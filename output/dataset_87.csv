   JUDGMENT 
    
   
   
  HIS HONOUR:  
   
   
   
  1.  
  On 24 November 1998, in a reserved judgment, I found the defendant not guilty of two charges of clearing native vegetation without consent as required by  
  State Environmental Planning Policy No 46 - Protection and Management of Native Vegetation 
  , contrary to s 76(2) of the  
  Environmental Planning & Assessment Act 
   1979 and constituting an offence under s 125 of that Act. I made a formal order that the summonses in both proceedings be dismissed. Although the judgment was delivered on 24 November 1998 the order was not entered and sealed until 26 November 1998.  
   
   
  2.  
  The defendant now seeks an order that the prosecutor pay his costs. The defendant seeks in the alternative an order under Pt 10 r 7 of the  
  Land & Environment Court Rules 
   1996 that the orders made on 24 November 1998 be amended by adding the following order: 
   
   
  “Prosecutor to pay costs of the defendant.” 
   
   
  3.  
  The reserved judgment in this case was delivered at 9.30 am on 24 November 1998. It was not until later that day, however, that Mr P F T McGirr, solicitor for the defendant, raised the issue of costs. As outlined in the affidavit of Mr McGirr dated 10 November 1998, he spoke to my Associate on 24 November 1998 explaining that he had not read the judgment when it was handed down and requested that the matter be listed as soon as possible in order that the defendant might ask for costs. Mr McGirr subsequently spoke to the solicitor for the prosecutor on 24 and 25 November 1998 informing them that the defendant was seeking costs. It was not until 26 November 1998 that the order dismissing the summonses was sealed and entered. 
   
   
  4.  
  Mr M H Baird, who appears for the prosecutor, submits that the Court does not have the power to make any order for costs. There is now a perfected order of the Court dismissing the summonses. The summonses having been dismissed, the process must be regarded as complete.  
   
   
  5.  
  Mr Baird further submits that the sole power under which this Court may make an order for costs in its summary jurisdiction is under s 52 of the  
  Land & Environment Court Act 
   1979, which is a specific provision relating to costs in such cases and which circumscribes the general power to make orders for costs found in s 69 of the Act. 
   
   
  6.  
  Section 52(1) of the  
  Land & Environment Court Act 
   provides: 
   
   
  “52(1) Where a Judge - 
   
   
  (a) convicts any person of an offence punishable in the summary jurisdiction of the Court; 
   
   
  (b) makes an order dismissing the charge for any such offence; or 
   
   
  (c) makes an order under section 556A(1) of the  
  Crimes Act 
   1900, in respect of any such offence, 
   
   
  the Judge may, in and by the conviction or order, order the defendant, in the case of a conviction or order referred to in paragraph (a) or (c), to pay to the prosecutor, or, in the case of an order referred to in paragraph (b), order the prosecutor to pay to the defendant, costs of such amount as are specified in the conviction or order or, if the conviction or order so directs, as may be determined under subsection (2). 
   
   
   
  7.  
  Mr Baird submits that since s 52 requires that any order for costs must be made in the conviction or order (as the case may be) and since no order for costs was made in the order dismissing the summonses, the Court is now unable to consider the question of costs. Mr Baird relies upon  
  Fosse v Director of Public Prosecutions 
   (1989) 16 NSWLR 540, in which Smart J held, in relation to the equivalent section in the  
  Justices Act 
   1902 (s 41A) that a magistrate does not have jurisdiction to make any order for costs unless a defendant makes application for an order for costs immediately upon the magistrate discharging the defendant: whenever an order for costs is made it must form part of the process of discharging the defendant.  
   
   
  8. 
    
  Mr Baird further submits that the Court has no jurisdiction to make the alternative order sought by the defendant under the  
  Land & Environment Court Rules 
  , Pt 10 r 7 (the so-called “slip rule”). Neither, according to Mr Baird, does the Court have jurisdiction to set aside or vary the order under Pt 15 r 9 of the Court’s rules. Mr Baird appears to accept that these rules may afford a power to set aside or vary an order and are thus exceptions to the common law rule that once a judgment of the Court has been passed and entered, the Court thereafter lacks power to make an order which alters or sets aside that judgment. As I understand Mr Baird’s submission, however, such rules cannot override the specific provision in s 52 of the Act as to when and how costs are to be determined and paid. The cases in which the slip rule, for example, have been applied are not cases where a provision such as s 52 of the  
  Land & Environment Court Act 
   otherwise governs the making of such orders.  
   
   
  9.  
  Mr P S Hastings QC, who appears for the defendant, accepts that the common law rule is that once a judgment of the Court has been passed and entered, the Court thereafter lacks power to make an order which alters or sets aside that judgment. The general rule, however, admits to certain exceptions. One such exception at common law is the “slip rule” ( 
  Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v White Industries (Qld) Pty  
  (1993) 
    
   117 ALR 253 at 263-264, Full Court of Federal Court;  
  L Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council (No 2) 
   (1982) 151 CLR 590 at 594). 
   
   
  10.  
  Mr Hastings also relies upon  
  Fosse v Director of Public Prosecutions 
   (at 546-547) for a submission that the proceedings are not completed and must be regarded as still on foot for consequential purposes if there is an outstanding application for costs. In the present case, in view of the facts described by Mr McGirr and noted in paragraph 3 above, the application for costs was foreshadowed before the orders were sealed and entered, so that the proceedings are not yet completed.  
   
   
  11.  
  Alternatively Mr Hastings relies upon Pt 15 r 9 of the Court’s rules. That rule enables the Court to set aside or vary an order if ( 
  inter alia 
  ) the party in whose favour the order was made consents. The order dismissing the summonses is an order in favour of the defendant. Mr Baird, on the other hand, submits that the order benefits the prosecutor because, having been made, it prevents the making of an order for costs against the prosecutor under s 52 of the Act.  
   
   
  12.  
  Finally, Mr Hastings submits that an alternative power exists under the  
  Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
   1967. Such power may be exercised after the defendant is acquitted or discharged (s 2). The  
  Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
   is not circumscribed by s 52 of the  
  Land & Environment Court Act 
   because the form of relief is different (being a certificate as opposed to an order) and an order under s 52 is directed to a party whereas a certificate under the  
  Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
   is directed to the Director-General of the Attorney-General’s Department. 
   
   
  13.  
  Part 10 r 7(1) of the Court’s rules (the “slip rule”) is as follows: 
   
   
  “7(1) If there is a clerical mistake, or an accidental error or omission, in a judgment or order, or in a certificate, the Court, on the application of any party or without any such application, may, at any time, correct the mistake or error.” 
   
   
   
  14.  
  Part 10 r 7(1) of the Court’s Rules is in the traditional form of a slip rule (see, for example, the  
  Supreme Court Rules 
   Pt 20 r 10; the  
  High Court Rules 
   Order 29 r 11). In  
  L Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council 
  , Mason ACJ, Wilson and Deane JJ said (at 594-595): 
   
   
  “Order 29, r 11 is in the traditional form of a slip rule. It reflects the inherent jurisdiction of a court ‘at any time to correct an error in a decree or order arising from a slip or accidental omission’ (see  
  Milson v Carter 
   (1893) AC 628 at p 640). In terms, the rule provides, inter alia, that ‘an error arising in a judgment or order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court or a Justice on motion or summons’. The rule extends to authorize an omission resulting from the inadvertence of a party’s legal representative (see  
  Fritz v Hobson 
   (1880) 14 ChD 542 at pp 561-562;  
  Chessum & Sons v Gordon 
   [1901] 1 KB 694 at 698;  
  In re Inchcape (Earl) 
   [1942] Ch 394, at pp 397-398;  
  Coppins v Helmers & Brambles Constructions Pty Ltd 
   [1069] 2 NSWR 279, at pp 281-282;  
   Tak Ming Co Ltd v Yee Sang Metal Supplies Co 
   [1973] 1 WLR 300, at p 304; [1973] 1 All ER 569, at p 571). This is so, regardless of whether the order has been drawn up, passed and entered (see  
  Milson v Carter 
   [1893] AC at p 640;  
  Fritz v Hobson 
   (1880) 14 ChD, at p 560). 
   
   
   
  15.  
  In  
  Shaddock  
   the High Court held that the slip rule was available to correct the inadvertence of counsel who had previously forgotten to apply for an order for interest before perfection of the order. 
   
   
  16.  
  In  
  Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Tectran Corporation Pty Ltd 
   (1988) 62 ALJR 151, 77 ALR 190, the Court granted an application to amend an earlier order, dismissing a summons, by adding an order that the applicants on the summons pay the costs of the respondents to that summons. It appeared that costs had not been sought at the time of dismissal of the summons because of the inadvertence of counsel. Toohey J said (at 152), after referring to  
  Shaddock 
  : 
   
   
  “In many cases the slip rule or its equivalent is invoked when, through error or oversight, a judgment or order fails to express correctly the intention of the court at the time when the judgment or order was announced. But it is clear that this power of correction extends to cases where a matter, through inadvertence, was not dealt with at the hearing. In that case the purpose of correction is not to give expression to the intention of the court at the time the judgment or order was pronounced:  
  Coppins v Helmers & Brambles Constructions Pty Ltd 
   [1969] 2 NSWR 279. That is the situation which has arisen here. None of the cases so far mentioned was concerned with a failure to ask for the costs of a successful proceeding. However  
  In re Inchcape (Earl of) 
   [1942] Ch 394 was such a case and Morton J held that a rule comparable to O29, r 11 empowered the court to amend an order to include provision for costs which had not bee asked for earlier. So too was  
  Rowe v Delfs 
   [1966] WAR 49 where Hale J varied an earlier order by including a certificate for the cost of transcript which counsel had omitted to ask for. 
   
   
  I am satisfied then that the Court is empowered to grant the relief which the respondents seek. I am also satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order amending the order made on 6 November 1987 by including provision that the applicants pay the respondents’ costs of that summons. In the ordinary course a successful party is entitled to costs:  
  Ritter v Godfrey 
   [1920] 2 KB 47 at 52-53, 60-61. There are no considerations prevailing that would warrant departing from the established rule.” 
   
   
   
  17.  
  There is no doubt that s 52 of the  
  Land & Environment Court Act 
   is a specific provision relating to the making of orders for costs in the summary criminal jurisdiction of the Court. It thus circumscribes the general power to make orders for costs in s 69 of the Act. It requires the making of any order for costs in and by the conviction of a person of an offence, or in and by the making of an order dismissing the charge for any offence, or in and by the making of an order under s 556A of the  
  Crimes Act 
   1900 in respect of any offence ( 
  Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Maritime Services Board of New South Wales 
   (1995) 87 LGERA 188 at 200;  
  Environment Protection Authority v Alkem Drums Pty Ltd 
   (1996) 93 LGERA 83;  
  Environment Protection Authority v Associated Dairies Pty Ltd,  
  Bignold J, 15 June 1998, unreported).  
   
   
  18.  
  There is nothing in s 52, however, which suggests that any order made under sub-s (1) is not subject to the common law rule known as the “slip rule”, of which Pt 10 r 7 of the  
  Land & Environment Court Rules 
   is an example. As noted by the Full Court of the Federal Court in  
  Caboolture Park Shopping Centre 
   (at 263) and by the High Court in  
  Shaddock 
   (at 594-595) the rule is a rule of the common law. Moreover, as was said by Mason ACJ, Wilson and Deane JJ in  
  Shaddock 
   (at 594) and by Toohey J in  
  Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Tectran Corporation Pty Ltd 
   (at 152) the rule extends to authorise an omission resulting from the inadvertence of a party’s legal representative. As further noted by Mason ACJ, Wilson and Deane JJ in  
  Shaddock 
   (at 595), the rule is available regardless of whether the order has been drawn up, passed and entered. 
   
   
  19.  
  I am, of course, bound by the two judgments of the High Court to which I have referred. I therefore hold that orders made in the summary criminal jurisdiction of this Court are subject to the slip rule. In particular, the slip rule extends to the power of the Court to make orders for costs under s 52 of the  
  Land & Environment Court Act 
  .  
   
   
  20.  
  In the present case it is clear from the evidence of Mr McGirr that the failure of the defendant to seek an order for costs when the reserved judgment was delivered was solely the result of his inadvertence. It is also clear from Mr McGirr’s evidence that he foreshadowed the seeking of an order for costs both to the prosecutor’s solicitor and to the Court before the Court’s orders were sealed and entered. The facts thus fall squarely within the parameters for the implementation of the rule as explained in  
  Shaddock 
   and in  
  Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Tectran Corporation Pty Ltd 
  . These facts are sufficient to distinguish the present case from  
  Fosse v Director of Public Prosecutions 
  . If the defendant is otherwise entitled to an order for costs then, in my view, the slip rule enables such an order to be now made.  
   
   
  21.  
  There is, apart from the slip rule, the alternative power in the Court to set aside or vary a perfected order, namely the power under Pt 15 r 9 of the Court’s Rules. That rule relevantly provides: 
   
   
  “9. The Court, may, on terms, set aside or vary an order in any of the following cases - 
   
   
  (a) if the order has been made in the absence of a party, whether or not the absent party is in default of appearance of otherwise in default, and whether or not the absent party had notice of the motion for the order; 
   
   
  (b) if notice of motion for the setting aside or variation is filed before the signing and filing of the minute of the order under rule 4; 
   
   
  (c) if the order was obtained by fraud; 
   
   
  (d) if the order is interlocutory; 
   
   
  (e) if the order does not reflect the intention of the Court; 
   
   
  (f) if the party in whose favour the order was made consents.” 
   
   
   
  22.  
  In the present case the party in whose favour the order was made, namely the defendant, consents to the order being varied so as to include an order for costs. Mr Baird submits that the prosecutor, not the defendant, is the person in whose favour the order was made: the order benefits the prosecutor because it prevents the making of an order for costs under s 52. I do not agree with Mr Baird’s submission. The defendant was charged with two serious criminal offences. The prosecutor was seeking convictions. The prosecutor was unsuccessful. The order that was made was an order dismissing the summonses. The order was thus clearly one which was in favour of the defendant. As in the case of the slip rule, if the defendant is otherwise entitled to an order for costs, I would be prepared to invoke this rule for the purpose of making such an order. I do not have to do so, however, because the slip rule alone is a sufficient basis upon which to make any order for costs to which the defendant may be entitled.  
   
   
  23.  
  If I am wrong in holding that either or both of the abovementioned rules enables the Court to make an order for costs as now sought by the defendant, then I would be prepared to exercise the Court’s powers under the  
  Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
   1967. That Act enables the Court or Judge, in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, to grant to a defendant a certificate under that Act where the defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged (s 2). Again, however, I do not have to resort to that Act since the slip rule is alone a sufficient basis upon which to make an order for costs in the present case. 
   
   
  24.  
  Having found that there is jurisdiction to make an order for costs it is necessary to turn to the merits of the application for costs. The relevant principles which govern the making of orders for costs in criminal proceedings are explained in  
  Latoudis v Casey 
   (1990) 170 CLR 534.  
   
   
  25.  
  In  
  Latoudis 
   Mason CJ states (at 542): 
   
   
  “In ordinary circumstances it would not be just or reasonable to deprive a defendant who has secured the dismissal of a criminal charge brought against him or her of an order for costs … It is inequitable that the defendant should be expected to bear the financial burden of exculpating himself or herself, though the circumstances of a particular case may be such as to make it just and reasonable to refuse an order for costs or to make a qualified order for costs.” 
   
   
   
  26.  
  Mason CJ further states (at 544): 
   
   
  “I am persuaded that, in ordinary circumstances, an order for costs should be made in favour of a successful defendant. However, there will be cases in which, when regard is had to the particular circumstances, it would not be just and reasonable to order costs against the prosecutor or to order payment of all the defendant’s costs. If, for example, the defendant, by his or her conduct after the events constituting the commission of the alleged defence, brought the prosecution upon himself or herself, then it would not be just and reasonable to award costs against the prosecutor.” 
   
   
   
  27.  
  In the same case, Toohey J states (at 565): 
   
   
  “If a prosecution has failed, it would ordinarily be just and reasonable to award the defendant costs, because the defendant has incurred expense, perhaps very considerable expense, in defending the charge.” 
   
   
   
  28.  
  Toohey J refers to a situation where it may be just and reasonable to refuse costs. He states (at 565): 
   
   
  “If a defendant has been given the opportunity of explaining his or her version of the events before a charge is laid and refuses the opportunity, and it later appears that an explanation could have avoided a prosecution, it may well be just and reasonable to refuse costs.” 
   
   
   
  29.  
  Toohey J further states (at 565): 
   
   
  “This has nothing to do with the right to silence in criminal matters. A defendant or prospective defendant is entitled to refuse an explanation to the police. But if an explanation is refused, the successful defendant can hardly complain if the court refuses an award for costs, when an explanation might have avoided the prosecution.” 
   
   
   
  30.  
  McHugh J states (at 569): 
   
   
  “The fact that the informant has acted in good faith in the public interest or may have to meet the costs out of his or her own pocket is not a ground for depriving the defendant of his or her costs. Speaking generally, before a court deprives a successful defendant in summary proceedings of his or her costs, it will be necessary for the informant to establish that the defendant unreasonably induced the informant to think that a charge could be successfully brought against the defendant or that the conduct of the defendant occasioned unnecessary expense in the institution or conduct of the proceedings.” 
   
   
   
  31.  
  Mr Baird, on behalf of the prosecutor, submits that the defendant in this case withheld relevant information which, he submits, had it been divulged was material information which would have determined whether there was to be a prosecution. Mr Baird further submits that because the defendant did not answer a questionnaire which the prosecutor sent him, the defendant falls within the exception in  
  Latoudis 
   and should not be awarded costs. 
   
   
  32.  
  The defendant was not, however, under any obligation to answer the questionnaire sent to him by the prosecutor. A defendant has a right to silence, especially in criminal a proceeding. Not withstanding this, in a letter dated 15 September 1997 the defendant’s solicitor responded in a general way to the questionnaire sent to him by the prosecutor. Mr McGirr stated: 
   
   
   
  “We refer to a questionnaire which you furnished to our client. Rather than answer in a detailed fashion, we are instructed that there are being carried out farming works … on an area that was cleared before August 1995 being prior to SEPP 46 being introduced and that  
  the regrowth was less than ten years of age 
  . Our client understands that the land was grassland and that there existed the right to continue developing country on which the regrowth was under ten years of age and upon which work had been commenced and nearly completed prior to the introduction of SEPP 46.” (The emphasis is mine.) 
   
   
   
  33.  
  It is apparent from this letter that the defendant did inform the prosecutor that the land cleared was regrowth of less than ten years of age and as such the defendant falls within an exception under cl 11 of the State Policy, as I found. 
   
   
  34.  
  Accordingly, I reject the prosecutor’s submission that the defendant withheld relevant information from the prosecutor. Although the defendant did not respond to the detailed questionnaire, he did provide an explanation of the clearing to the prosecutor. 
   
   
  35.  
  In these circumstances there is no reason why the successful defendant should not be awarded his costs. The general principle that costs follow the event should be applied in this case. There was nothing in this case which indicates that the defendant falls within the exception to that general principle, described in  
  Latoudis 
  . I am therefore of the opinion that the prosecutor must pay the defendant’s costs. 
   
   
   
  I certify that this and the preceding 14 pages are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the Honourable Mr Justice Lloyd.

      REGINA v. JOHN EDWARD HEARD 
      
      
    1   SIMPSON J: I agree with the order proposed by Acting Justice Smart and with his reasons therefor.  
    2   SMART AJ:  John Edward Heard seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence, comprising a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 4 years for supplying not less than the commercial quantity of amphetamine, a prohibited drug. The applicant complained that the head sentence and consequently the minimum term were excessive. He made no complaint abut the minimum term being about 43% of the total sentence, and submitted that such a ratio should be maintained in any lesser sentence and submitted that such a ratio should be maintained in any lesser sentence imposed by this Court. The applicant also contended that having regard to his criminality, he had been punished proportionately more severely than his co-offenders. 
    3   About 9.59 am. on Saturday 9 August 1997 the applicant’s vehicle was observed in the driveway of 4 Gilford Street, Kariong, the home of Dennis Watkins, a wholesale supplier of prohibited drugs. A short time later, the applicant left that home carrying a package with a white dress wrapped around it. The applicant placed it on the back seat of his vehicle which police followed. About 11.05 am. Mr. Heard drove his vehicle along Bondi Street, The Entrance, towards his home. He was stopped by some police officers and searched. When questioned by the police, he told them that there was a pound of ‘speed’ on the back seat. Police took possession of that drug. The gross weight was 456 grams. In the glove box there was a resealable plastic bag containing a further 4 resealable plastic bags each of which contained a powder substance. The applicant said that this was ‘speed’. Its gross weight was 127 grams. The combined gross weight of the drugs was 583 grams with an estimated street value of $58,300. The purity of the drug did not exceed 6.9%. The remaining 93.1% of the substance is deemed to be amphetamine as a result of s.4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Nevertheless there was twice the commercial quantity of amphetamines. The offence carries a maximum prison penalty of 20 years. 
    4   The applicant has a lengthy criminal record which began in 1962, with a minor offence and since 1969 there have been many offences over the years up to 1991. He has been fined, placed on recognisance and imprisoned. In all there are 24 entries on his record and many of these contain several offences. The most serious offence was robbery with striking in 1979, when he was sentenced to 6 years hard labour with a non parole period of 2 ½ years. His record contains many dishonesty offences, assaults and traffic offence; while there were no previous drug offences, his record does not entitle him to any leniency. 
    5   The applicant stated that he had to move house from Clovelly to the Central Coast, that he was receiving only a disability pension, that he was short of money and so involved himself in supplying drugs to extricate himself from those problems. His sister described him as being in a financially desperate position. 
    6   The applicant was born on 8 February, 1941. His health is not good. He suffers from osteo-arthritis and his sister said that he was in excruciating pain most of the time. Sometimes he has great difficulty in walking. Dr. Lou Lewis in his report of 26 November 1997 has written: 
     
      
       
       “I have known John Heard for over 10 yrs … In the past few years has had his right hip replaced, his left knee replaced, and within the next 12 months he will need to have a left hip replacement. His body is literally riddled with severe disabling osteo-arthritis.” 
       
      
    7   The applicant’s relatives and friends have stated that he was very ashamed of what he had done. They are trying to arrange some part time employment for him which he can manage. It was apparent that he had quite an amount of support. 
    8   The judge, while noting that the applicant had declined to answer any questions by the police, and thereby disclose any details of his drug suppliers, said that the applicant co-operated and was remorseful. 
    9   The judge accepted evidence that over the years he had been a good citizen in other respects and very close to the members of his family. While he has struggled in life he has also been prepared to help others. The judge accepted that the applicant had contributed considerably by way of charitable work to a number of charities. Considerable sums were raised due in no small part to his efforts. 
    10   Correctly, the judge was much influenced by the objective gravity of the offence, observing: 
     
      
       
       “Without suppliers we would not have the rampant problems in the community associated with the use and abuse of drugs. Basically, Mr Heard’s only excuse for being involved in this matter is that he was short of money and he used this opportunity to get himself out of his financial problems. There is hardly much consideration to be given for a person in that situation.” 
       
      
    11   The judge found that the applicant’s age and health, and the high level of hardship he would suffer in gaol, along with the resultant need for an extended period of rehabilitation, constituted special circumstances. I agree. 
    12   The applicant pointed out that the judge had fixed a head sentence which was just over one third of the maximum penalty. The applicant submitted that this was excessive on a consideration of the objective facts alone. It was even more demonstrably excessive when the subjective features were taken into account. It was submitted that proper allowance had not been made for the age and health of the applicant in either the head sentence or the minimum term. 
    13   The applicant contended that he was detected and caught as a result of material obtained through telephone interceptions which formed part of a concerted police operation known as “Operation Gymea”, which was focussed on Leslie Kalache and his associates. The applicant contended that he received a sterner sentence than others involved in the operation, and that the sentence lacked parity. There was an authorised telephone intercept of the telephone service of Dennis and Tracie Watkins. Immediately after Mr Heard was arrested his de facto wife, at 11.27 am, telephoned Mr D Watkins and advised him that the applicant had been arrested. 
    14   At 1.05 pm Mr D Watkins again spoke with the applicant’s de facto wife on the telephone. Mr Watkins told her that he would contact Mr Leslie Kalache, the principal of the drug organisation, to see if one of his friends could do anything. Mr Watkins immediately telephoned Mr Kalache and informed him of the arrest of John Heard. Twenty minutes later Kalache telephoned Watkins and they surmised that the incident may have been a “set up”. About 6.50 pm that day the applicant and Mr D Watkins spoke on the telephone and theorised as to how he came to be arrested. 
    15   There was material pointing to Watkins and the applicant having an association previously. The materials did not indicate the length of that association. Watkins, his wife and Kalache had a close association. 
    16   To gain some understanding of the Kalache operation it is necessary to refer to the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Kalache,  4 February 2000 unreported. Kalache was the leader of an organised network involved in the manufacture and distribution of prohibited drugs run from his Clovelly unit. Kalache dealt primarily with methylamphetamine. From December 1995 he was involved with others in financing an operation to manufacture this drug through the purchase of equipment and chemicals (on the blackmarket). A drug laboratory was established at Wollombi, and commercial quantities of the drug were manufactured there. A site in Booral was purchased in June 1997 and a laboratory was established there. There was a mass purchase of Sudafed tablets by a number of people. Around 3.5 kilograms of methylamphetamine was manufactured there and distributed. Profits of $350,000 were mentioned. In mid August 1997 the manufacture of a further 3.5 kilograms was begun. 
    17   Between 20 May 1997 and 30 September 1997 from 5 to 20 persons were involved in trafficking the prohibited drugs supplied by Kalache. During this period in excess of 20 kilograms of methylamphetamine was supplied by Kalache for distribution.  
    18   Kalache supplied cocaine in excess of 5 kilograms during the period mentioned. He also supplied ecstasy tablets estimated to number 4000. Cannabis leaf was supplied on a regular basis in substantial quantities. 
    19   Kalache advised his associates on ways in which they could on-sell the various drugs, on suitable prices, and potential profits. The police arrested about 50 other persons who were connected with Kalache’s activities. 
    20   Judge GD Woods QC sentenced some 16 offenders, including Kalache. Kalache effectively received a minimum term of 7 ½ years and an additional term of 2 ½ years. On appeal this was increased to a minimum term of 22 years and an additional term of 3 years. Judge Woods sentenced Kalache on 6 May 1999 some 13 ½ months after Judge Viney sentenced Mr Heard. 
    21   Some of the sixteen offenders were involved in the manufacture of prohibited drugs, and some appeared to be large scale distributors and wholesalers. Mr and Mrs Watkins appeared to be in the latter category. Apart from the Crown appeal against Kalache there were appeals by seven offenders on the ground that the sentence imposed was too severe. In two instances the appeal was dismissed. In a third instance leave to appeal was refused. The other appeals have not been determined. In another three cases there have been Crown appeals alleging the sentence was inadequate. One of the Crown appeals has been dismissed. The others are to be determined in May 2000. A schedule containing the names of thirty-one offenders and their sentences was produced. It was headed “Operation Gymea - Sentencing”. 
    22   The applicant relied particularly upon the sentences imposed upon Bonney, Moretti and Yates. For the three offences of manufacturing methylamphetamine (large commercial quantity), supply methylamphetamine (commercial quantity), and supply ecstasy (commercial quantity) Bonney received an effective minimum term of 2 years 9 months and an additional term of 2 years 3 months. Bonney was Kalache’s chief lieutenant, working for Kalache at Kalache’s unit. Bonney had a medical condition making it difficult to serve the sentence. We were not told of any Crown appeal. Bonney has an extensive record, and had spent extensive periods in gaol. His record included serious crimes. There was a break from 1990 to 1997 when he was not charged with any offences. Bonney does not appear to have had any connection with offences in the Gosford district. 
    23   For the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine Moretti was sentenced to a minimum term of twelve months and an additional term of twelve months. He attended Kalache’s unit at Clovelly on several occasions. He purchased methylamphetamine from Kalache and sold it to a number of his customers over a period of months. The special circumstances were the need for rehabilitation. This court was not told of any Crown appeal. Moretti had no previous convictions. 
    24   For supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine Yates received a minimum term of 2 years and an additional term of 8 months. His appeal against the severity of that sentence has been dismissed. Yates attended Kalache’s unit on numerous occasions and received supplies of methylamphetamine, and had many discussions with Kalache. Yates received advice as to how he should conduct his operation. He engaged in repeated supplies of the drug over some months. Yates had a relatively minor record. 
    25   Reference should also be made to the case of Dennis Watkins, Mr Heard’s supplier. Watkins was sentenced for manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy, supplying cannabis, and supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. Watkins received a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two and a half years. Watkins had a lengthy criminal record stretching back to 1956. He has spent periods in gaol. 
    26   The taped telephone conversations reveal that Kalache was worried about what had happened to Heard. Kalache remarked that while The Entrance was “out of our bounds”, he would see what he could do. Kalache had corrupted two police Detective Sergeants of Police. He was able to get information and assistance. 
    27   The applicant complained that he had been penalised for pleading guilty at an early stage. Many of those in the Kalache group were arrested between the middle of August 1997 and the end of September 1997, but they did not plead guilty at such an early stage. 
    28   The applicant was not close to the centre of the Kalache operation. However, Heard was known to Kalache, who was advised very shortly after Heard was arrested, and was anxious about that. Mr Heard led back to Watkins, who was closely linked to Kalache. 
    29   The quantities being handled by Mr Heard indicate that he was quite an important distributor or retailer of Kalache’s prohibited drugs. The sentence imposed on Watkins, who was closely associated with Mr Heard, is out of balance with that imposed on Mr Heard. Watkins received a lesser overall sentence (five and a half years as against seven years) and the same minimum term. Watkins’ criminality is much greater. Considerations of parity compel intervention. There is no ideal or even a good conclusion. The sentences imposed by Judge Woods were excessively lenient. Nevertheless, Mr Heard has a legitimate sense of grievance. Comparatively, he has received a sterner sentence. 
    30   I propose the following orders: 
     
      
     (a) Leave to appeal granted. 
      
      
     (b) Appeal allowed; sentence quashed. 
      
      
     (c) In lieu of the sentence imposed, the applicant is sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of two years two months starting on 20 March 1998 and ending on 19 May 2000, and an additional term of two years ten months starting on 20 May 2000.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONO’KEEFE JDATE: 7 April 2000No: 12693/99 - SHANNAN LEE COLEMAN v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONSJUDGMENT 
    HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
    INTRODUCTION 
     
      
    1    On 18 October, 1999 the plaintiff, Shannan Lee Coleman, was convicted in the Local Court at the Downing Centre, Sydney of soliciting another person for the purposes of prostitution contrary to the provisions of S.19(1) of the Summary Offences Act, 1988. From that conviction, the plaintiff has appealed in accordance with S.104(1)(a) of the Justices Act, 1902 on the ground that the magistrate erred in law in his interpretation of the word “solicit” and its application to the facts of the case. 
     
      
    2    There had been a number of complaints concerning persons plying their trade as prostitutes within sight of a school situated in Forbes Street, Darlinghurst. As a consequence, the New South Wales Police Service assigned undercover police officers in plain clothes and using unmarked cars to the area. Constable Mourlas was one such officer. On the night of 24 June, 1999, Constable Mourlas drove to Forbes Street, Darlinghurst within view of the SCEGGS boarding school in an unmarked police vehicle. Seeing the plaintiff on the footpath, he drew his vehicle to the kerb some three metres further down the street from her. Thereupon, the plaintiff walked down the street to the car, approached the open passenger window, lent on the door and asked the constable “Do you want to have some fun?” The response from the constable being in the affirmative, the plaintiff opened the passenger door, got into the vehicle, sat beside the officer and quoted him prices at which she would engage with him in various sexual acts up to full intercourse. She also told him where this could take place and the maximum time allowed for the prices quoted. Constable Mourlas then drove not to the place the plaintiff had nominated, but to a place where his sergeant was. There the plaintiff was arrested and later charged at Kings Cross Police Station. 
     
      
    3    The plaintiff did not dispute that she was in Forbes Street. Whilst she did not formally concede that the place where she was in that street was within view of SCEGGS boarding school, it was not contested that it was and that fact was found adversely to the plaintiff by the magistrate. Although there was some dispute in cross-examination as to the colour of certain of the garments that she was wearing, the plaintiff did not give any evidence to negate the evidence given by the police officer and it is clear from the photograph tendered and other evidence that the top portion of the clothing she was wearing under a cardigan was of light, virtually see-through material and exposed a good deal of the upper part of her body, including the breast area. Before the magistrate and before the court, she said that her defence “hinged on the interpretation of ‘solicit’ ”. Her actions and the conversations in which she engaged did not, so she argued, amount to soliciting. 
     
      
    4    The plaintiff’s case was that soliciting involves persistence, pestering, pressure, importuning and the like. Further, that as there was “only a simple request” on her part, her actions did not amount to soliciting, indeed, she submitted that for there to be soliciting there must be actions that give rise to a problem of public order and that what she did, did not respond to these descriptions and hence did not constitute soliciting.  
     
      
    5    Section 19 of the Summary Offences Act 1988 provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(1) A person in a road or road related area shall not, near or within view from a dwelling, school, church or hospital, solicit another person for the purpose of prostitution.  
         
         Maximum penalty: 6 penalty units or imprisonment for three months. 
         
         (2) A person shall not, in a school, church or hospital solicit another person for the purpose of prostitution.  
         
         Maximum penalty: 6 penalty units or imprisonment for three months. 
         
         (3) A person shall not, in or near, or within view from a dwelling, school, church, hospital or public place, solicit another person, for the purpose of prostitution, in a manner that harasses or distresses the other person. 
         
         Maximum penalty: 8 penalty units or imprisonment for three months. 
         
         (4) The provisions of this section are in addition to and do not derogate from, any other law (including s.4).” 
        
       
      
    6    The matter for determination is the meaning of solicit as used in S.19(1) of the Summary Offences Act. In order to determine this it is appropriate to look at the dictionary meanings and derivation of the word , the legislative history of the provision, the form and structure of S.19 as a whole, and a number of decided cases concerning the meaning given to the word when used in statutes in pari materia. 
     
      
    SOLICIT - DICTIONARY MEANING - DERIVATION 
     
      
    7    In seeking enlightenment as to the meaning of a provision by reference to its legislative history, I am conscious of the dictum of Mason J in Beckwith v R (1976) 12 ALR 333 that : 
     
      
       
        
        “Resort to the history of a statute all too rarely illuminates the meaning of the current provisions” (at 340). 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    8    However the legislative history of S.19(1) of the Act may be of some assistance in the interpretation of the section in the present Act.  
     
      
    9    Prima facie an ordinary English word in a statute is to be given its appropriate ordinary English meaning. The word solicit has a number of possible meanings, depending on the context. The plaintiff, who argued the matter in person with skill , determination and persistence, put before the Court a number of dictionary meanings of solicit. The first was the American Dictionary of the English Language. This dictionary is in a form somewhat different from that of Australian and English dictionaries. It does not include any specific reference to the meaning of solicit in the context of prostitution, but does indicate that the meaning of solicit is: 
     
      
       
        
        “to ask with some degree of earnestness; to make petition to; to apply to for obtaining something. This word implies earnestness in seeking, but I think less earnestness than beg, implore and importune, and more than ask or request.” 
        
       
      
    10    The plaintiff then referred to the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary which listed a number of meanings. One is “entreat, petition, urge (a person); ask earnestly or persistently”; another, related to prostitution, is “accost a person and offer oneself or another as a prostitute”. Her next reference was to Webster’s 9th New Collegiate Dictionary from which she referred to the word accost as meaning “to approach and speak to, often in a challenging or aggressive way” (Italics added). This was done because in the Oxford Pocket Dictionary (her next reference) , the word solicit is defined to include “accost as a prostitute”. It is to be noted that in this Webster’s Dictionary definition, the manner of the approach and speaking are only a frequent, nor a necessary, accompaniment. The necessary elements are approaching and speaking to. 
     
      
    11    No reference was made by the plaintiff to any of the following dictionary meanings:  
     
      
       
      (1) The Macquarie Dictionary (2nd Edition, 1991) gives solicit a particular meaning in relation to prostitution namely, “to accost (another) with immoral intention as a prostitute”. 
       
       
      (2) The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd Edition, 1989) gives two meanings appropriate in the context of prostitution: “Of women: to accost and importune (men) for immoral purposes”; “to tempt, entice, allure, to attract or draw by enticement”. One of the examples given in respect of the first mentioned meaning is a reference to a person who “persistently solicited in a public place.” This would suggest that, unless the authors of the Oxford English Dictionary used an oxymoron (which is unlikely for authors of such dictionary), the word solicit per se, i.e. when used alone, does not necessarily involve any sense of persistence. The same dictionary relevantly defines “importune” as “to solicit for purposes of prostitution”. Accosting in the sense of approaching and offering the services usual for a prostitute, is the primary or essential meaning in this dictionary, with a linked appropriate meaning which involves allurement, enticement and the like.  
       
       
      (3) In the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary (1986) solicit, when used as a verb, has as the relevant meaning “to invite or make appeals to or to importune”. 
       
       
      (4) In Collins Concise English Dictionary (Australian Edition, 1984), solicit is given the meaning “make a request, accost with an offer of sexual relations in return for money”.  
       
      (5) Chambers English Dictionary (1988) relevantly defines solicit as “to invite to immorality” and (“of prostitutes”) “the making of advances”.  
       
       
      (6) In Webster’s Third International Dictionary (1976) the meaning appropriate to the context of prostitution is “to accost (a man) for immoral purposes.” Accost is defined as “to approach and speak to.” 
       
      
    12    Soliciting is not restricted to prostitutes. A person may solicit a bribe. The word solicit is derived from the Latin verb “sollicitare”. When used in relation to bribes it bears the meaning “seek to obtain”: thus sollicitare iudicium donis (Ovid). There is no need for persistence or like behaviour. Furthermore, authority indicates that a mere request for a bribe is sufficient to constitute a solicitation. Putting one’s hand out in a particular way in appropriate circumstances can amount to soliciting i.e. seeking to obtain, a bribe. A person may solicit alms. This may be done by actually asking for money, or by sitting or standing on the pavement with a bowl , saucepan or equivalent receptacle and either holding it out to passers by or so placing it that there is an invitation to put money in it. This may or may not be accompanied by words. If words are used they may be no more than “Spare some change”? “Can you help me?”, or equivalents. Neither the acts nor the words need be persistent, repetitive or aggressive. Indeed, this is highlighted by the fact that in some American States where, to introduce an element of persistence or aggression into such begging offences, aggressive pan-handling is required - a reference to a saucepan being held by the handle and extended to the potential donor. 
     
      
    13    Having examined these various dictionary meanings, I am of opinion, that the ordinary dictionary meaning of solicit in the context of prostitution in this day and age involves a personal approach for the purpose of, or which is accompanied by, or which constitutes or conveys, an offer that some form of sexual activity will be engaged in by the person making the approach in return for monetary gain. The approach need not be aggressive persistent, pestering, or repeated nor is it necessary that it should constitute an annoyance to the person approached. 
     
      
    LEGISLATIVE HISTORY 
     
      
    14    The original equivalent legislative provision in New South Wales was in the Vagrancy Act, 1902, S.4:  
     
      
       
        
        “4(1) Whosoever - 
         
         ……  
         
        (i) being a known prostitute solicits or importunes for immoral purposes any person who is in any public street thoroughfare or place;” 
        
       
       
      commits an offence. 
       
      
    15    The inclusion of importunes in S.4(1)(i) of the Vagrancy Act, 1902 indicates that solicits in that section involves something different from and less than importunes. In my opinion, solicit in that section of that Act conveys no sense of persistence, pestering or pressure. 
     
      
    16    The Vagrancy Act, 1902 was repealed by the Summary Offences Act, 1970 (No.96 of 1970) and S. 4(1)(i) was replaced by s.28 of that Act, which was in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who - 
         
        (a) for the purposes of prostitution solicits another person who is in or near a public place; or 
         
        (b) for the purpose of prostitution loiters in, near or within view of a public place, 
         
        is guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
      
    17    The offence created by s.28(a) deals with an active approach by the prostitute; that created by s.28(b) deals with passivity, which may result in the customer making the approach. 
     
      
    18    After some intermediate changes in the law, the present day equivalent of S.4(1)(i) of the Vagrancy Act, 1902 was enacted as S.19 of the Summary Offences Act, 1988. 
     
      
    19    In his Second Reading speech on the Summary Offences Bill (1988) in the Legislative Assembly, the Attorney General indicated that the provisions then introduced were intended to restrict the places in which prostitutes could openly ply their trade and so protect members of the public. 
     
      
    20    From the forgoing it can be seen that there is nothing in its legislative history to suggest that in S.19 of the Summary Offences Act, 1988 the word solicit is used with a meaning different from its ordinary dictionary meaning as determined above. Indeed, the legislative history tends to support such a meaning. 
     
      
    THE FORM OF THE STATUTE 
     
      
    21    Sections 19(1) and (2) appear to be directed at protecting schools, churches and hospitals from the problems associated with prostitutes disporting themselves in the street within view of such places and approaching people for the purposes of their trade. The fact that S.19 uses the word solicit rather than the rubric that had been used in the Vagrancy Act, 1902 namely, “solicits or importunes”, in my opinion suggests that, whilst soliciting may include importuning, it is not necessary that there be any importuning in order to constitute soliciting under the new section. This conclusion is reinforced by the form of s.19(3).  
     
      
    22    The offence created by s.19(3) carries a heavier penalty than the offence created by S.19(1). But, additional elements need to be proved in order to establish an offence under S.19(3). Soliciting is still necessary but it must be soliciting which is carried out in a manner that harasses or distresses the person solicited. The addition of the requirement that there be harassment of or distress to the person solicited would be unnecessary if soliciting itself necessarily required an element of persistence, pestering, pressure, importuning, annoyance or the like. Such elements would undoubtedly evidence harassment. They may also give rise to distress in the person solicited in such a manner. 
     
      
    23    In my opinion s.19(3) is a clear indication of legislative intent that when used in s.19 the word solicit per se, does not require anything in the nature of persistence, pestering, pressuring, annoying, aggression, importuning or the like. 
     
      
    24    The form of the statute therefore, does not suggest that solicit, as used in s.19(1) has other than its ordinary dictionary meaning, as determined above. 
     
      
    PREVIOUS DECISIONS 
     
      
    25    The plaintiff has submitted that the court is constrained by authority to find that her actions did not constitute soliciting. It is therefore necessary to examine a number of the decided cases that deal with soliciting in the context of prostitution. 
     
      
    26    Physical presence is an element. The prostitute who solicits must be able to be seen by the potential customer (Weisz v Monahan (1962) WLR 262. In that case it was held that a prostitute who displays an advertisement in a public street indicating that she is available for any one who desires her services does not thereby solicit. Lord Parker CJ, with whom Ashworth and MacKenna JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am quite satisfied that soliciting … involves the physical presence of the prostitute and conduct on her part amounting to an importuning of prospective customers.” (at 263) 
        
       
      
    27    The facts of the case clearly indicate that importuning, in the sense used in the judgment, does not involve other than the prostitute in person making known that she is available to engage in sexual activity for money. The reference in the judgment to Smith v Hughes (1960) 1 WLR 830 demonstrates this. In that case the prostitutes’ method of soliciting was to stand on a balcony at first floor level, attract the attention of passing men by tapping on the balcony railing and then invite them to come inside the premises by such words as “would you like to come up here a little while”. This was held to constitute soliciting. Clearly there was no question of persistence or pestering or pressure or annoyance involved in that means of solicitation. The decisions in both these cases would comprehend the actions of the plaintiff in the present case as soliciting. 
     
      
    28    The decision in Behrendt v Burridge (1976) 1 WLR 29 is to a like effect. There the solicitation consisted of a female sitting in a bay window, provocatively or scantily dressed and illuminated by a red light. This was held to be “soliciting in the sense of tempting or luring prospective customers” (at 33). Persistence, pestering, pressure, annoyance, aggression or repetition were not necessary. Boreham J., with whom Lord Widgery CJ and Donaldson J agreed, said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… applying what I accept is a word of common usage to the facts that the Justices found in this case, there clearly was solicitation. Perhaps one may approach the matter thus. If one asked the question of the ordinary passer by ‘what is that young woman doing in that window, in that garb, in that light, in those circumstances?’ one ventures to suggest the clear answer would have been, though perhaps not in these precise words, ‘she is soliciting for prostitution’ .” 
        
       
      
    29    A like type of question asked in relation to the actions of the plaintiff at the relevant time on 24 June, 1999 in Forbes Street would, in my opinion, evoke a like answer. 
     
      
    30    In Newman v Paties (1979) Qd R 402 Lucas J, in considering what soliciting for the purpose of prostitution involved, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Moynihan has drawn our attention to the definition of “solicit” given in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, and to that I would add one of the definitions contained in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary which in the relevant sense defines it as“to accost and importune (men) for immoral purposes.” These definitions show that in order to constitute soliciting by a woman there must be an  
        active approach 
         from the woman who is charged with the offence.” (at 403; italics added). 
        
       
      
    31    Persistence, pressure, repetition or the like were not necessary elements under the law of soliciting in Queensland. Clearly the actions of the plaintiff in the present case would fall within the “active approach” referred to by Lucas J. 
     
      
    32    In Fingleton v Bryson (1980) 26 SASR 208 Jacobs J had to consider the meaning of solicit in s.25 of the Police Offences Act of South Australia. That section made it an offence if a person “accosts or solicits any person for the purpose of prostitution.” The prostitute in that case inserted an advertisement in a newspaper advertising her services. A police officer responded to the advertisement and arranged to meet in order to have sex with her. The arrangement involved the police officer meeting the prostitute outside an hotel. The meeting took place and price and other details were discussed a little later over a drink in the hotel bar. In holding that this did not amount to soliciting, Jacobs J referred with approval to Behrendt v Burridge (supra), and expressed the view that the word solicits as used in the South Australian legislation was influenced in its meaning by its association with the word “accosts”. He decided that in order for it to constitute soliciting “the conduct must amount to an invitation to other persons going about their business to avail themselves of the services of the prostitute”. (supra at 212). 
     
      
    33    Again, persistence, pestering, pressure, repetition or annoyance were not necessary elements of soliciting under the law of South Australia. 
     
      
    34    In Jitjarden v Thompson (1995) 38 NSWLR 611, Allen J considered s.16 of the Summary Offences Act 1988, which made it an offence for a person to use certain premises for the purposes of soliciting for prostitution. Allen J held that while soliciting may commonly convey an element of pestering or flaunting, it does not necessarily involve such an element. In that case an undercover police officer went into a massage parlour , was told the price of a massage, inquired what it included. The female he was addressing then asked him if he wanted to pay more and he indicated he did. Thereupon she asked him if he wanted “the full service”. He asked what that included and she responded that for a higher nominated price “you get sex”. When he asked if she provided the sex she said she did. Allen J held that : 
     
      
       
        
        “The offering of those services in those circumstances constituted soliciting for prostituting within the meaning of s.16” 
        
       
      
    35    Allen J. did not find that any element of persistence, pressure, pestering, repetition or annoyance was necessary for soliciting. In my opinion, this is correct.  
     
      
    36    Section 16 is in Part 3 of the Act as is Section 19. Part 3 is concerned with prostitution and Ss.16 and 19 are the only sections in Part 3 that use the words solicit or soliciting. It would be curious if words describing the same activity were to be used in different senses within the same part of the Act. Such an approach to the construction of the Act would be adopted only if required by the form of the Act itself (see for example S.60 I of the Limitation Act 1969; Walter v. State of New South Wales unreported 15 March, 2000). The form of Part 3 of the Summary Offences Act, 1988 does not suggest that there should be any difference in the meaning of solicit in the two sections; indeed to the contrary. 
     
      
    37    A more restrictive view of the meaning of solicit was taken by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Reg. v. Roland (1976) 27 CCC (2d) 435. In that case, the defendant sat at a table opposite the informant and winked at him. He thereupon went over and sat down with the defendant, who offered to have sexual intercourse with him for a nominated price. This was duly paid and the act of intercourse took place. In concluding that no offence had been committed, the Court held that it was necessary in order to commit the offence of soliciting that there be some importuning in the sense of persistence, besetting with petitions or pressure (supra at 487). However, the essence of the decision is that to wink does not evidence or constitute soliciting. It should be noted that in that case “to importune” was said to mean “to solicit pressingly or persistently”. Such a meaning itself implies that soliciting per se involves something less than importuning. This distinction, in my opinion, appears to have been accepted in S.4(1)(i) of the Vagrancy Act 1902.  
     
      
    38    In Hutt v. The Queen (1978) 82 DLR (3d) 95 the Supreme Court of Canada considered the meaning of the word solicit as used in the Canadian Criminal Code (S.195). In that case, the defendant smiled at a plain clothed police officer. He smiled in return. She entered his car and once in the car asked the officer if he wanted a girl and, when he indicated that he did, she nominated a price. The Supreme Court adopted the approach taken in Reg v. Roland (supra). Five Justices held that pressure or persistence was necessary in order to constitute soliciting under the Canadian legislation. Four justices held that pressure and  persistence were necessary. 
     
      
    39    The two Canadian decisions take a different view of the law from that taken in New South Wales, England, Queensland and South Australia. However, differences between the law of Australia and the law of Canada are not without precedent as was pointed out by McHugh J. in Perre v. Apand Pty. Ltd. (1999) 73 ALJR 1190 at 1209. The difference in the law of Australia and the law of Canada in relation to actions for negligence to recover pure economic loss: (Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. The Dredge Willemstad [1976] 136 CLR 529 in Australia; Canadian National Railway Co. v. North Pacific Steamship Co. (1992) l SCR 1021) is an example.  
     
      
    40    In any event, the Canadian cases referred to can be distinguished on a number of grounds. First, the legislation under consideration in those cases did not have an equivalent of S.19(3) of the Summary Offences Act, 1988. Second, the legislative history of the Canadian provisions is different from that of the current New South Wales provision. In addition, it should be recognised that the meaning of words may differ not only from time to time but also from place to place.  
     
      
    CONCLUSION 
     
      
    41    An examination of the ordinary dictionary meaning and derivation of the word solicit when used in the context of prostitution, the legislative history and form of s.19 of the Summary Offences Act 1988, and relevant decided cases leads to the conclusion that when used in s.19 of the Summary Offences Act 1988, solicit involves a personal approach, for the purpose of , or which is accompanied by, or which constitutes or conveys, an offer that some form of sexual activity will be engaged in by the person making the approach in return for monetary gain. 
     
      
    42    It is unnecessary, according to the ordinary meaning of the word solicit, when used in the context of prostitution, for there to be any element of aggressive persistence, pestering, pressure, or harassment or annoyance to the person approached . Nor is there a need for distress or embarrassment to be caused by or result from the approach or offer. If there are any of those elements present they may evidence a breach of s.19(3). The mere approach by a prostitute to a person who is a potential customer, when she is dressed in a suggestive manner, perhaps with appropriate gestures or words, or is presented in a particular way is sufficient to constitute an offer of services as a prostitute.  
     
      
    43    In my opinion, the actions of the plaintiff in Forbes Street on 24 June, 1999 qualify as soliciting. She was dressed in a manner which was designed to attract males. The front part of her upper body was clad in see-through type material, revealing much of her breasts. Her approach to Constable Mourlas’ vehicle was for the purpose of letting him know she was available for sexual activity. Her words as she lent on the car as she stood in the street clearly indicated what she was offering to the constable. Inside the car there was a confirmation of the offer, a quantification of the price and explanation as to other details.  
     
      
    44    There is no doubt that the plaintiff was a prostitute. She offered her body for acts of indecency, including sexual intercourse, for the sexual gratification of the under cover police officer. This clearly falls within the definition of prostitution in S.3 of the Act and also constitutes prostitution under the Common Law (Halsbury’s Laws of England 4th Ed. Vol. 11 para. 386).  
     
      
    45    The approach by the plaintiff to Constable Mourlas as a prospective customer with the intention of offering her services to him as a prostitute, constituted a breach of S.19(1) of the Summary Offences Act, 1988. In so deciding the Magistrate did not err either in his conclusion or in the legal principles he applied . 
     
      
    46    For the foregoing reasons the Summons in this matter is dismissed and the conviction of the plaintiff confirmed. The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the proceedings.

       70027/99 - REGINA v MATTHEW JAMES HARRIS 
        
        
       SENTENCE 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: On 3 December 1999, the prisoner, Matthew James Harris, was arraigned on an indictment charging him with three counts of murder. He entered pleas of guilty to each count. All matters were stood over for sentence. The sentence hearing was listed before me on 24 March 2000.  
     
      
    2    On that date, the Crown presented a further indictment charging the prisoner with an offence of armed robbery in company committed upon Trang Doan Ngoc Nguyen on 20 June 1998. The prisoner pleaded guilty to that charge. 
     
      
    3    The armed robbery offence was the first in the series of offences for which the prisoner stands for sentence. It was committed ten days before the prisoner’s 30th birthday.  
     
      
    4    The prisoner committed the armed robbery in company with a man named Kenneth Scott Frazier. Neither of them had money to buy alcohol. It was about 7.15pm on a Saturday night. They went to the front door of premises in Nordlingen Drive, Wagga Wagga, which were situated directly behind the block of units in which they both lived. They knocked on the front door of the victim’s unit announcing that they were police. Each was armed with a large kitchen knife. The victim, Trang Nguyen, opened the front door of the unit and the two men pushed their way in. They terrorised Ms Nguyen holding a knife to her throat and demanding money. Her three children were present. They stole a total of $58.00. They disconnected the telephone and left the unit and went to buy alcohol.  
     
      
    5    This ugly crime appears to mark the commencement of the prisoner’s degeneration to a point where, in the space of six weeks beginning around 1 October 1998, he strangled three people in separate incidents. 
     
      
    6    Peter Wennerbom was aged 62 years. He was a single man living in a unit in Jack Avenue, Wagga Wagga. He was a slightly built individual who suffered some residual difficulties following a stroke. The prisoner was on friendly terms with Peter Wennerbom’s sister, Elaine de Jong. He had accompanied Mrs de Jong on occasions when she visited her brother. He knew that Mrs de Jong loved her brother and had been worried about his health.  
     
      
    7    Some time around 1 October 1998, the prisoner knocked on Mr Wennerbom’s front door under the pretext of asking for a drink of water. It appears that Mr Wennerbom was suspicious of the prisoner’s approach. The prisoner told police that Mr Wennerbom handed the water to him at the door. The prisoner barged in. Shortly after entering the premises he commenced to strangle Mr Wennerbom. He told the investigating police, “He was an old man, there was no, no resistance at all. I had total, you know, control over the situation, he, he couldn’t do anything”. 
     
      
    8    Mr Wennerbom was in the habit of keeping relatively large sums of cash at home. Commonly he would have between $600 to $800. No money was found in the unit following the discovery of his body. The prisoner, in the course of two electronically recorded interviews said he did not recall taking money from Peter Wennerbom. Generally, his recollection of the detail of these shocking crimes was patchy. It may well be that he did steal a quantity of cash after killing Mr Wennerbom. 
     
      
    9    I was invited to approach sentence upon the basis that the prisoner went to Mr Wennerbom’s home with the intention of robbing him and that thereafter he killed Mr Wennerbom to avoid identification. On this view, so the Crown Prosecutor submitted, one might discern a progression in the pattern of the prisoner’s criminal offending in the second half of 1998.  
     
      
    10    It was the Crown’s submission that the subsequent two killings bore a different character. Both of these were wholly opportunistic killings committed for no reason other than that the prisoner was angry and found killing to be an outlet for that anger. 
     
      
    11    There are a number of passages in the interview conducted between Detective Sergeant Spence and the prisoner on 1 December 1998 and in the subsequent “walk-through” interview conducted at the deceased’s premises on 7 December 1998 which suggest strongly that the killing of Peter Wennerbom was an opportunistic killing, for the sake of it. Thus, during the interview on 7 December, the following exchange appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now when you, earlier you said you came here, you were going to ask for some money. Do you remember if you actually got any money from him? 
         
        A. Oh, no, no, I don’t think, I might have, that, that might have been the reason to come here, but like I said, I ended up asking him for water instead. I don’t, didn’t come here to ask him for money, I didn’t, I don’t, I, I might have said that but I don’t think I came here to ask for money. The only reason I came here was because I knew the, I knew him, I knew he lived on his own and I knew I could kill him.” 
        
       
      
    12    Elsewhere in that interview, the prisoner asserts that robbery did not even enter his mind. He speaks of his sole intention as being to kill Mr Wennerbom. I will return to the question of the prisoner’s motivation in relation to this first killing in due course. 
     
      
    13    Mr Wennerbom’s body was found by the father of one of his neighbours on the afternoon of 4 October 1998. Police and the ambulance service were summonsed. Senior Constable Christie attended and observed a suspicious bruise to the right side of the deceased’s throat. He treated the premises as a potential crime scene and contacted the duty officer. Arrangements were made for specialist police to attend and photograph the scene.  
     
      
    14    Dr Childs, the deceased’s treating medical practitioner examined the body. He noted the bruising to the neck and declined to issue a death certificate. The deceased had last been seen alive on 1 October 1998. The post-mortem examination did not establish a clear cause of death. At the time, it was considered that death may have been the result of a stroke or epileptic seizure. 
     
      
    15    Elaine de Jong, in a statement dated 8 January 1999, told police that in the days following the death of her brother the prisoner had been especially solicitous. Mrs de Jong’s daughter, Jane Pope, asked the prisoner to help her clean out Peter Wennerbom’s unit following the discovery of his body. The prisoner did so. He went to the funeral. Jane Pope said that he did not attend the service itself but he stayed outside playing with her children. She did not consider this unusual since the prisoner was accustomed to helping her with the children.  
     
      
    16    Over the course of a number of years Mrs Pope had seen the prisoner suffer periodic bouts of depression. She observed that he was depressed in the period following the death of Peter Wennerbom.  
     
      
    17    Yvonne Ford was a 33 year old woman living at 26 Phillip Avenue, Wagga Wagga. She suffered from mild intellectual disability. She was able to live independently. She held down a part-time job working for Cheryl Fitzgerald-Holmes, the proprietor of a set of boarding kennels. Ms Ford was employed for 20 hours per week to walk the dogs. She was described by Janice Lowing, Ms Fitzgerald-Holmes’ sister, as a methodical person and a conscientious employee. She had drawn up a chart to remind herself which dogs had been walked and which had not. She relied upon the Community Transport service to drive her to and from work. This is a community based organisation employing volunteer drivers. The prisoner was one. On occasions he had driven Ms Ford to work. 
     
      
    18    Ms Lowing told police that Yvonne was a very security-conscious person. Among the only people she could imagine Ms Ford letting into her home would be the Community Transport drivers and perhaps the Woolworths delivery man. Ms Lowing described Yvonne Ford as a totally harmless person who enriched the lives of those who knew her. Ms Fitzgerald-Holmes told the police, “All Yvonne wanted was to get a car, meet a boyfriend and have a family”.  
     
      
    19    On or about 17 October 1998, the prisoner called to Yvonne Ford’s home. In an interview with the police, he said he did not remember how he came to visit the premises. He said he “just went there. I was probably out on one of me walks and I probably had a few drinks, in the area so I just went went to the house ended up there”. 
     
      
    20    The prisoner knocked on the front door of Mr Ford’s home telling her that it was Matthew from Community Transport. She let him in. They engaged in small talk in the lounge. The prisoner told Police that Yvonne had been happy to see him. He volunteered that she did not get many visitors. After a little time the prisoner made a sexual advance towards her. He had no intention of having sexual intercourse with Ms Ford. The advance was a pretext. The prisoner had decided that the easiest way to kill Ms Ford would be to strangle her while she was in the bath. He had no hostility towards her. She had been always polite and nice to him on the occasions when he had driven her for the Community Transport Service. He told police: 
     
      
       
        
        “We struck up a bit of a friendship, as, just, just driving her around, and I obviously could tell she was lonely, she was slightly handicapped. I didn’t come, I didn’t come around here for sex, I didn’t come around here for anything, I just came around to say Hello, I live nearby, but then these thoughts started entering my head that I wanted to kill her.” 
        
       
      
    21    The prisoner persuaded Ms Ford to get into the bath. He offered to rub her back. He took his clothes off and sat in the bath behind her. Then he strangled her. She struggled so he held her under the water while strangling her. It took 3 to 4 minutes to kill her.  
     
      
    22    The prisoner told police that there was no particular reason for him to select Ms Ford, “… it could have been her, it could’ve been anybody. She was just unlucky”. Ms Ford did meet one criterion. The prisoner told Detective Sergeant Spence, “I just thought she would be easy, to target, she wouldn’t put up a fight or … she would be relatively easy to kill” (Q.363/4). 
     
      
    23    The prisoner was asked how he had felt at the time he was strangling Yvonne Ford and he replied, “Powerful, angry, just anger, pure anger. Not, not that she, there was no sex or anything, I was angry at the world. This is why this whole thing has happened, has started, and it was just my total anger building up from, I don’t know, from the day I was adopted, it’s just all built and built and, and something has set, set me off and I, I killed her” (interview, 7 December 98 at pp 23-24). 
     
      
    24    The prisoner told the police that, following the murder of Yvonne Ford, when he went home, he had felt horrified. 
     
      
    25    Janice Lowing became concerned about Yvonne Ford’s wellbeing on Sunday, 18 October 1998 when she did not answer the door. Senior Constable Hall attended the premises and discovered the body. He made contact with his supervisor and arranged for scientific police to attend. A post-mortem examination was carried out but the cause of death was not evident at that time. There was nothing to suggest to the police that the death of Ms Ford was the result of foul play. 
     
      
    26    The prisoner noted that there had been no press report of Yvonne Ford’s death. He inferred that his crime had probably not been detected. 
     
      
    27    The prisoner was living in a block of units at 1 Joyes Place, Wagga Wagga. He came to know a number of the other residents of that block. His immediate neighbour was Ronald Galvin. They were aquainted with one another. Ronald Galvin had never done anything to upset the prisoner. On 3 November 1998, the prisoner strangled Ronald Galvin. The following evening, the prisoner borrowed Elaine de Jong’s car. He carried Mr Galvin’s body from the Joyes Place premises wrapped in a doona. He drove to an area of tall grass not far from Uranquinty where he dumped the body. He was generally familiar with the Uranquinty area because Jane Pope and her family live there. He had stayed at the Pope’s home some years earlier. 
     
      
    28    Ronald Galvin was the son of Cecil and Iris Galvin. The Galvins live in Wagga Wagga. Ronald was a loving son who assisted his parents in a variety of ways which enabled them to enjoy a full and outgoing life in their later years. He would collect them and take them shopping or on visits to the doctor or to see family and friends. His senseless killing has caused untold distress to them and to his sisters, Barbara and Cheryl, and to his brother Brian. A Victim Impact Statement, prepared on behalf of the family, is in evidence. It speaks eloquently of the family’s loss and of their sense of bewilderment that their son and brother should have been murdered by the prisoner for no reason. I bear in mind the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85.  
     
      
    29    The prisoner’s recall of the circumstances surrounding the killing of Ronald Galvin were poor. At the time of the extensive interviews between the prisoner and Detective Sergeant Spence conducted on 1 December 1998 the prisoner’s short term memory appears to have been impaired. He had taken an overdose of heroin the previous night. He was observed by the welfare officer, responsible for screening new receptions at the Silverwater Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, to be in a highly distressed, anxious and confused state when she assessed him at 7.20pm on 2 December 1998.  
     
      
    30    In his first interview concerning the murder of Ronald Galvin, the prisoner was not able to recall whether he had strangled Mr Galvin in his own flat or in Mr Galvin’s flat. Subsequently, on 7 December 1998, when the prisoner participated in a “walk-through” at each of the premises in which he had killed people, he remained somewhat uncertain about the scene of the killing of Mr Galvin. He thought that he had been drinking with Mr Galvin, although it was possible that he had called to Mr Galvin’s flat to ask for a cigarette. He strangled him from behind. His only explanation was, “… I think it was just a lot of anger I was getting rid of and it was being projected on him” (Q.562).  
     
      
    31    Ronald Galvin was reported as a missing person. Detective Sergeant Spence interviewed the prisoner on 25 November 1998 in connection with the disappearance. The prisoner gave an account that he had last seen Mr Galvin at 7.00 or 7.30pm on the evening of Melbourne Cup day. Mr Galvin had been sitting on the stairway leading up to his flat with a number of persons including someone described as “a bloke I’ve never seen before”. The prisoner said he had not seen Mr Galvin since that time. Detective Sergeant Spence recorded the prisoner as a suspect in relation to the disappearance of Ronald Galvin on 25 November 1998.  
     
      
    32    Mr Galvin’s body had not been located as at the date of the prisoner’s arrest. 
     
      
    33    In the period following Mr Galvin’s murder the prisoner made two attempts to kill himself. In each instance he took an overdose of heroin. On Wednesday 11 November 1998, Elaine de Jong spoke with the prisoner who told her that he had just returned from a trip to Sydney after taking an overdose. She asked why and he said “I don’t feel well, I’ll talk to you about it tomorrow. I need to tell you something”. The following day, she went to the prisoner’s flat but he was not at home. She made a number of inquiries and learned that the prisoner had returned to Sydney. Such was her concern that she flew to Sydney that same day in an attempt to locate him. She returned to Wagga Wagga three days later having failed to find him.  
     
      
    34    On 30 November 1998, Mrs de Jong received a telephone call from the prisoner at 3.00am. He said to her, “I need to talk to you. Will you stand by me no matter what?” He hung up shortly thereafter. About two minutes later, he telephoned again and repeated his request that she promise to stand by him. He went on to say, “I’m going to be away for a long time, about sixteen years. Will you visit me. Will you promise not to die before I get out?” The prisoner then told Mrs de Jong, “I killed that bloke that’s missing from next door”. Mrs de Jong asked where the body was to be located and the prisoner replied, “Somewhere in Uranquinty. Don’t tell anybody yet. I want to do this in my own time. I love you.” Mrs de Jong immediately spoke with her husband and together they went to the Wagga Wagga Police Station and spoke with Sergeant Hogno at about 4.00am that day. 
     
      
    35    At 9.30am, the prisoner again telephoned Mrs de Jong. He told her that he was in Sydney. He repeated his request for her to stand by him. In that conversation he went on to tell Mrs de Jong, “I killed a lady in Phillip Avenue as well on Caulfield cup day”. Mrs de Jong asked, “How”. The prisoner replied, “In the bath. But I don’t think anybody found her because I don’t think there was anything in the newspapers about it”. He asked Mrs de Jong not to have the police waiting for him should he return to Wagga Wagga. He said he wanted to go to the Police Station when it was daytime. Mrs de Jong replied, “Mathew, don’t come back here thinking that you can talk me into being quiet. You know how I am”. The prisoner said, “I don’t know if I can do it. What about if you make me a tentative booking under the name of Mathew Brown on today’s coach?” The prisoner did not take the coach. 
     
      
    36    At 2.05pm, he telephoned Mrs de Jong from Sydney. She was, at that time, speaking with Detective Sergeant Spence. During this conversation, the prisoner told Mrs de Jong that he had some heroin and he thought it was best to end it all then. It appears that the prisoner took an overdose of heroin sometime later that evening. Inspector Axford attended the Embarkation Park, Victoria Street Potts Point at a little after midnight on Tuesday, 1 December 1998 to investigate a report of a male person who had apparently overdosed. He located the prisoner lying unconscious in the park. The ambulance service was contacted and the prisoner was revived by the administration of oxygen and Narcan. He was conveyed to St Vincent’s Hospital for further treatment. 
     
      
    37    After Inspector Axford obtained the prisoner’s personal particulars, he made some inquiries on the police computer system. As the result of those inquiries he arranged for Senior Constable Clarke to attend at St Vincent’s Hospital and arrest the prisoner.  
     
      
    38    At a little after 11.00am that morning, Detective Sergeant Spence conducted the first of a number of electronically recorded interviews with the prisoner.  
     
      
    39    During the interviews conducted on 1 December 1998, the prisoner was told of the admissions made by him to Mrs de Jong as to the killing of Ronald Galvin and Yvonne Ford. He said, and I accept, that he did not remember having made those admissions. Nonetheless, he freely confessed that he was the killer.  
     
      
    40    The final interview conducted on 1 December 1998 concerned the death of Peter Wennerbom. That interview commenced at 8.53pm. The prisoner had not made any admission to Elaine de Jong as to the killing of her brother. At the beginning of the interview, the prisoner started to say that he did not know about the death of Mr Wennerbom. At that point he appeared to become upset. He expressed concern about upsetting Elaine de Jong. He went on to say to Detective Sergeant Spence, “My mind’s not clear on it but, I don’t know, I think I might have something to do with it”. Shortly thereafter, he clarified this by saying he had strangled Mr Wennerbom. 
     
      
    41    I approach this matter upon the basis that the prisoner was fully cooperative with police throughout their investigation. I accept that his memory for detail of the events was, at times, impaired. 
     
      
    42    On 7 December 1998, the prisoner accompanied Detective Sergeant Spence and other police to the scenes of each of the killings and made further frank disclosures concerning his involvement. 
     
      
    43    On 1 February 1999, Detective Sergeant Smith conducted a further electronically recorded interview with the prisoner. In the course of this interview, Detective Sergeant Smith obtained a great deal of background information concerning the prisoner which, in some measure, assists in an understanding of these appalling crimes. 
     
      
    44    The prisoner was born on 30 June 1968. He was adopted at the age of about ten months and grew up in Cronulla. His parents had one natural child, a girl four months older than the prisoner. The prisoner had come to understand that arrangements had been put in train for his adoption at a time when his parents believed that they were unable to have further children of their own. Subsequently, his mother gave birth to a son. When the prisoner was around ten, he was told that he was adopted. He appears to have been very unsettled by that discovery.  
     
      
    45    It was the prisoner’s perception that his parents and, in particular his mother, treated him differently and less well than his brother and sister. In his early teens he started exhibiting behavioural problems. He began abusing alcohol and truanting. He left home and school.  
     
      
    46    The Department of Community Services arranged various placements for the prisoner over the years. A report, dated 12 July 1983, under the hand of Mr Mullany, District Officer, was tendered on the prisoner’s behalf. The report was prepared two weeks after the prisoner’s 15th birthday. At the time, the prisoner was in temporary foster care with a family in Gymea. His behaviour with this family had been observed to be quite good. It was noted that his parents had shown a complete lack of interest in him. The family was described as living ten minutes by motor vehicle from the foster home but as having made no attempts to contact the prisoner. 
     
      
    47    From the age of fifteen or thereabouts, the prisoner found himself living in refuges and on the streets. He prostituted himself and became a heroin user. In January 1991, he was charged with offences of armed robbery and assault. In May 1991, he was sentenced to an effective minimum term of two and a half years penal servitude. An additional term of six months was specified. The prisoner described the victim of the armed robbery offence as one of his customers. 
     
      
    48    While serving this sentence, the social worker at the Junee Prison put the prisoner in touch with Elaine de Jong. Both Elaine de Jong and her daughter, Jane, were active in the Triangle Organisation. This is a voluntary group which aims to assist adoptees to meet their biological parents. Elaine de Jong agreed to assist the prisoner to locate his mother. She formed a friendship with the prisoner and, following his release from custody in 1993, he moved to Wagga Wagga. He lived with Mrs de Jong and her family for a period of six months or more. He was motivated by a desire to make a fresh start away from the life he had known in Kings Cross in the previous decade. 
     
      
    49    From that time, up until the date of his arrest in relation to the present matters, the prisoner lived predominantly in Wagga Wagga. He would return to Sydney on occasions and purchase heroin. However, his usage was controlled and, until shortly prior to his arrest, recreational.  
     
      
    50    The prisoner’s criminal record as a juvenile contains relatively few entries having regard to his lifestyle. His first convictions recorded against him as an adult were the armed robbery and assault offences to which I have referred. He was sentenced in May 1991 in respect of these offences. He was then aged twenty-two years. He was released from prison around November 1993 at the age of twenty-five.  
     
      
    51    From the date of his release from prison until the armed robbery of Trang Nguyen in June 1998, the prisoner appears to have led a relatively law abiding life if one puts to one side for present purposes his occasional drug use. The only criminal offence recorded against him in these years was a conviction for stealing recorded at the Wagga Wagga Local Court in respect of which he was fined $200. He had not been out of prison long at the date of his arrest for that offence.  
     
      
    52    The prisoner obtained employment for a short time at Cargill’s Meatworks as a packer. By and large, over these years, he was unemployed. In 1994, he undertook a basic education course at the Wagga Wagga TAFE. This course lasted for six months. The prisoner found the content of it too elementary to be of real interest. However, he persisted because it provided him with something to do and he wished to please the de Jong family.  
     
      
    53    The prisoner performed voluntary work with the Community Transport Organisation in Wagga Wagga. Again, his motivation for undertaking this work was that it provided him with something to do. He also enjoyed driving. 
     
      
    54    An old pre-sentence report, dated 14 October 1987, was tendered on the prisoner’s behalf. That report described the prisoner as a young man who had been anxious to discover his natural mother for some years. He had previously been told he would have to wait until he was 18 years of age. He told the author of the report that he had come to feel that an attempt to find his natural mother may only bring hurt and rejection. That proved to be a well-founded fear. With the assistance of Mrs de Jong the prisoner met his natural mother a year or two prior to the commission of the present offences. He told Detective Sergeant Smith that the meeting lasted three or four minutes. His mother explained that she had given him up at birth and that she did not want further contact with him. He was given to understand that his mother had given birth to him at an early age and that, subsequently, she had formed another relationship and had children who represented her “own family”. Those children knew nothing of the prisoner nor did she wish them to learn of him. I accept that this was a significant blow to the prisoner. 
     
      
    55    In his interview with Detective Sergeant Smith on 1 February 1999, the prisoner said that as a child he had nightmares about his adoptive mother. He used to think that she was trying to kill him. He hated her. He said that his nightmares would feature the silhouette of his mother in the window carrying a knife trying to kill him. Those nightmares recurred over a period of years until the prisoner left home. He went on to tell Detective Sergeant Smith: 
     
      
       
        
        “… just the thoughts, you know, I’ve always, its on record, I’ve always thought of I’ve wanted to kill my mother and my family and stuff like that. Just being dirty on the world, you know, being dirty on the fact that I was adopted and I was taken in by this family and then rejected by them. … in the shit with the prostitution and having to lower meself and all that, just all the thoughts.”  
        (Q.102) 
        
       
      
    56    He went on to state that he had murderous thoughts about his family quite often from about the age of 13. He said that his thoughts about killing people continued during the period that he was prostituting himself. He described himself in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “I went with so many blokes I could have killed a number of them, but I didn’t, I didn’t, didn’t go through with it, but even then I had the thoughts, you know, these blokes that the, that I was, that I was sleeping with were using me and I using them or whatever, I thought, I wanted to kill them, of course.” 
         (Q 105) 
        
       
      
    57    Reports by two psychologists were tendered in the prisoner’s case. One by Ms Barrier, dated 10 November 1999, and one by Ms Matsuo, the forensic psychologist, at the Metropolitan Medical Transient Centre, Long Bay complex. Ms Matsuo reports regular and on-going therapeutic contact with the prisoner between 16 September 1999 and the date of her report, 22 March 2000. Her opinion is based in part upon the results of psychometric assessment and in part on her observations of the prisoner over six months of regular contact. Ms Matsuo notes that psychiatric assessment of the prisoner, while he was in custody led to a diagnosis of depression and that he has been taking anti-depressant medication since October 1999. The medication, together with psychological therapy, has resulted in him showing greater emotional stability and in the emergence of his underlying personality.  
     
      
    58    Both Ms Matsuo and Ms Barrier made use of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory - Third Edition (MCMI-3). This is a standardised psychometric measure designed to assess information concerning the subject’s personality, emotional adjustment and the presence of psychopathology. I read both psychologists as having obtained broadly consistent results by reference to that measure.  
     
      
    59    Ms Barrier’s test results revealed a diagnosis of personality disorder (schizotypal) and/or avoidant personality disorder with prominent depressive and schizoid traits. Ms Barrier states that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Personality test results describe someone who is ‘unable to overcome the feelings that life is empty and meaningless, and unable to master the skills to overcome the deficits he sees within himself, he is likely at times to become cranky if not explosive’.” 
        
       
      
    60    Ms Barrier reported that the prisoner demonstrates little empathy for the victims and limited understanding of the enormity of his behaviour. He told Ms Barrier that he was currently seeing a psychologist at the prison on a regular basis with the aim of assisting him to come to terms “about why it all happened”. 
     
      
    61    Ms Matsuo says that the prisoner has a Schizoid personality disorder. Individuals with this disorder tend to be detached from social relationships and to have a restricted range of expression of emotion in interpersonal settings. They tend to be socially isolated people. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) suggests that, in some situations, such individuals may be comfortable in revealing themselves and they may acknowledge painful feelings. Ms Matsuo says that this has happened with the prisoner. She goes on to observe: 
     
      
       
        
        “Taken in context based on his day to day behaviour, Mr Harris displays few pervasively antisocial traits. He prefers to be alone rather than in large groups but this stems from his feeling of inadequacy and worthlessness. He often denigrates himself in front of the author and has a low self-image. Mr Harris’ history does indicate he has often failed to comply with social norms especially in terms of his drug use, prostitution and his criminal history, however, he does not lack remorse altogether. He has demonstrated significant levels of compassion both in and out of gaol, helping others in need and in particular taking care of young children at his home in Wagga. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Harris’ transient disregard for others has occurred as a very specific end to a certain set of psychological circumstances. He believes the reason he felt indifference to the human life that he destroyed may be the indifference he feels towards his own existence. He is not, in terms of his enduring personality type an irritable, aggressive or violent person as assessed by the MCMI-3 - and he is not a person who pervasively shows indifference or contempt for the feelings and suffering of others or explosive anger.” 
        
       
      
    62    Ms Matsuo describes the prisoner as expressing genuine remorse over the death of Yvonne Ford but not over the deaths of Mr Wennerbom or Mr Galvin. Ms Matsuo states that the prisoner displays empathy for his female victim and that he shows insight into the emotion she would have experienced at the time. Ms Matsuo considers that the prisoner is developing increasing feelings of guilt concerning Ms Ford, that he feels “terrible” inside, that he is disgusted with himself and that he deeply regrets his actions. He has expressed distress and confusion in his sessions with Ms Matsuo over the fact that he feels no empathy with the male victims. He says he wants to feel it because he knows what he has done is extremely wrong. 
     
      
    63    In her conclusion, Ms Matsuo states that, in the length of time she has had contact with the prisoner, he has begun to accept responsibility for his crimes and not to feel the depth of self-pity which he did previously. Ms Matsuo states: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Harris is cognisant of his psychological shortcomings and his lengthy problems with drugs and alcohol. He has already shown himself to be highly motivated to work on his offending issues with psychological programs and his substance abuse issues with AOD counsellors.” 
        
       
       
      She describes him as having begun what he knows will be the difficult task of understanding himself. 
       
      
    64    As I have noted, the Crown submitted that I would approach this matter upon the basis that the killing of Mr Wennerbom was in a different category to the killings of Yvonne Ford and Ronald Galvin. The Crown submitted that I would not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner had set out with the intention of killing Mr Wennerbom. The Crown accepted, having regard to the whole of the material, that a reasonably possible view of the facts was that the prisoner had intended to rob Mr Wennerbom, and that, having done so, he determined to kill him in order to avoid later identification. 
     
      
    65    There are, as I have observed, a number of passages in the interview between Detective Sergeant Spence and the prisoner in which it appears the prisoner clearly acknowledges that his sole intention in visiting Mr Wennerbom that night was to kill him. This is against a background of the prisoner’s admissions that, for a number of years, he had entertained thoughts of killing people in order to get back at the world. I note that, in his sessions with Ms Matsuo, the prisoner has asserted his belief that it was his intention on the evening he called upon Mr Wennerbom to rob and not to kill. The prisoner has not sought to put a complexion on the killings of Yvonne Ford or Ronald Galvin other than that they were killings for the sake of it. Nor in his sessions with Ms Matsuo has he sought to feign remorse for the killings of either Peter Wennerbom or Ronald Galvin. This inclines me to accept that the prisoner has endeavoured to be frank with Ms Matsuo. 
     
      
    66    The interview concerning the killing of Peter Wennerbom was the final interview conducted on 1 December 1998. It is apparent that the prisoner was exhibiting considerable confusion on that day. In the course of his interviews concerning the killing of Yvonne Ford and Ronald Galvin, he had repeatedly spoken of his ruminations about killing people generally. At an early stage in the interview concerning the murder of Peter Wennerbom, he said, “I intended to rob I think”. Subsequently, as I have already detailed, he moved from this as his intention asserting emphatically that he had gone to Peter Wennerbom’s home in order to kill him. 
     
      
    67    I consider that, in the light of his state on 1 December and having regard to the sequence with which he was interviewed concerning the three deaths, that I would not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that his intention was to kill Peter Wennerbom at the time when he knocked on Mr Wennerbom’s front door. 
     
      
    68    I approach the matter of sentence upon this basis. Around the time of his 30th birthday, the prisoner started to become overwhelmed by feelings of depression associated with his view that he had achieved nothing in his life. He was at the time associating with Kenneth Frazier, a person with a lengthy criminal record. The association was a bad one from the prisoner’s point of view. 
     
      
    69    Kellie Oxford, a young girl living in the Frazier’s home gives an account of the lead up to the armed robbery of Trang Nguyen. She says that it was Mr Frazier who proposed the robbery. She recalls the prisoner as initially declining to be involved. The following night, both Mr Frazier and the prisoner were drunk when Ms Oxford says, Frazier said, “What about that armed robbery?” to which the prisoner replied, “Why not”. 
     
      
    70    Both the prisoner and Ken Frazier were suspects in relation to the robbery of Trang Nguyen. They were asked to attend an identification parade at the Wagga Wagga Police Station. It would appear that there was insufficient evidence to charge either of them at that time.  
     
      
    71    After getting away with the robbery of Ms Nguyen, the prisoner, when again affected by alcohol, was emboldened to rob Peter Wennerbom. Having forced his way into Mr Wennerbom’s house, he killed him to avoid detection. He was a person who for years had entertained thoughts of killing people. Having killed Mr Wennerbom, and having avoided detection, the prisoner became confident enough to commence killing people for the satisfaction of it. 
     
      
    72    The Crown submits that the killings of Yvonne Ford and Ronald Galvin call for the imposition of the maximum penalty. 
     
      
    73    As I have noted, these proceedings were before me on 24 March 2000. On that day the Sentencing Act 1989 was still in force. On 3 April 2000, Schedule 1 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 commenced. The Sentencing Act 1989 was thereby repealed. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Procedure Act”) commenced on that day. The savings and transitional provisions are contained in Schedule 2 of the Procedure Act. Relevantly cl 37(a) is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “anything begun before the appointed day under a provision of the old legislation for which there is a corresponding provision in this Act may be continued and completed under the old legislation as if the 
         Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 
          
        1999  
        had not been enacted”.  
        
       
      
    74    I do not know what is embraced by the words “anything begun … under a provision of the old legislation”. The proceedings were on foot prior to the appointed day at a time when the Sentencing Act 1989 was in force. They had been commenced, on one view, not later than the date on which the prisoner was arraigned. It is not clear to me that anything had begun under a provision of the old legislation for which there is a corresponding provision under the Procedure Act. The proceedings had begun by virtue of the presentation of the indictment. For this reason, I consider the Procedure Act and not the Sentencing Act to apply to any determinate sentence imposed. 
     
      
    75    Section 19A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (“the Act”) provides that a person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life. Section 19A does not affect the operation of s 21 of the Procedure Act which admits of the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life in respect of a person’s conviction for murder. 
     
      
    76    Section 61 of the Procedure Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder, if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    77    Section 61 of the Procedure Act is in identical terms to s 431B of the Act. The latter was inserted into the Act by the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Act 1996. It commenced on 30 June 1996. I was not referred to any authority concerning the construction of this provision. Hunt CJ at CL referred to it in passing in R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at 49, a case dealing with an application for the determination of a minimum and additional terms pursuant to s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989. In that case, the Crown submitted that his Honour should decline the application and direct pursuant to s 13(8) that the applicant never re-apply to the Court for such a determination. The effect of such a direction being to leave the unsuccessful applicant serving a term of imprisonment for the remainder of his or her natural life. In this context, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For completeness, reference should be made to the terms of s 431B(1), inserted in the Crimes Act last year, which purports to provide a mandatory life sentence for murder where ‘the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met by the imposition of [a life] sentence’. The subheading to that particular provision is ‘Mandatory life sentences for certain offences’ but, so far as the offence of murder is concerned, it has no effect as a mandatory sentence, because it permits (by subs 3) a sentence less than the maximum to be imposed even where its conditions have been fulfilled. It adds nothing at all to the common law relating to the imposition of maximum penalties, except the danger that it may eventually be interpreted as replacing the common law by an ill-defined code which will eventually become narrower than the common law”. 
        
       
      
    78    Greg James J gave detailed consideration to the history and effect of s 431(B) in Regina v Petrinovic [1999] NSWSC 1131. His Honour, having noted that s 431B(3) appears to preserve a discretion to impose a lesser sentence (in that it provides that nothing in subs (1) affects the operation of s 442), went on to observe that if the Court is of the opinion set out in s 431B(1) there is, having regard to the language of the section, no discretion to impose a sentence other than life (para 25). It is difficult to reconcile s 431B(3) (now s 61(1) of the Procedure Act) with the terms of s 431B(1) (now s 61(3) of the Procedure Act). I see the force of Greg James J’s view.  
     
      
    79    I approach this matter upon the basis that if I am of the view that the prisoner’s level of culpability in the commission of the offences is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence I am required by s 61(1) of the Procedure Act to impose such a sentence. I consider that if I am of that view I would, in any event, be required to impose a life sentence having regard to the principles governing the sentencing of offenders at common law; Regina v Garforth (NSWCCA, unreported, 23 May 1994). 
     
      
    80    In Petrinovic, Greg James J, after referring to the Attorney General’s second reading speech of the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Bill in the Legislative Council on 17 April 1996, said this:  
     
      
       
        
        “Considering what was said by the Attorney-General and the language used in s 431B(1), it appears that the section is meant to apply to the culpability involved in the commission of the crimes and that is not to be limited as defined merely by the immediate factual circumstances. Even as to those, there is some doubt as to whether the relevant test requires the culpability of the factual circumstances of the individual offence, standing alone, to justify the imposition of penal servitude for life (see  
        Regina v Street 
         (CCA, unreported 17 December 1996)). It is not necessary to resolve that matter here.”  
        (paras 33/34) 
          
        
       
      
    81    The language of the provision appears to be drawn from the observations of the Court in Garforth. In that case, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant, that the maximum sentence ought to be reserved to cases in which the offender was likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his life or, alternatively, to those cases where there was no reasonable prospect of rehabilitation. The Court rejected that submission and in the course of so doing observed, “There are some cases where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty”. 
     
      
    82    What matters are to be taken into account in determining whether the prisoner’s level of culpability is so extreme as to require the imposition of a life sentence? Mr Webb, who appears on behalf of the prisoner, submitted that I would have regard the prisoner’s frank admissions as to his guilt, in particular his voluntary disclosure of the offences involving Peter Wennerbom and Yvonne Ford (in respect of which he was not a suspect), his troubled background and the emotional deprivation of his youth, and the contents of Ms Matsuo’s report. These matters in combination, so it was submitted, would lead me to the view that the prisoner’s culpability for the crimes is not so extreme as to demand the life sentence. 
     
      
    83    Prior to the introduction of s 19A of the Act when the penalty upon conviction for murder was a mandatory life sentence (at a time when persons sentenced to life had the expectation of eventual release on licence under s 463 of the Act) the Crimes (Homicide) Amendment Act 1982 inserted a proviso to s 19 permitting a judge to impose a determinate sentence in cases in which it appeared to the Judge “that the person’s culpability for the crime is significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances whether disclosed by the evidence in the trial or otherwise”. The construction of that proviso was the subject of a division of opinion within the Court. The controversy was resolved in R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466, a case in which the majority determined that the expression “culpability for the crime” requires that material totally unconnected with the commission of the crime be excluded (per Samuels JA at 479, Lee J at 482). Thus, circumstances arising after the commission of the murder, being matters ordinarily referable to the exercise of the sentencing discretion such as remorse, assistance to the authorities, a plea of guilty and favourable prospects for rehabilitation, were not to be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the prisoner’s culpability for the crime was significantly diminished.  
     
      
    84    The proviso to s 19 as it then stood was in different terms to the formulation in s 61(1) of the Procedure Act. Further, the proviso operated to confer a discretion where otherwise there was none. Section 61(1) operates (accepting for present purposes the force of Greg James J’s view in Petrinovic) to take away a discretion and to require a judge to impose the maximum sentence if he or she is of the specified opinion. Such a provision should be construed restrictively. Nonetheless, having regard to the language of the provision, it seems to me that the assessment of the prisoner’s culpability required by the section is directed to circumstances surrounding or causally connected to the offence. Again, I consider this to be consonant with the position at common law having regard to Garforth.  
     
      
    85    Thus, I put to one side for present purposes consideration of such evidence as there is of the prisoner’s remorse, his confessions, pleas of guilty and prospects of rehabilitation and I consider whether the prisoner’s culpability for his crimes is so extreme that the community interest in the various stated objectives of sentencing requires the imposition of a life sentence.  
     
      
    86    In Bell, the majority observed that culpability means “blameworthiness” as distinct from “deserving of punishment” (per Samuels JA at p 479, Lee J at p 482). In R v Burke [1983] 2 NSWLR 93 at 101, Nagle CJ at CL observed (again in the context of the proviso to s 19 introduced by the Crimes (Homicide) Amendment Act 1982) “the deprived life and upbringing of a prisoner may, in some cases, have contributed to the committal of the murder and so may reflect on his culpability”. That such a consideration may be relevant to the assessment of the prisoner’s culpability for his crime in the sense of being a causative influence upon it was accepted by each of the judges in Bell. 
     
      
    87    I turn now to the evidence concerning the prisoner’s troubled background. In the course of his interviews with the police and in discussions with the two psychologists the prisoner described a childhood characterised by rejection and emotional deprivation. I have summarised the effect of this material above.  
     
      
    88    A statement was obtained from the prisoner’s father which does not describe any difficulties in his son’s early years. Mr Harris does report that he and his wife started to identify problems with the prisoner’s school work and behaviour when the prisoner was in the last year of primary school. Mr Harris says that the prisoner did not fit in well at high school and left both school and home aged fourteen years. He says that he is not able to give any reason why he left home at this age.  
     
      
    89    Mr Mullany’s report, to which I have referred, describes a very different picture. It is a contemporary document. It is expressed in the strongest of terms. In this respect it is sufficient to note the opinion set out in paragraph 7 of the report. Mr Mullany goes on to summarise the report of a psychologist prepared around May 1983 when the prisoner was aged fourteen years. The psychologist was of the opinion that the prisoner’s behaviour was consistent with children who have not come to grips with adoption and have lost their bonds to their substitute family. Mr Mullany considered the lack of contact between the prisoner and his family (in respect of which he was not critical of the prisoner) was likely to have “an ongoing adverse effect on his emotional development which in all probability will mean he will become involved in anti-social and criminal behaviour”.  
     
      
    90    I approach this matter upon the basis that the prisoner did experience a significant level of emotional deprivation and rejection in childhood and that this led to him leaving home and living the life of a ‘street kid’. In his teenage years he prostituted himself with men and experienced the feelings of debasement and worthlessness that almost inevitably flow from that lifestyle. 
     
      
    91    I consider that this unfortunate background was causally related to the commission of the present offences. It is the burden of everything the prisoner had to say to the investigating police in a series of interviews notable for their frank admissions. It finds support in the report of Ms Matsuo. This view causes me to refrain from concluding that the prisoner’s culpability for his offences is so extreme that the community interest in the various objects of sentencing may only be met by the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. 
     
      
    92    I consider that I have a discretion to impose a lesser sentence than one of life imprisonment. It does not flow that I would necessarily do so. Among the various objects of sentencing I must consider the protection of the community.  
     
      
    93    No psychiatric evidence has been placed before me to assist with a consideration of the prisoner’s potential for dangerousness in the future. In Garforth the Court observed that a judge is not in a position to require the defence to tender psychiatric reports nor can a person facing sentence be required to submit to a psychiatric examination at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions. In those cases where no psychiatric material is available, the sentencing Judge is required to make his or her own determination on such material as is available. The Court said:  
     
      
       
        
        “There are some cases in which the circumstances of an offence on their own suggest the possibility of dangerousness”.  
        
       
      
    94    The prisoner is a person who has killed people whom he perceived to be vulnerable and, therefore, easy to kill because it made him feel powerful to do so. He told Detective Sergeant Spence in the course of the “walk-through” interview relating to the death of Peter Wennerbom that, “He had been living a straight life in Wagga” and “over months thoughts about killing people came into my head - they were powerful thoughts”. In that same interview, he said, “I’ve always expressed the desire to kill people ever since I was a kid and it made, and it, it sought of excited me. It wasn’t like I was getting off on it or anything but it was very powerful and it was revenge on society. It’s you know, the whole shit.” 
     
      
    95    Having regard to the crimes committed by the prisoner, together with the statements made by him to the investigating police, I have no difficulty in concluding that the prisoner represents a danger to the community. This is a proper matter for me to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence, consistent with the observations of the majority in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465. Considerations of the protection of the community cannot allow of the imposition of a sentence which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. Having regard to the gravity of these offences I do not feel constrained on that account. 
     
      
    96    The prisoner is thirty-one years of age. A life sentence may see him serve something of the order of fifty years in custody with no prospect of release regardless of any progress which he makes towards reform. In Garforth, the Court observed, “We should emphasise that we do not intend to diminish the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment”. The Court quoted, with approval, the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Petroff (unreported, 12 November 1991): 
     
      
       
        
        “The indeterminate nature of a life sentence has long been the subject of criticism by penologists and others concerned with the prison system and the punishment of offenders generally. Such as sentence deprives a prisoner of any fixed goal to aim for. It robs him of any incentive and it is personally destructive of his moral. The life sentence imposes intolerable burdens upon most prisoners because of their incarceration for an indeterminate period and the result of that imposition has been an increased difficulty in their management by the prison authorities.” 
        
       
      
    97    It is to be borne in mind that Hunt CJ an CL was speaking of life sentences as they stood prior to the introduction of s 19A into the Act at a time when life sentence prisoners had the expectation of ultimate release on licence. 
     
      
    98    As I read Ms Matsuo’s report, there exists some possibility that the prisoner may develop an understanding of his psychological difficulties. Ms Matsuo paints a somewhat more optimistic picture of the prisoner’s prospects in this regard than emerges from the report of Ms Barrier. Ms Matsuo has had continuing contact with the prisoner over a relatively lengthy period. I accept her opinion in preference to Ms Barrier’s for that reason. 
     
      
    99    I consider that the prisoner’s admissions both to Mrs de Jong and to the police are significant to my view that he is not entirely without hope of rehabilitation. His crimes speak of a callous unconcern for human feelings. At the time he was committing them there are some indications that he was himself disturbed by his behaviour. 
     
      
    100    In the course of his interview with Detective Sergeant Spence concerning the murder of Ronald Galvin, the prisoner said that he had gone to see a doctor in Wagga Wagga for depression. He was asked why he was depressed and he replied, “’cause I killed the bloke”. He went on to say, “There wasn’t any other problem, it was just, you know, living with it”.  
     
      
    101    In the period following the murder of Mr Galvin, I accept that the prisoner, on two occasions, endeavoured to kill himself. When he telephoned Mrs de Jong on 30 November 1998, it seems to me he was exhibiting some signs of concern about his aberrant behaviour. There are passages in his lengthy interviews with the investigating police which tend to confirm that view. 
     
      
    102    I consider that the prisoner has some prospect that, with appropriate psychological counselling over a lengthy period, he may one day come not to present a danger to the community. The experience of this Court in making determinations pursuant to s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989 shows that, on occasions, over the course of long terms of imprisonment some offenders (despite the commission of terrible offences) do rehabilitate themselves to such a degree that their release into the community under supervision may be contemplated; Regina v McCafferty, unreported, NSWSC Wood J, 15 October 1991.  
     
      
    103    I note that the prisoner managed to form a relationship of sorts with Mrs de Jong and with her daughter, Jane Pope, and Mrs Pope’s family. Despite Mrs de Jong’s love for her brother, she continues to offer support to the prisoner. So does Mrs Pope. Mrs de Jong in a letter dated 16 March 2000, speaks of the prisoner’s apparent caring relationship with a young child then being looked after by Mrs de Jong. She refers to occasions when the prisoner exhibited initiative and kindness in dealing with the clients of the Community Transport Service. Given his crimes and, in this context, particularly the murder of Yvonne Ford, I feel I can place little weight on considerations of the latter sort.  
     
      
    104    In Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525, the majority spoke of the difficulty of forecasting the likelihood of a prisoner re-offending over the course of a lengthy term. This was in the context of the determination of a minimum term in respect of a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment. The sentencing judge in that case had imposed a minimum term of 18½ years. In so doing he had placed particular weight on considerations of the protection of the community. The majority found this minimum term to be excessive. The applicant was twenty-seven years of age at the date of sentence and would be over forty-five before the likelihood of his re-offending became a matter for the proper authorities to assess.  
     
      
    105    In Bugmy, the applicant’s sentence was that fixed by the legislature, namely, life imprisonment. There exists in Victoria provision for the imposition of a life sentence together with the specification of a minimum term before the expiration of which the prisoner may not be considered for parole. Such a sentence provides for greater flexibility than is open to a judge in this State. The protection of the community is assured by the life sentence. A prisoner who continues to pose a threat to society will not be granted conditional release on parole. The specification of a minimum term provides an incentive for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    106    I may either impose a life sentence which deprives the prisoner of any hope or motive for rehabilitation or fix a determinate sentence. I have determined to impose a determinate sentence. Any determinate sentence must, having regard to the facts of this case, accord primacy to the protection of the community. Of necessity, this dictates a sentence of great severity.  
     
      
    107    I now turn to a consideration of the other features of the case which it was submitted would favour the exercise of some leniency. As I have noted the death of Yvonne Ford was not treated as an unlawful killing in the light of the inconclusive findings on autopsy. Although police entertained suspicions concerning the death of Peter Wennerbom, the matter does not appear to have been the subject of active investigation. 
     
      
    108    The prisoner’s disclosure of his otherwise unknown guilt of two of these murders, together with his admission as to the murder of Ronald Galvin at a time when Mr Galvin’s body had not been located, would in the ordinary course entitle the prisoner to a significant measure of leniency; R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. As I have noted, this consideration would not stand in the way of the imposition of the maximum sentence if I were of the view that such a sentence was required. Since I am not of that view, I consider that I should reduce the sentence I would otherwise impose in order to reflect the prisoner’s voluntary disclosure of his guilt with respect to the murders of Yvonne Ford and Peter Wennerbom. However, I bear in mind that I must not reduce the sentences I impose such that they become unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences. This latter consideration is to the fore in the approach I adopt. 
     
      
    109    I have regard to the prisoner’s pleas of guilty entered at the first opportunity. This is a matter which, pursuant to s 22 of the Procedure Act, permits a court to reduce the sentence which would otherwise be imposed. I take this into account in the same way I have indicated with respect to the prisoner’s voluntary disclosure of guilt. 
     
      
    110    As I have noted I have regard to the protection of the community consistent with the observations of the majority in Veen (No. 2) in determining the appropriate sentence. In Petrinovic, Greg James J dealing with sentencing pursuant to s 5 of the Sentencing Act 1989 observed that the additional term did not exist solely for the purpose of the provision of supervision. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An additional term should reflect those elements referred to by the High Court in  
        Regina v Bugmy 
         (1990) 169 CLR 525 and may well include, in addition to a period for which supervision is prescribed, a further period during which the offender remains subject to the sanction of return to custody so as to reinforce rehabilitation and to provide protection, albeit of a more limited kind than that provided for by custody, to the community.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour departed from the statutory ratio in that case and imposed an additional term greater than one-third of the minimum term. 
       
      
    111    Under s 44 of the Procedure Act, I am required to firstly set the term of the sentence and then to set a non-parole period for that sentence. The latter is the minimum period for which the prisoner must be kept in custody in relation to the offence. The non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the Court decides there are special circumstances for it being less; s 44(2).  
     
      
    112    In the present case, I consider that there are special circumstances and I propose to specify a non-parole period which is less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence. The non-parole period I propose is itself of very great length. At the expiration of this period, should the Parole Board consider that the release of the offender to be appropriate, having regard to the principle that the public interest is of primary importance (the test provided by s 135 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999) a lengthy period of supervision would be necessary. The prisoner should also be subject to the sanction of return to custody in order to reinforce rehabilitation for an extended period. 
     
      
    113    Each of the sentences I impose will be concurrent and will commence on the date the prisoner was taken into custody, being 1 December 1998. In fixing the sentences, I have not sought to distinguish the murder of Peter Wennerbom from the other two killings. I have regard to the principle of totality; R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245.  
     
      
    114    In relation to the offence of armed robbery in company, committed upon Trang Nguyen on 20 June 1998, I note that Kenneth Frazier was found guilty at trial. He was sentenced to a minimum term of thirty-nine months imprisonment, together with an additional term of fifteen months. Mr Frazier’s criminal record discloses a lengthy history of criminal offending including sexual assaults and other offences of violence. I see no reason to distinguish between the prisoner and Mr Frazier in terms of culpability for the commission of the armed robbery offence. I bear in mind that Mr Frazier was not entitled to any discount upon a plea of guilty and that the prisoner had a criminal record at the date of the offence, somewhat less extensive than was that of Mr Frazier’s. I consider that the sentence imposed on Mr Frazier on its face to be a lenient one. The sentence I impose in relation to this offence will, having regard to considerations of parity, also be lenient. In the light of the circumstance that the prisoner stands for sentence on three counts of murder which will each attract lengthy non-parole periods, I propose decline to set a non-parole period in relation to the sentence imposed with respect to the armed robbery.  
     
      
    115    Matthew James Harris, on each of the three counts of murder, you are sentenced to imprisonment for forty years, that sentence is to be taken to have commenced on 1 December 1998. I specify a non-parole period in each case of twenty-five years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole is 30 November 2023. In relation to your conviction in respect of the armed robbery of Trang Nguyen, I sentence you to a term of three years imprisonment to date from 1 December 1998. For the reasons given I decline to set a non-parole period in respect of this offence. This sentence will expire on 30 November 2001.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
        
        
       
      
    1    GROVE J :  This is an appeal following conviction of the appellant by Flannery DCJ in the Sydney District Court on a count of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of the narcotic drug cocaine. The offence was particularized to have been committed between 1 January and 28 September 1993. 
     
      
       
      
    2    Despite a plea of guilty having been entered in the District Court, the appeal challenges conviction. Some background needs to be sketched. The appellant and a co-accused, Richards were listed to be identically indicted on 19 April 1999. Both the then accused objected to the admissibility of intended Crown evidence substantially in reliance upon principles asserted to have been articulated in judgments by the High Court in Ridgeway v The Queen 1995 184 CLR 19. Flannery DCJ embarked upon a voir dire hearing. The material placed before him was voluminous and included transcripts from inconclusive hearings. At an earlier trial, presided over by Viney DCJ, a jury failed to agree. Two further trials had commenced, presided over by Christie DCJ, but both were aborted before verdict.  
     
      
       
      
    3    Both Viney DCJ and Christie DCJ had conducted similar voir dire hearings concerning the admissibility of the Crown evidence and had ruled in favour of admissibility. On 11 May 1999 Flannery DCJ ruled that the proposed evidence would be admitted and indicated that he would publish his reasons at a later date. He did so on 27 July. However, after announcement of the ruling, the appellant was re-indicted and pleaded guilty. Richards pleaded not guilty and his trial proceeded, culminating in a verdict of guilty being returned by the jury on 7 June. On 24 November 1999, his Honour imposed sentences of twelve years imprisonment (with a minimum term of eight years) on Richards and six and a half years imprisonment (a minimum term of four years) on the appellant.  
     
      
       
      
    4    The submissions on behalf of the appellant must be examined in the context of facts.  
     
      
       
      
    5    In the course of employment for a corporation which involved some customs agency, one Modica discovered that the Australian Customs utilized a stamp which, if impressed on an invoice prior to goods being shipped, at least from the United States, signalled that the goods had been inspected at the point of export and no further inspection was required in Australia. Modica forged such a stamp. Importing contraband by means of its use was referred to as Modica’s “scheme”.  
     
      
       
      
    6    In February 1992 Modica was arrested in connection with a planned importation of a large quantity of heroin coming from Asia. At interview he mentioned to police that a person named Cluff and an associate of his, whom Modica knew as Warren, were interested in utilizing his scheme. The police suspected, correctly as it turned out, that Warren was in fact, Warren Richards. Police information was that Richards was an active criminal in a wide range of offences. Cluff’s interest in the scheme was no doubt whetted by his participation in an unsuccessful attempt in 1990 to import cocaine from the United States which had been foiled by U.S. authorities which had intercepted the narcotic shipment. 
     
      
       
      
    7    Police were interested in targeting Cluff and Richards as likely offenders and determined to utilize Modica in that regard. Necessary arrangements were made for recording conversations between Modica and Cluff. There were intermittent contacts. In June 1993 a meeting took place at which Richards introduced Cluff to the appellant who enquired at that meeting whether Modica could organize unimpeded import of cocaine from South America, (where it could be purchased more cheaply than in the United States). Cluff replied that he thought not. 
     
      
       
      
    8    Some considerable time later a further meeting took place, this time between Cluff, Modica and the appellant arising out of which it was agreed to proceed with a plan to import four kilograms of cocaine from the United States. The appellant travelled twice to that country in connection with this plan. No narcotic was obtained on the first trip in July 1993 and the appellant engaged in a “dummy run”, obviously testing the efficacy of the scheme. He obtained and despatched a pistol to Australia through a freight forwarding office in America. Authorities intervened by unpacking and photographing the weapon, altering its mechanism so as to render it incapable of discharging a bullet and then restoring the package into the transit arranged by the appellant (but under continuing surveillance).  
     
      
       
      
    9    On the second trip in September 1993 the appellant purchased what amounted to 3.2 kilograms of pure cocaine and deposited it within two cartons of coffee granules which he lodged for shipment with a freight forwarder. The parcels bore invoices which the appellant had received from Modica. The consignment was imported into Australia accordingly but intercepted and substitution made, after which delivery took place. The appellant was arrested at the place where delivery was made. 
     
      
       
      
    10    I shall refer to other facts in connection with particular submissions. 
     
      
       
      
    11    A notice of appeal dated 2 June 1999 (that is, prior to delivery of reasons by Flannery DCJ on 27 July) is with the papers although there is no indication on the face of the document as to when it was filed. Some grounds of appeal were expressed in that document but written submissions on behalf of the appellant filed 1 February 2000 enumerated propositions “concerning each of which it is suggested his Honour erred in a material respect”. These were treated by the Crown as grounds for the purposes of its written response. It is convenient to set out those paragraphs and I will also refer to them as grounds. 
     
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in his use of the ‘unwary innocent’ test as a basis, or indeed the basis, for determining that this case did not come within category one of the procurement categories identified in the leading judgment in Ridgeway. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour erred in finding the illegal police conduct did not come within the second category of Ridgeway (p.14.7). All of the evidence should have been excluded applying the principles of Ridgeway and s.138 of the Evidence Act. Summaries of established and suspected illegal and improper conduct are set out in schedule A and B hereto respectively. 
         
        
        
         
         3. His Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration, being that the actual importation of part of the cocaine into Australia by the Australian Federal Police did not constitute an element of the offence with which Bijkerk was charged. The principles of Ridgeway are not excluded from consideration for that reason. It is also noted that police imported the whole, not part, of the drugs concerned. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Likewise, the introduction of s.15X of the Crimes Act (C’th) had no bearing on the conspiracy charge. Evidence of the importation by Australian Federal Police officers was relied upon by the appellant as evidence of the illegality of the conduct of police as co-conspirators. It was not sought to exclude the importation from evidence but rather to rely upon it for the purpose of the argument. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The degree of procurement in this case is greater than in Ridgeway inasmuch as it was the police through their agent Modica who instigated the offence, not Bijkerk. In Ridgeway it was Ridgeway who initiated the offence by contacting and pursuing Lee. His Honour gave no apparent recognition to that situation. 
         
        
        
         
         6. One of the differences relied upon by his Honour in distinguishing Ridgeway was that in Bijkerk’s case, the offence was not committed by persons who would not otherwise be unlikely to commit it. His Honour seems to have not appreciated that Ridgeway initiated the importation of the drugs. Ridgeway cannot be portrayed as an ‘unwary innocent’ whatever the relevance of such a finding might be. 
         
        
        
         
         7. His Honour erred in applying the principle that ‘Courts should be cautious about impugning imaginative techniques designed to combat the resourceful apparatus of perpetrations of serious crime’ to the facts of this case. 
         
        
        
         
         8. His Honour erred in ruling that even if the facts of this matter came within the first category of Ridgeway, he would still allow the evidence in on the basis of ‘competing desirabilities’. This was a case in which a proper exercise of the public policy discretion in accordance with Ridgeway  
         and s.138 of the Evidence Act 
          required exclusion of the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         9. His Honour erred in finding that the appellant was not an ‘unwary innocent’ to the extent that this was a relevant or proper consideration in the case. There is no sufficient evidentiary basis for the making of such a finding.” 
         
        
       
      
    12    The argument on behalf of the appellant was not developed by sequential attention to these grounds but it is convenient to use them for reference and to deal first with grounds 1 and 9 which are topically associated.  
     
      
       
      
    13    An observation was made by Gleeson CJ in R v Sloane 1990 49 A Crim R 270 concerning the sale of drugs to an undercover police officer that such specific sale would never have taken place but for the activity of the relevant police officer, but that that was not sufficient to constitute a case of entrapment. His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “To use the language of an American case on the subject, ‘a line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal’  
         Sherman v The United States 
          356 US 369”. 
         
        
        
       The quotation is a precaution in pithy language rather than a formulation of a precise legal test.  
        
       
      
    14    Unlike what is apparently the position in the United States, entrapment does not offer a defence against conviction for the commission of a crime: R v Hsing 1992 25 NSWLR 685, but, where entrapment is shown to have occurred, it is not irrelevant to the conduct of a prosecution. In Ridgeway the majority judgment (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) accepted that a trial judge possesses a discretion to exclude, on public policy grounds, evidence of an offence where its commission was brought about by unlawful conduct on the part of law enforcement officers and further that such discretion existed where a criminal offence has been induced by improper, though not unlawful, conduct on the part of the authorities. Their Honours recognized the conceptual possibility that there may exist “extreme cases of creating circumstances of temptation under which a vulnerable but otherwise law abiding citizen commits an offence of a kind which (so far as the police are concerned) he or she otherwise might not have committed…..” 
     
      
       
      
    15    Their Honours specified that their references to an offence being “procured” by illegal conduct on the part of law enforcement officers were intended to refer to two distinct, but possibly overlapping, categories of case. They stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The first category consists of cases in which the police conduct has induced an accused person to commit the offence which he or she has committed. ……… The other category of case is where illegal police conduct is itself the principal offence to which the charged offence is ancillary or creates or itself constitutes an essential ingredient of the charged offence. An example of that category is a case where a person is charged with receipt or possession of stolen property in circumstances where not only the supply, but the actual theft, of the stolen property has been organized by the police for the purpose of obtaining the conviction of the person to whom it is supplied. In that category of case, the police illegality and the threat to the rule of law which it involves assume a particularly malignant aspect. Even in such a case, if the police conduct is disowned by those in higher authority and criminal proceedings have been instituted against the police as well as the accused it is unlikely that considerations of public policy relating to the integrity of the administration of criminal justice would require the exclusion of evidence either of the accused offence or of the particular element of it created by the police illegality. If, however the illegal police conduct would appear to be condoned by those in higher authority and it does not appear that criminal proceedings have been brought against the police, those considerations of public policy will be so strong that an extremely formidable case for exclusion will be raised.”  
         Ridgeway 
          @ p 39. 
         
        
       
      
    16    Senior counsel for the appellant expressly limited his challenge in the appeal to an assertion that the current circumstances fell within the second category delineated in that extract from the majority judgment in Ridgeway. It does not appear that argument was put before Flannery DCJ with such precision. There are initial obstacles to the appellant’s contention. The “controlled” importation was not a principal offence to which the appellant’s conspiracy could be regarded as ancillary, having regard to the circumstance that the appellant’s offence was complete before that activity was undertaken. Neither was that importation, nor any other police conduct, constituent of an essential ingredient in the offence charged. In making these remarks, I have of course ignored the potential effect of s15X of the Crimes Act. That said, I will proceed to deal with the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    17    The reference by Flannery DCJ to his finding that the appellant was not “an unwary innocent” appeared in the context of his judgment rejecting argument that the circumstances fulfilled the criterion specified as the first category in Ridgeway. His Honour found that there was no impropriety in the police conduct and found that Richards had shown an interest in the Modica scheme. The appellant was introduced into the scheme by Richards through Cluff. That scheme had been discussed between Cluff and Richards in its application to drug importation prior to Modica being “programmed”. His Honour noted that the appellant had two convictions for selling drugs of addiction and found that neither accused then before the Court was an “unwary innocent”. 
     
      
       
      
    18    Senior counsel submitted on behalf of the appellant that it was necessary to show that a person had a predisposition to commission of a crime of generally similar type to that charged but antecedent to it in order to be categorized as an “unwary criminal” as distinct from an “unwary innocent”. I have expressed my view that the language in the United States Supreme Court did not formulate a precise legal test but, even if it be so regarded, the appellant fails to qualify for classification as an “unwary innocent”. His prior convictions produce that result.  
     
      
       
      
    19    In his judgment Flannery DCJ relied upon, inter alia, decisions of this Court in R v Dumas unreported CCA 20 November 1995; R v Karam 1995 83 A Crim R 416; R v Salem 1997 96 A Crim R 421 and R v Coulstock 1998 99 A Crim R 143. In the course of argument senior counsel for the appellant invited this Court to depart specifically from the first three of those decisions and from a decision in R v Saleam 1999 NSW CCA 86. It might be observed that Salem was expressly applied in Coulstock. For completeness, I should ad a reference by counsel to Regina v N 1999 NSW CCA 187 which was an application for leave to appeal against sentence in which remarks concerning Ridgeway were made. 
     
      
       
      
    20    The contention of the appellant was that Flannery DCJ had misdirected himself in exercising his discretion in finding that the appellant was not an “unwary innocent” by reason of his following the principles adumbrated in the decisions from which this Court is now invited to depart. In support of the submission it was contended that the convictions of the appellant referred to by his Honour were matters relating to events decades earlier and could not provide a resource from which such a finding could be made. To approach the issue in this way, assumes that classification as either an “unwary innocent” or “unwary criminal” is a definitive legal test. Even if one assumed, to the contrary of the view which I have expressed, that it is such a test, I see no reason for placing an arbitrary time limit upon the span over which an offender’s predisposition is to be assessed.  
     
      
       
      
    21    I am unable to perceive that anything said in any of the cases referred to represents misunderstanding or misapplication of the principles of Ridgeway.  
     
      
       
      
    22    More significantly in my view, however, is the assessment of the appellant’s activity in relation to the crime itself which plainly demonstrates that his criminality is self inspired and not induced by conduct of the police. I have already observed that it was the appellant in association with Richards who approached Modica and that in his first conversation with Cluff he explored the possibility of using the mooted scheme for import from South America where the obtaining of supply of narcotic was cheaper than in the United States. The evidence further shows that it was the appellant who negotiated the financial arrangements with Modica and extracted an agreement for financial contribution from him. There is an abundance of evidence concerning conversations in which the appellant participated prior to the importation of the narcotic following his second trip to America wherein he displayed enthusiasm for the proposed venture, an intention to explore further ventures and attention to detail for avoiding possible detection. He discussed marketing strategies for the narcotic and, highly significantly, whilst in the United States he negotiated the price and purchased cocaine from his own contacts. In respect of this neither police nor Modica played any part. 
     
      
       
      
    23    Neither of these grounds is made out. 
     
      
       
      
    24    Grounds 2, 5 and 6 relate directly and indirectly to the proposition that the whole of the intended Crown evidence should be rejected in accordance with the principles outlined for the second category in Ridgeway. 
     
      
       
      
    25    As is made plain in the language of the judgment, the principles outlined are applicable where illegal police conduct is either the principal offence to which the offence charged against the accused is ancillary or where that conduct constitutes an essential ingredient of the charged offence. I have already made brief reference to this in dealing with grounds 1 and 9. 
     
      
       
      
    26    The offence charged against the appellant was conspiracy to import into Australia a commercial quantity of narcotics. The terms of the charge were that he conspired with Richards. The offence was complete once the appellant agreed with Richards to embark upon the criminal enterprise and was powerfully evidenced by the conduct of the appellant in meeting Modica and settling the terms of the agreement including financial contribution. The actual importation was not a necessary element of that offence and it was complete not only before the importation took place but before the preceding “dummy run”.  
     
      
       
      
    27    I consider that the fact that the offence was complete before the importation took place provides an insuperable obstacle to the contention by the appellant that the second category described in Ridgeway is applicable. Counsel sought to meet this obstacle by contending that the offence of conspiracy commences when the agreement is struck and continues thereafter and is therefore not completed. That proposition is unsound. The offence is complete when the agreement is struck. Evidence, particularly of subsequent overt acts, is admissible to demonstrate that such agreement has been reached between the conspirators but this does not mean that the progression of criminal activity subsequent to the agreement constitute essential ingredients of the offence charged. 
     
      
       
      
    28    The conclusions which I have reached essentially dispose of the matters raised in ground 3. It was not irrelevant for his Honour to observe that the actual importation was not an element of the offence charged and no error by his Honour is demonstrated. 
     
      
       
      
    29    Ground 4 refers to s15X of the Crimes Act (Commonwealth). This provision is a Part of the Crimes Act relating specifically to “controlled operations started before commencement of” the Part. Commencement date was 8 July 1996. In terms, the provision specifies that the fact that a law enforcement officer committed an offence in relation to the importation of narcotic goods is to be disregarded when an issue as to admissibility of evidence arises (subject to certain provisions which are not currently germane). The provision has application to an offence of conspiracy by reason of the reference to an “associated offence” to an offence contrary to s233B of the Customs Act, which in turn is defined (in s3 of the Crimes Act) to include an offence under subs 86(1) of the Crimes Act, which in its turn refers to conspiracy.  
     
      
       
      
    30    There is no real issue turning upon s15X. In the expression of ground 4 it is stated that the evidence concerning importation was not the subject of objection but rather the appellant wished to have that evidence before the Court in order to demonstrate his assertion that the law enforcement authorities were themselves offenders.  
     
      
       
      
    31    As has been pointed out the contention that police were co-conspirators encounters the obstacle that the appellant’s offence was complete upon reaching agreement to import the cocaine. Although Flannery DCJ did not deal with the matter on this basis, the evidence discloses a further difficulty in an evidentiary sense which faces the appellant. The first trip by the appellant to America (which did not result in the importation of any cocaine) was nevertheless shown to be a trip connected with intended importation. There is evidence that on the day that the appellant departed from Australia the Federal Police cabled their liaison officer in Los Angeles requesting that the Drug Enforcement Agency in America be informed that (assuming the appellant became possessed of narcotic) it was desired that he be arrested in America and that no shipment to Australia be permitted to proceed. There were other contacts between Australian and United States authorities to the same effect. The consequence is that the evidence rather than demonstrating that the police were entering into criminal conspiracy with the appellant shows that they were seeking to have him promptly arrested and dealt with according to law.  
     
      
       
      
    32    Ground 7 seeks to promote a passing remark by his Honour into a legal principle which he applied. As the terms set out in ground 7 show, ordinary reading of the comments reveal no more than a caution. His Honour’s observation was entirely compatible with others to like effect, for example, in Salem Hidden J noted that a trial judge’s observation “that the familiar investigative technique used in this case is ‘one of the more depressing by-products of the hermetically sealed drug culture’ was entirely apt”. Salem was a case of sale of narcotic to an undercover police operative posing as a purchaser. 
     
      
       
      
    33    It has already been observed that, despite the terms of ground 8, senior counsel at the hearing of the appeal expressly pressed his argument only in relation to the second category mentioned in the extract of judgment from Ridgeway above set out. There is no indication of error in his Honour’s approach to application of s138 of the Evidence Act and it was entirely consistent with the approach approved in Salem. 
     
      
       
      
    34    The appeal should be dismissed.

     REGINA v Loan Phuong LUONG 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   PRIESTLEY J: Justice Smart will give the Court’s reasons. 
    2   SMART AJ: The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the alleged inadequacy of the sentence comprising a minimum term of eight months and an additional term of two years ten months in respect of one count of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of heroin on 14 January 1999. The quantity alleged was 716.5 grams and the supply was a deemed supply. 
    3   The trial of the prisoner took place from 27 July to 6 August 1999. The Judge said: 
     
      
       
       “The Crown case accepted by the jury was that the prisoner was in joint possession of the heroin with her de facto in a car that was stopped and searched on the Hume Highway some kilometres from Albury travelling from Melbourne to Sydney. The prisoner and her de facto were resident in Melbourne and the prisoner was six months pregnant at the time. The heroin was found secreted under the back seat”. 
       
      
    4   The jury rejected her evidence and that of her husband that she was unaware of the heroin being in the car. 
    5   When searched she was found to be in possession of $12,000 and a set of electronic scales. She said that her husband had handed to her the sum mentioned at the Casino, being money which he had won.  
    6   The judge rejected the suggestion that the prisoner and her husband were only couriers. He found that their money was involved in the transaction. 
    7   The prisoner entered Australia in September 1998 for the purpose of living with the co-offender, her de facto, and later her husband. She is Vietnamese and was born on 12 December 1965. She speaks Vietnamese and Laotian but at the time of the offence and sentencing she did not speak English. The judge noted that within a few months of her arrival in Australia she was involved in the supply of heroin. 
    8   The judge found that greed was the reason for the offence but thought that it was probably her husband’s greed. She assisted him because of their relationship. He was a heavy gambler. 
    9   The judge recorded that the family relationship and any special hardship had been considered and dealt with in the sentence of the prisoner and that the judge sentencing the husband should be appraised of this. In fact, Judge Gibson subsequently sentenced the husband to a minimum term of four years six months and an additional term of one year six months.  
    10   The judge took into account that:  
     
      
       
       (a) she showed no remorse and that this was consistent with her plea of not guilty; 
        
       (b) she was unable to speak or understand English and that this would make her time in gaol more onerous. Further, her relatives are in Victoria and this would much restrict visiting;  
        
       (c) her behaviour whilst in custody had been good; and 
        
       (d) she had no prior criminal convictions. 
       
      
    11   The prisoner attended school until year 10 or 12 in Vietnam. She is the mother of three children, two from a prior marriage, one of whom, a boy aged about eight she brought with her from Vietnam. She had known her husband for some years. They had lived together in Laos prior to her coming to Australia on a visitor’s visa. Almost immediately on her arrival she became pregnant and a child was born in custody in June 1999. The prisoner was married to the co-offender in Melbourne about a month after her arrival in Australia. The child born in custody is an Australian citizen and it appears that at least her husband had residency rights if not citizenship rights.  
    12   The prisoner’s son by her prior marriage was living with her sister at the time of sentencing. The judge was informed and accepted that as the son arrived in Australia on a visitor’s visa with his mother he was unable to attend school and thereby considerably disadvantaged. The son understands only Vietnamese. 
    13   The judge took into account the report of Mr W J Taylor, psychologist. That revealed that the prisoner had become depressed. The diagnosis was of a moderately severe depressive disturbance. She had only seen her eight year old son once since her arrest and it was difficult for her to be treated because she did not speak much English. She had had no treatment or counselling since she was in gaol. The report emphasises how distressed she was at having her baby taken away from her shortly after his birth and only seeing him infrequently since. The report concludes: 
     
      
       
       “It is of concern however that she is currently feeling very depressed and it is felt that she is in need of support and therapy to assist her in coping with this. The reasons for her depression were outlined earlier. It is going to be difficult for her to receive counselling due to her lack of knowledge of the English language. Therefore any time that Mrs Luong has to spend in custody is going to be much more difficult for her than it is for the average woman. This is not merely because of language and cultural differences but also due to a lack of emotional support in this country together with the separation from her children.” 
       
      
    14   All this is readily understandable. It would be surprising if this were not so. 
    15   The judge was disturbed that after his birth the baby was almost immediately taken away from the prisoner, that she was only able to see the child twice a week and that this arrangement did not always operate properly. 
    16   The judge recorded that he had been informed that there was no provision for a woman in custody awaiting trial to keep her baby and to properly bond with the baby and that if she appealed against her conviction or sentence the same situation prevailed until the appeal was resolved. The judge directed the prosecution to inform the responsible Minister so that provision could be made for her or any other woman in the same position to have the immediate and continuous care of her new born child. 
    17   By the time of the trial the harm had been done in that the baby had been denied the solace of his mother through his early months and an opportunity to establish a good relationship with her in those days. A lot of ground had to be made up. The fact that once any appeal was finalised and the prisoner was serving her sentence the prisoner could, if approved, have the baby with her, did not meet the problem that the prisoner and her baby had been separated in the very early months. I do not think that the judge was, as the Crown suggested, under a misapprehension that the baby could not be with the mother after sentence. 
    18   The judge was also influenced by the prisoner’s husband being in gaol for a longer period and unable to offer any support or look after the children.  
    19   The judge was aware of the authorities as to when hardship to third parties, for example children, could be taken into account. He held that there were no truly exceptional circumstances but there were special circumstances. I agree that there were. This was the lady's first time in custody. The prisoner's sentence was going to be harder on her than most. There were acute problems with the children and the loss of both members of the household. The judge emphasised this. 
    20   The judge was acutely conscious of the gravity of the offence. He recommended that the prisoner be deported. He said, “...anyone that comes to this country and within months is engaged in serious crime does not deserve to be given the protection of citizenship or residency in this country”.  
    21   The Crown’s approach was that whilst the head sentence was low, it fell within the lower limit of the permissible range. The Crown contended that the minimum term was manifestly inadequate. 
    22   The minimum term expired on 13 September 1999 and she had been in custody since her arrest on 14 January 1999. She was released on 30 September 1999. Thus she spent eight and a half months in custody. She has been at liberty for six and a half months. 
    23   The Crown contended that the judge had erred in finding special circumstances. He had, it was submitted, not focused on the need for a longer than usual additional term and the consequent extended supervision. In most cases the need arose from something emanating from the prisoner and not from a need in some other party. This experienced judge dealt with the question of special circumstances concisely. He was confronted with a situation where harm had already been done. The mother was severely depressed. For her health to begin to recover the position with the baby and her eight year old son had to be substantially improved. It was not going to be easy as she would have no support from her husband who would be in gaol. Further, she would need extended support and supervision while he was in gaol. It was important that the task of restoring her health commence as soon as possible, subject to an appropriate sentence being imposed. Having presided at the trial the judge was well placed to assess the extent of her criminality and the proportion between the minimum and additional terms. 
    24   It was submitted that the judge had not adequately appreciated the effect of section 29(2)(c) of the Correctional Centres Act 1952 and the administrative arrangements which could be made. I do not agree. The judge was concerned with what had already happened. That does not mean that he was unaware of what could happen in the future. It was further submitted that the judge also attached undue weight to his recommendation for deportation and that this let him to impose too light a minimum term. I do not agree.  
    25   The judge dealt with imposing the sentence which he regarded as correct. The recommendation for deportation was a further and separate matter. For my part I would refrain from making any recommendation. Questions of breaking up the family and the husband not seeing his son would require consideration. 
    26   In the wholly unusual circumstances of this case I am not persuaded that in setting the length of the minimum term and that of the additional term the judge specified a minimum term which was manifestly inadequate. Even if I am wrong in that view I would nevertheless dismiss the appeal in the exercise of the Court’s discretion, bearing in mind that the prisoner has been at liberty for six and a half months since more than completing the minimum term of the sentence imposed.  
    27   I propose that the appeal be dismissed.  
    28   PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with the reasons given by Justice Smart. 
    29   FOSTER AJA: I agree. 
    30   PRIESTLEY J: The Court’s order then is that the appeal is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1    STEIN JA: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It seeks to challenge orders made by Moore DCJ on 21 July 1999 staying proceedings on an indictment against Glenn Paul Bucksath (the respondent). The stay was granted on the basis of an abuse of process by the Crown and was expressed to be conditional upon the payment by the Crown of the costs of the accused thrown away on an indemnity basis. 
    2    On 19 February 1999 the respondent was committed for trial on three charges alleging that he had obtained by deception cheques for one, Darren Foster, contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. There were three alternative charges under s 178BB. The trial was fixed for Monday 19 July 1999, the date having been confirmed at a mention on 9 July 1999. 
    3    On the morning of the trial the Crown Prosecutor, who had been briefed only a few days previously, indicated that he sought an adjournment. The application was made on a number of grounds. These included: 
     
      
     (a) It was necessary to issue a subpoena to the Australian Taxation Office and there had not been time to do this. 
      
      
     (b) Darren Foster had been recently charged with the same offences and was alleged to be a co-offender. It was desirable that there be a joint trial. 
      
      
     (c) There was a possibility of 100-150 new charges being laid against the respondent and some of these may be appropriate to be included in the indictment. 
      
      
     (d) There was a difficulty with some banking witnesses who had not arrived at the Court. However, this was said not to be a ‘serious’ difficulty. 
    4    Counsel for the respondent opposed the application on the basis that his client was ready to proceed and had incurred substantial legal costs, which would be thrown away if the trial was adjourned. Other reasons were advanced in opposition to the application. 
    5    In considering the adjournment application his Honour expressed concern that the accused came to the Court expecting a trial and was completely unwarned of the application for an adjournment. An adjournment would cause him considerable financial loss. 
    6    His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       … I feel that whilst I should grant the adjournment sought by the Crown, I should make it a condition that the Crown should pay the costs thrown away by today’s adjournment on an indemnity basis. 
       
      
    7    The Crown Prosecutor indicated that he would have to seek instructions on whether to give an undertaking to pay the costs thrown away. This application (for an adjournment to obtain instructions) was not opposed and his Honour adjourned the trial to Wednesday, 21 July 1999. 
    8    On 21 July 1999 the Crown informed his Honour that he declined to give the undertaking. Accordingly, his Honour should refuse the adjournment which he had previously sought. The Crown indicated that it was ready to proceed.9    Defence counsel described the Crown’s behaviour as ‘outrageous’ and as an abuse of process of the Court. He submitted that the proceedings should be stayed until such time as the Crown agreed to pay the costs of the 19th, 20th and 21st July and for preparation thrown away. The Crown opposed the stay. His Honour adjourned to read R v Beeby (1999) 104 A Crim R 142. 
    10    When his Honour returned to the Court, the Crown made an application. He asked for an adjournment with a view to seeking to join the charges against the respondent up with charges against Darren Foster. He offered to pay the respondent’s costs of Monday, 19 July and Wednesday, 21 July 1999. Respondent’s counsel obtained instructions but later reiterated his application for a stay on the same conditional basis referred to earlier. 
    11    In giving reasons his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       I had difficulty in seeing how that does not amount to an attempt to negotiate with the Court. Either there is a recognition that the accused has been put to costs which he should not have been required to incur, he being privately funded, and they being substantial costs, or the accused has not to express its position in that way whilst one may semantically weave a logically cohesive basis for it strikes me as avoiding the basis of the true justice which underlies the present position.  
       
      
    12    His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
       I find the present position most unsatisfactory, especially where it is one which could have been cured had there been a more reasonable approach adopted by the Crown in regard to meeting the accused’s legitimate claim to be paid for costs thrown away.  
       
      
    13    Because of his Honour’s concern for the position of the respondent, his Honour gave his counsel a choice. One, if the respondent wanted his trial to proceed that day, a costs order in his favour could not be made because the District Court had no power to do so. Two, the trial would be adjourned on the undertaking of the Crown to pay two days costs. Three, counsel be given the opportunity to seek ‘a more extensive stay of proceedings’. 
    14    Counsel for the respondent reiterated that he sought a stay of proceedings conditional upon the payment of the respondent’s costs of Monday, 19 July and Tuesday, 20 July 1999. 
    15    His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
       I will grant a stay of proceedings on the indictment which is to run until the Crown either pays or undertakes to pay the costs of the accused of Monday and Tuesday. The reason behind that is because for all the matters which I have stated earlier today there has been an abuse of process which entails both a failure by the Crown to be, which entails all the matters regarding the inefficient preparation and cognate matters by the Crown and its, and the Crown’s approach to the question of costs. If that undertaking is given before 1.30 today then the trial can commence at 2 o’clock otherwise at 2 o’clock I will simply stand the matter out of today’s list.  
       
      
    16    The luncheon adjournment was then taken and when the Court resumed, the Crown indicated that it was in a position to undertake to pay two days costs but only on the basis of an adjournment. Counsel for the respondent then asked for a stay of proceedings until such time the Crown pays ‘the entire costs thrown away and not simply two days’ see Appeal Book 40 (lines 45 - 48). 
    17    His Honour proceeded to deliver a further judgment. He noted the position taken by the Crown. In the circumstances, he felt that the stay should continue. He further noted the respondent’s application that the Crown pay the costs thrown away by the adjournment. He said that he would stay the proceedings ‘conditional only on the Crown paying the costs thrown away by the trial not proceeding on Monday’. He added that the stay was on the basis of the abuse of process which ‘runs through to today so the costs … include the costs of today’, that is, 21 July. Counsel for the respondent asked that the costs mentioned be paid on an indemnity basis. His Honour acceded to this application. The Crown then asked for formal reasons to be published by his Honour. His Honour agreed but they do not appear to have been forthcoming, so far as we are aware. 
    18    We do not have before us any formal order staying the proceedings and I have to say that I am at a loss to know precisely what were the terms of the stay ordered by his Honour. It is by no means clear to me what is comprised in the Crown ‘paying the costs thrown away by the trial not proceeding on Monday’ (July 19). The later remarks indicate that it was to include the costs of July 21 and, later still remarks, indicate that they were to be indemnity costs. Nonetheless, the terms of the stay are unclear and uncertain. It is not apparent what the Crown is to do in order to satisfy the conditions of the stay so as to have it lifted and the trial proceed. 
    19    The Crown argues that there was no abuse of process. Reliance is placed on Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23 and Walton v Gardiner (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378. Counsel for the Crown suggest a narrow concept of abuse of process confined to the institution of proceedings for an improper purpose or the continuance of proceedings ‘foredoomed to fail’. In my opinion, this is not justified by a reading of Jago. In particular, Mason CJ made it plain that the power to prevent an abuse of process was derived from the public interest that trials are conducted fairly and proceed without unreasonable delay, (see p 30). 
    20    At 31 Mason CJ said: 
     
      
       
       Once it is recognized that the courts may order that criminal proceedings be stayed for the purpose of preventing injustice to the accused caused by undue delay, it necessarily follows that other orders may be made in cases of undue delay for that purpose. There is no reason to confine the discretionary power of the courts by arbitrarily stipulating that a stay is the only proper remedy for undue delay. A second and related point may also be made. In appropriate cases, orders may be made to prevent injustice notwithstanding that there is no reason to suspect that the actual trial, when held, will not be fair. Thus orders may be directed to ensuring fairness in pre-trial procedures; in particular, a court may order that a trial be expedited where it sees the delay as warranting such action but not as being of such a kind as to justify staying the proceedings. 
       
      
      
     See also the judgments of Deane J and Gaudron J. 
      
    21    In R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735 the Court of Criminal Appeal held that while the District Court had no power to grant an adjournment subject to the Crown paying costs, it could stay proceedings until costs thrown away by an adjournment were paid.22    In Mosely two orders were involved. Johnston DCJ had granted an adjournment to the Crown but ordered it to pay certain costs of the accused. Later, Herron DCJ granted a stay of proceedings until the costs ordered by Johnston DCJ were paid. Johnston DCJ had no power to make the order for costs. Thus, that order had to be set aside. Gleeson CJ continued that: 
     
      
       
       However, the fact that Herron DCJ’s order staying proceedings was based upon an incorrect premise (the validity of the order of Johnston DCJ) does not necessarily mean that this Court would intervene to set it aside. As was observed, Johnston DCJ could, in all probability, have achieved what he set out to achieve by a different method; he could have told the Crown he would not grant an adjournment unless the Crown agreed to compensate the respondent for the costs wasted. The assumption that he had power to protect the respondent from unfairness by making an order for costs was apparently important to his Honour’s conclusion that the interests of justice dictated the granting of the adjournment. Although his Honour acted beyond jurisdiction the Crown until recently took no appropriate steps to challenge his order. The Crown is still either unable or unwilling to explain that delay or the subsequent delay in appealing against the order made by Herron DCJ. Even though Johnston DCJ took a technically incorrect course, the consideration that motivated him has not been shown to be wrong. The adjournment which the Crown asked for and obtained would, in the particular circumstances, have caused unfair prejudice to the respondent unless the respondent could by some means be given protection in respect of costs. Bearing in mind the public interest considerations that apply to criminal proceedings, there may well be room for debate in many cases as to whether, when a Crown witness becomes unexpectedly unavailable, the interests of justice require that a trial should proceed unless an accused can be compensated for costs thrown away.  
       
      
    23    The Court exercised its discretionary power to modify the invalid order staying the proceedings by providing that the stay be until the costs thrown away as a result of the adjournment granted by Johnston DCJ be paid by the Crown. 
    24    R v Seebag (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 February 1993, unreported) is another case where a judge adjourned a trial on the application of the Crown and ordered it to pay the accused’s costs of the day. It was further ordered that the proceedings be stayed until the costs were paid. Following Mosely, James J found that the order for costs made by the judge was without power and invalid. It followed that the stay was also invalid unless the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to its powers under s 5F(5), and in the special circumstances, ordered a stay until the costs of 20 August 1992, thrown away by reason of the adjournment, were paid by the Crown. James J considered that this was a case where the Court should make a similar order to Mosely. 
    25    His Honour added some general remarks, which I think are useful as guidance to trial courts. He said: 
     
      
       
       If in the District Court the Crown applies for an adjournment of a trial and the application is opposed by the accused the court can, of course, in a proper case either simply grant the adjournment or simply refuse the adjournment. The Court can in a proper case ask the Crown to agree voluntarily to pay any costs of the accused which would be thrown away if the application for an adjournment is granted. If the Crown will not agree to pay those costs, that will be a factor which the District Court judge should take into account, along with all the other relevant factors, in deciding whether to grant the application by the Crown for an adjournment. However, there will be occasions where the requirements of justice are such that notwithstanding that the Crown is not willing voluntarily to pay the costs, the application by the Crown for an adjournment should be granted.  
        
       
      
    26    Hunt CJ at CL agreed with James J. So did Smart J, although his Honour added an obiter comment: 
     
      
       
       I desire to reserve my opinion on the question whether a judge of the District Court may grant an adjournment on the basis that there will be a stay of proceedings pending payment of the costs of an accused. There is a neat question as 
         
       to whether that is tantamount to an order that the Crown pay the costs of the accused. The alternative view is that the Crown has to decide whether it wishes to proceed. If so, it proceeds after it has paid the costs. If it does not wish to pay the costs it simply does not proceed further. The Crown decides whether it will or will not pay the costs. There is no order that it do so.  
       
      
    27    In R v Beeby leave to appeal was sought in relation to a refusal of a judge to stay proceedings until certain costs of the accused were paid by the Crown. Dunford J (with whom Powell JA and Dowd J agreed) held that his Honour had no power to make an order for costs, either as such, or as a term of a stay of the proceedings. No undertaking had been sought from the Crown to pay the costs. 
    28    Turning to the instant case, as I mentioned earlier there is considerable confusion as to the terms of the stay ordered by his Honour. The stay, insofar as I have been able to understand it, contains uncertainties, which is patently undesirable. It also appears to be wider than was justified by the unfairness to the respondent caused by the actions of the Crown. To my thinking, the appropriate stay should have been in accordance with the undertaking offered by the Crown on 21 July to pay the respondent’s costs of 19 and 21 July 1999 if the trial was adjourned, which his Honour appeared to accept. The payment of two days costs seems, in all of the circumstances, to be reasonable. I see no reason why costs should be on an indemnity basis. The conduct in question is not such as to justify indemnity costs. 
    29    During the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Crown, who is not the same counsel who appeared for the Crown before his Honour, indicated as a fall-back position, that the undertaking offered to Moore DCJ be reiterated and stand. As I have indicated, it seems to me that that is the appropriate term of the stay. 
    30    Because of what I have said above, I believe that it is appropriate to vary the stay order made by his Honour. I would propose that the appeal be upheld in part and the order made by Moore DCJ on 21 July 1999 be varied to provide that the stay of proceedings on the indictment be until the costs of 19 and 21 July 1999 be paid to the respondent by the Crown; such costs to be agreed, or failing agreement, to be in such amount as is assessed by a judge of the District Court. 
    31    DUNFORD J: I agree with the orders proposed for the reasons given by Stein JA. However, as I wrote the principal judgment in Beeby, it is desirable that I say how I see this case is distinguishable from that one. In Beeby at [26] - [27] I noted that no undertaking had been sought by the applicant’s counsel from the Crown to pay the applicant’s costs and went on: 
     
      
       
       If he had, in the light of  
       Mosely  
       the judge could have taken the Crown’s response into account in considering whether to grant the application; and if such undertaking had been given and not complied with, semble that would have justified a stay of proceedings until that undertaking was fulfilled … But no undertaking was sought nor given, and his Honour had no power to make an order for costs either as such, nor as a term of the grant of leave. Consequently he had no power to stay the proceedings until the costs were paid ... 
       
      
    32    I adhere to what I there said but I consider this case is distinguishable in that the question of costs having been raised on the Monday, on Wednesday, 21 July the Crown took the attitude envisaged in Mosely, that it would not pay any costs, go without the adjournment and proceed forthwith. But later that day the Crown took an alternative position, namely, that it would undertake to pay two days costs if the case was adjourned. The case was adjourned. 
    33    The Crown having offered the undertaking to pay the costs as a term of the adjournment, the case is distinguishable from Beeby and I am satisfied that the judge had power to grant the stay in such terms as to give effect to the Crown’s undertaking.  
    34    SIMPSON J: I agree with the presiding judge and I also agree with Dunford J. 
    35    STEIN JA: The orders are as I have indicated in the closing remarks of my reason for judgment.

      Regina v Aigailetai POUOA 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1    STEIN JA: Before the Court are two appeals by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by Goldring DCJ on the respondents, Jade Hoon and Aigailetai Pouoa. 
    2    On 10 February 2000 his Honour sentenced each offender to a minimum term of 8 months imprisonment and an additional term of 6 months, a total sum of 14 months. In the case of Ms Hoon, the minimum term expired on 27 February 2000, she having been in custody since 28 June 1999. In the case of Ms Pouoa, her custody commenced on 29 June 1999 and the minimum term expired on 28 February 2000. 
    3    Both respondents had pleaded guilty to a charge of ‘ongoing supply of prohibited drug’ pursuant to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for an offence under the section is 3500 penalty points or 20 years imprisonment, or both. 
    4    The Crown served a Notice of Appeal on Ms Hoon on 27 February 2000 and Ms Pouoa on 28 February 2000. Ms Pouoa was released to parole at the end of her minimum term. Ms Hoon was also released to parole at the conclusion of her minimum term but later, so it seems, she was arrested and charged on other matters. She is back in custody in relation to these additional matters unconnected with the subject offence. The Court is unaware as to whether her parole may be revoked or otherwise. 
    5    Two other related persons were sentenced by Goldring DCJ at or about the same time. Mr Surita Rojanavong was sentenced on 10 February 2000 to 8 months imprisonment to commence on 22 June 1999. At the conclusion of his sentence, he was deported to Thailand. Mr Mathew Shrubb was sentenced to 11 months imprisonment to commence on 13 July 1999 and an additional term of 6 months. 
    6    On 9 March a Mr Con Karamitsios was also convicted of an offence under s 25A(1). The supply in his case involved five occasions within the 30 consecutive days mentioned in the section. Other offences were taken into account on his sentencing. These included possess heroin, possess cocaine, goods in custody, supply heroin and possess heroin. 
    7    He was sentenced to a minimum term of 9 months with an additional term of 2 years and 3 months. In respect of Mr Karamitsios, the Court has been informed that there has been no Crown appeal. 
    8    The charges against the present respondents arose in the following circumstances. 
    9    In March 1999 police received information that a large-scale heroin distribution network was operating within the Kings Cross area. Inquiries identified the principal organiser of the network. It was established that he employed two middle level managers, a street level manager and a group of eight ‘runners’ who distributed the heroin on the street. 
    10    These persons were selling ‘quarter weights’ (0.25g) of heroin on a daily basis, for $80 each. 
    11    The method employed was that each ‘runner’ was supplied five quarter weight deals of heroin at a time after contacting the street level manager. That manager then contacted the middle level manager and this person attended a pre-arranged location, met the ‘runner’ and replenished the supply of five street deals. The ‘runner’ would hand the middle level manager cash to the amount of $350 which was derived from the previous sales. Any amount over $350 was kept by the ‘runner’ as payment. 
    12    The respondents were identified as ‘runners’ for the network and they were not allowed to attend the safe house run by the middle management. 
    13    The respondent, Ms Hoon, was approached by an undercover police officer at Kings Cross on 21 June 1999 and she supplied him with an orange balloon cap of heroin for $80. The drug weighed 0.25g. She was arrested on 28 June 1999 and took part in an ERISP wherein she admitted that she had been selling heroin for about 3 months. She herself was addicted to heroin and occasionally used part of what she was selling. She gave the proceeds to the street level manager, except for $10 from each sale which she kept. She said that as at 21 June 1999 she had not been working for the street level manager and must have been dealing on her own behalf. 
    14    The respondent, Ms Pouoa, was approached by undercover police on 16 June 1999 at Kings Cross. She supplied him with a blue balloon cap of heroin for $80. Later that day the same officer brought another cap from her for $80. On 22 June 1999 another undercover officer purchased a cap of heroin from her for $80. She was arrested on 28 June 1999 and took part in an ERISP, wherein she admitted to selling heroin every few days for $80 per deal retaining $10 for herself. 
    15    The Crown submits that the sentence imposed on each respondent is manifestly inadequate and that his Honour gave insufficient weight to general deterrence and excessive weight to subjective considerations. 
    16    It is submitted on behalf of the Crown that the objective seriousness of the offences are high and, in each case, the sentence does not reflect the objective criminality. The respondents participated in an ongoing systematic distribution of heroin. A significant factor in the objective seriousness is said to be the ongoing nature and commercialisation of the operation rather than the actual amounts of heroin distributed. It has to be said, it seems to me, that the sentences are, prima facie, very lenient ones.17    Section 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act came into operation on 7 August 1998. It provides that a person who, on 3 or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days, supplies a prohibited drug (other than cannabis) for financial or material reward is guilty of an offence. Because the offence is so new, no helpful Judicial Commission sentencing statistics are, as yet, available. 
    18    In Ms Hoon’s ERISP she was cooperative with the police and named the middle level manager who supplied her with the drugs. She said that she had been working on and off for him since March 1999. She was charged with supplying heroin on three separate occasions between 1 June 1999 and 28 June 1999. Apart from the one supply to the undercover officer on 21 June, some of the answers in the ERISP were equivocal and ambiguous leading his Honour to observe that she would not have been charged with this offence had she not been totally frank with the police. It was on the basis of her admissions that she was charged with a breach of s 25A(1). While there was no direct evidence of three separate supplies during the period charged, she pleaded guilty and her plea admitted the supply alleged in the charge. 
    19    Turning to the objective seriousness of the offence in respect of Ms Hoon, the Crown relies on the ongoing nature and commercialism of the operations, rather than the amounts involved. However, the amount of drugs supplied is still relevant, as is the number of times the drug was supplied during the relevant period. Here, the amount of heroin supplied on any one occasion was 0.25g. Three occasions are specified in the charge within the period mentioned. It is to this offence that she pleaded guilty, even though her ERISP may have admitted to other earlier acts of supply. 
    20    As to the commercialisation of the operation, it is plain that Ms Hoon was not in any way involved in the administration of the organisation. She did not receive any real profit from the commercialisation. The seriousness of being involved in an organisation concerned with the distribution of drugs must be acknowledged, as his Honour did. Nonetheless, both Ms Hoon and Ms Pouoa were ‘runners’ on the lowest rung of culpability. 
    21    Turning to the subjective circumstances of Ms Hoon, there is an obvious and direct link between her addiction and the offence. The offence was not committed purely for monetary gain. She was 19 years old and her age and addiction placed her in a vulnerable situation. His Honour observed that these factors appeared to have led her (and also Pouoa) into being recruited into a sophisticated distribution operation. 
    22    Ms Hoon gave evidence about her background which his Honour found to be frank. Her difficult background was outlined. Her parents separated when she was three. She was assaulted by her step-father and went to live with her father when she was 13 years. She started using drugs when very young and has a record for a number of drug-related matters. This was, however, her first time in prison. She was frank with his Honour about her difficulty in dealing with her drug problem and, perhaps with refreshing honesty, could not promise to overcome her addiction. His Honour was entitled to find that there was some ‘possible chances of rehabilitation’ and to find ‘special circumstances’, as he did. 
    23    A pre-sentence report was also before his Honour. It was not in our appeal papers but has been handed to the Court. The report corroborates a deal of Ms Hoon’s evidence to his Honour and does not assist in her opportunity for rehabilitation. 
    24    Bearing in mind the facts upon which Ms Hoon was sentenced, her cooperation with police, her subjective circumstances and her plea of guilty, I do not see that the sentence has been shown to be manifestly inadequate. It is necessary for the Crown to demonstrate an error in sentencing principle. See Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293, Malvaso v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 227 and Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295. 
    25    I can see no error in principle. His Honour gave appropriate weight to general deterrence. Recently in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, Spigelman CJ noted the difficulties of Crown appeals succeeding where no particular error can be identified in the sentencing process and the Crown relies on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as the basis for the conclusion of some error in principle. 
    26    Another factor which I take into account in relation to both respondents, is a justifiable sense of grievance that they may have on being re-committed to prison. This arises from circumstances relating to two other ‘runners’ whom I have already mentioned. The defendant Rojanavong was sentenced to an 8 months fixed term by his Honour at the same time that the sentences on these respondents were imposed. It seems that his Honour did this because Mr Rojanavong was a Thai national and was to be deported, which has in fact occurred. However, he was also 19 years of age, around about the same age as these two respondents, and he was a ‘runner’ in the same organisation in similar circumstances to these respondents. He was not given any additional term of imprisonment. 
    27    The other matter of concern in relation to a sense of grievance relates to the defendant Con Karamitsios, who was also a ‘runner’, and in relation to whom I have mentioned was sentenced on 9 March 2000 to a minimum term of 9 months and an additional term of 2 years and 3 months. He was 25 years at the time - quite a deal older than these respondents - and the offence under s 25A(1) with which he was charged related to the supply on 5 occasions within the stipulated period. As I have mentioned, he also had a number of other offences which were taken into account. He has been released to parole following the serving of his minimum term and, importantly, has not been the subject of any Crown appeal. 
    28    To summarise, I do not think that the Crown has demonstrated any manifest inadequacy in the sentence or error of principle in relation to Ms Hoon. Further, one must not lose sight of the element of double jeopardy involved in Crown appeals. As I have mentioned, both respondents have now served their minimum terms. 
    29    I would dismiss the Crown appeal regarding the respondent Ms Hoon. 
    30    Turning to the respondent, Ms Pouoa, similar considerations apply. Her position is, to some extent, factually different to that of Ms Hoon. She supplied 0.25g of heroin to undercover police on three occasions between 16 and 22 June 1999. Like Ms Hoon, she was a ‘runner’ engaged in street sales. She was aged 18 years at the time and had become an addict at the age of 17 years. Feeding her drug habit was the principle reason for her participation in the organisation. 
    31    In terms of subjective considerations, while addiction is no excuse for supplying drugs, the offence was not for greed but doubtless to feed her habit. While the prospect of conviction, given the evidence, was probable, her plea of guilty and admissions should be given weight. 
    32    His Honour also had the benefit of a pre-sentence report and a report from a psychologist, both of which supported her prospects of rehabilitation. 
    33    The reports reveal that the respondent Ms Pouoa’s father died when she was aged 8 and she was raised by her mother alone in circumstances of considerable hardship. She was young and immature and subject to negative peer pressures which contributed to her entering the drug culture. There was a suggestion in the psychologist’s report which indicated a rebellion on her part against a very strict religious upbringing. She had not been to prison before and had two previous convictions for possessing drugs. His Honour found ‘special circumstances’, especially relating to her youth and concluded that her sentence should be the same as imposed on Ms Hoon. 
    34    Again, I do not see that his Honour committed any error of principle and I am satisfied the Crown has not demonstrated the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. In my opinion, the sentence was within his Honour’s discretion and this Court ought not intervene.  
    35    In both of these cases there was a substantial delay in sentencing the respondents while they remained in custody. This resulted in the respondents completing their minimum terms prior to the hearing of the Crown appeals. A re-committal to prison after seven weeks on parole for the respondent Ms Pouoa, heightened in the case of a youthful offender, may prejudice her prospects of rehabilitation. These facts would lead me, assuming I had found the sentence to be manifestly inadequate, to decline to intervene, see R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561. 
    36    I propose that the Crown appeal regarding the respondent Ms Pouoa also be dismissed.37    DUNFORD J: I agree that the Crown appeals should be dismissed in each case, but I do not agree that his Honour's Remarks on Sentence disclose no error of principle and, in my view, the sentences were demonstrably inadequate. 
    38    Section 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (1985) was introduced in 1998 following a recommendation of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. It was submitted that Miss Hoon was charged with only three instances of supplying small amounts, but, in my view, s 25A involves more than that, and the objective criminality of offences under that section is considerably greater than the supply on three or more occasions. 
    39    The section is directed to the concepts of repetition, system and organisation, and the objective criminality of any offence under the section should be determined by reference to those features, and not merely to the number and quantities of individual instances of supply. As pointed out in the Minister's Second Reading Speech in relation to the relevant legislation, the section is designed to:  
     
      
       
       "" ... target dealers who have organised their forces in such a way as to limit the full effect of the  
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
        . . . "" 
       
      
     He went on: 
      
       
       ""The amount of drugs which are supplied is immaterial to an offence under section 25A, either within each individual offence or in total."" 
       
      
    40    Obviously the section is primarily directed to those persons higher up the organisation than the respondents in this case, but the section is wide enough to cover ""runners"" such as the respondents, who can fairly be described as ""retail couriers"". 
    41    Distribution networks cannot operate without those at the lowest levels and those persons play an essential part in the operation, albeit, a lesser role than those higher up in the organisation. Accordingly, offences under the section, even by persons fulfilling the functions performed by the respondents in this case, must be regarded as more serious than offences under s 25. 
    42    In my view, the sentences imposed in these cases were manifestly inadequate and his Honour failed to pay significant regard to the objective seriousness of the offences and to general deterrence. In the light of the small additional terms imposed, I also consider that his Honour, although correctly finding special circumstances existed, failed to have sufficient regard to rehabilitation. In my opinion, both the minimum and the additional terms should have been significantly greater. 
    43    However, the Court's power to uphold Crown appeals is discretionary. I have regard to the sentences imposed on other offenders at the same level, particularly Mr Rojanavong, Con Karamitsios and Mathew Shrubb, although I understand there is a Crown appeal in relation to Shrubb listed for hearing in June, and consider that these respondents would have a justifiable sense of grievance if their sentences were increased.  
    44    In addition, both have completed their sentences, although Miss Hoon has since been returned to custody on a remand in relation to another matter. To be released in February and returned to custody in April without any allegation that she has failed to abide by the terms of her parole and without any allegation that she has committed any other offence would impose considerable hardship on Miss Pouoa.  
    45    Another difficulty in the case is that, from the material available to his Honour at the time, the prospects of rehabilitation in relation to Miss Pouoa appeared considerable better than those in relation to Miss Hoon, but Miss Hoon has provided more additional information to the police relating to co-offenders, and was not charged with as many individual acts of supply.  
    46    Balancing these considerations created problems of their own, and ultimately the learned Crown Prosecutor has submitted today that they should both be treated the same. It is for these reasons that I agree the Crown appeal should be dismissed in each case.  
    47    SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed but again, I take a slightly different approach. 
    48    In the case of Miss Pouoa, it was proper for the sentencing judge to take account of and give considerable weight to the strong evidence of rehabilitation, having particular regard to her youth, notwithstanding the serious nature of the offence. That evidence justified the judge in taking what would otherwise have been an unusually lenient course. such a course was in the interests not only of Miss Pouoa but also of the community in effecting her rehabilitation. 
    49    This was a case in which it was open to the Judge to conclude that her prospects of rehabilitation deserved greater weight than the community’s demands for retribution or of general deterrence. 
    50    For those reasons, I agree with the presiding judge that the sentence imposed of Miss Pouoa was not manifestly inadequate. 
    51    Miss Hoon’s circumstances were different. There was absolutely no evidence of any prospect of rehabilitation. Indeed, as I read the evidence given by her - and of course I do not have the advantage of anything other than the words on the page - she showed no sign of having any real wish to overcome her heroin addiction. That produces a grim prospect of rehabilitation such that rehabilitation could not seriously have been regarded as an issue. That would have justified the sentencing judge in taking a different approach in relation to her sentence. 
    52    However, there were other factors, including questions of parity, that operated in her favour. I doubt that, having regard to what I have said about rehabilitation, parity alone would have justified the sentence that was ultimately imposed on Miss Hoon, but there was also the significant effect of her plea of guilty, her youth, and the matters referred to by the others members of the Bench. 
    53    I indicate to the view that, notwithstanding all of those matters, the sentence at the time it was imposed was manifestly inadequate but in the exercise of discretion in relation to Miss Hoon I would dismiss the Crown appeal. 
    54    STEIN JA: Accordingly, the orders of the Court are that both appeals be dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
    1   HULME J: The court orders that there be no publication of any part of these proceedings in a fashion which will serve to identify the complainant or her children, and in particular, orders that in any publication of these proceedings, the applicant can be referred to as ""CJB"" 2   CARRUTHERS AJ: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Job QC at the Newcastle District Court on 29 October 1998. 3   The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to an indictment containing eight counts. Counts 1-7 were under Section 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 - sexual intercourse with a child between ten and 16 years by a person in authority. This offence carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for ten years. 4   The eighth count was under Section 73 of the Act - carnal knowledge by a stepfather. This carries a maximum sentence of eight years penal servitude. The eight counts cover the period from 14 September 1987 to 18 May 1993. 5   The complainant was born on 27 January 1977 and accordingly the offences range over the period from age 10 to 16 years. 6   In relation to the eighth count, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of three years penal servitude to commence on 24 August 1998 (the day upon which he was ultimately taken into custody having pleaded guilty) and to expire on 23 August 2001. 7   In relation to counts 1-7, his Honour imposed a minimum term of four years penal servitude to commence on 24 August 2001 and to expire on 23 August 2005. His Honour imposed an additional term of three years to commence on 24 August 2005 and to expire on 23 August 2008. 8   The applicant was born on 5 December 1958 and was accordingly 39 years of age at the date of sentence. 9   The applicant commenced having a relationship with the complainant's mother in late 1976 and they eventually married on 20 August 1977. The complainant was born, as I have indicated on 27 January 1977 as the result of a relationship between her mother and a person other than the applicant. Thus as from 20 August 1977 the applicant became the complainant's stepfather. Four children resulted from the marriage between the applicant and the complainant's mother. 10   The applicant and his family lived in various locations in New South Wales throughout the relationship. These locations included Newcastle, Sydney and the mid-north coast of New South Wales. 11   The complainant always referred to the applicant as ""Dad"". 12   The complainant erroneously believed until she was twelve years of age that the applicant was her biological father. When the complainant was about twelve years of age the applicant and the complainant's mother separated. The marriage was subsequently dissolved. 13   The complainant then remained with her mother who is alleged to have been very violent towards her. Eventually the complainant moved into the same residence as the applicant. 14   By consent a statement of facts was tendered before his Honour under the hand of Senior Constable Muxlow dated 29 September 1998. It is convenient to set that report out verbatim:  
     
      
       
       ""Offence No 1: Sexual intercourse with child between 10 and 16 years by person in authority. 
        
         
        
       On or about 14 September 1987 the prisoner and his family moved to the Smithtown area, near Kempsey. Sometime between 14 September 1987 and 14 February 1989 
        
       During this period the prisoner entered the victim's bedroom and removed his son, Kenneth from the bed. He then removed all his clothing and all of the victim's clothing. At this time the prisoner got into bed with the victim. 
        
         
        
       The prisoner has then placed his penis into the vagina and moved his penis in and out for some period of time. The prisoner has then had the victim turn over so she was laying on her stomach. The prisoner has again placed his penis into the victims vagina from the rear. The prisoner removed his penis from the victim's vagina prior to ejaculating onto the bed sheets. The prisoner later changed those sheets. 
        
         
        
       At the time of this incident the victim was a student at Smithtown Public School and was aged somewhere between 10 and 11 years of age. Also during this period the victim's mother would regularly travel to Sydney for work as a prostitute leaving the prisoner in charge of the children. 
        
         
        
       Offence No 2: Sexual intercourse with child aged between 10 and 16 years by person in authority. 
        
         
        
       Sometime between 14 February 1989 and 21 May 1989 the prisoner and his family moved to a house in Albert Street, South Kempsey. The victim recalls this incident occurring shortly prior to a school excursion to the Canberra area. 
        
         
        
       The prisoner has laid down next to the victim on a bed. The prisoner removed the victim's underwear, leaving her dressed only in a nightie. The prisoner has commenced to touch the victim on the breasts and vagina. The prisoner has then placed his penis inside the victim's vagina. After an unknown amount of time the prisoner has ejaculated inside the victim's vagina. 
        
         
        
       At the time of this incident the victim was 12 years of age and a student in year 6 at Kempsey South Public School. 
        
         
        
       Offence No 3: Sexual intercourse with child aged between 10 and 16 years by person in authority. 
        
         
        
       Sometime between 14 February 1989 and 30 May 1989 whilst living in the same house in Albert Street, South Kempsey the prisoner took the victim into his bedroom and laid the victim onto his waterbed. This occurred whilst the victim's mother was in Kempsey hospital. He removed all of the victim's clothing and his own clothing, except for his socks. The prisoner commenced to touch the victim on the breasts and the vagina with his hands. He has placed his penis into the victim's vagina for an unknown period of time. The prisoner has removed his penis from the victim's vagina and masturbated himself until ejaculating on the victim's stomach. 
        
         
        
       At the time of this incident the victim was 12 years of age. 
        
         
        
       Offence No 4: Sexual intercourse with child aged between 10 and 16 years by person in authority. 
        
         
        
       Sometime between 31 December 1989 and 1 March 1990 the prisoner and his family were living at Lauchlan Street, Kempsey. The prisoner has woken the victim from her sleep and asked her to go to the lounge room. After a cup of coffee the prisoner sat on a lounge chair and removed his penis from his pants. He has forced the victim to suck his penis by holding the back of her head. The victim's mother then walked from her bedroom and caused the prisoner to cover his penis with his shirt. The incident ceased prior to the victim's mother entering the room. The victim returned to her bed and went to sleep. 
        
         
        
       At the time of this incident the victim was either 12 or 13 years of age. 
        
         
        
       Offence No 5: Sexual intercourse with child aged between 10 and 16 years by person in authority. 
        
        
       Sometime between 26 January 1991 and 1 January 1992 the prisoner and his wife separated. The victim left the home with the prisoner. During this period the prisoner and victim moved into a house in Inches Road, Kempsey with people known and Lou and Pauline. During this time the victim awoke to find the prisoner on top of her and had his penis inside her vagina. The prisoner ejaculated inside the victim's vagina. 
        
         
        
       At the time of this incident the victim was 14 years of age. 
        
         
        
       Offence No 6: Sexual intercourse with child aged between 10 and 16 years by person in authority. 
        
         
        
       Sometime between the period of 18 February 1992 and 31 March 1992 the prisoner and victim were living at the Southside Caravan Park. The victim awoke one night during this period to find the prisoner on top of her and he had his penis inside her vagina. The prisoner removed his penis after and unknown period of time and ejaculated on the victim's stomach. 
        
         
        
       At the time of this incident the victim was 15 years of age. 
        
         
        
       Offence No 7: Sexual intercourse with child aged between 10 and 16 years by person in authority. 
        
         
        
       Sometime during the period of 3 March 1992 and 15 April 1992 the prisoner and the victim were living alone in firstly the Southside Caravan Park, Kempsey and then the Macleay Valley Caravan Park, South West Rocks. Sometime during this period the prisoner had sexual intercourse with the victim which caused the victim to fall pregnant. The victim gave birth to a baby named A on 7 January 1993 at Port Macquarie Hospital. 
        
         
        
       The age of the victim at the time of the incident was 15 years of age. 
        
         
        
       Offence No 8: Carnal knowledge by stepfather. 
        
         
        
       Sometime between the period of 6 May 1993 and 18 May 1993 the prisoner and victim were living alone at Mareeba Crescent, Port Macquarie or Church Street, Port Macquarie. Sometime during this period the prisoner had sexual intercourse with the victim which resulted in the victim falling pregnant. The victim gave birth to B on 16 February 1994. 
        
         
        
       At the time of this incident the victim was 16 years of age and did not consent to having sexual intercourse with the prisoner. 
        
         
        
       This relationship continued between the prisoner and the victim until around 1 December 1996. As a result of this relationship the victim had two further children named C born at Belmont Hospital on 3 May 1995 and D born in Queensland on 14 October 1996. 
        
         
        
       About 9.00 am on Friday, 14 February 1997 the prisoner was arrested by police at B and Z Smash Repairs at Boolaroo. The prisoner was escorted to Wallsend Police Station and then to Mayfield Police Station as the interview room was occupied. The prisoner was electronically interviewed and denied the offences. He was then charged with the matters now before the court."" 
        
       
      
    15   The applicant ultimately admitted his guilt in respect of all counts, however despite the dreadful wrong which he did to the complainant, it is impossible to discern even a glimmer of contrition on his part. 16   His Honour had before him a psychological report dated 13 October 1998 by Ms Anna Robilliard who conducted psychometric tests on the applicant. These tests interestingly revealed that the applicant was of a Schizoid personality. Ms Robilliard described such personality as follows:  
     
      
       
       ""The Schizoid personality is characterised by a lack of sensitivity, interest or concern for other people. A similar remoteness is often observed in the individual's own self awareness and degree of personal insight. They will seem deficient across broad spheres of human knowledge, particularly about social matters, and often seem impervious to the emotional and personal implications of everyday social life or the praise or criticism of others.” 
       
      
      
     The report continued with reference to the applicant: 
      
       
      
       
       Dependent attributes are also evident in his test profile and are typically demonstrated in the adopting of docile, passive, avoidant behaviours, withdrawal from adult responsibility and an exaggerated fear of being alone. Lack of self confidence and a perception of personal inadequacy and ineptitude is consistent. 
       
      
       
      
       
       The antisocial attributes evident in his profile indicate that CJB is probably prone to impulsive, short sighted, imprudent behaviour and would show insufficient regard for norms, values and social codes predominant in society. Such individuals frequently find gratification in a perception that such restrictions do not apply to them and they value the image and sense of being free, unencumbered and unconfined to persons, places, obligations and routines. A callous insensitivity of mood is frequently demonstrated and paucity of compassion, remorse and adequate regard for the safety and wellbeing of others."" 
       
      
     17   I found this explanation by Ms Robilliard to be extremely helpful in obtaining some comprehension of how the applicant could have behaved in such an appalling fashion as he did towards the complainant. Ms Robilliard did not think that the applicant is a paedophile in the more commonly understood sense of that term. She concluded: 
     
      
       
        ""He definitely requires professional treatment as at this point he remains largely ignorant of the serious nature of his offences and the potential damage that could result for those involved, both in the short and longer term. Intellectually, he is quite capable of developing insight and understanding."" 
       
      
     18   The applicant originally applied for Legal Aid which was granted and then withdrawn. He made certain submissions in the Application for Leave to Appeal which he lodged with this Court. He indicated to the Registrar that he would appear before this Court today unrepresented, however, we have been informed by Mr Lamprati presently appearing before the Court for the Crown, that the applicant has now indicated that he does not intend to appear before the Court and, in fact, he is not presently before the Court. 19   I set out verbatim his written submissions: 
     
      
       
       ""(1) Accumulation of sentence(Re: The 8th count): 
        
         
        
       The 8th count was different in name only and did include some basic allegation(ie sexual intercourse with stepfather. 
        
         
        
       Though all this may be true and I have never denied this fact. But his Honour Justice Job has made this particular offence stand out as if it happened at a different time lapse (ie after a break up in relationship.) 
        
         
        
       But on the contrary was a continued pattern of behaviour that was a contruction (sic) of a relationship. It was not as isolated offence different in type, nature and occurrence to anything which had occurred previously and up to date of charge. 
        
         
        
       (2) The relationship between myself and my stepdaughter had lasted some 5-6 years in this time we lived as defacto husband and wife and there were 4 children born as a result of this relationship. There were no problems between myself and [the complainant] until a friend of mine's girlfriend had told here if she charged me with these offences she would get a lot of money and I would be put in jail for a long term to which has certainly happened. 
        
         
        
       (3) The other discrepancy I find with count 8 is that after this pregnancy there were 2 more, in which case I do not think his Honour Justice Job has looked closely at and to the period of time to which we were living de facto (5-6 years). 
        
         
        
       (4) I feel sentence is excessive on basis of the accumitation (sic) of the 8th count which is not different in""type"" of offence or in a different time frame. 
        
         
        
       (5) This 8th count is different in name only of charge."" 
        
         
       
      
    20   This Court has also had the benefit of written submissions on behalf of the Crown which conclude with the submission that ""A worse case is difficult to envisage."" I respectfully agree.21   Referring to the applicant's written submissions, may I say that it is understandable that a lay person may find it difficult to appreciate the manner in which the sentences were structured, particularly bearing in mind that each of the offences constituted a high degree of criminality and it is difficult to conclude that any one offence is more serious than another. His Honour did not explain in his remarks on sentence why he structured the sentences in the way in which he did. 22   The high degree of criminality extending over so many years, and the large number of relevant counts would indicate that different judges would approach the structure of an appropriate sentencing regime in different ways. I do not think that the manner in which his Honour structured the offences offends against the principle of totality as explained by the High Court in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63 or the principles enunciated more recently in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 23   So far as the subjective matters are concerned, his Honour specifically took into account the pleas of guilty, the fact that this is the first time the applicant has been in custody because of this type of offence, and that it is likely, because of the abhorrence which the prison population feels towards offenders against young children, that he will serve the sentence in protection. Because of these matters his Honour concluded, rightly, in my respectful view, that there were special circumstances within the meaning of Section 11 (2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. 24   It is quite unnecessary to refer to the earlier authorities of this Court which emphasise that sexual assaults upon young children especially by those who stand in a position of trust, must be severely punished. It is an area where the deterrent aspect of sentencing must necessarily play a significant role. 25   In my view, the application for leave to appeal entirely lacks substance. The sentences were well within the sentencing discretion available to his Honour and I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be refused. 26   HULME J: I agree. The order of the Court is that the application for leave to appeal is refused.

     REGINA v Jade Lillian CLARKE 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: Jade Lillian Clarke seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on her by his Honour Justice Christie QC at the Sydney District Court on 22 April 1999. The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to one count under Section 97 of the Crimes Act, 1900 (the Act) robbery in company, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude. 
    2   His Honour took into account two offences on a Form 1, being one count of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence under Section 114 of the Act. This offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years penal servitude. The second count was one of larceny which carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for five years: see ss 116 and 117 of the Act.3   His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of 3 years penal servitude to commence on 26 November 1998 - the date upon which the applicant was taken into custody - and to expire on 25 November 2001. His Honour imposed an additional term of two years to commence on 26 November 2001 and to expire on 25 November 2003. 4   The applicant was born on 7 December 1979 and she had no prior criminal record. The applicant's co-offender in relation to the robbery in company offence was George Shannon Moses, who pleaded guilty before Judge Christie to armed robbery. This count was also under Section 97 of the Act. The only difference, of course, between the charges was the applicant was charged with robbery in company, whereas the co-offender Moses, was charged with armed robbery. However, in relation to Mr Moses's sentence, his Honour was not required to take into account any matters under Form 1. 5   Judge Christie imposed an identical sentence upon Mr Moses in relation to the armed robbery as that which he imposed on the applicant in respect of the robbery in company. Very briefly stated, the facts in relation to the robbery are that a little after 1am on Monday, 23 March 1998, a Mr Wusarne was working alone as a console operator at the Caltex Service Station at Neutral Bay. At that time the co-offenders entered the store and confronted him as he was sweeping the foyer floor area. Mr Moses was armed with a large carving knife. He pushed Mr Wusarne in the back, causing him to fall against a display cabinet. As Mr Wusarne turned to face him, Mr Moses placed the blade of the knife against Mr Wusarne's throat, forcing him backwards to the cash register. Mr Moses threatened to ""cut him"" if Mr Wusarne did not open the cash register drawer. At first, Mr Wusarne declined to do so. 6   The applicant then reached over the service counter and removed the cash drawer from underneath the counter. She then removed all the notes from the cash drawer. As the applicant was removing the money from the drawer, Mr Moses kept saying to Mr Wusarne, ""I'll cut you, I'll cut you"". 7   After the applicant had removed the money from the counter drawer, she started to press a number of buttons on the cash register in an attempt to cause the register drawer to open. Eventually as a consequence of the threats directed to him, Mr Wusarne opened the cash register and the applicant removed all the notes from the till. The applicant then ran out of the store, and after the co-offender had removed the coins from the counter drawer he walked out of the store. 8   The victim described the knife as having a long silver blade which was about 35 centimetres long and curved to a point. 9   I turn then to the Form 1 matters. Four days later viz on 27 March 1998, the applicant, unaccompanied and armed with the same knife, entered the same premises with the intent of again robbing them. However at that time, fortunately, the proprietor was outside sweeping the apron around the petrol tanks. Accordingly there was no need for the applicant to use the knife and she removed money from the office premises. She was charged appropriately with the offences in the Form 1. 10   The co-offenders were apprehended in relation to the original robbery under somewhat unusual circumstances. Investigating police obtained from the service station proprietor a security video which had recorded the events of 23 March. This video was made available to a television station which screened it on a programme dealing with unsolved crimes. A viewer of this programme recognised either one or both of the co-offenders and, as a consequence, police armed with a search warrant, attended the premises which they jointly occupied at Willoughby on 10 June 1998. Both offenders were arrested on that date. 11   The applicant fully admitted both offences and cooperated with the police. Originally the co-offender denied involvement, but as is clear, later admitted the robbery offence. 12   The co-offender is three years older than the applicant and had a prior criminal record, albeit not a significant one. On 8 November 1994 at North Sydney Local Court, he was dealt with on one charge of malicious damage. The charge was proved but dismissed by the magistrate under the provisions of Section 556A of the Crimes Act. He was at the same time convicted of failing to leave licensed premises. In respect of that charge, he received the benefit of a recognizance under Section 556A, self in the sum of $100 to be of good behaviour for six months. 13   Subsequent to the commission of the subject offences and prior to her plea of guilty on 26 November 1998, the applicant conceived a child of whom Mr Moses is the father. The pregnancy was disclosed to Judge Christie. He rejected any possible suggestion that this was a deliberate pregnancy to seek leniency in the sentencing process. Indeed, his Honour appropriately took the pregnancy into account in the sentencing process, acknowledging that although a custodial sentence was inevitable, the child would be born whilst the applicant was in custody. He referred to the applicant as having ""compelling subjective circumstances"". He also took into account that the applicant was, at the time of the offences, addicted to illicit substances. He took into account the absence of any prior criminal convictions on her part, or indeed any prior criminal charges. He regarded the applicant's prospect of rehabilitation as ""excellent"". He took into account her early plea of guilty as being demonstrative of remorse and contrition. 
    14   The first ground of appeal was based upon the alleged disparity between the objective and subjective circumstances of the applicant and Mr Moses which were such as to leave the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance as a consequence of the identical sentences. 15   It is apparent from what I have said that his Honour was not faced with the precise situation which confronted the sentencing judges in Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione (1995-1996) 189 CLR 295 because his Honour was not confined to sentencing co-offenders in relation to the same offence. He was, of course, sentencing co-offenders in relation to the same offence so far as the robbery on 23 March 1998 was concerned. However, he was additionally required to take into account the two matters on the Form 1, so far as the applicant was concerned 16   It has forcefully been put to us by Mr Stratton on behalf of the applicant that this Court should bear in mind that the maximum sentences in relation to both Form 1 matters are considerably lower than the maximum penalty in relation to the Section 97 matters. However, as I have indicated, this multiplicity of offences was a factor that distinguished the instant sentencing process from that in Lowe and Postiglione. Nevertheless, having both offenders before him, his Honour appropriately, if I may respectfully say so, endeavoured to avoid any realistic disparity in sentencing them. He sought, in a careful assessment of the relative objective and subjective factors, to attain equality in the administration of justice. This involved a careful balancing exercise of both the objective and subjective circumstances in so far as the co-offenders were concerned. 17   Mr Stratton has drawn the Court's attention to the fact that during his remarks on sentence, his Honour said:  
     
      
       
       ""I think it is fair to say that the prisoner Moses was the leading light, if that be the correct expression, in relation to the events which took place on 23 March. That is, he is an imposing and threatening person who was armed with a very threatening weapon; a carving knife. It was he who threatened Wusarne. It was he who manhandled Wusarne and no doubt by his sheer physical presence, lent aggression to the entire enterprise. He was the active perpetrator of the threatened violence and the aggression. As I say, his sheer physical presence would be sufficient to lend weight to the enterprise."" 
       
      
    18   Mr Lamprati, on behalf of the Crown, has drawn our attention to the fact that in her ERISP, the applicant was asked the following questions:  
     
      
       
       ""Q.129. And when you left the house with George, who took possession of the knife when you left the house? 
       
      
      
       
       A. It was in the backpack. 
        
         
        
       Q. 130. Who put it in the backpack? 
        
       A. Me 
        
         
        
       Q.131. And where had the knife come from? 
        
       A. It was found, at the time there was a council clean up, and in that George and I had gone around and collected a few things, and in that we found a utensil box with mashed potato mashers and stuff like that and the knife had come from inside the box."" 
        
       
      
    19   One must bear in mind, of course, that in this joint criminal enterprise, the applicant was fully aware that Mr Moses' physical size was likely to have been an intimidating factor to any potential victim. Further, they jointly took the knife with them, she having placed it in the bag, albeit at the critical time it was Mr Moses who was holding the knife and holding it in such a position in relation to Mr Wusarne's body that it constituted a very significant and terrifying threat to him. 20   In addition to matters that I have already mentioned, Mr Stratton specifically referred to the disparity of three years in the ages of the co-offenders; the prior clear record of the applicant; her tender age; her pregnancy; her expression of contrition in her earlier admission of the offences to the investigating police. At the end of the day, as Mr Stratton correctly and fairly conceded, in so far as the parity exercise is concerned, the burden rests upon the applicant to satisfy this court that the sentencing discretion miscarried. 21   Dealing specifically with this point, I am unable to reach that conclusion. The significant factor that militated against the applicant in the balancing exercise was the commission of the two Form 1 matters which must be regarded as serious matters, despite the disparity between their maximum sentences and the maximum sentence in relation to the robbery. I can see no error in legal principle, so far as his Honour’s reasons are concerned. There was no manifest error and I think, if I may respectfully say so, that his Honour could not have done more than he did in an attempt to achieve parity, albeit as I have said earlier, these were not precisely Lowe or Postiglione cases. I would reject this ground of appeal. 22   I would reject the second ground that the learned sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant's age, her pregnancy, the assertion that the offences were spur of the moment offences motivated by addiction to drugs, and his Honour's acceptance that the applicant demonstrated excellent prospect for rehabilitation. 23   I would also reject the submission that in the light of the sentencing guidelines set out in Henry 46 NSWLR 346, the sentence was manifestly excessive. This sentence preceded Henry, but nevertheless when one looks at the factors in Henry as being appropriate factors for consideration in relation to this type of offence, and the guideline judgments as a whole, I can see no aspect in which this case falls foul of the principles enunciated in Henry. 24   The point was made by the Crown that although his Honour has obviously given some thought of the fact that the applicant's child would be born when she was in custody, that the provisions for mothers having children with them whilst in custody are now much more favourable than existed at the time of the judgment of this Court in Ihm (unreported, 9 November 1993, Hunt CJ at CL, Allen and Matthews JJ). The fact that the child will be with his mother for some time in custody is naturally a matter which attracts sympathy, however, this Court is bound to apply the relevant principles of law to the case before it. Applying the relevant principles of law I am quite unable to conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the sentencing process. 25   Although it has no influence on the decision which I have reached in this matter, I would be constrained to say that had his Honour imposed a lesser sentence upon the present applicant than Mr Moses, there would be a distinct possibility that Mr Moses would have been applicant before this Court. 26   I would not wish to leave this case without noting that one could not help but be impressed by the admirable efforts that have been made by the applicant to rehabilitate herself whilst she has thus far been in custody and the care with which she has obviously bestowed upon her child. It is now clear from the material before this Court - (irrelevant as it is to the sentencing exercise) that she has - one might be excused for saying, wisely - now severed her relationship with Mr Moses and therefore she will, upon her release from custody, be a sole parent. One can only hope that the refusal of this application will not in any way discourage her in her rehabilitative attempts. 27   Accordingly I propose that in the circumstances, the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 28   HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour’s reasons.

     REGINA v GEORGE ADLER 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
        
        
       
      
    1    GROVE J :  The appellant was tried before Stewart A/DCJ upon an indictment containing twenty one counts, each alleging an offence contrary to s178BA of the Crimes Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment ……….” 
         
        
        
       Counts 1 to 15 involved obtaining by deception from seven nominated persons, cheques either for the appellant or a company Badrum Pty Limited (Badrum), with the exception of count 5 which alleged a financial advantage as particularized therein. Counts 16 to 21 alleged obtaining cash or cheques in varying amounts from an eighth person. The appellant was found guilty on all counts and was sentenced to terms of imprisonment. The appeal challenges the convictions.  
        
       
      
    2    The hearing of the trial extended from February to May 1998. At the commencement (February 16) the appellant was represented by senior and junior counsel and a solicitor. On March 2 representation effectively ceased. The learned trial judge in due course ruled that the trial would continue and the appellant conducted his defence without appearance on his behalf by any lawyer. It will be necessary in order to deal with some grounds of appeal now raised to detail later the circumstances surrounding these events. One consequence was that the appellant made an opening address and presented oral evidence in chief in a narrative form. From them it was established that many of the factual allegations made by the Crown were not disputed.  
     
      
       
      
    3    The essence of the Crown case was that funds were obtained from the persons named in the various counts of the indictment (referred to as “investors”) upon representations that their money would be invested in Canadian Government bonds. Badrum was to be used as an investment vehicle. The deceptions arose out of the circumstance that the appellant neither had such bonds nor access to them. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The Crown evidence was necessarily voluminous. Banking records showed deposit of funds obtained from the investors into accounts maintained by Badrum and drawings following those deposits. None of the drawings was transmitted in any fashion so as to obtain, or in any way in connection with, Canadian Government bonds. The appellant did not contradict this evidence. He claimed that the investors had become unsecured lenders to Badrum and that the proposal to secure the bonds was to be fulfilled per medium of using lines of credit which had been established with a Panamanian bank. Pivotal to transaction was a man named Robert Wilson who, the appellant claimed, would telephone the appellant to inform him that he had a bond available for purchase. The appellant would instruct the Panama bank to release funds to a French bank (Hottinger) in return for appropriate documentation, including what were called interest coupons concerning the bonds. The case of the appellant was that, although the specific money taken from the investors and given to Badrum was used for purposes other than bond purchase, the use of the appellant’s credit line facility amounted to performance of the agreement with the investors. Subject to the content of a letter admitted for limited purpose in the appeal to which I will later make reference, there was no evidence of the conduct of any transaction such as hypothesized by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    5    Parts of the representation by the appellant to investors included specification of maturity dates for payment of interest due. The appellant testified however that he had no records of the acquisition of any particular bonds nor any documents of account or the like. He agreed that he had “fobbed off” investors who were seeking payment or repayment. It was the Crown case that investors had provided $1,472,865 and they had received in return $323,640. 
     
      
       
      
    6    By September 1993 Badrum was in liquidation. The representations to the eighth investor (counts 16 to 21) were made between 22 September and 12 November 1993. The appellant admitted that he had told the liquidator of Badrum that he was not keen to disclose the destination of the investors’ funds. He also acknowledged that he had not mentioned the existence of Wilson to that liquidator.  
     
      
       
      
    7    There were numerous matters of detail examined at the hearing and a number of concessions in addition to those mentioned. Perhaps one of the most significant in the trial in terms of the credibility of the appellant’s claim, was his agreement that it was only on 20 April 1998 when the trial was entering its third month that he, for the first time, told anyone that Panama (i.e. the bank there) was a location of importance to the bond transaction scheme. 
     
      
       
      
    8    It was the Crown contention that the inconsistencies and the incredible nature of the appellant’s evidence of the supposed existence of a credit line and Canadian Government bond transactions was fully exposed by the evidence and confirmed in his cross examination and the only conclusion to be reached was that the appellant never had available to him any such bonds and that neither he nor Badrum had traded in them or invested any money derived from the investors in them. 
     
      
       
      
    9    A Notice of Grounds of Appeal filed in March 1999 contained eight grounds and three further grounds were added. They were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour erred in law in refusing to discharge the jury when counsel and solicitor for the appellant indicated that they could no longer appear for the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour erred in law in failing to inform the accused that he had the right to object to the evidence of: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           a. Mr Flynn at p709 that Mr Cambridge acted as a director as the accused ‘was not able to do so’. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           b. Mr Flynn at p715 that there were no assets of Badrum recoverable by the liquidator other than an amount paid by way of a filing fee. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           c. Mr Cambridge at p778 that he had paid money to the appellant to purchase Canadian government bonds and had not ‘get the money back’. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           d. Mr Hattersley at p496 as to the dishonour of a cheque provided by the appellant 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           In that: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            i. there was no issue to which the evidence related. The evidence was irrelevant. Its real vice was that it diverted the jury from the consideration of its proper task. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            ii. the probative value (if any) was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            iii. the evidence could only be classified as tendency evidence, specifically evidence as to bad character. See s97 Evidence Act. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           e. Even if the evidence had probative value (which is refuted) the evidence did not have such probative value as to pass the test imposed by s101 of the Evidence Act, namely that the probative value of the evidence had to substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect it would have on the accused. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         3. His Honour erred in law in resorting to what amounted to a cross examination of the appellant at p1584 and in particular engaging in the following exchange with the appellant: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. No, no, is it right that Badrum’s funds were deposited in the Hottinger bank? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Well, that’s - I’m not sure how I can answer that your Honour. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Try the truth? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Well, I object to that, your Honour. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. You can object all you like. Just do your best?45 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Funds in a credit line are exactly the same thing. If you have an overdraft you have funds available. If you have cash in the bank, you have funds available. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         4. His Honour erred in law in inviting the jury to consider matters relating to the rule in Brown v Dunne (sic) when considering the appellant’s case. 
         
        
        
         
         5. His Honour erred in law in directing the jury at p35su. 1/5/98: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Is Mr Starkie lying as the accused says or not? The accused really is saying, members of the jury, that these people, Starkie, Elliott, Cairns, Hattersley, were in a conspiracy together, they had had their heads together and they were prepared to do their utmost to have the accused wrongly convicted. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         6. His Honour erred in law in directing the jury as to lies told by the appellant; alternatively 
         
        
        
         
         7. His Honour erred in law in his directions to the jury concerning lies told by the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         8. His Honour erred in law in that he failed to take into account adequately or properly in the conduct of the trial that the accused was unrepresented. 
         
        
        
         
         9. The trial judge erred in law in failing to rule that the first 15 counts of the indictment alleging that the appellant dishonestly obtained for himself or for Badrum Pty Limited from the name individuals a valuable thing by deception were bad for duplicity and to quash these counts.  
         
        
        
         
         10. The trial judge erred in law in his failure to correctly and adequately direct the jury on the requirement of a finding that the obtaining was done dishonestly in respect of each count in the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         11. The trial judge erred in law in failing to direct a verdict of not guilty in respect of count 10 in the indictment involving an allegation in respect of a Mr Gregory there being no evidence or insufficient evidence to permit the jury to find a verdict of guilty in respect of this count.” 
         
        
       
      
    10    Grounds 1, 2 and 8 are directly or indirectly connected with the lack of legal representation of the appellant for a substantial portion of the trial. It is convenient to deal first with the more limited issues raised by the other grounds of appeal.  
     
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
       
      
    11    The appellant was being cross examined when he gave the answer which attracted the intervention by the learned trial judge set out in the following extract from the transcript which elaborates the context a little more than that expressed in the ground: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “A. Yes, I would have said that Badrum’s funds are deposited in the Hottinger bank, that’s correct, not Mr Cairns’ funds. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That Badrum’s funds are deposited in the Hottinger bank? 
         
        
        
         
         A. They were deposited. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, they were deposited in Hottinger as well as in Panama. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The funds, Badrum’s funds? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Badrum had secured credit lines. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. No, no, is it right that Badrum’s funds were deposited in the Hottinger bank? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, that’s - I’m not sure how I can answer that your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Try the truth? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I object to that, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You can object all you like. Just do your best? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Funds in a credit line are exactly the same thing. If you have an overdraft you have funds available. If you have cash in the bank, you have funds available.” 
         
        
       
      
    12    Mr Cairns was one of the investors named in the indictment. The intervention was hardly surprising, given that the appellant’s case acknowledged that the actual funds deposited into the Badrum accounts were not transmitted overseas and his case was, as I have noted above, that the existence of a line of credit and the use of it by him was tantamount to dealing with the funds in accordance with the representations made to the investors.  
     
      
       
      
    13    It was argued that his Honour’s remark “try the truth” would have indicated to the jury his Honour’s view that the appellant’s testimony lacked credibility. It was conceded by the Crown in argument that the choice of phrase was unfortunate. Whether that be so or not, I am unpersuaded that any miscarriage has been shown. The last answer in the above extract from the transcript shows that the appellant was articulating the case which I have mentioned namely that cash in bank, overdraft facility and available line of credit were interchangeable in the context of the transactions which the appellant claimed to have been undertaking. That was his version of the truth. No prejudice could fairly be inferred from an adjuration to tell it. 
     
      
       
      
    14    I would reject this ground. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 4 
        
       
      
    15    The matter complained of in relation to this ground is referenced to an occurrence during the cross examination of Mr Moulds, an Australian Securities Commission investigator. The following extract of transcript is pertinent: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “ADLER: Q. During your investigation did you ask any of the investors for information relating to their personal bank accounts? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And were they supplied to you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you investigate those accounts? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did you ask any of these investors, lenders, such as Mr Cairns and Mr Hattersley for the balance sheets of their companies? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Not Mr Hattersley, I don’t know about Mr Cairns, he was interviewed by Mr Jackson. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Are you aware as to whether Mr Hattersley had in his company the ownership of any Canadian treasury bonds? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. I am not aware of that, no. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you didn’t think that was a relevant thing to investigate? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And had you investigated Mr Hattersley’s affairs and found that he had a treasury bond in his private company, what would you have asked him about that? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Very hypothetical, and I won’t allow it. 
         
        
        
         
         ADLER: It may not that be hypothetical. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Perhaps, but it is at the moment. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR (BUSCOMBE) None of this was put to Mr Hattersley. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I know it wasn’t. I won’t allow it.” 
         
        
       
      
    16    Earlier in the trial the leading Crown Prosecutor had mentioned an objection by her which had elicited a remark from the appellant that the purpose for which money had been obtained from a particular witness was to be challenged. She pointed out that if the appellant wished to raise a case along those lines, it had not been put to previous witnesses. The complaint was made that the rejection manifest in the above extract may well have been an attempt by the appellant to do what the prosecutor said he had not. 
     
      
       
      
    17    It is noted that cross examination of a number of the investors was undertaken by senior counsel before his withdrawal from the trial. It is not contested that the matter sought to be raised by the appellant had not been put to the witnesses. The argument was developed in terms of an asserted obligation of the trial judge to advise the appellant about the nature of the operation of the practice rule in Browne v Dunn 1894 6R. 67. The submissions in this regard, as was the case in respect of a number of other grounds, were presented in the context of sweeping generalisations concerning concepts of fairness to unrepresented accused. An obstacle to the attraction of intervention by the Court is the presentation of argument in a vacuum. It is not suggested that the matter sought to be investigated by the appellant was factual or relevant to any issue in the trial. There is no demonstration that the rejection of the evidence had any potential adverse effect upon the case being sought to be made by the appellant.  
     
      
       
      
    18    Counsel argued that the learned trial judge misapplied or misunderstood the nature of “the rule in Browne v Dunn” as applied to the circumstances of this case and, alternatively, that he was under an obligation to advise or inform the accused about the consequences which might flow from its breach. The investigation of such submissions is futile unless it is in the context of the demonstration of some disadvantage to the appellant in the conduct of his case.  
     
      
       
      
    19    The inability to demonstrate practical potential for adverse affect is not surprising given the specific direction by the trial judge on this topic to the jury. Counsel for the Crown at trial had submitted that the issue required attention and in the course of his charge to the jury the trial judge explained to them the nature of the rule of practice and the inherent fairness of raising matters in cross examination. He finalized his directions to the jury however in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It may well have been, and would have been, fairer to put these things to these witnesses, but I do not take it to the position that where, because he did not ask them, he should not be believed. I do not take it to that point, and it is far less the position that because he did not put these questions, it should go to a question of his guilt or innocence. Certainly it may well have been fairer, would have been fairer if he had put them, but you cannot take it to the point, when you take it into account, that it was unfair, that that is an issue that you should take into account on the question of his guilt. You cannot do that.” 
         
        
       
      
    20    It was submitted that there was no call for the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn in the case. It was not applied against the appellant. The consequence of the direction was that he was left in a more favourable position than he would have been if representation had continued, in the sense that his representatives would have been expected to comply with the rules of practice. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 5 
        
       
      
    21    This ground complains of specified content in his Honour’s charge to the jury and is recited in particulars of the ground. It reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Is Mr Starkie lying as the accused says or not? The accused is really saying, members of the jury, that these people Starkie, Elliott, Cairns, Craik, Hattersley were in conspiracy together, they had their heads together and they were prepared to do their utmost to have the accused wrongly convicted.” 
         
        
       
      
    22    In isolation, such remarks could provoke a conclusion that the jury was being invited to make a choice between the evidence of the accused and that of prosecution witnesses. It is trite law that that is never the issue for determination in a criminal trial. There is ample authority to that effect. A convenient example is R v Towner 1991 56 A Crim R 221 where it was said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The trial judge must deal with the opposing versions, however, in such a way that it is made clear to the jury that it is not their task to make that choice, that is to determine which of the versions it is that is the correct one and which it is that is the false one. Their task is simply to determine whether they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.” 
         
        
       
      
    23    The particular content of the charge to the jury must be viewed in the context of the case. It was a specific issue raised by the appellant that a number of the investors had collaborated with the Australian Security Commission investigators to construct near identical statements and give false evidence against him. As will be seen from the following extract from the transcript it was the accused himself who raised the proposition of conspiracy against him. He gave this testimony: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Q. But your explanation for why you couldn’t pay out Mr Cairns his 975 thousand dollars odd, according to letter of guarantee, on 12 March is because it was Mr Craik’s fault and he had got something confused and you had gone on, invested other moneys or some such things, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Oh I see. Mr Cairns, I put it to you Mr Adler, told you in no uncertain terms prior to departing for overseas that he wanted to see his investment paid out? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s absolutely untrue. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just wait until I finish: Before he would give any consideration to committing those funds and a further one cool million to another bond: What do you say about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Firstly it is absolutely untrue. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I don’t suppose you can add much to ‘absolutely untrue’ can you Mr Adler? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well it is absolutely untrue. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. What you are really saying is that you have already said that Mr Starkie’s evidence was untrue, haven’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. In regard to the sending of money overseas, his particular money? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes sir, that’s untrue. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And Mr Cairns’s evidence is untrue? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s exactly right, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mr Craik’s evidence is untrue? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well your Honour if I might, it’s a real coincidence that Elliott introduced Starkie and Cairns. Starkie introduce Hattersley, Gregory. They had a meeting in Craik’s office and suddenly all the stories are exactly the same. I mean it’s, you know, just odd, isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. I don’t know? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I don’t know either. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is this what you are saying to the jury, in a roundabout sort of way: That these investors have all got their noggins together and come into this Court to falsely attribute things to you, is that right? That is really what you are saying, isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I’m not so sure it is the investors. But when you have a situation where these five people out of all the investors suddenly there is just five so called friends who are the main complainants in that matter, and there is nothing odd about that of course. Suddenly, according to the Australian Securities Commission, do their statements all around the same time, over eight and nine and twelve drafts, all of which are destroyed by the ASC and all we have is that final last statement. Well with due respect, you can shake your head, but you weren’t there.” 
         
        
       
      
    24    The reason for this matter being raised then is that it was canvassed by the appellant and whether the extracted part of the charge to the jury involved an invitation to misapply principle needs to be gauged in the context of the whole of his Honour’s remarks on this subject. The context of the extract particularized in the ground is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The accused, in evidence, said that basically what Mr Starkie said in evidence about the cheques, the amounts and the times is correct. He claims, of course, that what Mr Starkie said about what the accused told him is, he used his words, ‘a pack of lies’. The accused, himself, says that he lied to Mr Starkie about the repayments. These are matters which you will undoubtedly take into account when you are coming to an assessment of whether the Crown has proven these charges beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
        
        
         
         This follows a lengthy and exhaustive, perhaps exhausting even, cross examination of Mr Starkie, it traverses virtually everything he said in examination in chief. Is Mr Starkie lying as the accused says or not? The accused really is saying, members of the jury, that these people, Starkie, Elliott, Cairns, Craik, Hattersley, were in a conspiracy together, they had had their heads together and they were prepared to do their utmost to have the accused wrongly convicted. That is what he said to you or words to that effect. I do not pretend that they are the exact words. He also put to you that not only are those five doing those things but the attack on them goes further in that he alleges that they not only conspired with each other but also with the investigators of the ASC. 
         
        
        
         
         It is a matter for you whether you think that it is a credible suggestion whether those people did these things as alleged for there can be no mistake that that is what the accused is alleging. It is completely and utterly a matter for you, I have no opinion on the matter. I remind you yet again that it is for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
      
    25    Although, as I have said, the particularized passage may be construed as contrary to principle when viewed in isolation; when seen in its proper light, it can be observed that his Honour made it clear that the jury was not being invited to undertake a determination of whether it was the appellant or the Crown witnesses who were lying in order to make its determination. 
     
      
       
      
    26    This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
        
       Grounds 6 and 7 
        
       
      
    27    It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that a direction on lies was neither necessary nor appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
       
      
    28    That proposition cannot be sustained. At the very beginning of the case the Crown opened that it alleged that the accused was lying when he said that he had or had available to him particular securities and indeed this was the essence of the allegation of deception. The Crown opened further however, and adverted to its intention to prove the telling of lies before, at the time of and after receiving money from the investors. 
     
      
       
      
    29    It has been noted that the appellant acknowledged that he had told lies to some investors to “fob them off” when they were seeking repayment. It thus became not only important but obligatory for the learned trial judge to give the jury some assistance as to the use that they might make of lies told by the appellant. It was necessary that there be drawn to the attention of the jury, the need to differentiate. On the one hand it was the Crown case that the appellant had lied to investors in order to obtain funds from them; proof of such lies being evidence directed towards proving an element of the charges, namely that the appellant had dishonestly engaged in deception. If the case were limited to that, then the appellant’s submission that a direction was neither necessary nor appropriate would be correct: Edwards v The Queen 1993 178 CLR 193. There were however other lies which were capable of being found by the jury and it was necessary for his Honour to tell the jury in what way they might approach a finding that the appellant had lied when investors were seeking explanation for delay in payment of interest or repayment of investment. Such lies were not within the ambit of the ingredients of the offences charged themselves. His Honour dealt with such matters in some detail and at some length. He drew the necessary distinction. He cautioned them about the necessity for materiality and he summarized the case being advanced by the appellant that the lies which he conceded telling were not capable of affording any causal nexus with the payment of money by the investors and his argument that the true reason for their action was reliance upon others. 
     
      
       
      
    30    Contrary to the submission that the directions were confusing and inappropriate, I would accept the Crown submission that they were clear and comprehensible. They did not involve error. 
     
      
       
       These grounds are not made out. 
        
        
       Ground 9 
        
       
      
    31    This ground relates to form. No objection was taken on behalf of the appellant either when legally represented or later, after the withdrawal of the representatives. The Crown opposes the grant of leave to advance this ground. The circumstance that the ground is raised for the first time on appeal is not inevitably fatal to it. If the point is good, then the judgments of conviction are flawed and I would not regard the refusal of leave as an option available to deny the appellant relief.  
     
      
       
      
    32    Counsel for the appellant recited in his written submissions the recapitulation of principle stated by the editors of Archbold: “No one count of the indictment should charge the defendant with having committed two or more separate offences”. 
     
      
       
      
    33    I do not dissent from that statement of principle and it is amply authorized in Australian cases, for example: Johnson v Miller 1937 59 CLR 467; S v The Queen 1989 168 CLR 266.  
     
      
       
      
    34    However the submissions did not identify the alleged duplicity, whether patent or latent. As it is alleged that all counts were bad it will suffice to exemplify one of them. The first count read: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales, who prosecutes in this behalf for Her Majesty, by James John Jolliffe, a person authorised by order in writing to sign indictments for and on behalf of the said Director, charges in the District Court of New South Wales in its criminal jurisdiction at Sydney on 16th February 1998 that 
         
        
        
         
         George Adler 
         
        
        
         
         1. On 2 December 1992 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales dishonestly obtained from Peter Elliott for himself or for Badrum Pty Ltd a valuable thing, namely a bank cheque dated 27 November 1992 in the amount of $113,365.26 drawn in favour of Peter Elliott and endorsed at the accused’s request in favour of BDO Nelson Parkhill Trust Account, by deception, namely by falsely representing to Peter Elliott that he had a Canadian Government Bonds issue to fill, that it was a secure investment and that it would be repaid on 29 January 1993 together with interest in the sum of $26,000, at a time when he neither had nor had available to him an issue of Canadian Government Bonds.” 
         
        
       
      
    35    The implication of the submissions on behalf of the appellant was that the appearance of the disjunctive permitted a construction of the terms of the count specifying separate and distinct offences. In my opinion such construction is not available. The offence is the obtaining dishonestly by deception of an amount of money (or thing of value or financial advantage) and, given the terms of the statute, they do not become multiple offences to obtain such for himself or another person. 
     
      
       
      
    36    I would not sustain this ground. 
     
      
       
        
        
       Ground 10 
        
       
      
    37    It was recognized by senior counsel appearing for the appellant in the appeal that the pursuit of this ground would involve departure by this Court from the authority of the High Court in Peters v The Queen 1998 192 CLR 493. In the circumstances only a formal submission was made in terms of the ground and it is unnecessary to explore the matter. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 11 
        
       
      
    38    It was put in written submissions that the appellant, whilst unrepresented, did not seek a directed verdict upon count 10 in the indictment but this was incorrect and an interlocutory judgment by the learned trial judge is among the papers. In any event I would not see absence of application as a bar to upholding this ground if it was demonstrated that there was insufficient evidence fit for the jury to consider on the question of the appellant's possible guilt. It is unnecessary to explore whether, as submitted, the judge was under an obligation to remove that count from the jury. The question is whether there was sufficient evidence so to leave it. 
     
      
       
      
    39    In summary the submission of the appellant was that the evidence was incapable of supporting the allegation that the investor (Mr Gregory) placed funds through the appellant with Badrum as a result of dishonest deception by the appellant. It is contended that the evidence shows that he acted on the advice of another. Some of Mr Gregory’s evidence was elicited in cross examination by senior counsel then appearing for the appellant. It included: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Q. As I understand it, rather than you being persuaded by Mr Adler, the position is that because you respected some of the people that were investing with them you relied on them? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It was because of their reputation and their business acumen of whatever description you want, streetwiseness, that you went into it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can I ask you this: If they had not gone into it would you have done so? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is that the reason why in effect you took what colloquially describe as the ostrich approach, put your head in the sand? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I was half happy to invest on the basis that other people I respected were prepared to invest.” 
         
        
       
      
    40    In re-examination the following further answers were elicited by counsel for the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Q. In answer to my learned friend on more than one occasion you indicated you relied on the fact other people you knew had invested in the scheme, correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Other persons? It was really Mr Starkie was the only gentleman I knew. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To what extent do you rely on the fact Mr Starkie decided to invest? 
         
        
        
         
         A. 100 percent.” 
         
        
       
      
    41    Those answers need to be considered in the light of the whole of the evidence of the witness including the initial enquiry by the appellant whether Mr Gregory was interested in investing in a Canadian bond syndicate; the representations about the broker in Missouri; the request for a form of guarantee and the production of a letter by the appellant in response and the explanation of how the bond was said to work. 
     
      
       
      
    42    In his judgment on the application for directed verdict delivered on 15 April 1998 the learned trial judge acknowledged the force in the applicant’s submission but correctly recognized that the issue was whether there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could convict: Doney v The Queen 1990 171 CLR 207. Particularly in relation to the last evidence above extracted, his Honour held that it was open to conclude that the meaning was that the witness was relying upon Mr Starkie’s probity, business acumen and the like and was not qualifying his earlier evidence that he had been persuaded by the appellant to draw money in favour of Badrum. There needed to be established a causal connection between the deception by the appellant (of which there was evidence) and the obtaining of the money. R v Ho & Anor 1988-89 39 A Crim R 145. His Honour did not err in leaving the count for deliberation upon by the jury.  
     
      
       
        
       Grounds 1, 2 and 8 
        
       
      
    43    These grounds relate to the continuance of the trial after the legal representatives of the appellant had withdrawn. I interpolate that attention was drawn to District Court Criminal Procedure Rule 5 relating to leave to withdraw and the apparent absence of reference to formal compliance with it. It is abundantly clear that the trial judge impliedly granted any necessary leave and I do not regard any non-compliance as germane to the central issue of whether the continuance of the trial in the circumstances should have been seen to be, or was, unfair.  
     
      
       
      
    44    I should trace some events. On 2 March 1998 his Honour was asked to keep the jury waiting to enable some discussion between counsel and for instructions to be taken. After some time counsel returned to Court, and in the absence of the jury, senior counsel indicated that a matter of great concern had arisen and that he could not continue to act for the appellant until he received some firm instructions from his solicitor. His Honour commented that this was very cryptic but that it had to be so. The matter was adjourned until the following day. 
     
      
       
      
    45    On the next morning senior counsel told his Honour that neither he nor the solicitor instructing him could continue to appear for the appellant. Junior counsel substantially took the same course. Senior counsel expressed a preference not to detail the reasons for his action and his Honour did not press the matter. On the previous day it had been said that the perceived problem had nothing to do with funding or the like. Senior counsel acknowledged that the Court, the Crown and the appellant would be placed in difficult positions but he stated that he was fortified in his view in the light of the appellant’s previous occupation and understanding of “certain rules”. The appellant was formerly a solicitor. 
     
      
       
      
    46    There followed some discussion about possible arrangements for alternative representation. Later the appellant told his Honour that he had made approaches to several solicitors. Given description of the issues one particular solicitor, experienced in the appropriate area of practice, estimated necessary preparation time in terms of weeks. 
     
      
       
      
    47    The appellant said that he wished to continue to defend the matter but was not capable of doing it (in the sense of representing himself) and added: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “There is just one thing I would like to explain if I may and that is while I accept responsibility for something that occurred which is the reason why (senior counsel) can no longer act, this was not a deliberate act on my part or a secretive receiptive (sic) action. It was circumstances that were outside my control.” 
         
        
       
      
    48    In further exchange, he stated that he was not experienced in criminal law and had never practised in the field. This was not challenged although this was not the appellant’s first practical encounter with it, as can be gleaned from Adler v District Court of New South Wales 1990 19 NSWLR 317. 
     
      
       
      
    49    Later on 3 March, his Honour permitted the jury to separate. As a result of what was said to the jury the appellant enquired about being granted an adjournment without the trial being aborted. 
     
      
       
      
    50    On 4 March the learned trial judge ruled that the matter was to proceed despite the absence of representation for the appellant. The hearing, however, was not resumed until 12 March. In the meantime bail was granted to the appellant to enable him to attend to matters in connection with preparation of his defence.  
     
      
       
      
    51    His Honour approached the issues in express application of the principle that a trial of the nature then underway should not proceed with the accused unrepresented except in exceptional circumstances. The test was correct and in conformity with Dietrich v The Queen 1992 177 CLR 292. Like a decision to adjourn or to grant a stay, the decision to proceed is made in the exercise of discretion and that exercise is invulnerable on appeal unless there is error disclosed by demonstration that the judge has acted on a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, mistaken the facts or does not take into account some material consideration: House v The King 1936 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
       
      
    52    So far as the Court has been made aware, the event or circumstance which led to the withdrawal of the lawyers remains known only to those involved. It was complained that his Honour ought not to have made the relevant ruling in the absence of that knowledge, but confidentiality derived from legal professional privilege and the power of waiver reposed with the appellant himself. He did not choose to exercise it.  
     
      
       
      
    53    In his reasons his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(Senior Counsel) is an experienced senior counsel particularly in criminal matters, I would venture to opine. For him to say that his view as to the rightness, and the other lawyer’s decision to withdraw being fortified because of the accused’s previous occupation and understanding of the Rules, indicates to me that (senior counsel) at least is of the view that the accused would not be disadvantaged as some may be by the fact that his representatives had decided to take the action that they have.” 
         
        
       
      
    54    It was argued that his Honour was in effect adopting the view of counsel (as to reduced disadvantage) rather than assessing the matter for himself. Read as a whole, the interlocutory judgment shows that his Honour did not do this. On fair construction, he was saying that he shared the fortification apparently experienced by the other lawyers.  
     
      
       
      
    55    The essential issue on appeal is whether, viewed in the light of the principles abovementioned, discretion has miscarried. His Honour found that this was an exceptional case. He referred to a number of matters and it is plain that he based his final conclusion upon the combined effect of them. If the jury were to be discharged, there would be considerable delay in commencing a new trial. It was conceded by the appellant that, if that were to happen he would be unlikely to gain release on bail. Although the detail was unrevealed, the appellant also conceded that it was his fault that his then current representatives could no longer act for him, subject to the rider that his conduct was not deliberate. His Honour found that the appellant was a person of considerable attainment and intelligence and experienced both legally and commercially. He observed that, up until then, the appellant had been active in instructing counsel, passing notes to them and he inferred that counsel were asking questions on the appellant’s direct instructions. It was argued that his Honour could not know whether the contents of any such note were useful or even relevant. That is so, but it was not disputed that any investment scheme (to use a neutral expression) was devised and put into practice by the appellant and it was a fair inference that he would have to be the source of instruction about matters relating to his scheme and also any congress which he had with the witnesses who were being questioned by his counsel. His Honour observed for himself that the appellant was astute and capable of putting cogent argument on his own behalf, witness the argument on the very issue of whether the trial should proceed. Most of the investors had been called and cross examined by counsel before the withdrawal. In essence there was a pattern to the questioning of these investors and his Honour found that there was no one who, in his estimation, the appellant could not “handle”. 
     
      
       
      
    56    None of the foregoing was extraneous or irrelevant. No mistake of fact has been demonstrated.  
     
      
       
      
    57    Attention was drawn to an exchange recorded in the transcript of 24 March when the appellant was seeking an adjournment to prepare the (cross) examination of a particular witness. The appellant pointed out that he had not asked for extra time in respect of the first four witnesses (called since the departure of his lawyers) because he was prepared and felt competent and ready. This was said, of course, in the absence of the jury but it caused his Honour to ask whether the appellant was saying that he did not want the trial aborted and the appellant replied that he had not changed his view about that. This response might be understood as meaning that he adhered to the position noted in the interlocutory judgment of 4 March that he was adamant that he did not wish the trial to proceed and that he felt not competent to conduct his defence. However his Honour, perhaps understandably confused as to what position the appellant was adopting, asked: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I want to be perfectly clear at this point, you are saying that you want to go on unrepresented”. 
         
        
        
       The appellant replied: 
        
        
         
         “I do, your Honour. I have never said differently.” 
         
        
       
      
    58    I do not consider that the words last used should be given great weight. There was clearly confusion from time to time. However, the Court is not only in a position to examine the correctness of his Honour’s finding on 4 March that continuance would not lead to a trial which was unfair but to examine whether in the event it was so unfair. 
     
      
       
      
    59    There is a discrete post trial matter which requires attention. The copy letter marked Exhibit A in the appeal is on the letterhead of an organization giving an address in the Republic of Panama. It is dated 8 April 1998 which is well within the span of trial and, if the date is accurate, it had the capacity to be despatched, received and produced at it. The content of the letter is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        
        
         
         “Mr George Adler 
         
        
        C/- 262 Castlereagh Street 
        
        SIDNEY NSW 2000 
        
        
        
         
         Dear Sir: 
         
        
        
        
         
         We refer to previous correspondence and wish to confirm that this company has establish of a credit line in which you shared access in providing guarantees to various Canadian banks in connection with the trading of Canadian Government Treasury Bonds over various years, but more particularly between December 1992 and December 1993. 
         
        
        
         
         We are able to confirm your participation in the use of this line of credit during the above period and for the above purpose and we can confirm that your participation exceeded the sum of $2 million and that such participation was in varying amounts. 
         
        
        
         
         We are able to confirm that in particular, the credit line facility was extended at your request to various banks in France, Switzerland and Canada. 
         
        
        
         
         We confirm that all your requests were made by telephone communication and that the activation of the credit line was made directly at your request. 
         
        
        
         
         We further confirm that at no time has any Australian authority contacted us concerning any transactions you may have conducted with our institution. We do confirm that you were the only person in contact with us concerning these transactions. 
         
        
        
         
         Unfortunately, our records are no longer complete and we are unable to assist you with documentation concerning the above. 
         
        
        
         
         If we can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 
         
        
        
         
         Yours faithfully, 
         
        
        
         
         ANIBAL ILLUECA HERRANDO 
         
        
        Assistant Management.” 
        
         
        
         
       
      
    60    It can readily be perceived that the text of the letter appears supportive of at least part of the contention of the appellant concerning the existence of and the use of a line of credit. However, the letter itself could not simply have been tendered at the trial. It was acknowledged by senior counsel appearing in the appeal that the existence of this letter had been known to the appellant’s present advisers since August 1999. Nothing is sought to be put before the Court on this issue apart from the letter itself. There is no identification of the author of the letter beyond the subscription within it. There is no material gathered to authenticate it. There is nothing put before the Court to suggest that efforts have even been in train to either establish its genuineness or the integrity of any of its content. As at trial, the letter and its content was not admissible simply by tender. The Court received it on the limited basis of being able to look at its content for the purpose of hearing argument. Nothing else is put before the Court. On the bare face of it, there is no warrant for the Court acting upon it and I would reject the tender and the invitation to act upon the content as if it provided some evidence of fact.  
     
      
       
      
    61    Argument in support of these grounds included reference to an assortment of incidents and incidentals of the trial. It was noted that the transcript shows that when senior counsel commenced to respond to enquiry about what had happened during the adjournment the appellant had not been returned to the courtroom. His arrival was noted in the course of counsel’s response. It was said that his Honour should have had the unheard remarks repeated. The artificiality of this complaint is demonstrated by the absence of any attempt to relate it to any identified disadvantage to the appellant. The submission overlooks that the appellant was in due course supplied with a transcript and it is obvious that he was attending to its content. He did not at any time himself complain that the matter now sought to be canvassed was of any significance. 
     
      
       
      
    62    It was asserted that exchange between the trial judge and counsel determined adversely to the appellant, at least by innuendo, that the appellant might have admitted his guilt to his then counsel. It is not to any point whether a trial judge infers, is told, suspects, believes or is convinced of the guilt of an accused provided that situation is not allowed to contaminate the deliberations of the jury upon proof of guilt. Discussion of possible change of plea in the absence of the jury is irrelevant to any present issue. 
     
      
       
      
    63    The absence of specification of exactly why the lawyers were withdrawing has been noted above. It was obvious that his Honour therefore could not apprise the jury of the reason. It was important that he guard against the risk that the jury might infer that the withdrawal was a signal that the appellant was or might be guilty. This was done and I detect no error in the way that this issue was dealt with. 
     
      
       
      
    64    In the interlocutory judgment of 4 March, his Honour had said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Length should not be confused with difficulty and complexity. Although it is true to say that these counts involve some complexity. When boiled down the counts really are basically straightforward.” 
         
        
       
      
    65    From time to time in the charge to the jury references were made to the case being long and involved. Senior counsel appearing in the appeal sought to adopt these references as support for an assertion that the complexity was such that the trial of the unrepresented appellant should be categorized as having been unfair. Unfairness is, of course, the essential issue and whether the trial was unfair cannot be determined by labels such as difficult, straightforward, long, short, complex or plain.  
     
      
       
      
    66    Specifically in relation to ground 8, there was advanced a collection of instances alleged to manifest a failure by the trial judge to render appropriate assistance (as distinct from advising on matters of law) to the unrepresented accused then on trial.  
     
      
       
      
    67    As Samuels JA remarked in a different context, there are appeals of the fine tooth comb variety: R v Baraghith 1991 54 A Crim R 240. This appeal qualifies for that description especially in regard to these submissions. Nothing is to be gained by ritual repetition of the content of all the references. It suffices to record my conclusion that the trial judge did not fail to fulfil his duty to render appropriate assistance to the appellant where necessary. This was not at all a case where an uneducated, inarticulate and retiring personality was being overwhelmed by the legal process. The appellant was forceful and demonstrated an abundant capacity to advance his own interest and assertions. The amount of assistance required of his Honour must be proportioned to the need, which in the case of the appellant was not extensive.  
     
      
       
      
    68    I will deal however with one matter which was vigorously elaborated in oral argument. The cross examination of the appellant included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Q. This is your answer Mr Adler: ‘The line of credit was organized by Hottinger’s themselves. It could have been from one bank or a syndicate of individuals, or a series of banks’ That is what you told the Judge? 
         
        
        
         
         A. And that’s absolutely correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Ooh lah lah, Mr Adler. Tell me how Panama and Panamanian bank and individuals, a syndicate of individuals are a series of banks, are the same thing? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because the bank in Panama, Generale Sociale existed as a series of banks and a number of very, very wealthy people in the United States, South America and they put up credit lines on a continual basis. Not just for me or Badrum, but for major oil companies around the world. And God knows what else. 
         
        
        
         
         Every time you got a credit line established it sometimes comes from the bank and often comes from either the individuals who put up the security; it comes from a number of sources. It all revolves around a major institution called Generale Sociale, which is was what I told his Honour some days ago. That’s how the Panamanian credit line works.” 
         
        
       
      
    69    It was said that the introductory expostulation to the second question amounted to a denigration of the witness and exceeded the bounds of propriety required of a crown cross examiner. It is generally desirable that cross examination by counsel, whether appearing for the Crown or for an accused, be presented in a fair and forthright manner. But it is a far different thing to invite a court of error to intervene where there have been flourishes of language or attempts to achieve dramatic effect on the basis that this demonstrates miscarriage. Judgment on the good taste of what was said is neither appropriate nor required. The incident brings no weight into determining any issue in the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    70    Particulars to ground 2 refer to matters of which it is complained that the appellant was not advised of his right to object and the vice was said to be the admission of evidence which was irrelevant, or of which the probative value was outweighed by unfair prejudice to the appellant. The complaint particularized in ground 2(a) was formally withdrawn, it being recognized that the matter was essentially raised by counsel then appearing for the appellant at trial.  
     
      
       
      
    71    The matters particularized in 2(b), (c) and (d) provoked comment from counsel for the Crown on the appeal that he could not understand what the problem was. I share that position. None of these matters required information or assistance from or direction by the trial judge. It was relevant for the Crown to show that the money provided by the investors was no longer included in the assets of Badrum. It was relevant to show that money had not been refunded and potentially relevant to show that the appellant had provided the cheque (although dishonoured by the bank) to rebut a possible posture of the appellant seeking to distance himself from transaction.  
     
      
       
      
    72    Ultimately a judgment must be made whether, on examination of the issues litigated, the nature and quality of the evidence, the contribution or the absence of assistance by the trial judge, the charge to the jury and the general conduct of the trial, it ought to be categorized as unfair. In my judgment it was not. 
     
      
       
      
    73    I would dismiss the appeal.

       REGINA v Robert John MARSHALL 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was convicted after a plea of not guilty on a charge of armed robbery with a knife, contrary to s97 (1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The Appellant had elected to be tried by judge alone. Judge Twigg QC DCJ found the Appellant guilty on 11 December 1998. 
     
      
    2    The alleged offence occurred on 2 September 1995 at Bomaderry when the victim, Mr Frederick Robert Sams, the proprietor of a liquor shop at Bomaderry, was robbed of about $1,400 in cash. 
     
      
    3    The events of that evening commenced with a male person entering the shop and looking at various items on the shelf. Mr Sams gave evidence this man was wearing a grey coloured flannelette shirt with a hood which enclosed his head so only the face at the front was visible. 
     
      
    4    After looking around the shop, that male person left, having engaged in a brief conversation with Mr Sams. 
     
      
    5    About an hour later on that same evening, another male entered the shop. This person had a goatee type beard and moustache, which Mr Sams said was similar to the first male. Indeed, Mr Sams said, the two males ""could almost be twin brothers"". He confirmed in his evidence in the case that ""they looked the same"". 
     
      
    6    On the second occasion, the man produced a knife from behind his back. Mr Sams said that he could see it was shiny with a clean edge of about 20 cms in length. The handle appeared to be black. Mr Sams said that the man forced the knife against the victim’s chest and threatened him unless he opened the till. Mr Sams had a opportunity to see his assailant, albeit in circumstances which induced significant fear. As the second man left the store with the money, Mr Sams noticed the first male was standing alone outside the front door with his back to him and the hood still over his head. The two then ran away from the shop. These events occurred on 2 September 1995. 
     
      
    7    On 5 September 1995, Detective Whitehall, the officer in charge of the case, invited Mr Sams to come to the police station. At the station he examined photographs. Mr Sams did not recognise anyone depicted in those photographs. In fact, as subsequently emerged, but to which no reference was made in Detective Whitehall's original statement, the photographs shown to Mr Sams at that time included ""two or three"" photographs of the Appellant. 
     
      
    8    Later on that same day, 5 September, the Appellant was arrested with respect to other matters. He was found in possession of a large serrated edge knife. Detective Whitehall called Mr Sams to the police station in order to see if he could identify the knife. During that period, Detective Whitehall went with the Appellant to his premises where a search was conducted. Although the police searched for clothing matching the description given by Mr Sams, neither those clothes, nor any other evidence implicating the Appellant in the robbery, was found. 
     
      
    9    When Detective Whitehall and the Appellant returned to the station, by reason of the construction work going on, they entered through the area where Mr Sams was in attendance standing at the counter and inspecting the knife. Mr Sams said that he identified the Appellant as the same person who had pointed the knife to his chest and stolen the money from him. He said in his evidence he had made the identification at first to Senior Constable Keith with whom he was talking and who later went and fetched Detective Whitehall. Mr Sams then repeated the identification. Senior Constable Keith, however, failed to confirm that any identification was made to him. 
     
      
    10    When Detective Whitehall brought the Appellant through the police station, the Appellant was in fact handcuffed with some cloth, perhaps a t-shirt, draped over the handcuffs. 
     
      
    11    However, in his evidence, Mr Sams expressed an opinion that it was obvious that the person was in custody, and indeed he was in the custody, or appeared to be in the custody of the very detective whom Mr Sams then knew was conducting the investigation. I should note Detective Whitehall expressed the same opinion, that it would have been obvious to any person that the Appellant was at that time in custody. 
     
      
    12    It is clear that without the identification on the part of the victim the police had no case against the Appellant. The sole issue in the case was identification. 
     
      
    13    The issue was raised on a voir dire to determine whether or not the victim's evidence of identification should be excluded, particularly under s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecution if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant"". 
        
       
      
    14    His Honour, in his judgment on the voir dire, recognised the well known difficulties with identification evidence and the obligation to direct a jury - in the present case, relevantly, to direct himself - with respect to those dangers. His Honour outlined the facts of the case as they had been presented to him for the purpose of the voir dire and, in the event, admitted the evidence. His Honour found that the evidence of identification had ""high probative value"". However, he also found that the accused was not prejudiced in any way other than in the respect that all evidence that might lead to conviction is prejudicial. 
     
      
    15    The prejudice often associated with identification evidence is that, although mistaken, it is frequently given with great force and assurance by the person who made the identification. These are matters about which witnesses frequently refuse to admit the possibility that they might have erred and, accordingly, give evidence in a particularly definitive form. 
     
      
    16    It appears that his Honour was impressed by the way Mr Sams gave the evidence of identification and indeed made reference to Mr Sams' demeanour. However, it is the experience of the Court with respect to identification, that demeanour can be misleading. 
     
      
    17    The factual issues which were before his Honour at the time of the voir dire concerned the circumstance that the victim had said that the two individuals were virtually of identical appearance. Furthermore, there was evidence that, at the relevant time, the Appellant did not have a goatee beard, as the armed robber was said to have had. 
     
      
    18    There are two grounds of appeal. The first is that his Honour erred in admitting the evidence of identification. The second is that there was a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    19    The first ground of appeal proceeded on the basis of material that was before his Honour at the time of the voir dire. The second ground of appeal introduced the additional elements going to the admissibility of the identification evidence which emerged during the conduct of the trial. 
     
      
    20    In the course of his reasons on the voir dire, Twigg DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is clear from the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission that a trial judge in criminal cases has a discretion to exclude evidence if it is more prejudicial than probative. There are some matters of concern in relation to the exercise of this discretion. On my understanding I must balance the probative value of the evidence against the danger of prejudice or the possibility of an unfair trial without any preconceptions."" 
        
       
      
    21    His Honour's reference to the ""discretion"" is in error. As Sheller JA pointed out in R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61 at [20]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected."" 
        
       
      
    22    The written submissions in this case proceeded on the basis that the admissibility of the evidence was to be determined in accordance with the material before the trial judge on the voir dire. In a sense that may be so. That does not, however, mean that the trial judge is not obliged to revisit the issue as and when the factual assumptions upon which his decision on the voir dire was based, prove to be incorrect. 
     
      
    23    Hunt CJ at CL with whom Gleeson CJ and Abadee J agreed said in R v Tugaga (1994) 74 A Crim R 190 at 193-194: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is also always open to the trial judge in the appropriate case to withdraw evidence of identification from the jury's consideration where, after it has been given, its quality has been demonstrated to be such that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. ... The occasion for its exercise would usually be where the weakness of the evidence (and thus its disproportionate prejudice) had not been established in any voir dire examination, although it would not depend upon whether such an examination had been held; or it may arise simply because the judge had altered a conclusion formed upon an earlier objection, although again it would not depend on whether there had been such an earlier objection."" 
        
       
      
    24    In the course of his reasons on the voir dire, Twigg DCJ referred to the occasion on which the Appellant, together with Detective Whitehall entered the police station at the time of which the first identification was made. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is true to say that that was in a situation where it was a police station and that the person the accused was walking with was the police, there is no suggestion that he was being restrained or that he was handcuffed or in any way giving the appearance of being under arrest. It may well be that that sort of evidence might come out if there is oral evidence before me."" 
        
       
      
    25    Indeed, that event transpired. Detective Whitehall agreed in cross-examination that the accused was in fact handcuffed. Both Mr Sams and Detective Whitehall, as I have indicated above, agreed that it was obvious that the Appellant was at that stage in custody. 
     
      
    26    Accordingly, the danger of unfair prejudice from an identification, which often arises where such identification is made in circumstances in which the person being identified appears to be suspected of, or to have been charged with, a crime, existed in this case. 
     
      
    27    Perhaps even more significantly, the evidence at the trial, but not before the trial judge on the voir dire, created the situation which is often eferred to as a ""displacement effect"". 
     
      
    28    As indicated above, Mr Sams had himself seen two or three photographs of the accused that morning. It is of some significance for present purposes that he did not identify the Appellant from those photographs. Of determinative significance, in my opinion, is the possibility that when Mr Sams made the identification of the Appellant at the police station, he was in fact recalling, no doubt subconsciously, the features of the photographs he had been shown that morning, rather than the features of the person who had committed the robbery. This, of course, is the displacement effect. 
     
      
    29    This is a clear example of the dangers of identification evidence. It has been identified in numerous authorities. I give one example. In Alexander v The Queen (1979-1980) 145 CLR 395 at 409 Stephen J said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Lastly, there is the 'displacement effect'. Having been shown a photograph, the memory of it may be more clearly retained than the memory of the original sighting of the offender and may, accordingly, displace that original memory. Any subsequent face-to-face identification, in court or in an identification parade, may, on the identifying witness's part, in truth involve a matching of the man so identified with the remembered photograph, which has displaced in his memory his recollection of the original sighting."" 
        
       
      
    30    See also per Mason J at 426; and R v Carusi (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 at 55 per Hunt CJ at CL. 
     
      
    31    In these circumstances, the probative value of the identification is diminished. No application was made to his Honour to revisit the question of admissibility. His Honour went on, in the course of his trial judgment, to warn himself about the dangers of identification evidence, and his Honour made reference in the course of his final judgment to: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The highly suggestive circumstances of the identification in the police station, that is whether it is akin to a court room identification with the likelihood of the person in custody being the offender is suggested by the circumstances."" 
        
       
      
    32    This was no doubt a reference to his Honour's factual finding earlier in the final judgment on the basis of the evidence that was before him that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The accused was handcuffed in front of his body although he had a t-shirt loosely covering his hands and the handcuffs"". 
        
       
      
    33    During the course of his final judgment, his Honour made reference to the fact that the prosecutor had conceded in his final submissions that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown case was not as favourable to the prosecution as it was at the end of the voir dire"". 
        
       
      
    34    His Honour went on to explain this concession in the following manner: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He was referring to the fact that during the voir dire the evidence was that the victim was shown a bundle of photos after the accused had declined the option of an identification parade. But it was said that these photographs did not include a photo of the accused. The evidence during the trial disclosed that the bundle of photographs did indeed contain at least two photos of the accused.  
        
       
       
        
        The inference to be drawn from that submission is that the victim did not identify the accused from photos"". 
        
       
      
    35    His Honour's reasoning in this respect is too narrow. It is not simply the failure to identify the accused, which has to be weighed in the balance in assessing the subsequent act of identification. Of more significance is that this action of showing photographs to the person who subsequently made the identification created the possibility of a displacement effect. His Honour makes no reference in his reasons to this issue of displacement. In this, I believe, his Honour erred. 
     
      
    36    The evidence of identification of the knife was equivocal if not contradictory. No other evidence connected the accused to the crime, other than the identification by Mr Sams. 
     
      
    37    In the light of the evidence, both of the adverse effect from identifying a person in custody, and in this case, the displacement effect - either effect often being enough - this is an unusual case. It is unusual to find the co-existence of both of these distorting effects in an identification case. 
     
      
    38    In my view, by reason of that combination and the absence of any other evidence, the identification evidence was of limited probative value and of a high order of prejudice. I do not believe that on this evidence a conviction was reasonably open. The trier of fact, in this case the trial judge, ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. In my opinion, an innocent man may have been convicted. 
     
      
    39    HEYDON JA: I agree. 
     
      
    40    JAMES J: I agree. 
     
      
    41    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is: Appeal is allowed. Direct a verdict of acquittal. 
     
      
    42    SPIGELMAN CJ: On 9 July 1999 Twigg DCJ gave two separate judgments on sentence, one related to the offence of armed robbery with respect to which the Court proposes to allow the appeal against conviction. However on the same day his Honour sentenced the Applicant with respect to other charges relating to events that had occurred between 5 August 1995 and 7 August 1995. There were three charges involved, first that he did break and enter a dwelling house and steal certain items including a television set but also other items. To this the Applicant pleaded not guilty. 
     
      
    43    With respect to the second alternative charge there was a charge that the Applicant did dispose of a television set that had been stolen. To this charge he pleaded guilty. The third charge was a charge of obtaining a sum of money by false pretences as to the title to a National Bank cheque with an intent to defraud. To this charge he also pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    44    The prosecution accepted the plea to the two charges in full discharge of the indictment. I should indicate that this was a separate indictment from that involving the armed robbery. 
     
      
    45    His Honour gave careful and detailed reasons for each of the sentences to which he had come. He gave separate sentences for the three different offences. However, his Honour did take into account the fact that the Applicant was being sentenced for offences at the same time and that there would be some necessity to consider the totality of the sentence with respect to the charges. It is not necessary to outline the circumstances of the two charges with respect to which the Applicant pleaded guilty. They are fully set out in his Honour's reasons on sentence. 
     
      
    46    His Honour also made reference to the prior convictions for similar offences by the Applicant, which were matters appropriate to be taken into account with respect to the sentencing on the separate charges. In the course of his reasons for the two charges to which the Applicant pleaded guilty his Honour said, after making reference to the offence involving the armed robbery at the liquor store: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is appropriate that I take all matters into account when considering the totality of sentence. I propose to accede to the submission of defence counsel and not opposed by prosecution that any sentences on these two matters should run concurrently with any sentence I impose in respect of the armed robbery"". 
        
       
      
    47    At the end of his reasons for sentence his Honour sentenced the Applicant to two fixed terms for those two charges. With respect to the count of disposing of stolen property, he was sentenced to a fixed term of two years penal servitude to commence on 9 July 1999. With respect to the charge of false pretences, he was sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months to commence on 9 July 1999. His Honour was at that stage aware that he proposed to sentence the Applicant on the second indictment to a minimum term of three years and six months and an additional term of two years and six months, the minimum term also commencing on 9 July 1999. 
     
      
    48    One of the submissions made in the course of the submissions by Mr Craddock, appearing for the Applicant was that there was no express reference in his Honour's sentence to a period of some twenty days pre-sentence custody that had been served. However, his Honour referred to that fact and there is no reason to believe that his Honour failed to take it into account in fixing the terms that he did, and the date on which they were to commence. 
     
      
    49    At the end of his reasons for sentence with respect to the two charges presently under consideration his Honour identified the quantum of the fixed terms he proposed to impose and said in each case that the reason for the fixed term was because of the penalty he was imposing in respect of the armed robbery. 
     
      
    50    By this reference I understand his Honour to be saying that but for the fact that a longer minimum term was to be imposed with respect to the armed robbery, his Honour had not contemplated the imposition of a different sentence with respect to these two charges, encompassing a minimum term and an additional term. Nevertheless, with respect to each of these charges it appears clearly from his Honour's reasons that his Honour gave very careful consideration to the separate nature of the offences and also to the prisoner's significant relevant record with respect to offences of a cognate character. In my opinion the fixed term of two years for one offence and one year for the other offence should be understood as what his Honour would otherwise have imposed as a minimum term, if his Honour had been sentencing on the basis of identifying both a minimum term and an additional term. 
     
      
    51    If this Court were to intervene in any way for any reason in the sentence of his Honour with respect to those two charges, then in the exercise of the discretion of the Court I would not fix a non-parole period of any lesser term than the two years for the second of the charges in the first indictment and one year for the third of the charges in the first indictment. 
     
      
    52    For these reasons in my opinion leave to appeal with respect to sentence on the convictions pursuant to that indictment should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    53    HEYDON JA: I agree. 
     
      
    54    JAMES J: I also agree. 
     
      
    55    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are that the appeal against conviction with respect to the armed robbery is allowed and a verdict of acquittal is entered. With respect to the appeal against sentence leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL CA 40801/99  POWELL, JA STEIN, JA HODGSON, CJ in Eq. Tuesday 16 May 2000 
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
     CHANDLER V. THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC  
      
     PROSECUTIONS & ANOR 
     . 
     
    1   POWELL JA: I have read in draft the Judgment which has been prepared by Hodgson CJ in Eq with which Judgment I understand Stein JA to agree. I regret, however, that I am unable to concur with their Honours' views as to the proper disposition of the present application . 
    2   I note that, in the course of his Judgment (para. 17), Hodgson CJ in Eq expresses the view that the use of the word ""charged"" in s.5(2) of the Drug Court Act indicates that it is the elements of the charge which are significant and not the particular conduct which had led to the subject person being charged, and expresses his agreement with the Judgment of Judge Murrell in R. v. Ranse  (1999) NSWDRGC 2 in this respect. Despite his Honour having expressed that view, he, later in the course of his Judgment (para. 30), expresses the opinion that, so long as the conduct leading to the charge is voluntary, the circumstance that there may be no advertence to its dangerousness, and no intention of a violent outcome, does not prevent the conduct being called violent conduct, an opinion which, since it places stress on the actual conduct, and the consequences of that conduct which led to the subject person being charged is, in my view, difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with his Honour's earlier expressed view that is it is the elements of the offence charged rather than the actual conduct which is the determinant for the purposes of s.5(2)(d) of the Act. A similar difference in approach can be seen between the Judgment of Judge Murell in R v. Ranse  supra and her Honour's later Judgment in R. v. Sloane  (1999) NSWDRGC 3, where her Honour held that a person charged with the offence of robbery (Crimes Act 1900 s.94) where the robbery involved a threat rather than the actual use of physical force, is not excluded from the class of ""eligible persons"". 
    3   If I may, with respect, say so, the approach apparently favoured by Hodgson CJ in Eq and Judge Murrell reflects a degree of confusion of thought, as is made apparent by the following passage in the Judgment of Judge Murrell, at first instance, in the present case where her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In my view, the expression 'violent conduct' looks at the nature of the relevant conduct rather than the intent of the conduct. If violence  
        in the sense of actual force 
         is an element of the offence in question, the offence is 'an offence involving violent conduct' and the offender is excluded."" 
        
       
      
      
      (my emphasis) 
      
      
    4   A similar degree of confusion of thought is revealed by the following passage in the Second Reading speech of the Hon. Paul Whelan, Minister for Police, when the Bill which became the Drug Court Act 1998 (""the Drug Court Act"") was in the Assembly  Parliamentary Debates - Assembly 27 October 1998 p. 9031: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Drug Court programme will deal only with offenders who commit certain categories of offence. These offences will be mainly non-violent theft offences. Those offenders who commit sexual offences and offences involving violent conduct will not be eligible. The types of offences that will be included are break, enter and steal, fraud and forgery offences, offences involving stealing from a person  
        or unarmed robberies, provided there is no violence 
        , possession and use of prohibited drugs, or dealing in quantities of prohibited drugs below the indictable limit."" 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (my emphasis) 
        
       
      
      
    5   The offences of robbery - the subject of the charge in R. v. Sloane  supra - assault with intent to rob and steal from the person - the subject of the charge in R v. Ranse  supra - are all dealt with together in s.94 of the Crimes Act 1900 and the same maximum penalty is prescribed for each. As was said by Smart AJ in R v. Delk  (1999) 46 NSWLR 340, 344: 
     
      
       
        
        ""These offences are seen as part of an overall scheme dealing with the graver thefts  
        where there is violence or putting in fear or the potential for violence exist 
        ."" 
        
       
      
      
      (my emphasis) 
      
      
    6   While violence is not a necessary ingredient in the offence of stealing from the person, the elements necessary to constitute the crime of robbery are: 
     
      
     1. the unlawful taking and carrying away of property of some value; 
      
      
     2. from the person of another, or in his presence, or from under his immediate and personal care and protection; 
      
      
     3. against his will; 
      
      
     4. either by force or putting him in fear; and 
      
      
     5. with the intention of permanently depriving a person of such property. 
      
      
     The essence of the offence is that violence is done, or threatened, to the person having custody of the property, who stands between the robber and the property in order to prevent or overcome his resistance and to oblige him to part with the property and submit to the thief stealing it; the offence against the person and the theft are combined ( 
     Smith v. Desmond 
       
      [1965] AC 960 
     ). 
      
    7   It follows that, while a sudden taking or snatching of property from a person unawares is not, of itself, sufficient to constitute robbery (R v. Donnally  (1799) 1 Leach 193; R v. Walls  (1845) 2 Carrington & Kirwan 214), it may constitute robbery in a case where there has been a struggle or some injury (R v. Gnosil  (1824) 1 Carrington & Payne 304; R v. Lapier  (1784) 1 Leach 320; R v. Moore  (1784) 1 Leach 335; R v. Mason  (1820) Russell & Ryan 419). 
    8   What I have written will make it clear that, although violent conduct, or the threat of violent conduct, is an essential element of the crime of robbery, physical injury to the victim is not. Such injury is, however, an element in the crimes provided for by successive sections, s. 95 - robbery or assault with intent to rob in circumstances of aggravation - s. 96 - robbery with wounding - s. 98 - robbery with arms or in company and wounding - the first of which additional crimes carries a maximum sentence of twenty years and the second and third of which additional crimes carries a maximum sentence of twenty-five years. 
    9   The confusion of thought involved in the approach in fact adopted by Judge Murrell in the two cases - R v. Ranse and R v. Sloane- to which I have earlier referred, is pointed up by the facts in each case.  
    10   In R v. Ranse the relevant charge with which her Honour was concerned to deal was that the accused ""did steal a chattel, i.e. a handbag, $40.00 and personal papers the property of Hong Lin from the person of Hong Lin"". The brief facts upon which the Crown relied in support of that charge, as recorded by her Honour were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At about 5.00 p.m. on 23 February 1999, Mrs. Hong Lin was in the underground car park of her residence in Manchester Street, Merrylands, having just returned from work. She was with her son and daughter. Vehicle TAT-227 approached and the accused got out of the car. He asked Mrs. Lin if she knew a person from one of the flats. She said she didn't know. She spoke to her son and then felt the accused pull her bag from her right arm. She fell onto her right side. The bag strap broke. The accused got into the car and drove away. He was unaccompanied. Mrs. Lin observed the details of the number plates as he drove away. As a result of her fall, Mrs. Lin had bruise on her right arm and a sore right hip. Her property was found in the vehicle at the time of the accused's arrest."" 
        
       
      
      
      
     Despite the fact that, as her Honour observed, the circumstances could well have warranted a conviction for robbery or assault with intent to rob, her Honour held that as violence is not an element of the offence of steal from the person - the offence with which the accused was charged - the accused was not rendered ineligible by the provisions of s.5(2) of the Drug Court Act.  
      
    11   In R v. Sloane the accused was indicted for the offence of robbery and indicated an intention to plead guilty to that offence. As recorded by her Honour, the facts upon which the Crown relied to establish that offence were: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… that on 22 November 1998, the accused took a small serrated steak knife from his home and placed it under his shirt. At about 8.40 p.m. he entered a chemist shop close to his home. He walked 'calmly' up to a shop assistant, placed a plastic bag on the counter in front of her and said: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
          'This is a hold-up. Put the notes in the bag. Don't touch anything. Don't press anything. If customers come in don't say or do anything.' 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        According to this shop assistant, the accused, 'wasn't violent'. The pharmacist who was present in the shop activated a pocket hold-up alarm. She walked to the cash register, opened it and handed $75.00 to the accused. The accused ran from the shop. Although the pharmacist noticed the accused had his right hand inside his open shirt and saw something inside his shirt, neither the pharmacist nor the shop assistant was aware that the accused was armed with a steak knife.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Three weeks later, police attended the accused's home. He ran and hid under the house. When he emerged he admitted the robbery. He produced the clothes which he had worn at the time of the robbery and pointed out the knife which he had concealed under his shirt. He said that he had taken the knife in case he was confronted. He said that he had used the proceeds of the robbery to purchase heroin."" 
        
       
      
      
      
     Despite the fact that violence, or the threat of violence, is an essential element of the crime of robbery, Judge Murrell held ""that a person charged under s. 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a robbery which involves a threat (rather than the actual use of physical violence) is not thereby excluded from the s.5 class of 'eligible persons'"", a conclusion which, if I may say so, I find difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with the approach taken by her Honour in  
     R. v. Ranse  
      supra 
     . 
      
    12   The confusion of thought to which I have earlier referred is continued in the Judgment of Judge Murrell at first instance in the present case in which, as I have earlier recorded, her Honour held that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… the expression 'violent conduct' looks at the nature of the relevant conduct rather than the intent of the conduct. If violence in the sense of actual violence is an element of the offence in question, the offence is 'an offence involving violent conduct' and the offender is excluded."" 
        
       
      
      
      
     Having so determined, her Honour continued: 
      
      
       
        
        ""The accused is charged with offences under s.52A of the Crimes Act 1900 which have as elements the driving of a vehicle which is involved in an impact with a person. Such conduct is violent conduct, i.e. conduct involving actual force. I accept the Crown's submission that this is a case of actual violence. Therefore s.5(2)(b) of the Act renders the accused ineligible for sentence under s.7(2) of the Act."" 
        
       
      
      
    13   In Giorgianni v. The Queen  (1984-1985) 156 CLR 473; 58 ALR 641, a case in which the High Court was concerned to deal with s.52A of the Crimes Act in an earlier form, Mason J (as he then was) said  CLR at 490; ALR at 563: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The misdemeanour created by s.52A is capable of being committed by a person who is the driver of a motor vehicle. The section was introduced because of the reluctance of juries to convict motorists of manslaughter in the factual circumstances which it envisages:  
        Attorney-General (NSW) v. Bindoff 
          
        ((1953) 53 SR(NSW) 489, at p.490). However it is apparent from the terms of the section that mens rea is not an essential element of the misdemeanour which it creates. In order to support a conviction under s.52A it is sufficient that death or grievous bodily harm to a person was occasioned through the specified means at a time when the defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug or at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public. It is well settled that the test for determining whether the defendant was driving 'in a manner dangerous to the public' is an objective one which takes into account 'all matter s connected with the management and control of a car by a driver when it is being driven': ( 
        R v. Coventry 
         ((1938) 59 CLR 633, at p.639). Those matters of course include the mechanical condition of the motor vehicle: cf  
        Reg v. Spurge 
         ([1961] 2 QB 205;  
        Reg v. Robert Millar(Contractors) Limited 
         ([1970] 2 QB 54). But the language of the section does not exclude the operation of a defence of mistake of fact on reasonable grounds and the defendant will not be liable in a case in which the dangerous manner of driving is due to a mechanical defect if neither knew nor ought to have known the existence of that defect:  
        R v. Coventry 
          
         p. 638 
        ; Reg v Spurge 
          
         supra 
        . 
        "" 
        
       
      
      
      
     while Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ said  
      CLR at 499; ALR at 659 
     : 
      
      
       
        
        ""The manner in which a vehicle may be driven includes its mechanical condition and if that condition is defective, it may, by reason of that fact, be driven in a manner dangerous to the public: see  
        R v. Coventry  
         (1938) 59 CLR 633 esp at 639 
        ; Reg v. Spurge  
         [1961] 2 QB 605 
        ; Reg v. Robert Millar (Contractors) Limited  
        [1970] 2 QB 54. The offence created by s.52A does not require the prosecution to prove any state of mind on the part of the driver, although his act of driving must be conscious and voluntary and he may have a defence of mistake of fact on reasonable grounds:  
        R v. Coventry  
        (at p.638). It is unnecessary to pursue in this case whether the driver must establish such a defence or whether the effect of his raising it is to cast upon the Crown the ultimate burden of disproving it beyond reasonable doubt. It is sufficient to observe that the defence is available. Otherwise the mental state of the driver is irrelevant for the section imports an objective standard by which his driving is to be judged."" 
        
       
      
      
    14   In Jiminez v. The Queen  (1992) 173 CLR 572; 106 ALR 162, a case concerned with a charge of culpable driving contrary to s.52A of the Crimes Act 1900, as it was in June 1998, in which case the accused said that he had lost control of his motor vehicle when he fell asleep, the High Court, in a joint Judgment - Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ - said  CLR at 577 et seq; ALR at 165 et seq.: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Upon the evidence, it appears there was a short period of time after the applicant fell asleep and before the impact during which the applicant awoke and attempted to regain control of the car. It was not suggested that, while he was attempting to regain control, the applicant was driving dangerously. Drivers are often confronted with an emergency which requires them to take steps to avoid an accident. Even if the evasive action fails to avoid the accident it does not necessarily amount to driving in a dangerous manner. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        The offence of culpable driving as it applies to the present case requires a motor vehicle to have been driven in a manner dangerous to the public at the time of the impact which occasioned death. Even if the motor vehicle was not being driven dangerously at the precise moment of impact, a preceding period of driving in a manner dangerous may be so nearly contemporaneous with the impact as to satisfy this element of the offence. Contemporaneity is a question for the jury."" 
        
       
      
      
      
     and, then, after a reference to the Judgment of King CJ in  
     Reg v. Kroon 
       
      (1990) 52 A Crim R 15, 18  
     : 
      
      
       
        
        ""As King CJ recognises, where the question is whether a driver who falls asleep at the wheel is guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, the relevant period of driving is that which immediately precedes his falling asleep. Not only must the period be sufficiently contemporaneous with the time of impact to satisfy the requirement of s.52A but the driving during that period must be, in a practical sense, the cause of the impact and the death. The relevant period cannot be that during which the driver was asleep (because during that time his actions were not conscious or)  
         the words in parentheses do not appear in - and appear to have been omitted as a result of oversight from - the CLR, but appear in the ALR, report. 
         voluntary. And, for the reasons which we have given, if the driver's actions upon waking up amount to no more than an attempt to avoid an accident, it cannot be that period of driving. 
        
       
      
      
      ……… 
      
      
       
        
        It follows that for a driver to be guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public because of his tired or drowsy condition that condition must be such that, as a matter of objective fact, his driving in that condition is a danger to the public. Various matters will be relevant in reaching such a conclusion. The period of driving, the lighting conditions (including whether it was night or day) and the heating or ventilation of the vehicle are all relevant considerations. And, of course, it will be necessary to consider how tired the driver was. If there was a warning as to the onset of sleep that may be some evidence of the degree of his tiredness. And the period of driving before the accident and the amount of sleep that he had earlier had will also bear on the degree of his tiredness. But so far as 'driving in a manner dangerous' is concerned the issue is not whether there was or was not a warning of the onset of sleep, but whether the driver was so tired that, in the circumstances, his driving was a danger to the public. The various matters which bear on that question, and the way in which they bear on it, should be carefully drawn to the attention of the jury."" 
        
       
      
      
    15   As the passages from the Judgments of the High Court in Giorgianni v. The Queen  supra and Jiminez v. The Queen  supra make clear, while the essential elements of an offence under s.52A of the Crimes Act are, first, the driving by the accused in the manner, or while in the condition, provided for in s.52A(1)(a)-(c), s.52A(3)(a)-(c), and an impact - either in the conventional sense or in one or other of the senses provided for in s.52A(5), (6) - occasioning death or grievous bodily harm, each of which elements is to be regarded as contemporaneous in the sense discussed in those Judgments, violent conduct in the conventional sense is not an element of the offence. 
    16   This being so, it follows that, if - as I believe to be correct - when determining whether an accused is ""an eligible person"", the Drug Court is required to consider whether violent conduct is one of the elements of the offence with which the accused is charged, Judge Murrell erred in holding that violent conduct was an element of the offences with which the Claimant was charged in the present case. 
    17   In my view the Order sought in paragraph 1 of the Amended Summons, and the Declarations sought in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Amended Summons should be made and the proceedings should be remitted to the Drug Court to be dealt with according to law. The First Opponent should pay the Claimant's costs of the Summons. 
    18   STEIN JA: I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Hodgson CJ in Eq and agree with it and the orders his Honour proposes.  
    19   The question of construction of ‘an offence involving violent conduct’ in s 5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act 1998 is a difficult one and finely balanced. 
    20   In my opinion, the policy behind the legislation, taking into account its objects, scope and purpose, lead me to favour the construction reached by Hodgson CJ in Eq. In my view, offences against s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 are offences involving ‘violent conduct’. 
    21   HODGSON, CJ in Eq INTRODUCTION On 18th November 1998, the claimant Paul Chandler pleaded guilty to three charges: (1) that on 27th October 1997 at Bass Hill he did steal a motor vehicle; (2) that on 27th October 1997 at Bass Hill he did drive a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact occasioning death in circumstances of aggravation; and (3) that on 27th October 1997 at Bass Hill he did drive a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation. 
    22   On 11th May 1999, Judge Latham in the District Court referred the claimant to the Drug Court to be dealt with for these offences, pursuant to the Drug Court Act 1998.  
    23   On 16th June 1999, Judge Murrell, Senior Drug Court Judge, determined that the claimant had been charged with offences involving violent conduct within s.5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act, and that accordingly he was ineligible for sentence under s.7(2) of that Act. 
    24   By the Amended Summons in these proceedings, the claimant seeks declarations that the offences with which he was charged were not offences involving violent conduct within s.5(2) of the Drug Court Act, and consequential orders.  
    25   It is common ground now that the claimant was incorrectly charged, in that the circumstances of aggravation alleged to be involved were only introduced as circumstances of aggravation into s.52A of the Crimes Act on 16th January 1998. Accordingly, it is common ground that charges (2) and (3) will have to be amended so as to remove reference to circumstances of aggravation. The claimant intends to plead guilty to these amended charges. Accordingly, it is common ground that these proceedings should be determined on the assumption that the claimant is charged with these amended charges.  
    26   The particular circumstances of the offence may be summarised as follows. At 5.50pm on 27th October 1997, the claimant was driving a stolen motor vehicle on the Hume Highway at an estimated speed of 90kph in a 70kph zone. He changed lanes ""in an aggressive manner"" and proceeded to weave in and out of traffic. The front offside portion of his vehicle collided with the rear of the offside portion of another vehicle. He attempted to correct the vehicle but lost control of it. It veered at right angles across the roadway, mounted the median strip and became airborne. It landed on the roof of an oncoming white Laser vehicle, rolled into a blue Magna vehicle and came to rest upside-down. The driver of the Laser later died of injuries sustained in the collision, and her passenger suffered a mild brain injury.  
     
     LEGISLATION 
    27   The elements of the relevant charges are set out in s.52A(1), (3) and (5), in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        52A(1) A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:  
         
        (a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug; or  
         
        (b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons; or  
         
        (c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.  
         
        A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.  
         
         
        ...(2) 
         
        (3) A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:  
         
        (a) under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug; or  
         
        (b) at a speed dangerous to another person or persons; or  
         
        (c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.  
         
        A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.  
         
         
        ...(4) 
         
        (5) For the purposes of this section, the circumstances in which a vehicle is involved in an impact occasioning the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, a person include if the death or harm is occasioned through any of the following:  
         
        (a) the vehicle overturning or leaving a road while the person is being conveyed in or on that vehicle (whether as a passenger or otherwise);  
         
        (b) an impact between any object and the vehicle while the person is being conveyed in or on that vehicle (whether as a passenger or otherwise);  
         
        (c) an impact between the person and the vehicle;  
         
        (d) the impact of the vehicle with another vehicle or an object in, on or near which the person is at the time of the impact;  
         
        (e) an impact with anything on, or attached to, the vehicle;  
         
        (f) an impact with anything that is in motion through falling from the vehicle. 
         
        
       
      
    28   The matter requires consideration of some sections of the Drug Court Act. The objects of the Act are set out in s.3, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         3(1) The object of this Act is to reduce the level of criminal activity that results from drug dependency.  
          
         (2) This Act achieves that object by establishing a scheme under which drug dependent persons who are charged with criminal offences can be diverted into programs designed to eliminate, or at least reduce, their dependency on drugs.  
          
         (3) Reducing a person's dependency on drugs should reduce the person's need to resort to criminal activity to support that dependency and should also increase the person's ability to function as a law abiding citizen. 
         
        
       
      
    29   ""Eligible person"" is defined in s.5, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        5.(1) A person is an eligible person if:  
         
        (a) the person is charged with an offence, other than an offence referred to in subsection (2), and  
         
        (b) the facts alleged in connection with the offence, together with the person's antecedents and any other information available to the court, indicate that it is highly likely that the person will, if convicted, be required to serve a sentence of full-time imprisonment, and  
         
        (c) the person has pleaded guilty to, or indicated that he or she intends to plead guilty to, the offence, and  
         
        (d) the person appears to be dependent on the use of prohibited drugs (within the meaning of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) or other drugs prescribed by the regulations, and  
         
        (e) the person satisfies such other criteria as are prescribed by the regulations.  
         
         
        (2) A person is not an eligible person if the person is charged with:  
         
        (a) an offence punishable under Division 2 of Part 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, not being an offence that (under Part 9A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986) is capable of being dealt with summarily, or  
         
        (b) an offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault, or  
         
        (c) any other offence of a kind prescribed by the regulations. 
        
       
      
    30   Relevant provisions concerning acceptance into the program contemplated by the Act are ss.6 and 7, which are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        6(1) This section applies to such courts and proceedings as are prescribed by the regulations.  
         
        (2) It is the duty of a court before which a person is charged with an offence or to which a person appeals against a sentence imposed by some other court:  
         
        (a) to ascertain whether the person appears to be an eligible person, and  
         
        (b) if so, to ascertain whether the person is willing to be referred to the Drug Court to be dealt with for the offence, and  
         
        (c) if so, to refer the person to the Drug Court to be dealt with for the offence.  
         
        (3) The power conferred on a court by this section is to be exercised as soon as practicable after the person first comes before the court in connection with the offence, but may be exercised at any time:  
         
        (a) in the case of a court exercising functions under the Justices Act 1902, before the court has committed the person for trial or sentence in relation to that offence under Division 1 of Part 4 of that Act, and  
         
        (b) in any case, before the person is sentenced or re-sentenced for the offence. 
         
         
         
        7(1) This section applies to a person who has been referred to the Drug Court under section 6.  
         
        (2) The Drug Court may, under this section, convict and sentence a person who has pleaded guilty to the offence for which the person has been referred (whether before the referring court or the Drug Court) if, and only if, it is satisfied as to each of the following matters:  
         
        (a) that the person is an eligible person,  
         
        (b) that, having regard to the person's antecedents, it would be appropriate for the person to participate in a program under this Act,  
         
        (c) that facilities to supervise and control the person's participation in such a program are available, and have been allocated to the person, in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the regulations,  
         
        (d) that the person accepts the conditions imposed by this Act and the conditions that the Drug Court proposes to impose on the person (whether immediately or at some later date) as a consequence of his or her conviction and sentence under this section,  
         
        (e) that the person has been informed of the Drug Court's powers under Division 2 and of the respective consequences, as regards the sentence to be imposed under section 12, of the person's compliance or non-compliance with a program.  
         
        (3) On or within 14 days after sentencing the person, the Drug Court:  
         
        (a) must make an order imposing on the person the conditions that the person has accepted as referred to in subsection (2) (d) (the person's ""program""), and  
         
        (b) must make an order suspending execution of the sentence for the duration of the person's program (the person's ""suspension order"").  
         
        (3A) An order referred to in subsection (3) (a) or (b) may be made in the absence of the person in respect of whom it is made.  
         
        (4) A person who is convicted and sentenced by the Drug Court under this section with respect to an offence for which the person has been referred to the Drug Court under section 6 may at the same time be convicted and sentenced for any other offence to which he or she has pleaded guilty (other than an offence referred to in section 5 (2)), whether or not the person has been referred to the Drug Court under section 6 in relation to that other offence.  
         
        (4A) Subsection (3) applies to a sentence under subsection (4) in the same way as it applies to a sentence under subsection (2).  
         
        (5) Nothing in this Act entitles a person to be convicted and sentenced under this section, and no appeal lies against any decision by the Drug Court not to convict or sentence a person under this section.  
         
        (6) In this section, a reference to the convicting and sentencing of a person is, in the case of a person who is referred to the Drug Court after having been convicted, a reference to the sentencing of the person only.  
         
        
       
      
     ISSUES 
    31   It is common ground that the reference by Judge Latham was properly made under s.6. Judge Murrell determined that the claimant satisfied the requirements of s.5(1)(d), but was ineligible because of s.5(2)(b), so that the requirement of s.7(2)(a) was not met. Accordingly, her Honour did not enter into consideration of the other matters in s.7(2). 
    32   The sole question argued before us was whether or not Judge Murrell was correct in her determination as to s.5(2)(b). There is no dispute that, if we think her Honour was wrong on this point, we should grant relief substantially as sought: cf. Craig v. State of South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163, Waterhouse v. Gilmore (1988) 12 NSWLR 270 at 276; Saffron v. DPP (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 at 418.  
    33   The question before us involves consideration of two matters. First, does the application of s.5(2)(b) depend upon the elements of the offence with which the person is charged, or the circumstances of the particular offence actually committed by that person? And second, what is the nature of the violent conduct referred to, and is intent or recklessness as to violence required? 
     
     ELEMENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES? 
    34   On the first question, it was submitted by Mr. Smith for the Director of Public Prosecutions that one could take account both of the essential elements of the offence and of the conduct of the person on the particular occasion.  
    35   This has some support from the second reading speech in the Legislative Assembly on 27th October 1998, which included the following statement:  
     
      
       
        
        The Drug Court program will deal only with offenders who commit certain categories of offences. These offences will be mainly non-violent theft offences. Those offenders who commit sexual offences and offences involving violent conduct will not be eligible. The types of offences that will be included are break, enter and steal, fraud and forgery offences, offences involving stealing from a person or unarmed robberies, provided there is no violence. Possession and use of prohibited drugs, or dealing in quantities of prohibited drugs below the indictable limit. 
        
       
      
    36   The reference in that speech to committing of offences, and the phrase ""provided there is no violence"", suggests that the actual conduct of the person in relation to the offence is relevant.  
    37   However, in my opinion, the use of the word ""charged"" in s.5(2) points very strongly in the other direction, that is, suggests very strongly that it is the elements of the charge which are significant, not the particular conduct. That view was expressed in an earlier decision of Judge Murrell in R. v. Ranse (1999) NSWDRGC 2; and I agree with that decision.  
     
     VIOLENT CONDUCT 
    38   Turning to the second question, there is no definition in the Drug Court Act of ""offence involving violent conduct"" or ""violent conduct"" or ""violent"".  
    39   There are definitions of some similar words and phrases in other Acts: for example, of ""personal violence offence"" and ""violence"" in ss.4 and 93A of the Crimes Act, and ""offence involving violence"" in s.48E of the Justices Act. There is also a definition of ""violent offence"" in s.31(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (UK), considered in the cases of R. v. Cochrane (1994) 15 CR AppR(S) 708 at 711, R. v Bibby (1995) 16 CR AppR(S) 127 at 129, and R. v. Ragg (1995) 4 AllER 155. I do not think that any of these definitions or cases are of assistance here.  
    40   We were also referred to dictionary definitions of violence and violent. Without quoting them, I think it is fair to say that relevantly the dictionary definitions suggest that violence generally refers to the application of rough, strong, physical force.  
     
     Submissions 
    41   For the claimant, Ms. Burgess submitted that this was a remedial Act and should be given a generous construction, so that s.5(2)(b) should be construed narrowly; and Ms. Burgess referred to Bull v. Attorney-General (NSW) (1913) 17 CLR 370 at 584, and to R. v. Sloane (1999) NSWDRGC 3.  
    42   Ms. Burgess submitted that s.52A created an offence of strict liability. The only conduct involved was driving, which had to be conscious and voluntary. The quality of dangerousness was something objective, and need not be adverted to. The causation of death or grievous bodily harm need only be unintended consequences. See R. v. Harris (1967) 85 WN 1 at 7, R. v. Coventry (1938) 59 CLR 633 at 639. As a matter of ordinary English usage, dangerous driving was not violent conduct; and ordinary English usage was the proper test: see Seay v. Eastwood (1976) 1 WLR 1117 at 1121, NSW Associated Blue Metal Quarries Ltd. v. F.C.T. (1956) 94 CLR 509 at 514.  
    43   Mr. Smith for the Director of Public Prosecutions submitted that the Act was intended to strike a balance between rehabilitation and the need to punish offenders. It was directed towards people who break the law to feed their habit. There was a limit to what could be done, so that there were excluded from the ambit of the Act offences involving violence and sexual assault, because of the great public concern about offences of this kind. Shortly before passing the Drug Court Act, the Parliament had in January 1998 added driving under the influence of drugs as a further circumstance of aggravation of offences under s.52A, thereby expressing abhorrence to conduct of this kind.  
    44   Mr. Smith submitted that all offences under s.52A involve violent conduct, that is conduct involving the application of physical force injurious or destructive to another person, of such gravity that death or grievous bodily harm ensues: see A.G v. Binoff (1954) 70 WN(NSW) 309, R. v. Buttsworth (1983) 1 NSWLR 658.  
    45   The plain intention of the legislature was that the offence of causing death by dangerous driving was to be considered a most serious offence: R. v. Slattery (1996) 90 ACrim.R 519, R. v. Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 227.  
     
     Decision 
    46   I accept, as observed by Judge Murrell in Ranse, that the Drug Court Act had as one of its objects the provision of a benefit to offenders; and I agree with her Honour that s.5(2)(b) should be construed quite strictly, as it removes a benefit which would otherwise accrue to an offender. Also, while I accept that the Act appears to be mainly directed at benefiting people who commit crimes to feed their habit, I do not think that consideration has any significant bearing on the construction of s.5(2)(b); although plainly it would be of relevance to the exercise of the Drug Court's discretion under s.7.  
    47   Undoubtedly, a s.52A offence involves violence being done to the victim. However, it is submitted that it does not involve violent conduct, because it is no element of the offence that the violence, or even the dangerousness of the driving, need be intended or even adverted to as a possible element or consequence of the conduct. It is submitted that, in ordinary language, we would not characterise driving as violent conduct, even if it has such unintended consequences.  
    48   There is some force in the submission that driving would not normally be regarded as violent conduct. There seem to me to be two possible reasons why this might be so. First, there is the circumstance that any violence is indirect, in that it is mediated by the vehicle: in this respect, it might be similar to violence to a person caused by pulling a trigger or pushing a button. The second reason relates to the circumstance that the dangerousness of the driving and the violent outcome need not be intended and may possibly not even be adverted to.  
    49   As to the first reason, in my opinion the circumstance that violence is done to a person, not by vigorous physical activity, but through some instrument that may be activated without any vigorous physical activity, does not prevent the doing of violence to a person by those means being properly described as violent conduct. There is perhaps a latent conflict in ordinary usage here: the use of a weapon which does violence to a person would ordinarily be regarded as aggravating violent conduct, whereas on the other hand, it may be seen as negativing violent conduct because it reduces to near-inactivity the physical action required from the person causing the violence. Even though one must ultimately apply the ordinary meaning of words, I think this should be done with due consideration; and on the basis of due consideration, my view is that the circumstance that violence is caused to a person by an instrument activated by minimal physical activity does not make that activity other than violent conduct.  
    50   Turning to the second reason, that which concerns intention or advertence, my opinion is that, so long as the conduct itself is voluntary, the circumstance that there may be no advertence to its dangerousness, and no intention of the violent outcome, does not prevent the conduct being called violent conduct. The elements of the offence in question here include voluntary conduct, which is objectively dangerous, and which does in fact do violence to a person. The conduct involves what can be regarded as a dangerous weapon; so it is not as if the objective dangerousness of the conduct, or the violent outcome, are matters that could be considered foreign to the voluntary conduct.  
    51   For those reasons, in my opinion the s.52A offences with which the claimant is to be charged are offences involving violent conduct within s.5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act, and I would dismiss the summons.

     1     
     HIS HONOUR : 
       
     On 17 April 2000 the prisoner was arraigned before me upon an indictment charging the murder of John Frederick Lund at Muswellbrook on 13 December 1998 to which he pleaded guilty. The intention so to plead was indicated shortly before that arraignment. I note that when similarly arraigned on 10 September 1999, a plea of not guilty was entered. 
      
       
      
     2     
     On Sunday 13 December 1998 the prisoner travelled from Fennells Bay (where he was sharing a house with a man named Peter Tinker) to the victim’s home in Muswellbrook. Whilst there he attacked him and suffocated him with a wet tea towel. He left the body in the house and returned to Fennells Bay where he arrived on the Monday morning in company with an acquaintance whom he had apparently encountered on his journey. This person departed shortly thereafter and is not relevant to any matter under present consideration. 
      
       
      
     3     
     Later that day the prisoner told Mr Tinker that he had killed John Lund. 
      
     4     
     Some time previously Peter Tinker had been in a relationship with a woman named Kirralee Percival, as a result of which they had two children, a girl and a boy. Miss Percival also had an older daughter born to a previous relationship. This child had had little contact with her biological father and she referred to Mr Tinker as “Dad” and he considered and treated her as his daughter. After the break up of the relationship abovementioned, Miss Percival commenced to keep company with Aage Lund, the victim’s brother. Mr Tinker and Miss Percival remained upon good terms particularly having regard to their common interest in the welfare of the three children.  
      
       
      
     5     
     All of these people, including the prisoner were acquainted with one another and as well with Peter Stanley and Rosemary Carrall who were sharing the house in which the victim was living when he met his death. Mr Stanley and Ms Carrall had a three year son who resided with them. They, together with the child, had left the premises on 9 December to avoid confrontation with a person said to have assaulted Ms Carrall on that day. 
      
       
      
     6     
     In evidence in these proceedings the prisoner said that he had heard that the victim was going to move in with friends of his named Graham and Elizabeth who had a three year old daughter. I note that, before John Lund moved in with Peter Stanley and Rosemary Carrall - said to be about three months prior to his death - he was described as living with people named Graham and Elizabeth. 
      
       
      
     7     
     Information passed among members of the group that there were allegations against John Lund of sexual assault by him upon the elder of Ms Percival’s daughters who was then aged eight. On 28 May 1998 the appropriate police had been contacted and a statement from the child had been obtained. The prisoner became privy to the existence of the allegation and was told by Ms Percival that there had been a rape to which his response was to say that he would go to Muswellbrook and “sort it out”. Ms Percival told him not to go near the place and to leave it to the police. She specifically asked him not to tell Graham and Elizabeth whom she feared would inform John Lund about the investigation.  
      
       
      
     8     
     Late in the evening of Tuesday 15 December police attended the victim’s premises in response to information from a neighbour about animal behaviour at the house and concern for the welfare of the occupant. An officer entered through a small bathroom window and discovered a male body supine on the lounge floor. The body was decomposing and the constable had to flee from the emanation of odour. In due course the body was identified as that of John Lund. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The finding of the body was reported in various media. The reportage came to the attention of Peter Tinker. It included mention of dogs at the premises. The prisoner also heard a radio broadcast and commenced to provide details about the animals in addition to his assertions about carrying out the killing. Mr Tinker’s previous scepticism about the prisoner’s claims to have committed the murder underwent a change. He contacted Ms Percival and Aage Lund and after some confirmatory enquiries were made, he reported to police and was interviewed by them at length on Thursday 17 December. 
      
       
      
     10     
     Consequent upon his information to police a warrant was obtained for the use of a listening device and Mr Tinker was fitted with the necessary equipment on 18 December whereupon he returned to the house which he was sharing with the prisoner at Fennells Bay and engaged him in conversation. The prisoner was thoroughly inculpated in the killing by his own words to Mr Tinker. I have listened to the recording of the product of the device and will make some further reference to its content later. 
      
       
      
     11     
     I should not pass from this topic without observing that Mr Tinker undoubtedly exposed himself to possible risk and his assistance to authority in the detection and arrest of the perpetrator of a serious crime should be commended. The implicit suggestion by the prisoner that he may have acted to avoid accusation against himself is rejected. There is not the slightest evidence that Mr Tinker was anywhere near Muswellbrook at the relevant time or that there was ever any reasonable basis for suspicion for the killing being directed towards him.  
      
       
      
     12     
     The prisoner was arrested on 18 December and interview with police shortly thereafter was recorded on video and audio tape. A search of the premises at Fennells Bay had located store, Medicare, bank and pensioner concession cards taken from John Lund’s wallet. The prisoner admitted taking them. He further admitted the killing and, as I noted at the commencement of these remarks, he has pleaded guilty to murder. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The physical aspects of the execution of the crime are little disputed. The victim was bashed into unconsciousness or semi consciousness and, thus inhibited from defending himself, he was suffocated with a wet tea towel. What are in dispute are the motive and circumstances which led to that act of murder. 
      
       
      
     14     
     The product of the listening device reveals claims by the prisoner that he killed John Lund as an act of vengeance for the alleged abuse of Ms Percival’s elder daughter. The prisoner proclaimed himself to Mr Tinker as a type of vigilante engaged in protecting children. He added descriptions of his hatred of all offenders of this type.  
      
       
      
     15     
     Police seized documents authored by the prisoner which he claimed were drafts of prints for T-shirts and the like and doodlings which he made under the influence of cannabis. Included was a slogan “No excuse. Child abuse. It sucks.” And a statement “Proven Hate Equals Death In the Eyes Forever In Little Earthlings” which would appear to be a mis-spelled or irregular intended acronym for the word paedophile. 
      
       
      
     16     
     When interviewed by police within hours of making statements to Peter Tinker to the above effect, the prisoner claimed that he had killed John Lund at the latter’s request. He said that euthanasia was sought because medical opinion had been received that John Lund had but six weeks to live and he wished to end his life. Dr Cook, a general practitioner in Muswellbrook had been consulted by John Lund on several occasions, the last being 6 December. Dr Cook stated that to the best of his knowledge John Lund had no acutely terminal illness and was not told that he had six weeks to live. However he was told that his behaviour was damaging to his health and would shorten his life. The behaviour under reference was gross over indulgence in intoxicating liquor. 
      
       
      
     17     
     It appears nevertheless that the story of six weeks life expectancy gained some currency. Peter Stanley and Rosemary Carrall stated that they were told this by John Lund but, far from inspiring a wish for termination of life, he tearfully told them that he was frightened and did not want to die. They comforted him. Peter Stanley used a telephone in the home of a Muswellbrook neighbour Mrs Pearce and she overheard mention of “John being ill and having six weeks to live”. I do not know whether the prisoner was the recipient of this call but it is a fair inference that either directly or by relay, he acquired information about the life expectancy story from Mr Stanley or Miss Carrall.  
      
       
      
     18     
     In his testimony at the sentencing hearing the prisoner, somewhat reluctantly to my observation, recanted his claim to have performed a mercy killing. I extract some of his evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And they took you to the police station and you participated in the record of interview where you gave a totally different version for your motivation, didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There you were suggesting that Mr Lund had in fact asked you to kill him because he was dying? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that is not true, is it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, actually, on the night that it happened we discussed some of his problems that he has with his liquor abuse, that a doctor had given him six weeks to live. He was in a fair bit of pain while I was up there. Like, he was getting stomach cramps and what-not, and on a number of occasions he suggested to me that he would like to die. I didn’t take that much notice of it, though. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you were telling the police that in fact that was your motivation for killing him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that wasn’t true, was it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. In fact, what you were doing was using that information that you had. At that stage did you believe that by telling the police that, you may have been able to get yourself out of the situation you had found yourself in in relation to the killing, or why were you telling them that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t know exactly, like the events I told them I killed him and everything else but as for the details why, I didn’t want to go that far into it so I just came up with the first thing that came into my head and that was something I remembered from the night. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The facts though, in entering this plea, you do not rely at any level on a suggestion that you were somehow committing this murder because the deceased wanted you to kill him. That is not the position you are putting to this Court, is it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct.” 
         
        
       
      
     19     
     On 4 May 2000 the prisoner was interviewed and tested by a psychologist Ms Anna Robilliard and her report of 9 May has been tendered. She has recorded a history of the commission of the offence given by the prisoner and in sworn evidence he has adhered to that history. It has significant differences from his earlier versions to Peter Tinker and to the police.  
      
       
      
     20     
     In this third version, part of the background was an elaboration of fears for the three year old son of Peter Stanley and Rosemary Carrall and an exacerbation of the prisoner’s concern for the three year old daughter of Graham and Elizabeth who were said to be about to move in with John Lund. I have already observed that it was in a previous time that John Lund had lived with people of those names. There is no evidence, apart from the prisoner’s present assertion, that such a move for them to again share a house was intended. To Ms Robilliard and in Court the prisoner described a fantasy scenario of this couple arriving to move in, leaving the child while they went to a shop for a short time for supplies of bread and milk and the opportunity being taken by the remaining adult to subject the child to abuse.  
      
       
      
     21     
     This third version includes the contention by the prisoner that his intention in going to Muswellbrook was to prevail upon John Lund not to move in with Graham and Elizabeth. When the prisoner arrived at the Muswellbrook house he found children from the neighbourhood running about and he claimed that he noticed that John Lund was manifesting a sexual arousal. Nevertheless he engaged him in conversation until, upon being told that the allegations of sexual abuse were none of his business, the prisoner lost control and struck the victim “on a couple of occasions” and thereafter he said he couldn’t remember “the exact version of events” and the next thing he knew was he was “kneeling above him with a wet towel in his hand”.  
      
       
      
     22     
     I am satisfied to the necessary standard that the prisoner’s motive in going to Muswellbrook was the execution of a vigilante type of vengeance for the victim’s assumed guilt of child abuse. The discussion with Peter Tinker was spontaneous and there is no reason to conclude that the prisoner was inhibited from fully and accurately disclosing his culpability. The version to Ms Robilliard and the Court shows significant contrivance on the part of the prisoner. When speaking to Peter Tinker both before and at the time of being recorded, the prisoner mentioned the children running about the house but it is only in the most recent version that the description has been embroidered with the alleged observation of arousal. 
      
       
      
     23     
     I have already noted the contradiction between the prisoner’s version of the victim’s wish for death and his statements to others of his wish to live. I do not accept his claims that the materials seized by police revealed writings that were essentially inconsequential. They were confirmatory of the prisoner’s obsessions. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The details of the killing in the recorded conversation with Peter Tinker are consistent with the objective findings of the investigators. It is true that within that conversation are prevarications and boastings on matters such as serial killings which are apocryphal but these do not impinge upon the description of the circumstances of the events of central significance. The impression I have gained is that the prisoner has a very flexible concept of truth.  
      
       
      
     25     
     I find that the prisoner went to Muswellbrook with the intention of killing John Lund; that his motive was an obsessive hatred directed towards a man who was the subject of an allegation of child abuse; that the prisoner’s hatred was part of a wider, undiscriminating and obsessive hatred of persons the subject of such allegations and that he executed his intention of killing John Lund when the opportunity arose during the visit. It was not, as claimed to Ms Robilliard, a killing determined by a sudden impulse.  
      
       
      
     26     
     I am satisfied that the prisoner has no real remorse for his actions as witness his evidence that the death was a kind of justice that was done. It was instructive to observe the prisoner incanting that retribution for anything John Lund may have done had nothing to do with him, yet eventually he could not resist expressing the view that I have just mentioned towards the end of cross examination. 
      
       
      
     27     
     I turn to some other subjective considerations. The prisoner turned twenty one years on 15 March last. Subject to a matter in the appellate jurisdiction of the District Court, his prior record is confined to matters dealt with in the Children’s Court. His record does not attract particular leniency but, of course, there is nothing in it even remotely bearing the seriousness of the present crime.  
      
       
      
     28     
     Personal background information was collated by Ms Robilliard and reveals his membership of a dysfunctional family or, more accurately, a series of dysfunctional family-like relationships. His youthful offending saw him in a boys home and other circumstances saw him in youth refuges. Nevertheless his mother has remained in contact and offers him support. 
      
       
      
     29     
     Psychological testing indicated that offer and acceptance of the opportunity for extension of formal education had the potential for significant personal benefit. Whilst in gaol the prisoner has enrolled for the Higher School Certificate Course in the Open Training and Education Network which is supervised by the New South Wales TAFE Commission. 
      
       
      
     30     
     I have given consideration to whether this and other matters should be treated as special circumstances justifying a reduction of the three quarter proportion between head sentence and non parole period. I conclude that there should be no such alteration.  
      
       
      
     31     
     Giving liberal weight to favourable factors, the most weighty of which I find to be his comparative youth, and balancing these against the objective seriousness of the crime, I would assess an appropriate sentence at twenty years imprisonment. I am minded however to give some benefit for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. Late though it was, the community has been spared the expense of trial and the witnesses have been spared the burden of giving testimony and I will impose therefore a sentence of eighteen years. This will date from the original day of custody. 
      
       
      
     32     
     Andrew Mark McGrath, for the murder of John Frederick Lund, you are sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen years: the sentence is to commence on 18 December 1998: I set a non parole period of thirteen years and six months to commence on that date: I specify 17 May 2012 as the earliest date for your eligibility for parole.

       Wednesday, 17 May 2000 
        
        
       Regina v Yeakub Ali 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPERLING J: At a trial in the District Court commencing on 27 April 1999, the appellant was convicted on one count of committing an act of indecency towards a person under the age of sixteen years; one count of indecent assault; and three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The alleged act of indecency under the first count was that the appellant allegedly masturbated himself in the complainant’s presence. The alleged indecent assault was an alleged touching of the breast on the outside of the complainant’s nightie. The three counts of alleged sexual intercourse without consent were three separate instances of alleged penile-vaginal intercourse. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The complainant, in each case, was the daughter of the appellant’s de facto wife. The offences were alleged to have occurred during the period December 1991 to March 1994. The complainant was eleven at the commencement of that period and thirteen at the end of it. She was 18 years of age at the time of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The complainant gave evidence of each of the alleged occurrences on which the charges were based. 
     
      
       
      
    4    In the course of cross-examination and re-examination of the complainant, evidence was adduced concerning five interviews: 
     
      
       
        
       (a) With Ms McLaren, school counsellor, in June 1996, when the complainant said that the appellant had raped her at the age of twelve. 
        
        
       (b) With officers from the Department of Community Services (DOCS) in July 1996, when the complainant said nothing had occurred. 
        
        
       (c) With DOCS officers a few days later when the complainant again said nothing had occurred. 
        
        
       (d) With the police in August 1997, when the complainant said that the appellant had raped her but said nothing about any earlier incident. 
        
        
       (e) With the police in April 1998, when the complainant told them everything that had allegedly occurred. 
        
       
      
    5    The prior representations which were inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence - (b), (c) and (d) above - were brought out in cross-examination, as was (e). The representation mentioned in (a) above was brought out in re-examination. I will review how this happened and what was said by the trial judge about this evidence in the course of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    6    When evidence was adduced in cross-examination concerning the inconsistent representations - (b), (c) and (d) above - nothing was said by the trial judge to the jury, at that stage, as to how they could use the evidence. In the absence of a direction to the contrary, the jury would, at that stage, have taken the inconsistent prior representations to be evidence of the facts stated and not merely as evidence going to the complainant’s credit:  Hilder (1997) 97 A Crim R 70. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The evidence concerning the interview with Ms McLaren - (a) above -was allowed in re-examination over the appellant’s objection. The complainant’s account of the interview was that Ms McLaren agreed not to tell anyone and that it was only then that the complainant told Ms McLaren that she had been raped by her “ex-stepfather” when she was twelve. 
     
      
       
      
    8    At this stage, the trial judge made the following unsolicited observation to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Now ladies and gentlemen that evidence that you’re hearing is not evidence that in fact the complainant was raped by her stepfather because  
         evidence of what somebody tells somebody else outside a court is no evidence of the truth of what’s being said. 
          This evidence is all going to tell you what happened before DOCS came to explain to you why DOCS came and why she said to DOCS what she said to DOCS because it was raised in cross-examination. That’s the only relevance of this material.”  
         (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
      
    9    Neither side objected to this observation. The jury had now been instructed, in general terms and by common consent, that evidence of statements made out of court were not to be used as evidence of the fact. Unless directed otherwise at a later time that was a direction which the jury could be expected to apply to all evidence of statements made out of court. This direction overrode the assumption the jury would have made earlier that evidence of out-of-court statements was evidence of the fact. 
     
      
       
      
    10    It is unnecessary to comment on what his Honour said this evidence could be used for, but I should not be taken to endorse the detail of his Honour’s directions in that regard. 
     
      
       
      
    11    The re-examination continued. The complainant was now asked about the meetings with the DOCS officers. The evidence adduced was that, when she was approached by these officers during the following month, July 1996, she was shocked to see them because she had trusted Ms McLaren not to tell anyone. She acknowledged what she said in cross-examination, namely, that she told those officers that she had not been raped by the appellant. Conformably with having extracted a pledge of confidentiality from Ms McLaren, the complainant gave as her explanation for lying to these officers that she was scared they would tell her mother what had happened to her.  
     
      
       
      
    12    The complainant said she then made a few phone calls to the department. There was then a second visit by DOCS officers a few days after the first The implication was that she had told the department more on the telephone than she had been willing to disclose at the first meeting with the departmental officers. On the second occasion, she said, her mother was present, so she again did not tell the officers what had happened, for the same reason. She agreed that she did, at a later time, tell her mother about what she alleged had happened to her.  
     
      
       
      
    13    Asked why she had not included everything in her first statement to the police, the complainant replied that, at that stage, she “just wanted to put it in brief answer form”. That appears to have been her way of saying that she told the police, at her first interview with them, what she thought was the salient feature of the appellant’s conduct rather than everything she could have said about him. 
     
      
       
      
    14    His Honour granted leave and admitted the evidence in a judgment delivered in the course of the trial. His Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
         
         “Leave, in my view, is appropriate because of the significance of this evidence in this particular case and because it is evidence which supports the complainant in the account that she has already given to the jury in respect of the statements made by her to the officers from the Department of Community Services.” 
         
        
       
      
    15    The Crown now sought to call Ms McLaren in its case. The application was founded on s 108 of the Evidence Act 1995.  The trial judge ruled, over the objection of counsel for the appellant, that leave should be granted to the Crown to call the witness. Section 108 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “108.(3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.” 
         
        
       
      
    16    In the course of the judgment granting leave, his Honour referred to his earlier ruling that the conversation with Ms McLaren could be adduced from the complainant in re-examination (as was then done). His Honour said of that evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I have already told the jury that this evidence is not evidence as to the truth of what the complainant said. It is no evidence that in fact the accused did have sexual intercourse with the complainant but rather that this evidence is put before the jury to explain why it was, and the circumstances in which, she came to say to the officers of the DOCS what she said to them about the accused’s conduct toward her.” 
         
        
       
      
    17    His Honour then proceeded to deal with the application to call Ms McLaren. He recorded the appellant’s objection as being that the evidence might be given undue weight by the jury, to the prejudice of the appellant. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I do not believe that the submission should be upheld although there is perhaps some slight suggestion that the jury may misuse this evidence and use it as evidence against the accused of actual guilty of the offences charged. I have already warned the jury once that it has no such effect and I would warn the jury again both when this evidence is given by Miss McDermott and in the summing up.” 
         
        
       
      
    18    Ms McLaren then gave evidence of the complainant telling her, in June 1996, that she had been raped by the appellant. When that evidence was given, the trial judge immediately made the following observation to the jury, as he said he would: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I remind you ladies and gentlemen of what I said yesterday, the fact that the complainant told somebody else, in this case Miss McLaren, that she was raped by her ex step father, is no evidence at all that in fact she was raped by her ex step father.  
         What somebody says outside a courtroom is no evidence of the truth of what that person asserts. If that was so, we would deal with these matters by rumour and innuendo and hearsay. We do not deal with them in that way, we deal with them by evidence given in the courtroom 
         , and  
         I told you yesterday that the relevance of this evidence is not to prove that (the complainant) was telling the truth 
         , but to explain to you so that you understand the statements that she made to the officers from the Department of Corrective Services how that conversation came about. And in explanation of why there is a conflict it would seem on its face between what she said to the officers from the Department and what she said in evidence to you.”  
         (Emphasis again added.) 
          
         
        
       
      
    19    Again, neither side objected to this direction. The trial was proceeding on the basis, by common agreement, that the jury would not rely on out-of-court statements as evidence of the fact. 
     
      
       
      
    20    Again, it is unnecessary for me to comment on what his Honour said the evidence could be used for.  
     
      
       
      
    21    Ms McLaren’s evidence continued. She explained that she had contacted DOCS about the case because she was a mandatory notifier. 
     
      
       
      
    22    That was the Crown’s case. 
     
      
       
      
    23    The appellant gave evidence. He denied the allegations and ascribed a motive to the complainant for lying in that regard. Character evidence was called on his behalf. That was the appellant’s case. 
     
      
       
      
    24    What had been said in the course of the trial by the trial judge, before the summing-up, was in general terms. It was to the effect that prior representations were not evidence of the fact. The jury was thereby given to understand that no prior representation could be used as evidence of the fact, whether inculpatory or exculpatory of the appellant. The present case was now distinguishable from Hilder (supra) where it was held that a jury would assume that evidence of representation was evidence of the fact unless directed otherwise. Here, there was a direction in general terms which was otherwise.  
     
      
       
      
    25    There was no direction given to the jury, at any stage before final addresses, as to what use the jury were entitled to make of the evidence of prior inconsistent statements - the denial of any sexual assault by the appellant when interviewed by the DOCS officers and the failure to mention either of the earlier episodes when first interviewed by the police. However, in view of the general terms in which his Honour had directed the jury concerning other out-court-statements, the jury would have believed that they were precluded from using these statements as evidence of the fact. 
     
      
       
      
    26    In his summing-up, the trial judge gave directions concerning the prior consistent and inconsistent representations. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I have told you that in considering the complainant’s evidence you would have to take into account the inconsistencies that are apparent between what she said to you in the witness box and what she said on other occasions that have been highlighted to you and detailed to you by Mr Dhanji in his address. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused, of course, relies strongly on the evidence in relation to the various accounts that she gave to the officers of the Department of Community Services and then to the police, the last time she gave evidence in this matter and of course finally what she told you in the witness box. You have heard argument on those matters by both counsel and I do not intend to repeat them and you will give them what weight you think they deserve. 
         
        
        
        ….. 
        
        
         
         As I indicated to you during the course of the trial, the fact that a person makes an allegation against another person does not tell you anything at all about whether or not that allegation might be true. For example the fact that the complainant made a statement about these matters, or two statements about these matters to the police cannot be used by you as evidence that what she said to you in the witness box is truthful. Nor can you use anything that the complainant said to the police or to the counsellor as evidence that the accused did in fact do these things that she alleges that he did to those people, the police and the counsellor. You have to act on the evidence in the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         Now the only relevance of what she said to Miss McLaren is what I told you during the course of the trial and that is as an attempt to explain the circumstances surrounding her statements to the officers form the Department, which on their face, seem to be completely inconsistent with the allegations she made to the police and in evidence to you.”  
         
        
       
      
    27    That covered the field. All the prior consistent and inconsistent representations had been mentioned. The jury was instructed that none of them could be used as evidence of the fact.  
     
      
       
      
    28    The addresses, referred to in the summing-up as having dealt with prior representations, were not recorded. However, conformably with what had been said by the trial judge to the jury in the course of the trial (without objection) and conformably with the absence of any criticism of the addresses in the summing-up, it can reasonably be assumed that neither side relied on any one or more of the prior representations as evidence of the fact. 
     
      
       
      
    29    There was no objection by counsel for the appellant to any part of the summing-up.  
     
      
       
      
    30    The appellant appeals against conviction on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour erred in allowing evidence of complaint made 20 June 1996 to Marian McLaren. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour erred in granting leave to the Crown under s 108(3) of the  
         Evidence Act 1995 
          to lead evidence of a prior consistent statement. 
         
        
        
         
         3. His Honour erred in the directions he gave to the jury on complaint evidence in the summing-up. 
         
        
        
         
         4. His Honour erred in the directions he gave in relation to a prior inconsistent statement, the denial to DOCS, in July 1996 and subsequently, that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by the appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         5. His Honour erred in the directions that he gave to the jury on prior inconsistent statement in the summing up.” 
         
        
        
       Ground 4: His Honour erred in the directions he gave on prior inconsistent statement (the denial to DOCS, in July 1996 and subsequently, that she had been sexually assaulted by the appellant). 
        
        
       Ground 5: His Honour erred in the directions that he gave to the jury on prior inconsistent statement in of the summing up. 
        
        
       
      
    31    The point argued on appeal under these grounds of appeal was that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that the complainant’s inconsistent representation to the DOC’s officers (that the appellant had done nothing) should not be used as evidence of the fact. 
     
      
       
      
    32    In the appellant’s written submissions, it was said that the representation of no sexual assault made by the complainant to the DOC’s officers was evidence of the fact that there was no sexual assault, by operation of s 66, or, alternatively, s 72 of the Evidence Act 1995. That argument has not been pressed on the hearing of the appeal, and properly so.  
     
      
       
      
    33    The gist of the argument on the hearing of the appeal was that, the evidence having been correctly admitted as to credit in cross-examination of the complainant, it became evidence of the fact pursuant to s 60. That section provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “60. The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation.” 
         
        
       
      
    34    Section 60 had the effect for which the appellant contends, subject to the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion under s 136 to limit the way the evidence could be used: Welsh (1996) 90 A Crim R 364. Section 136 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “136. The court may limit the use to be made of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) be misleading or confusing.” 
         
        
       
      
    35    The appellant argues that the trial judge mistook or overlooked the effect of s 60. Another possibility is that he limited the use of the evidence pursuant to an implicit exercise of his discretion under s 136. In the latter event, the appellant argues that any such limitation on the way the evidence could be used was wrong. 
     
      
       
      
    36    It may be assumed for the purposes of the argument that, in one such manner, the trial judge erred in directing the jury as he did. But Rule 4 then stands in the appellant’s way. As I have demonstrated in my review of the course of the trial, from a point in the re-examination of the complainant, the trial judge consistently directed the jury that out-of-court statements did not stand as evidence of the fact. In the summing-up that direction was specifically applied to the DOCS interviews. No objection was taken by the appellant’s counsel at the trial to the general terms in which the judge directed the jury during the evidence or to the specific direction in the summing-up. This should be seen as a tactical decision by counsel for the appellant. If what the complainant said to the DOCS officers had been allowed as evidence of the fact - as the appellant now says it should have been - there was the risk that the consistent prior representation - the statement by the complainant to Ms McLaren that she had been raped by the appellant - would also have been admitted as evidence of the fact. Indeed, there was no more reason to limit the use that could be made of the one than of the other. Consistency would seem to have required the same treatment of both. 
     
      
       
      
    37    Leave will ordinarily not be granted under Rule 4 where the point not having been taken at the trial is explicable as a tactical decision: PAH (CCA, 18 December 1998, unreported), Gillard (1999) A Crim R 479. I would not grant leave in this case. 
     
      
       
      
    38    If, contrary to my view, it were to be considered appropriate to grant leave in this case and these grounds of appeal were made good, I would apply the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The present case turned on whether the jury accepted the complainant’s evidence of what allegedly occurred. The jury did not think that what was said to the DOC’s officers sufficiently affected the complainant's credit for them to have a reasonable doubt about the truth of what she said had occurred. If the jury had been told they could use the interviews as evidence of the truth of what the complainant said on those occasions, as well as going to her credit, I do not see any serious prospect that the result would have been any different.  
     
      
       
      
    39    In these circumstances, leave to argue Grounds 4 and 5 should not be given. These grounds of appeal accordingly fail. 
     
      
       
        
        
       Ground 3: His Honour erred in the directions he gave to the jury on complaint evidence in of the summing-up. 
        
       
      
    40    The appellant’s argument is that the representation to the DOCS officers that there had been no sexual assault stood as evidence of that fact, by operation of s 60. It is then said that the trial judge’s directions in relation to representations by the complainant which were consistent with her evidence could have been taken by the jury as intended to limit the use of the representation to the DOCS officers, confining the use of that evidence to the complainant’s credibility.  
     
      
       
      
    41    For the reasons I have given earlier, it seems to me that the trial judge intended, by what he said in the course of the evidence, to limit the use of all prior representations in that way, and that this is what he successfully conveyed to the jury. That was articulated in the summing-up in a way which left no room for doubt that the direction was intended to apply as much to the inconsistent statements as to the consistent ones. 
     
      
       
      
    42    That is to sharpen the appellant’s argument, not to blunt it. But the approach then leads only to the argument advanced in support of Grounds 4 and 5, and fails, accordingly, for the same reasons. 
     
      
       
        
        
       Ground 1: His Honour erred in allowing evidence of complaint made 20 June 1996 to Marian McLaren. 
        
        
       Ground 2: His Honour erred in granting leave to the Crown under s 108(3) of the 
        Evidence Act 1995 
        to lead evidence of a prior consistent statement. 
        
        
        
       
      
    43    The trial judge perceived - correctly - that the evidence of complaint to Ms McLaren could be admissible only pursuant s 108. The subject matter of the representation was not admissible under s 66. It was not “fresh in the mind” of the complainant some two years after the event: Graham [1998} HCA 61, 157 ALR 404. As I have recorded earlier in my resume of the trial, his Honour granted leave pursuant to s 108(3) and admitted the evidence of complaint to Ms McLaren.  
     
      
       
      
    44    I take the appellant’s argument as going both to the re-examination of the complainant concerning the McLaren interview and to the evidence by Ms McLaren herself. Of these, the evidence by Ms McLaren was, of course, more damaging to the appellant because it was independent evidence of what was said by the complainant on that occasion.  
     
      
       
      
    45    There was only one point of substance argued on the hearing of the appeal in support of these grounds of appeal. The evidence was admitted under s.108(3)(a), that is, as evidence capable of re-establishing the credibility of the complainant, having regard to the possible effect of prior inconsistent representations, namely, the interviews with the DOCS officers brought out in cross-examination (in which the complainant said nothing had happened). It was submitted that the McLaren interview did not rationally answer the possible effect of the statements to the DOCS officers, because the McLaren interview was some two years after the last of the alleged offences. 
     
      
       
      
    46    Different considerations apply in relation to s108(3)(b). Where it is or will be suggested that a witness has fabricated evidence (or that the evidence is reconstructed, or the result of suggestion), a consistent out-of-court statement made as part of the train of events leading to the trial for the offence may not be admissible because it adds nothing to what is said by the complainant in evidence at the trial. In such a case, the out-of-court statement does not rationally answer the suggestion of fabrication, reconstruction or suggestion in relation to the evidence given by the complainant in court. The out-of-court statement merely tells the same story in materially the same context as the evidence given in court. It does nothing for the complainant’s credibility that the same story has been told out of court in such a case.  
     
      
       
      
    47    By contrast, it a very different situation where evidence has been adduced of a prior inconsistent statement. In such a case, a consistent statement made at about the same time, coupled with an explanation for the inconsistent statement which is connected with the truth of the consistent one has the potentiality to answer the attack on the witness’ credibility in a rational way. That is this case. What was said to Ms McLaren, in conjunction with the explanation for the inconsistent statement, had the capacity to provide a rational answer to the attack on the complainant’s credibility based on the inconsistent statements made to the DOCS officers in the following month. 
     
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
    48    In my opinion, all grounds fail. I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

     SENTENCE 
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR : Kevin Walter Towers appears for sentence on a count of malicious wounding. To wound is to cause an injury involving the cutting of the interior layer of the skin. Provided the wound is of that quality, the offence can lie and it is not requisite that there be any consequence of prescribed or particular seriousness. The offence is indictable and the Crimes Act specifies a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment, however it is included in the schedule of matters which are to be dealt with summarily unless either the prosecutor or the person charged elects otherwise. If there is no such election, a person convicted faces sentence by a magistrate whose jurisdiction is limited (except in circumstances not applicable here) to imposing no more than two years imprisonment. 
      
       
      
     2     
     There is some unusual procedural background in this case and I should mention aspects of it. On 18 January 1998 the prisoner was arrested and charged with the murder of Neville Stuart (Dickie) Edwards. He was committed to stand trial on that charge and a bill of indictment was found accordingly. The trial was scheduled to commence before a jury to be empanelled on Monday 1st May instant. Certain information was supplied to the prosecution towards the end of the preceding week and over the weekend and, in consequence, an indictment was presented containing counts charging murder and, alternatively, malicious wounding. The prisoner pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to malicious wounding and the Crown accepted that plea in discharge of the indictment including an express understanding that the plea of not guilty to murder included a plea of not guilty to manslaughter. Subject to there being evidence to support the plea of guilty to malicious wounding, it is mandatory to deal with the matter on that basis. 
      
       
      
     3     
     It is important therefore to make two observations. First, the conviction in respect of which the prisoner appears for sentence does not involve any assertion of his culpability for the death of Mr Edwards. Second, treating the charge of malicious wounding in isolation as it now must be, it is reasonable to infer and I do infer, that if the bill had not been found for the more serious charge, consideration would have been given to whether the charge should not have been left to be dealt with summarily. It is speculative whether a decision to indict would have been made but the prisoner has lost a real chance that the matter might have been brought before a local court with consequent limit on maximum available penalty. These remarks imply no criticism of the prosecution. It is obvious that the practical and perfectly proper course was to add the alternative count to the original indictment. 
      
       
      
     4     
     I do not intend to dwell at length upon the facts. The prisoner, the deceased, and two women engaged in an extended binge of alcohol consumption at premises usually occupied by the two men at Bolton Point. Another man participated in this activity but left after he was separated from his wallet, apparently by one of the women. Nothing in this case turns upon that man’s transient presence or loss of his wallet. 
      
       
      
     5     
     At some stage the prisoner lost track of the whereabouts of one of the women and neighbours heard him loudly calling for her. There was some exchange of abuse between him and those disturbed by his actions. The other woman called for assistance to resist an alleged sexual advance by Mr Edwards. There are different versions about exactly what was happening or feared to be about to happen but the prisoner intervened. I am satisfied that he used a broken glass, observable in the still and video photography of police crime scene specialists, to cut Mr Edwards. I accept that in the temporal sense of the course of the struggle between the two men, Mr Edwards sustained six stab wounds, two of which damaged vital structures of the body and were contributorily causative of death. The evidence demonstrates that it was not the prisoner who inflicted the stab wounds. As Dr Oettle’s testimony affirms, the cuts consistent with being made by an edge of broken glass are entirely distinguishable from stab wounds. I should not, within the ambit of this case, express any conclusion as to who stabbed Mr Edwards and I do not go beyond repeating that the evidence does not establish that it was the prisoner. 
      
       
      
     6     
     Obviously much more happened than the prisoner, who has recently supplied a statement to police and given evidence in these proceedings, and the women who were earlier interviewed and gave evidence in the committal, have recounted. It is highly likely that all of their memories are corrupted by the alcoholic haze in which the events occurred and possible that descriptions are also tainted by self interest. Investigation revealed blood deposits over a wide area of the house and elsewhere. No one version or combination of them offers satisfactory explanation for these matters. The prisoner’s location of his committing the wounding in the bedroom cannot be sustained. I find it to have occurred in the kitchen area. Further, I do not accept that the prisoner struck only one or two blows with a glass in his hand which broke upon impact. I find that up to seven blows were struck causing the injuries identified by Dr Oettle and that all were struck with a glass already possessing a sharpened edge. 
      
       
      
     7     
     I do not perceive anything to be gained by my collating all the inconsistencies and contradictions observable in the evidence. Lest it be thought otherwise, I should mention that the information available to police and prosecution made the original charging of the prisoner with murder quite understandable and it is apparent that it is his recent decision to supply information which has caused reopening of enquiry into that matter. I have viewed a video recording of the futile attempt to conduct an interview with him in January 1998 and it is only now that the prisoner has elected to come forward with explanatory material. 
      
       
      
     8     
     In short, I find that the prisoner committed the offence of malicious wounding by inflicting the injuries with the glass above described. The death of Mr Edwards was not caused or contributed to by those injuries but by stab wounds suffered close to or even simultaneously with the attack upon him by the prisoner. There is no evidence that the attack by the prisoner was part of any joint enterprise with a person responsible for the stabbing. 
      
       
      
     9     
     I turn to some subjective matters. The plaintiff’s intellectual abilities are in the low range of the population. He had little schooling and what he had was essentially ineffective. He shares many of the disadvantages frequently seen to affect those of his aboriginal heritage. His prior record negates the possibility of particular lenience stemming from past good conduct. He has been given the benefit of recognizance; as recently as April 1997 he was released on a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on condition that he be of good behaviour for three years by Moree Local Court. That recognizance was current at the time of this offence. It is an aggravating circumstance. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The prisoner has had a series of misfortunes with infidelity by his partners. I can only guess whether his own behaviour might not have contributed to these. Whatever the cause, there are consequences and I detected a deep anguish at his separation from the children of his earliest and relatively long relationship. His former partner has moved elsewhere with the children and entered a new relationship. 
      
       
      
     11     
     By January 1998 the prisoner had descended to a pitiful state of existence. Apart from the events of 18 January, his life appeared to revolve around drinking and he had taken to imbibing concoctions based upon methylated spirits.  
      
       
      
     12     
     After being charged he was kept in custody until released to bail on 24 November 1998. All of that time, save fourteen days served in respect of offences apparently committed whilst in custody, was served in relation to the charge of murder, to which the Crown has now accepted his plea of not guilty. 
      
       
      
     13     
     Upon release to bail he was required to reside with his mother. She gave evidence. She has obviously been a good influence. I was impressed by her testimony and her admirable efforts to care for her family, her children and grandchildren, in financially stretched and other difficult circumstances. The prisoner has been before me on several different days. He is neat and well groomed and his presentation is altogether consistent with his claim that he has not partaken of alcohol for nearly three months. He is an entirely different person from the one visible on the video which I viewed. I accept that his intention for future abstinence is sincere. Only time will tell if he can succeed. It will be a task of some magnitude. 
      
       
      
     14     
     From the ages of twelve to sixteen or thereabouts, the prisoner worked as a strapper for a horse trainer, Mr Slade at the Broadmeadow Racecourse. Mr Slade currently has only one horse in work with another, I gather, possibly joining it at the stables shortly. I accept that he will offer the prisoner some work. I consider that it is as important for the plaintiff to be occupied as to be employed if he is to have any chance of achieving his goals. 
      
       
      
     15     
     Effectively the prisoner has served over ten months in custody. I take into account that and the loss of a real chance that this matter might have been dealt with in the Local Court with a limitation upon possible custody to two years. Even the imposition of that maximum would ordinarily require the specification of a non parole period and an order for release to parole after eighteen months, thus the prisoner has already served ten of a possible eighteen months if the matter were to be viewed in that light. I also take into account that the prisoner has had a charge of murder which would produce predictable apprehension, pending for over two years. Although that period might have been less if the prisoner had chosen to come forward earlier, I do not consider that what he has undergone should be ignored when, in the event, that most serious charge is not pursued.  
      
       
      
     16     
     I do not propose to return the prisoner to custody. 
      
       
      
     17     
     Counsel suggested that I should invoke the recently restored power to impose a suspended sentence. However s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the period of suspension cannot exceed the term of sentence subject to an overall maximum period of two years. The necessary accompanying good behaviour bond must also not exceed the term of sentence. I consider that the community and the prisoner will acquire greater potential benefit if the prisoner is subject to a bond for a longer period than any sentence I would add to the ten months already served. I have considered the possible alternatives of community service and periodic detention but have decided that they are not appropriate for the present case.  
      
       
      
     18     
     Kevin Walter Towers, for the malicious wounding of Neville Stuart Edwards, in lieu of sentence of imprisonment I direct that you enter a good behaviour bond for a period of three years commencing today 18 May 2000 and expiring on 17 May 2003 upon the following conditions: that you will appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during that term; that you are of good behaviour and that you will inform the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court at Newcastle of any change in your residential address during the specified term.

     REGINA v K 
     
     
       
     JUDGMENT 
    1 MASON P: I will ask Smart AJ to deliver the first judgment.2 SMART AJ: In this matter I will refer to the applicant by the pseudonym ""K"". 3 K seeks leave to appeal and to appeal against the severity of a sentence of seven years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years for the offence of importing into Australia a quantity of heroin being not less than the trafficable quantity. 4 On 29 November 1998 the applicant arrived by plane in Sydney from Indonesia. Concealed at the bottom of his briefcase was 999.5 grams of heroin mixture with a purity of 72.1 percent. The nett weight of pure heroin was 720.6 grams, which is a trafficable quantity. At the then current street prices of $300 to $450 for 1 gram at fifteen percent purity, the heroin seized was estimated to have a street value of $1 million to $1.5 million. 5 Upon the applicant's arrival he was to proceed to a nominated motel and contact his principal in Indonesia for further instructions. This is a typical mode of operation. Upon his arrest K agreed to assist the authorities. Under their supervision he went to the nominated motel and endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to contact his principal. However, his principal telephoned him at the motel. About one and a half hours later K received a local call advising him that on the following day he would receive a further call with further instructions. A person subsequently attended on him at the motel and saw the briefcase. He left and returned about twenty minutes later with $20,000 which he gave to K. This person was arrested.6 At the sentence hearing the Crown conceded that the applicant should be sentenced as a courier and that was correct. 7 The judge thought that the offence was committed solely in order to supply the applicant with funds. She noted that he had indicated a plea of guilty from the earliest opportunity. She regarded that as inevitable in the light of his admissions to the police. She thought there was some contrition inherent in the plea of guilty and the savings to the community which that plea represents. She found that the applicant had a lack of insight into his condition and position and that that bore considerably on the question of whether or not there was any demonstrable contrition or remorse over and above that indicated by the plea of guilty. She thought that there was very little contrition or remorse of that quality. 8 I would interpolate that this finding has to be set against his background and emotional condition and what he is capable of by reason of these factors. 9 The applicant had no prior convictions in Australia. He had a driving offence in America. That can safely be ignored. 10 The applicant was born on 28 November 1974 in England where he spent the first few years of his life before his father took the family to France. His parents separated when he was eight years old. He and his younger brother lived with his mother. The boys continued to see their father regularly until he moved to Brussels. His father remarried and had a three year old son. 11 When the applicant was about twelve years old his mother became ill and he and his brother were told that she had AIDS. He was terrified that he would contract AIDS from her and so for some time avoided physical contact with her. He and his brother preferred to sleep at their boarding school. She died when he was seventeen and the last couple of years were tragic for them all. Three days prior to the mother's death the father collected the boys. The applicant felt that he had not supported his mother when she most needed him. He had become emotionally detached. While the applicant got on with his young stepmother and three year old stepbrother the applicant felt that he did not belong in that family setting. 12 The psychologist has recorded that the applicant had no sense of belonging anywhere nor with anyone. He had few emotional attachments of any significance in his life. The judge accepted the assessment of the psychologist that the applicant had little insight and was emotionally under-developed.13 In his record of interview the applicant said that in October 1998 he had taken some narcotics, probably heroin, from Thailand to Indonesia in a backpack. He was paid $1,500. Both the judge and the Crown relied on this matter. There is no evidence that this was an offence under either Thai or Indonesian law, nor how seriously it would be regarded. I will, however, assume it was an offence. Even so, as it was committed outside Australia its relevance and weight are limited.14 The judge noted that she had little, if any, material before her which indicated that rehabilitation was likely or realistic. 15 The psychologist summed-up the position thus: 
     
      
       
       ""A major fear [K] voiced during our meeting was that he has no idea what to do on release from prison and essentially has no place to go. Talking this over with a psychologist would also be of benefit to him. 
        
        
       Personality damage is difficult to redress and the process is slow, however, in K's case, given his intelligence and the limited self-insight he currently demonstrates, with appropriate support and counselling, his prognosis seems positive."" 
       
      
    16 The judge emphasised the principle of deterrence. She took into account that the applicant would serve his sentence in protective custody and that this is a significantly harsher way of serving his sentence. 17 The judge relied on Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231. Ultimately she came to the conclusion that, having regard to the quantity, the other findings she had made and the operation of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), a head sentence of eleven years was an appropriate starting point. She reduced that by about forty percent, being the discount to be given for the substantial assistance rendered. This led to a head sentence of seven years. She then determined a non-parole period of four years. Non-parole periods are usually in the range of about sixty to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the head sentence. 18 In R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420 this Court in a guideline judgment upheld the conclusion to which this Court came in both R v Lawson (1997) 98 A Crim R 463 and R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44 that the range suggested in Ferrer-Esis has tended to be imposed for low-range commercial quantities rather than for high-range trafficable quantities, although there was an overlap between the two ranges. It is apparent from the remarks of the judge that she was not enamoured of the approach taken in Bernier.19 Wong & Leung reviewed a considerable number of cases. As a guideline it held that the appropriate range of head sentences for a mid-level trafficable quantity for drugs such as heroin for couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation was six to nine years. In broad terms, prior to that decision a sentence in this range was often imposed for such offences. Wong & Leung drew on an existing reservoir of experience and sentences and introduced more definitive guidelines in order to promote consistency of sentencing. It drew the existing strands together into a cohesive system and refined them.20 I do not accept the Crown's submission that the starting point of eleven years for a mid-range trafficable quantity in the circumstances of this case was permissible prior to Wong & Leung. It is certainly outside that guideline.21 After making the allowance required by s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) the correct head sentence, absent any discount, is one of eight years, having regard to the quantity of heroin, its value and the other circumstances of the case. 22 This was not the first time on which the applicant had acted as a courier, albeit not the other occasion was not in Australia. The subject offence could, therefore, not be regarded as an isolated one or a first time offence.23 I have not overlooked the plea of guilty, the subjective features and the serving of the sentence in protective custody. A discount of the order of forty percent (or a little less) as applied by the judge for assistance is unexceptionable. 24 With a starting point of eight years as a head sentence and allowing a discount of approximately but not quite forty percent, the head sentence reduces to one of five years. The non-parole period should be three years. Any lesser sentence would not sufficiently reflect the objective criminality of the offence.25 Counsel for the Crown urged upon the court that even assuming that the judge's approach and her mathematics indicated error, nevertheless, the sentence at which she ultimately arrived was the correct one. Counsel submitted that it was certainly within the range and that a lesser sentence was not one that should be imposed. 26 It is apparent from what I have just said that that is a submission with which I do not agree, given what is the correct starting point in this case and the correct approximate discount to be allowed. 27 I propose that leave to appeal against the sentence be granted, that the appeal be allowed, the sentence quashed and that in lieu of the sentence imposed the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for five years commencing on  
     
     29 November 1998 with a non-parole period of three years commencing on the same day. 
    28 MASON P: I agree.29 HEYDON JA: I agree.30 MASON P: That is the order of the Court.

     REGINA v MICHAEL HOUVARDAS JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1    MASON P: I ask Heydon JA to deliver the first judgment.2    HEYDON JA: Michael Houvardas pleaded guilty to four charges of being knowingly concerned in principal offences committed by his wife, Anastasia Houvardas, contrary to s 5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The principal offences committed by his wife consisted of one offence of false pretences contrary to s 29A of the Crimes Act and three offences of imposition contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act.3    The applicant was sentenced in respect of the s 29A offence to eighteen months' imprisonment to be released after serving nine months, the sentence to date from 27 January 2000. He was sentenced in respect of each of the three s 29B offences to four months' imprisonment. The maximum penalty in relation to s 29A is imprisonment for five years. The maximum penalty in relation to s 29B is imprisonment for two years.4    For the s 29A offence Anastasia Houvardas was sentenced to imprisonment for six months with immediate release upon security by way of recognisance to be of good behaviour for six months and that a fine be paid of $30,000 at the rate of $1,000 per month. For the other offence she was sentenced to two months. 5    The essential factual position in relation to the s 29A offence was that the applicant, an accountant, prepared a taxation return for his wife for the year 1992 which was signed by his wife. It enclosed a photocopy of a group certificate signed by the applicant which stated that his wife's gross salary for the 1992 year was $104,000 and that tax instalments of $38,650 had been deducted. The supposed employer was Mike Houvardas Investments Pty Ltd which conducted a business called the ""Barclay Reception Centre"". The return was lodged on or about 19 May 1993. The ATO issued a refund cheque in the amount of $38,650 which the wife banked on 3 June 1993. It went to the benefit of the business in which both the applicant and his wife were beneficially interested. In fact, the wife had been paid no salary in the year in question and no tax instalments had been deducted.6    The essential factual position underlying the s 29B offences was that returns for the years 1990, 1991 and 1993 were filed enclosing group certificates signed by the applicant but not allocated to Mike Houvardas Investments Pty Ltd and purporting to record tax instalments deducted from a salary paid to the wife. Again the wife in fact had been paid no salary and no tax instalments had been deducted. No refunds were in fact paid in respect of these returns.7    Although the applicant gave evidence which caused Judge Davidson QC to consider whether the criminality had not extended over a period of years, he found that in truth it extended over a period of only four months.8    The sentencing judge said that it was common ground that the major culpability rested with the applicant, not his wife. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""He was the author and instigator of these offences. I find that Anastasia's culpability in respect of them was that she was overborne by his expertise as an accountant and by perhaps also cultural factors which meant that she was led into these offences by him, whether or not she was led by cultural factors I take that view. If it had not been for his participation in these offences then she would not have been involved in them. Although she did do apparently some bookkeeping work so far as the conduct of the business of the Barclay Reception Centre is concerned, she has no accounting background, her background being that of a school teacher until marriage."" 
        
       
      
    9    The sentencing judge also made findings about relevant subjective factors which were generally favourable to the applicant. 10    Mr Bellanto QC relied on these factors in support of one of his submissions and they are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""3.5 The applicant, an accountant, was declared bankrupt in 1992 following which the family home at Strathfield was repossessed.  
        
       
       
        
        3.6 The applicant displayed an inability to recognise his full responsibilities professionally.  
        
       
       
        
        3.7 The applicant was personally of good character and general honesty and was a hardworking and devoted family man. 
        
       
       
        
        3.8 The offences were an unsophisticated series of offences which were doomed to discovery upon investigation. 
        
       
       
        
        3.9 The applicant was motivated by extreme financial pressure and by the need to continue to support his family as best he could. 
        
       
       
        
        3.10 The applicant was remorseful. 
        
       
       
        
        3.11 The applicant was a person of prior good character who was capable of contributing to the community. 
        
       
       
        
        3.12 The applicant suffered a great deal by virtue of his professional misconduct. 
        
       
       
        
        3.13 The applicant had prior convictions for minor tax offences which resulted in the imposition of pecuniary penalties none of which on their face would deprive him of any leniency which the court may extend to him. 
        
       
       
        
        3.14 There was a delay of approximately four years during which the applicant was under investigation in respect of the four offences. The investigations commenced in August 1993 and the information and summonses were prepared in April 1997."" 
        
       
      
    11    In writing the applicant advanced three arguments in support of the contention that the sentencing judge fell into manifest error, which were supplemented orally, and propounded a further argument orally. 12    The applicant's first argument was that the sentence offended the principle of parity in that, though the wife enjoyed the benefit of the fraud jointly with the applicant, he received a much heavier sentence. 13    In this regard Mr Bellanto made the following points. There was a joint involvement in what had happened, she got the benefit of the funds which were directly deposited into the business account and used for general purposes, she signed and dated the returns, she also signed and dated a letter of 14 September 1993 which accompanied the 1993 return and she claimed interest deductions for the partnership, she was the manageress of the business, she did not draw wages and any drawings in her name but, rather, household expenses were paid and she was very much involved with the applicant’s financial affairs. Mr Bellanto drew attention to the expression ""degree of connivance"" in the respondent’s written submissions and characterised the applicant's wife's conduct by the use of that phrase. 14    It may not matter but I do not believe the respondent was seeking so to characterise the wife's behaviour. 15    Finally, Mr Bellanto pointed out there was no evidence that the applicant could have committed the offences without the assistance of his wife. 16    With respect to the submission, in my judgment, it does not demonstrate an error in the sentencing judge's reasoning. He did correctly find and gave appropriate weight to the fact that the applicant was the author and instigator of the offences, the fact that the applicant overbore his wife using his expertise as an accountant and the fact that had it not been for the applicant, the wife would not have been involved. The difficulty confronting the submission was it lacked what might be called positive evidentiary support and to some extent represented - and I am not being critical - the consequences of a change in representation in that while the applicant and his wife were represented below by the same counsel, Mr Bellanto appeared for the applicant alone today.17    The applicant's second argument was that it was contrary to sound sentencing practice to impose a more severe sentence on an accessory than on a principal offender. He submitted that in law the responsibility should be shared at the very highest equally. He submitted that the involvement of the applicant had been, as he put it, “embellished to justify the higher sentence”. He submitted that in basic legal terms the applicant was an accessory and should not be punished beyond the extent to which the principal offender was punished. Mr Bellanto cited Regina v Hodges (1997) 95 A Crim R 85 at 86; Lowe v Regina (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v Regina (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 338. Nothing in these authorities specifically supports the proposition relied upon. Rather, they deal with general questions as to what does and does not create a justifiable sense of grievance. Sentencing an accessory more severely than a principal offender does not necessarily create a justifiable sense of grievance. Whether it does will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. The circumstances of this case could not fairly create that sense of grievance because of the role of the applicant as instigator. As the sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He not only committed these offences but he got his wife embroiled in them too."" 
        
       
      
    18    The third submission was that no consideration was given to whether periodic detention was a sufficient and available alternative. It may be accepted that that option was one which it was appropriate to consider. According to the Crown, the applicant's written submissions to the sentencing judge asked him to take ""into consideration on sentence and consider options falling short of full-time custody"". There is no reason to conclude that the sentencing judge did not comply with that request. That he did comply with it is supported by the fact that he imposed a non-custodial sentence on the applicant's wife. Further, the sentencing judge said: ""A sentence of full-time custody is the only appropriate response"". That implies that he considered other responses. There is no reason to suppose that the sentencing judge did not comply with  
     
      
      s 17A(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      .  
      
    19    It was submitted in a case such as this, taking into account the sentencing judge's duty to bear in mind all the options short of full-time custody, the reasoning process should be stated and it was wrong that appellate courts should have to guess at the reasoning of the trial judge. 20    The written argument placed reliance on Regina v Leonard and Rose (unreported NSWCCA 9 May 1997). In that case Grove J rejected a submission that the sentencing judge had to elaborate on each of the sentencing options he rejects, saying rather that it is his duty only to expose his reasons for the chosen option. In this case the sentencing judge, in my opinion, did this.21    Gleeson CJ gave consideration to an argument that the trial judge in Leonard and Rose should have referred to periodic detention explicitly because on one reading of the Crown's argument it conceded that periodic detention was the appropriate punishment. Sperling J agreed with the reasons of both Grove J and Gleeson CJ. 22    There is nothing to suggest any concession of a similar kind was made by the Crown in the present case.23    The fourth argument propounded by the applicant drew attention to the subjective factors affecting the applicant's position. Without repeating the matters to which Mr Bellanto drew attention, they centre on the financial difficulties which faced the applicant at the time the offences were committed and the very serious consequences which the pleas of guilty had for him professionally and personally. 24    Though it is a natural human response to Mr Bellanto's eloquent submissions to experience sympathy for the applicant, the trial judge was conscious of all of those factors and in my judgment his conclusion does not fall outside the range of an appropriate sentencing discretion in this case. 25    I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.26    MASON P: I agree.27    SMART AJ: I also agree.28    MASON P:  The orders of the Court will be as indicated.

      REGINA v. LEE DEAN CARROLL 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
      
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: Lee Dean Carroll was indicted for the murder of Stephen Michael Pagett at Kingswood on 17 December 1996. 
    2   On 9 February 2000, he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Mr. Pagett and that plea was accepted by the Crown on the basis of diminished responsibility. He is convicted of that offence. 
    3   As both the Crown and the offender's counsel submit, I deal with the matter as provided by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). I can see no disadvantage to the offender would result. 
    4   I have been provided with detailed written submissions and extensive material by both counsel. This was of great assistance. 
     
      
    5   With the Crown's consent it was requested I take into account, pursuant to s.33 of the Act, two offences: the first, that he at the same time and place did assault a person also then present, Michelle Thomas, in that, after having pointed the gun at Stephen Pagett and firing a shot which hit him in the upper chest/throat area, he turned the gun on Michelle Thomas and said, ""Lay down on the floor or you'll get it too"", an offence under s.61 of the Crimes Act 1900, punishable by a maximum of two years' imprisonment; and the second, that on or about 17 December 1996 at Kingswood he did possess a firearm, namely a shotgun that had been shortened, an offence under s.14(b) of the Firearms Act 1989, which if prosecuted on indictment carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, but which if prosecuted summarily, carries a maximum penalty of two years. 
    6   The offence of manslaughter, to which he pleaded guilty, is punishable by a maximum penalty of 25 years. The weapon referred to in all of the charges is the weapon with which the manslaughter was committed. The Crown has submitted, and I accept, that I should regard the applicable maximum for the firearms offence prosecuted in the way it has been in the circumstances as two years. 
    7   The offender admitted, by his plea, the elements of murder in relation to Mr. Pagett and, in particular, that he intended to kill or at least to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him and he further admitted his guilt of the two additional offences which I take into account when dealing with him for the offence of manslaughter. 
    8   Victims Impact Statements were provided to me on the plea and I have treated them as I am required to consistently with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Previtera (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 76. 
    9   Since the principal crime was committed prior to 3 April 1998, the Crimes Amendment (Diminished Responsibility) Act 1997 did not apply and the relevant provision, the operation of which reduces what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter, is s.23A of the Crimes Act 1900 as it stood prior to that former enactment. 
    10   The plea was accepted as a consequence of extensive psychiatric enquiries being made into the offender's mental state, by the Crown and the offender's legal advisers at the time. The Crown accepted the plea on that basis only on the receipt both from the defence of psychiatric reports obtained on the offender's behalf, and also on obtaining its independent psychiatric advice from Dr. Skinner. All four psychiatrists who furnished reports concurred in finding support for the requirements necessary for the application of the statutory provision. Further, the facts before me both as to the immediate circumstances of the offence, the offender's prior and subsequent circumstances and the assessments of him by other medical practitioners clearly support their views that, whatever psychological condition he suffered from at the time of the crime his mental responsibility was substantially diminished. All the material, as the Crown accepts, clearly establishes the offender's mental responsibility was substantially diminished. Even disregarding the transient effects of the drugs and alcohol he had taken on him, his mental state clearly was gravely affected. 
    11   There is no dispute as to the facts. About a week before the killing, the offender's older brother and another man noticed the offender in possession of the shotgun and arrangements were made apparently to shorten it. On 17 December 1996, the day of the killing, the offender was drinking and smoking cannabis at his brother's home for some hours. At about 11.00 pm with his nephew, Phillip Carroll, he drove to Blacktown and, upon arrival at a home in Blacktown, knocked on the door. When there was no answer, he abused the householder and smashed the glass in and left. He then directed his nephew to drive him to the Castlereagh Relaxation Centre at Kingswood and the offender went into the relaxation centre, which was upstairs, carrying a green cloth bag which contained the loaded shotgun. The premises comprised two units, one of which contained Michelle Thomas and the deceased who were watching television. 
    12   In a conversation with Ms. Thomas, the offender insisted on seeing the person Nina Sciberras, whom he insisted he had come to see. Ms. Sciberras was next door in unit two and Ms. Thomas declined to disturb her. The deceased, whilst seated on the lounge, asked the offender, ""What's your name, mate?"". The offender pulled the green bag off the gun, pointed the gun at the deceased, said, ""You want to know me name?"", and fired one shot, which hit Mr. Pagett in the upper chest/throat area. Mr. Pagett screamed and walked from the room holding the wound. The offender then turned the gun on Michelle Thomas who was standing about 1.5 metres away and said, ""Lay down on the floor or you'll get it too"". 
    13   The offender directed Phillip Carroll to drive him to Lillian Carroll's house. Close to this address the offender leaned out of the van window and fired a shot into the air. Phillip Carroll drove the van back to his father's home. 
    14   Mr. Pagett was conveyed by ambulance to Nepean Hospital but at 1.43 am on 18 December 1996, he died. The direct cause of death was described by Dr. Hulewicz as ""shotgun wounds to neck and chest"". 
    15   On 18 December 1996 at about 5.30 am, Michelle Thomas was handed four large photo albums and asked to look through them to see if she could identify the two men she saw shortly before midnight on 17 December 1996. She identified a photo of the offender as the man who shot the deceased. 
    16   On the night of 18 December 1996, the offender and Phillip Carroll camped out near the M4. About 8.15 am on 19 December, they attended the Shell Service Station at Marsden Park where the offender made two phone calls. An off duty police officer, Constable Price, saw the two men walking along the road near the garage and contacted other police. Both men were arrested hiding in the bush nearby. They were conveyed to Blacktown Police Station. The offender has been in custody for this offence since then and, pursuant to s.24 of the Act, I take that into account. His sentence will date from that day. 
    17   The offender took part in an ERISP comprising 250 questions and answers. He agreed that he was at his brother Phillip's house on 17 December 1996 having about eight beers over the day and watching Phillip Junior work on the car. He admitted breaking the window at Mr. Frohreich's house but stated it was an accident. He stated that he then went home to bed. The offender denied any knowledge of the shooting of Stephen Pagett on 17 December 1996. The offender mentioned that he had previously been in a ""mental institution"" (Bloomfield Hospital). 
    18   On 10 August 1999, Phillip Carroll made a statement to police admitting that he and the offender went to the Relaxation Centre on 17 December 1996. He stated that he did not know the prisoner had a gun. He gave sworn evidence that he would give evidence for the Crown in the trial of the offender. 
    19   Subsequently, the offender was examined by the four psychiatrists, namely, Dr. Wilcox on 12 August 1999, Dr. Strum on 13 August 1999, Dr. Westmore on 27 September 1999, all engaged by the defence; and Dr. Yvonne Skinner on 27 January 2000, engaged by the Crown. To the psychiatrists, the prisoner admitted he was the person who shot the deceased. 
    20   The opinions of all four psychiatrists were that at the relevant time the offender was suffering from an abnormality of mind arising from an inherent cause, namely either borderline personality disorder or acute depression or both and that his mental responsibility was substantially affected. 
    21   I had previously dealt with the offender's nephew on a charge of failing, without reasonable excuse to bring information to the attention of a member of the Police Service, which information might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of Lee Dean Carroll, and that nephew, as I have said, had, on 10 August made a statement to police and agreed to give sworn evidence concerning his uncle. 
    22   As soon as all the psychiatric evidence was forthcoming and the Crown indicated it was prepared to accept a plea to manslaughter, the plea was then entered on that basis. Taking that into account under s.22 of the Act, his sentence will therefore be less than would otherwise have been imposed. But I have regard to his earlier denials of involvement when assessing the appropriate weight to be given to the plea. 
    23   Despite the matters referred to in the histories given to the psychiatrists and in the character material, the offender has almost no criminal record. 
    24   In the material provided to me were the statements of Terrence Humphries concerning events prior to 17 December and various other statements concerning subsequent events. That material discloses various offences, particularly as allegedly involving the gun and the drugs with which offences the offender has not been charged. 
    25   Both the Crown and the offender's counsel have submitted I should, having regard to the principles enunciated by the High Court in The Queen v. De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, consider what is referred to in that material by way of background and context in relation to the submissions concerning the degree of mental responsibility remaining in the offender at the time of the crime charged. 
    26   In particular, both the Crown and the defence in the light of the medical opinion, to which I shall turn shortly, have contended that the offender is to be sentenced on the basis that his act of raising the shotgun and shooting was on impulse, unpremeditated and without any prior formed or planned intention to rob or kill on the night. So much I accept. The offender has consistently maintained to the doctors that he went to the premises to sell the gun or barter it for drugs.  
    27   However, he has contended by his counsel that he didn't realise the gun was loaded although that contention is inconsistent with an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm or that the offender was recklessly indifferent to human life, in that he knew that his act was likely to kill. That contention is inconsisent with the plea and simply does not accord with the undisputed objective facts even having regard to the offender's mental state. He plainly intended to shoot not dry-fire and even affected as he was he must have, at least realised a shotgun blast would at least cause grievous bodily harm. I reject that contention and find that the offender had at least an intention to cause grievous bodily harm when he fired, albeit it was formed when his mental responsibility was substantially affected as I have held. 
    28   As I said during argument, I accept that this is a severely disturbed young man, who during that period was affected by the use of various drugs, was violent in an irrational way and who had over the preceding years grown more disturbed and more violent progressively, whatever be the psychological mechanism that was operating, and that the results of it were certainly a grossly disordered personality coupled with depression, suicidal feelings and a disregard because of the operation of those medical conditions, for matters for which a reasonable citizen would have had regard. 
    29   The plea means that he had all the elements of murder and that at that time he was, because of his medical condition, substantially unable to act in a rational manner. But I must still apply the principles set out by the High Court in Veen v. The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476-477, discussed in Regina v. Engert (1995) 84 A. Crim. R. 67 at 68-71; Regina v. EJ (CCA, unreported 1 April 1997); Regina v. Tran [1999] NSWSC 1146 and applied by me in Regina v. Burke [2000] NSWSC 356. The sentence must reflect the objective seriousness involved in the taking of a human life in such a way and the seriousness of the offences taken into account. Nonetheless, and having regard to his mental condition, it is necessary to structure the orders the law requires me to make so as to have regard to the application of those principles of sentencing to his actual culpability and to impose a sentence which reflects those principles in the total sentence and in its components. It is also important that the sentence and its components meet the community requirements that the period during which he might be able to be liberated has a true meaning of advantage to the community and the period during which he is detained in custody be devoted not simply to a mere quarantine but to achieving some community purpose of punishment and assistance to the community goal of rehabilitation. To do so is to serve the ultimate sentencing goal of protection of the community: Regina v. Wright (CCA, unreported 28 February 1997). 
    30   Here, special circumstances are clearly made out: Regina v. B (1993) 68 A. Crim. R. 547 and particularly having regard to the principles in Regina v. Fernando (1992) 76 A. Crim. R. 56 and what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Leonard (CCA, unreported 22 November 1996). 
    31   Elements of general deterrence and personal deterrence and rehabilitation and the balance between them plainly need modification in a case such as this: see Regina v. Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A. Crim. R. 81 and those cases which deal with the appropriate balance to be effected where an offender is suffering from some such condition as is this offender. 
    32   As Dr. Skinner had access to the histories given to and the opinions of the other psychiatrists as well as the case papers and the prison medical clinic records, it is convenient to refer to the offender's prior personal circumstances, as set out in her report, tendered by the Crown. 
    33   I turn to the offender's personal circumstances. He was born on 29 November 1974 and is now 25 years of age. He is Aboriginal. He had, apparently, a long history of depression and an intense relationship collapsed some four months prior to the offence. He recommenced abusing alcohol and drugs. His family considered his committal to a mental hospital. He told the doctor he was suicidal and attempted to kill himself with his cousin's gun (the murder weapon) and sought to exchange it for drugs or sell it. 
    34   He is the second youngest of 11 children. His family had followed the opportunity for employment, moving frequently about the State. His parents separated when he was 10. He has lived with various relatives. His education is limited. The family has a tragic history apparently involving mental illness, a death and another severely injured sibling. 
    35   He is epileptic and had abused drugs and alcohol from an early age. 
    36   He has an appalling history of severe self-mutilation (over 100 scars) and suicide attempts and had been treated for a few days in a psychiatric hospital. 
    37   Dr. Skinner concludes that:- 
     
      
       
       ""Lee Carroll suffers from borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder may be regarded as an underlying mental condition, characterised by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships and marked impulsivity. Mr. Carroll has demonstrated a pattern of unstable and intense relationships characteristic of the disorder. He has a past history of instability of self-image and self-harming behaviour. He may have been suffering from depression or from a markedly reactive instability of mood around the time of the alleged offences. However, the principal and pervasive underlying mental condition of borderline personality disorder may be viewed as an abnormality of mind from inherent causes. 
       
      
      
       
       Thus, I believe that he may have a defence of diminished responsibility as a result of his personality disorder. This abnormality of mind reduces his ability to control impulses and frustration and to deal with mood changes in an appropriate manner. 
       
      
      
       
       Although he admitted that he had consumed alcohol and had taken drugs around the time of the alleged offences, and this may have been a contributing factor, I believe that the principal problem in relation to his mental state and behaviour is his underlying condition of borderline personality disorder. 
       
      
      
       
       Psychotherapy is generally recommended as a form of treatment for borderline personality disorder. In the custodial setting, Mr. Carroll has received this form of treatment from the prison psychologist and also from Dr. Daniels. Although prison medical records show that there have been some outbursts of verbal aggression and a number of occasions on which Mr. Carroll was depressed and felt suicidal, there is evidence that these episodes have been less frequent over the last 12 to 18 months and that his psychological condition has generally improved. It is to be hoped that his personality will undergo some maturation over the next few years. I would recommend continuing treatment with his present medication, gradually reducing the doses of diazepam over time and continuing psychological therapy. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Carroll has a good understanding of the charges against him and the legal proceedings. He is fit to plead and to stand trial."" 
       
      
    38   In custody he has been detained in hospital facilities and treated with appropriate medication, particularly by Dr. Daniels from whom a report was obtained evidencing the offender's good progress to rehabilitation and in overcoming his illness. 
    39   His statements to the psychiatrists and that in evidence before me showed a real degree of insight and contrition. One can see in the reports of the psychiatrists a developing prospect of rehabilitation whilst in imprisonment in his behaviour and insight. 
    40   The evidence of the chaplain, the reports of the drug and alcohol worker and a Corrective Services officer are greatly to his credit. 
    41   The Crown submits:- 
     
      
       
       ""The factors which need to be considered on this issue are:- 
       
      
      
       
       1. The guarded prognosis of the psychiatrists given the prisoner's longstanding personality disorder and the difficulty of treating such a disease. 
       
      
      
       
       2. The consensus that the offence may well have occurred without the ingestion of drugs and alcohol, although they were undoubtedly contributing factors. 
       
      
      
       
       3. The fact that the prisoner resorted to alcohol and illegal drugs which contributed to the likelihood of such an offence occurring. Obviously such drugs will be available to the prisoner on his release from prison. 
       
      
      
       
       4. Although his record is minor, there is evidence that the prisoner is prone to violence. That evidence is contained in the statements of Melissa Toivonen, Phillip Paul Carroll and Terrence Humphries.""  
       
      
    42   In considering these matters, I apply the principles I have earlier referred to. In particular I have regard to the effects of the drugs and the intoxication as not mitigatory but indicating a real danger to rehabilitation on the offender's release when taken in conjunction with his psychiatric condition. In this regard, I note the matters referred to by Spigelmen, CJ. in Regina v. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, applied by me in Regina v. Jancek [1999] NSWSC 1126 and Regina v. Burke [2000] NSWSC 356. 
    43   In relation to the special circumstances, he will need both a long period of support and assistance and probably treatment in his own and the community's interest. In structuring the sentence to reflect this I note the change in the law affected by the passing of the Act. In the Second Reading Speech appears the following:- 
     
      
       
       ""Detention can be by way of full-time imprisonment, home detention or periodic detention. In the ordinary course of events, the non-parole period will be three-quarters of the term of the sentence unless the court decides there are 'special circumstances', in which case it can impose a lesser non-parole period. Crucial changes introduced by the Sentencing Act 1989- the abolition of all remissions and that three-quarters of the term must be spent in detention unless there are special circumstances - are in no way changed by this or any other amendment. Truth in sentencing will remain. 
       
      
      
       
       Clause 44(2) ensures that a court that varies the statutory ratio must record its reasons for doing so. Although identical in all respects with the 'minimum term' of the Sentencing Act 1989, the bill restores the term 'non-parole period'. This reflects what really happens in sentencing. The term of the sentence is the actual period the prisoner may spend in detention. The non-parole period is the minimum period they must serve before being eligible for release. 
       
      
      
       
       The Sentencing Act 1989 tried in s.5(1) to change the way sentences of imprisonment were imposed by the courts. In theory, a court was required first to set a minimum term which must be served and then to add a period during which the prisoner could be released on parole. In practice, things were not quite so simple. The two-stage sentencing process has been described by the present Chief Justice of New South Wales as 'quite artificial'. The Law Reform Commission was similarly critical, noting:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'The mere statement of a minimum term and additional term cannot effectively convey all the purposes of punishment. It is only once a head sentence has been set that the court can determine the minimum term, that is, the period which the offender must, in justice, serve in gaol.' (pp.179-180) 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       Clause 44 implements this part of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations."" 
       
      
    44   The approach I should now take is set out by s.44(1). Having found special circumstances, it is not open to me to increase the parole period and thus the total sentence to reflect them so that now the variation in proportion between the different components will require a balance having regard to the considerations referred to by the High Court in Power v. Regina (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628; Bugmy v. The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 and Leeth v. The Commonwealth (1992) 174 CLR 455, remembering that any release on parole leaves the offender liable to return to serve the whole term. 
    45   It is not only to the length and prospects of the head sentence and the parole period I should have regard, but also to the necessity for the non-parole period adequately to reflect the criminality in all the circumstances of the principal crime and those taken into account and the offender's personal circumstances as affected by whether, because of his mental condition, Aboriginality and vulnerability he will serve the custodial portion of his sentence in circumstances more onerous than the general prison population. I accept that these considerations apply here. 
    46   Lee Dean Carroll, taking into account those additional offences, I sentence you to imprisonment for 12 years to date from 19 December 1996 with a non-parole period of seven years and six months. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 18 June 2004. 
    47   I direct these remarks be provided to the Corrective Services Department and to the Parole Board for consideration on the circumstances in which the offender will serve the custodial portion of his sentence and on what conditions and assistance should apply on his parole.

     DUNFORD J HULME J BARR J Friday, 19 May 2000 
     
     REGINA v GPP 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    3   BARR J: The appellant, whom I will refer to as GPP, appeals against convictions entered in the District Court for sexual offences against four children. The Crown presented a separate indictment for each complainant and the four trials were heard consecutively. 
     
      
    4   There is also an application for leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
       
      The first trial 
       
      
    5   The complainant at the first trial was a child I will call SKM. She was a niece of the appellant. There were seven counts. The first concerned an assault that was alleged to have taken place between 14 July 1981 and 31 December 1982, when the complainant was about seven years old. The accused, the complainant and their families resided in a village in western New South Wales. The appellant took the complainant and a cousin BY, then five years of age, on his motorcycle to a dam in a paddock a short distance from the village. When they arrived the appellant dropped off the cousin and took the complainant on a further two hundred metres to a tree. There he sat her down, put his hands down the front of her underpants and inserted a finger into her vagina. 
     
      
    6   There was no evidence of complaint. The Crown did not call the complainant’s cousin to give evidence. 
     
      
    7   The appellant gave evidence denying the act complained of. He said that he did not own or have the use of a motorcycle during the period of time particularised. He said that he hurt his back at work in March 1981 and was off work for six years as a result. He spent a considerable part of that time in hospital and was unable to drive or ride for long periods of time. 
     
      
    8   The cousin’s mother gave evidence that the complainant was living elsewhere and could not have been in the village at the time complained of. 
     
      
    9   The appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    10   In the second count the Crown alleged a further indecent assault during the same period of time. The appellant and the complainant were present at her grandparents’ house, where she resided, in the same village. The appellant took the complainant into the laundry and told her to place her hands on his penis. She did so and he ejaculated. There was no evidence of complaint. 
     
      
    11   The appellant gave evidence denying the act. 
     
      
    12   The appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    13   The third count depended on an incident which was said to have taken place in 1983 or 1984 when the complainant was nine years old. At the appellant’s request the complainant met him in the fowl yard of her grandparents’ house. He told her to put her mouth on his penis and she did so. There was no evidence of complaint. 
     
      
    14   The appellant gave evidence denying the act complained of and said that there was no fowl yard at the house at the time. 
     
      
    15   The complainant’s mother gave evidence to say that there was a fowl yard at the house at the time. 
     
      
    16   The appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    17   The fourth count charged a similar act which took place between 14 May 1984 and 13 May 1986 when the complainant was ten or eleven years old. The appellant took her, her sister SLP and a friend on a visit to the rodeo ground near the village to collect firewood. The complainant’s sister gave evidence that she went with the appellant, the complainant and friend on such an occasion, during which the appellant and the complainant went out of sight behind a toilet building. 
     
      
    18   The complainant said that she complained to the friend but withdrew the complaint when her friend said that she would tell her mother. The friend was not called to give evidence. 
     
      
    19   The appellant denied the act complained of. He denied ever going to that place for firewood. 
     
      
    20   The appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    21   The fifth and sixth counts concerned activities which took place at a motel in Dubbo between 23 March 1986 and 31 December 1987. The appellant took the complainant and her sister NP to Dubbo, where they stayed in a motel. The appellant entered the bathroom whilst the complainant was taking a shower and inserted his finger into her vagina. That was the act the subject of the fifth count. 
     
      
    22   The complainant said that she had told her sister what happened. 
     
      
    23   The sister was called to give evidence. She remembered going with the appellant and the complainant in his car to Dubbo, but not where she stayed. She remembered the appellant being fined for speeding, and the date 7 October 1987 was fixed by reference to an official record of a fine imposed upon him. 
     
      
    24   The sister did not give evidence of any complaint to her. 
     
      
    25   The complainant’s mother said that there was an occasion on which the appellant had taken the complainant and her sister to Dubbo. 
     
      
    26   In evidence, the appellant agreed that he had taken the complainant and her sister to Dubbo but said that he had dropped the complainant off at the house of a woman he named. He did not remember where he and the sister stayed. The woman he named was not called to give evidence. 
     
      
    27   The appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    28   The sixth count depended on the complainant’s evidence that the appellant inserted his finger into her vagina whilst she was in bed in the motel. There was no evidence of complaint. 
     
      
    29   The appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    30   The appellant was convicted on the seventh and last count. The complainant said that on 8 December 1987, when she was thirteen years old, she and two other children, NLP and SY were staying at the appellant’s house at Cobar. One day when the complainant was having a shower, the appellant sent the other children away to a service station to buy paddle pops. She and the appellant were in the house alone. The complainant left the bathroom and went to the bedroom. The appellant followed her, pulled the towel from her, lay her on the bed and tried to touch her vagina. She pushed his hand away, screamed and threatened to tell her father. He left the room. 
     
      
    31   NLP gave evidence that when she returned from the service station the complainant was in the house, dressed only in a towel, crying. The witness heard her shout, “You fucking hide from him yourself”. 
     
      
    32   SY was not called to give evidence. 
     
      
    33   The complainant said that she told a friend, MJ, about the appellant’s conduct and that MJ had spoken to the complainant’s sister S, who told the complainant that if she did not tell their mother, she would. MJ said in evidence that no such conversations took place between her and the complainant or between her and S. S gave evidence that she had spoken to MJ and to the complainant in the terms described by the complainant. 
     
      
    34   Following the complaint a police officer, Sergeant Hay, attended the complainant’s parents’ house on 9 December 1987. Sergeant Hay gave evidence to the effect that he would probably have recorded information and statements about the complaint in his notebook. However, he had no recollection of what the complainant had said to him and his notebook was unavailable and had probably been destroyed. Sergeant Hay identified his signature on an occurrence pad entry dated 10 December 1987. 
     
      
    35   Evidence was given by the husband of the complainant that they began going out together in 1989. After some time the complainant told him that the appellant had interfered with her sexually from the age of about seven years to about thirteen or fourteen years. He said that the complaint was about “touching her and all that sort of stuff”. Asked to elaborate, he said “Just like the fingering, head jobs and that sort of stuff”. 
     
      
    36   The first two grounds of appeal argued may be dealt with together. They asserted that the learned trial judge erred in not explaining fully to the jury the meaning and importance of the lack of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence and that his Honour erred in not fully explaining to the jury why it would be dangerous to convict the appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    37   No request was made for either of the explanations now contended for and leave is necessary to appeal on these grounds. 
     
      
    38   His Honour said this to the jury - 
     
      
       
        
        In this case there is one witness who is essential to the proof of the Crown case and that is, of course, the complainant in the case (the complainant). You should therefore examine and scrutinise her evidence with great care before you decide on a verdict of guilty on any or all or some of these counts on the indictment and you should only find the accused guilty if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth and the accuracy of the evidence given by (the complainant). I will be saying more about that later. The fact that I have given you that warning that you should use extreme care in the way that I have indicated does not mean that I have formed a view about (the complainant’s) evidence because you will recall that I do not have any responsibility at all in that regard. The evaluation of her evidence is entirely a matter for you. 
        
       
      
    39   Later in the summing-up his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        It is dangerous to convict on the evidence of a complainant when it is not supported by evidence of other witnesses. You may act on it if, after consideration of this warning, you are satisfied as to its truth and its accuracy. 
        
       
      
    40   His Honour’s remarks were made in the context of the trial generally and might have been understood by the jury as applying to any count. 
     
      
    41   It was submitted on appeal that his Honour failed to explain the meaning of corroboration and that the complainant’s evidence was not corroborated. Those submissions must be rejected because the evidence of the complainant on the seventh count was corroborated in a striking way by the evidence of NLP. She had been sent away by the appellant, leaving him alone with the complainant, and had returned to find the complainant distressed and uttering words that might mean that the appellant had a need to fear retribution. It was straight away after that event that the complainant complained to her parents and the police. 
     
      
    42   The case against the appellant was strongest on the seventh count for a number of reasons, including the supporting evidence of NLP. It might have advantaged the appellant to have the two directions I have extracted left as though they applied to that count as much as to the others, and that may explain why defence counsel made no application for further directions. If his Honour had dealt with the subject in any more detail he would have had to tell the jury that the evidence of NLP was independent of the complainant’s and that if they accepted it the Crown case on the seventh count did not depend on the evidence of the complainant alone. It is not surprising that defence counsel was content to leave the directions as given. 
     
      
    43   I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    44   The next ground of appeal argued complained that his Honour erred in failing to warn the jury about the consequences of the fact that the complainant was an adult, who was recalling in her evidence events that occurred when she was a child, and that for that reason her evidence appear to have greater veracity than it might otherwise warrant. It was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to point out to the jury that a child’s comprehension of sexual matters was usually if not invariably limited and that the complainant’s description of matters such as penile erection, masturbation and ejaculation must have been coloured by her later understanding of such matters. 
     
      
    45   It is not necessary to consider whether his Honour ought to have warned the jury in the terms contended for on the counts alleging misconduct whilst the complainant was of tender years, because the appellant was acquitted on those counts. The events the subject of the seventh count, the only one on which he was convicted, took place when the complainant was thirteen years old. The jury were entitled to assume that by that age she knew about penile erection, masturbation and ejaculation. 
     
      
    46   No application was made for the warning contended for on appeal. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    47   The next ground of appeal argued complained that his Honour erred in not explaining to the jury that the appellant was prejudiced by the unavailability of the complainant’s contemporary account which would have been recorded in Sergeant Hay’s notebook. 
     
      
    48   It was submitted that the absence of the notebook prejudiced the appellant because he could not test the evidence of the complainant by reference to her contemporaneous account and because he was denied the benefit of evidence of earlier allegations about and denials by the appellant which might have been recorded in the notebook. 
     
      
    49   No application was made for a direction in the terms contended for on appeal, and that is not a matter that counsel overlooked. Shortly before commencing the summing-up his Honour told counsel what he intended to say about the occurrence pad entry and the absence of the notebook. 
     
      
    50   The narrative portion of the occurrence pad entry was in the following terms - 
     
      
       
        
        On Sunday, 6/12/87 (the complainant), together with her sister, (NLP),10 old went to stay with their Uncle, (the appellant), about 30 old, of (address). They were to stay a week to attend school to save them travelling by bus from (the complainant’s residence) 
         
         About 8-8.30pm On Tuesday, 8th December, 1987 (the complainant) went to have a shower, (the appellant) had gave the other sister money to go and buy an ice block. He then entered the bathroom and attempted to fondle (the complainant), she ran from the shower into her bedroom, he followed her and again attempted to touch her breasts and lower body. She kept pushing him away and he then picked her up and threw her to the bed. He held her there for a couple of minutes until she informed him she was going to tell her Father (his brother). He then released her and she ran from the room. She suffered no injuries and was not sexually assaulted. 
         
         She informed her parents of the incident about 8pm 9/12/87. She was interviewed at … 10.15am 10th in the presence of her Mother, … Both her parents requested no Police action be taken as it was more a family concern, however, they wished to have the matter recorded. Both agreed that it was an isolated incident and there had been no reports of previous similar incidents. No further police action. 
        
       
      
    51   His Honour told counsel that he was intending to say this to the jury - 
     
      
       
        
        Now you recall the evidence of Barry Hay, a retired Sergeant from Cobar. He was the author of exhibit B, an occurrence pad entry made on 10 December 1987, which dealt with allegations forming the basis of count 7 on the indictment. Mr Hay has no independent memory of any of the events giving rise to the occurrence pad entry, he was unable to say whether or not he made a notebook entry at the time he interviewed various people, he was unable to say who those people were, although one can refer from the text of the entry that he probably spoke to the complainant and the accused. He was unable to say whether statements appeared in his notebook, from who they were taken, whether or not they were signed as to their accuracy and whether or not they were recorded on his occurrence pad accurately reflects on his notebook 
        
       
       
        
        For these reasons you should take great care when you come to evaluate the weight that you give to this piece of evidence. 
        
       
      
    52   Defence counsel said that he was content with what his Honour proposed to say and in due course his Honour gave the jury a direction substantially in the foreshadowed terms. 
     
      
    53   It often happens that the precise terms of complaint cannot be put before the jury, with the consequence that an accused person is unable to compare a verbatim report with the complainant’s evidence before the jury, but that does not of itself produce injustice. The submission that the appellant thereby lost an advantage assumes without warrant that there must have been a material difference between what the complainant told Sergeant Hay and what she told the jury. Since the contents of the occurrence pad entry could only have derived from the complainant’s account, of course, counsel had the opportunity to put to her any suggested inconsistency between the contents of that entry and what she told the jury. She was cross-examined accordingly. 
     
      
    54   As trial counsel recognised, his Honour’s directions were appropriate. It was not necessary for directions to be given in the terms contended for on appeal. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    55   The next ground of appeal argued asserted that his Honour erred in instructing the jury that the complainant’s statement to her husband in about December 1989, to the effect that the appellant had put his fingers in her vagina and got her to suck his penis, could be used as evidence of complaint on the seventh count. 
     
      
    56   What his Honour said was this - 
     
      
       
        
        I want to now go on to another aspect of these matters dealing with the question of complaint, as it is called in the law. That is to say, what she said or complained about to some people at some stage about what had happened to her. The complainant has made complaints about count seven to her mother and to the police officer, Mr Hay. There is some other evidence from her husband that she spoke to him some years later. 
        
       
      
    57   His Honour then went on to deal with the way the jury could use evidence of complaint or of absence of complaint. 
     
      
    58   I do not read what his Honour said as instructing the jury that what the complainant said to her husband in 1989 (as opposed to what she told her parents and the police in 1987) was relevant to the seventh count. As the jury were aware, the complainant told her husband about digital penetration and fellatio. No such act was asserted in the seventh count. I doubt whether the jury would have understood his Honour’s remarks about the complainant’s husband’s evidence to relate to the seventh count at all. It is apparent also that trial counsel did not take his Honour’s words to have that effect, for no application was made for his Honour to modify or withdraw the direction. 
     
      
    59   I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    60   The final ground of appeal asserted that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    61   A number of submissions were made under this ground. First, that the appellant was unable to account for his movements and to obtain evidence of alibi and the like because of the delay which had happened between the alleged events and the date of trial, or at least the date of charging. It was submitted that the evidence of the complainant was neither cogent nor convincing, as demonstrated by the acquittals on the first six counts. That was said to show that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her evidence. 
     
      
    62   It was submitted that evidence of complaint did not enhance the credibility of the complainant on the seventh count because the terms of complaint were not clear. The attention of the Court was drawn to what were said to be inconsistencies between what the complainant told the jury and what was recorded in the occurrence pad entry. Whereas the occurrence pad entry stated that the complainant and her sister were staying at the appellant’s house in order to avoid the bus journey between their home and school, the complainant in cross-examination did not remember why they were staying there, did not remember the appellant taking them to school and did not remember going to school at all at that time. 
     
      
    63   Whereas the statement in the occurrence pad entry said that the appellant attempted to fondle the complainant in the bathroom, the complainant in cross-examination said that that did not happen in the bathroom. She ran into the bedroom, he followed her there and that is where it happened. 
     
      
    64   The Court’s attention was drawn to what was said to be an inconsistency in the evidence of the complainant before the jury. She said that the appellant threw her onto the bed. He grabbed her by the arm and pushed her down. He was in front of her. He was on the bed with her. It was suggested in cross-examination that it would not be right to say that he was lying on top of her and she agreed, saying that he was not lying on top of her, he was trying to move her hands out of the way, trying to touch her but that she would not let him. Her attention was drawn to a statement she had given the police which contained the following passage - 
     
      
       
        
        I was on my back and (the appellant) was on top of me, (the appellant) started trying to touch my vagina but I kept putting my hands in his way so he couldn’t. 
        
       
      
    65   It was suggested that in her statement she had told the police that the appellant was on top of her and her answer was that he practically was, that she was on her back and that he was in front of her trying to move her hands. 
     
      
    66   It was not correct to submit that the appellant was unable to account for his movements because of any passage of time. This was the one count in the first trial in respect of which there had been immediate complaint, as a result of which the matter had been drawn to the attention of the police. The appellant was asked about this in examination in chief and said that Sergeant Hay had spoken to him about allegations made by the complainant and that he had denied them. 
     
      
    67   It was not disputed that the complainant and her sister had stayed at the appellant’s house at the relevant time or that the complainant and the appellant must have been within the house together. 
     
      
    68   I have read a transcript of the evidence of the complainant. Although she did not always describe events in the same way, I do not think that her evidence is internally inconsistent. I do not think that there is any serious inconsistency between the evidence she gave to the jury and the account that appears in the occurrence pad entry. It is necessary to acknowledge the superior position of the jury in seeing, hearing and evaluating the reliability of the complainant. This Court does not have that advantage. There seems no reason why they should not have accepted her evidence at face value about what happened in the appellant’s house on the occasion that gave rise to the seventh count. 
     
      
    69   The Crown case was a strong one. As well as the evidence of the complainant, there was the supporting evidence of NLP about the unusual distress of the complainant and the words she uttered to the appellant. There was immediate complaint to the parents of the complainant and to the police. Although the friend MJ denied that the complainant told her about the activities of the appellant, the jury were entitled to reject MJ’s denial. 
     
      
    70   In my opinion nothing about the acquittals on the first six counts leads me to the conclusion that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant on the seventh count. 
     
      
    71   In my opinion this ground of appeal has not been made good. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction after the first trial. 
     
      
       
      The second trial 
       
      
    72   The complainant at the second trial was BLY. There were four counts. The complainant’s evidence about the first was that during the school holidays in 1984, when she was eight years old, the appellant took her for a drive from Dubbo to Cobar in his white V8 Holden. On the way he took his penis out of his trousers, told her to suck it and held her head down, forcing her to do so. The car stopped. At about that time another car, driven by an aunt of the complainant, drove past. The complainant’s aunt spoke to the appellant and then asked the complainant whether she wanted to be driven back home. The complainant accepted the offer. The complainant spoke to her cousin NLP about the matter. 
     
      
    73   NLP was called but did not mention any such complaint. 
     
      
    74   The complainant’s mother, who was also the appellant’s sister, gave evidence that she had never sent the complainant off to Cobar with the appellant and that the complainant was never brought home by her aunt. 
     
      
    75   The complainant’s aunt, also the appellant’s sister, gave evidence that she had never had the complainant in her car between Cobar and Dubbo and had never seen her in a car driven by the appellant. 
     
      
    76   The appellant gave evidence denying the incident, denying taking the complainant in his car when she was small and denying having a white V8 Holden until he purchased one in 1993. 
     
      
    77   The appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    78   The complainant’s evidence on the second count was that one day in 1984 she was taking a shower at home when the appellant opened the curtain and asked for the soap and said that he wanted to wash her. She handed him the soap and he rubbed his hands over her breasts and vagina. No complaint was made until 1995. 
     
      
    79   The appellant gave evidence denying the incident. 
     
      
    80   The appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    81   The complainant’s evidence on the third count was that between 9 February 1988 and 31 December 1989 she and other children were taken by the appellant to a swimming hole near Cobar. Whilst she was in the water with the appellant he inserted his finger into her vagina. The complainant did not recall the names or genders of the other children. 
     
      
    82   The appellant gave evidence that there were no waterholes near Cobar which were fit to swim in. He had never swum in any of them or taken anyone to them. 
     
      
    83   The appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    84   The complainant’s evidence on the fourth count was that one day between 9 February 1990 and 31 December 1991 she was staying at an aunt’s house at Cobar. Whilst she was having a bath the appellant entered the room and got into the bath with her. She slapped him, got out of the bath and went to her bedroom. He followed her, pushed her onto the bed and tried to insert his penis into her vagina. She struck him again, left the house and went to the house of friends where she stayed for a few days. She complained to her two cousins, NLP and BP, about the appellant’s behaviour. 
     
      
    85   NLP said the complainant had told her that the appellant had tried to get into the bath with her. BP gave evidence that the complainant was upset, crying, and said that she had left the house because the appellant had tried to do something to her. When she was asked about it she said that he had tried to fondle her in the shower and in the bedroom when she was getting dressed. 
     
      
    86   The appellant gave evidence denying the incident. 
     
      
    87   The appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    88   The first two grounds of appeal complained that his Honour erred in not explaining fully to the jury the meaning and importance of the lack of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence and in not fully explaining to the jury why it would be dangerous to convict the appellant on her uncorroborated evidence. They may be dealt with together. 
     
      
    89   Having directed the jury that the burden of proof lay on the Crown throughout the trial, his Honour pointed out that the Crown case depended on the evidence of the complainant and that for that reason her evidence should be examined and scrutinised with great care before the appellant were convicted on any count. His Honour directed the jury about the need to be satisfied about the truth and accuracy of her evidence. His Honour reminded the jury that there was no complaint about the evidence the subject of the first three counts and of the significance of that fact for their assessment of the credibility and reliability of the complainant. His Honour directed the jury that it was dangerous to convict the accused on the evidence of the complainant when it was not supported by independent witnesses. 
     
      
    90   In my opinion, taken together, these directions brought home to the jury the need to look for support for the complainant’s evidence from other witnesses and sufficiently explained the meaning and significance of “lack of corroboration” in all the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    91   Defence counsel at the trial apparently considered the directions adequate because no application was made for further directions. I would refuse leave to appeal on these grounds. 
     
      
    92   The next ground of appeal argued complained that his Honour erred in failing to warn the jury about the consequences of the fact that the complainant was an adult, who was recalling in her evidence complaints that occurred when she was a child, and that for that reason her evidence might appear to have greater veracity than it might otherwise warrant. It was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to point out to the jury that a child’s comprehension of sexual matters was usually if not invariably limited and that the complainant’s description of matters such as fellatio must have been coloured by her later understanding of such matters. 
     
      
    93   In his final address, defence counsel referred to the situation of an adult giving evidence about what happened in childhood as a matter for the jury to take into account. Having done so, counsel was not concerned to ask the learned trial judge to say anything about the matter. In my opinion his Honour was not obliged to do so. 
     
      
    94   On appeal, counsel referred to a passage of a judgment of Higgins J in Aitchison v Director of Public Prosecutions (1996) 90 A Crim R 448, in which his Honour described recollection in adult terms of childhood events as giving a false sense of veracity which, if the evidence had been given contemporaneously, might not have been given. 
     
      
    95   I do not think that his Honour was attempting to lay down any rule for jury directions generally in which adults give evidence about things that happened to them in childhood. I understand his Honour’s observations to be no more than a comment upon the facts of the case before him. 
     
      
    96   I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    97   The next ground of appeal complained that his Honour erred in failing sufficiently to assist the jury about the use they might make of discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    98   This is yet another ground of appeal which results from a careful combing of the summing-up without reference to the issues that really mattered to trial counsel in the conduct of the case. Having dealt with the evidence of the complainant on each of the counts, reading substantial parts of it verbatim from the transcript, his Honour observed that the complainant had been cross-examined at length and that inconsistencies had been mentioned in counsel’s address, particularly about the fourth count in the indictment, where in her statement the complainant had said that penetration had occurred whereas in her evidence before the jury she said that there was no penetration. 
     
      
    99   It was submitted that that portion of the summing-up gave little or no assistance to the jury as to the use they might make of such inconsistencies as they might find. 
     
      
    100   This second trial commenced on Monday 18 May 1998 and the jury retired at lunchtime on Wednesday 20 May 1998. It was necessary and desirable in view of the shortness of the trial for the trial judge to deal only briefly with the evidence, which must have been fresh in the minds of the jury. Counsel’s closing address took place on the Wednesday morning immediately before the summing-up, and must also have been fresh in the minds of the jury. 
     
      
    101   It is not the duty of the trial judge to repeat every defence submission. The importance of consistency and inconsistency in the evidence of the complainant was self-evident and needed no emphasis. 
     
      
    102   It was further submitted that his Honour’s concluding remarks, to the effect that he did not wish to say much more about the matter, were likely to leave the jury with the impression that any points raised by defence counsel were insignificant. I disagree. His Honour explained to the jury that it was their duty, not his, to find the facts and that he did not intend to express opinions about the evidence. He also directed the jury in the usual way that it was their duty to reject any opinion they perceived might be his unless they arrived independently of the same opinion. 
     
      
    103   Defence counsel did not see fit to ask his Honour for the directions sought on appeal. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    104   The next ground of appeal was that his Honour erred, in explaining to the jury why a victim of sexual assault might hesitate to complain, by providing irrelevant examples. 
     
      
    105   In the passage of the summing-up complained of his Honour told the jury that delay in complaining does not necessary mean that the allegations are false and that there may be good reasons why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in complaining. His Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        Fear of the other party, not knowing what steps to take and confusion are examples of such reasons and these problems may be greater when the complainant is a child. 
        
       
      
    106   In her evidence in chief the complainant said, referring to the first count, that she did not tell anybody at the time because she feared a flogging. When asked why she did not complain about the events the subject of the second count, she said that nobody would have believed it, that they would have shut her up and given her a smack in the mouth. 
     
      
    107   Relying on these passages, counsel for the appellant submitted that the specific reasons the complainant had given were fear of others and the probability of disbelief by others. The complainant never said that she did not know what steps to take and she never said that she was confused. What his Honour said about such matters was therefore likely to mislead the jury. Reliance was placed on R v JTS an unreported decision of this Court of 25 May 1998. 
     
      
    108   I do not think that that case supports the appellant’s argument. What was there being criticised was a direction suggesting fear of revenge by the accused as a reason for not complaining. That was described by the Court as an embellishment founded upon matters of speculation and conjecture so as to produce a trial unfair to the accused. 
     
      
    109   The facts of that case were nothing like the present. In any case, it is apparent from a reading of the transcript of the evidence of the complainant that she might well have been confused and unsure what to do about what was happening to her, and the jury were entitled to take that view. 
     
      
    110   In any case, it is permissible in my view for a trial judge to tell a jury that ignorance or confusion may explain why a child sexual assault victim fails to complain, even where those reasons are not expressly put forward in evidence. One would be surprised if such a child were not confused or ignorant of what to do. His Honour did not direct the jury that those possible reasons had been expressly put forward by the complainant and the jury were not misled. 
     
      
    111   Recognising these matters, defence counsel made no application for the direction complained of to be withdrawn. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    112   The next ground of appeal complained that his Honour erred in directing the jury that they might use evidence of complaint to show consistency with the complainant’s evidence, in failing to point out to the jury that complaints to NLP, BP and NY were inconsistent with her evidence and in failing to point out that those complaints were not referable to the act of attempted intercourse with which the appellant was charged. 
     
      
    113   Three witnesses said that the complainant had complained to them. BP said that one day during the time the complainant was staying at the appellant’s house she entered BP’s house. She was crying and told BP that she had left the appellant’s house because he “had tried to do something to her”. The complainant went on to say that he had tried to fondle her in the shower and in the bedroom when she was getting dressed. Shortly after the complainant said those things, BP noticed police officers in attendance. 
     
      
    114   NLP remembered an occasion when the complainant was staying in Cobar at a house occupied by the appellant and his sister C. The complainant came out of the house and spoke to NLP. She was upset and said that the appellant had tried to get into the bath with her. 
     
      
    115   The complainant’s mother, NY, said that it was reported to her that the complainant had left the house of the appellant, where she was supposed to be staying, and was associating with a person she disapproved of. She went to the house of her brother CP in Cobar and there spoke to the complainant, who said that she was not staying with the appellant because he got into the bath with her. When she was asked what happened, the complainant said, “I jumped up to get a towel from behind the bathroom door and (the appellant) got up behind me and said ‘I’m going to stick my dick in your arse’.” 
     
      
    116   The complaints all related to the event the subject of the fourth count. His Honour said this to the jury - 
     
      
       
        
        Members of the jury, in respect to count 4, the complainant, (BLY), made complaints about that conduct alleged at the hands of the accused to those three people that I have mentioned and that is what it is alleged she said to them in response to that conversation. That is called evidence of complaint. Complaint is a part of the Crown case. You can use it to support the evidence of the complainant in a way that may show some consistency with the complainant’s evidence. You should evaluate that as evidence in the trial. 
        
       
      
    117   It was submitted that the substance of the complainant’s evidence about the fourth count was that the appellant lay on top of her and rubbed his penis on her vagina in an attempt to penetrate her. None of the complaints was in any way consistent with that allegation. It was therefore necessary for his Honour to direct the jury that the evidence of complaint was not about the act of attempted intercourse which was substantially the basis of the fourth count and could not be used to support the evidence of the complainant in the manner stated by his Honour. Reliance was placed on passages contained in judgments of this Court in R v E (1996) 39 NSWLR 450 and R v RNS [1999] NSWCCA 122. 
     
      
    118   In R v E the Court observed that evidence of complaint made in substantially different terms from the sworn account, either because it contains additional allegations or does not contain allegations made in the sworn account, may be treated as detracting from the credibility of the sworn account of the events relied on by the Crown: Sperling J at 457F. 
     
      
    119   However, the Court was not in those cases laying down rules for directions that must invariably be given. Every case is different and the duty of the trial judge is to give such directions as appear appropriate to the facts of the case. It was not suggested on appeal that the evidence of complaint was not admissible, and it obviously was. In cases like the present, where evidence of complaint deals with part but not all of the appellant’s acts as detailed in the sworn evidence of the complainant, it may be appropriate to draw that fact to the attention of the jury. It may sometimes be appropriate for the trial judge to limit the use the jury might make of complaint evidence. However, it does not seem to me that it was necessary for his Honour to take that approach in the present case. 
     
      
    120   His Honour warned the jury that evidence of complaint was not independent, as the source of it was the complainant herself. He warned the jury to be cautious in their assessment of the material and to look very carefully at all the circumstances surrounding the evidence. 
     
      
    121   His Honour and counsel may well have taken the view that it was unsurprising that when complaining, the complainant had given a partial account of what the appellant had done. The complaint witnesses said that the complainant was distressed when she spoke to them. The transcript of her evidence shows that throughout the trial the complainant had a great deal of difficulty giving her evidence and was emotionally affected from time to time as she did so. She was apparently not a person to whom the giving of a forthright and complete account came easily. 
     
      
    122   Defence counsel may have viewed the evidence of the complainant in this light as well, for no application was made for his Honour to give further directions. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    123   The next two grounds of appeal may be dealt with together. They assert that his Honour erred first in not directing the jury that even if they disbelieved or did not accept the evidence of the accused it was still open to them not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused and in telling the jury 
     
      
       
        
        … and you might ask yourselves who is to be believed, but even if you think the prosecution witnesses are not telling you the truth, that does not conclude the issue whether the prosecution has proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
      
    124   It is necessary to put the words into context. During the summing-up his Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
         I should tell you, I do tell you there is no requirement for you to compartmentalise any particular witness and say of that witness, “Well, I accept everything that he said or she said or I reject everything that he said or she said”. You are entitled as judges of the facts to be able to look at the particular witness and say, “Well, I think, thinking about it, this witness on that particular point was correct, but on that particular point was mistaken”. In this case it has been submitted to you by Mr Crown that there is no room for mistake here at all. Either you accept the evidence of the complainant or you reject it. There is no possibility for any middle road here and if you reject her evidence, you are obliged to return verdicts of not guilty; if you accept her evidence and you are otherwise satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, then you are otherwise obliged to return verdicts of guilty in those cases where it is appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
         We are commonly confronted in our daily lives with circumstances where two people might tell us different versions of the same incident and it becomes necessary for us on some occasions to make some decisions about which of the two versions we accept. A lot of the time it does not matter, but because there is a conflict in the evidence in this case between what the complainant has told and what the accused has told you, it is appropriate that I say something to you about the fact finding process and about the way in which you might like to think about resolving those differences of opinion. 
        
       
       
        
         In respect to all of the witnesses you are going to have to decide whether or not that witness’ evidence was reliable. That is to say, whether you can safely act upon it. The reliability of a witness depends upon two factors. Sometimes they overlap. Those two factors are first the honesty of the witness and, second, whether or not that witness’ evidence was accurate. 
        
       
      
    125   Later in the summing-up his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        But by giving evidence, the accused became a witness in the trial like all of the other witnesses. Exactly the same principles are involved in evaluating his evidence as you would apply in evaluating the evidence of all the other witnesses. By giving evidence, of course, he in no way varied or altered the obligation of the Crown to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. By giving evidence he does not undertake to prove anything, he does not have any burden of proof. 
        
       
       
        
         It might be said, members of the jury, that the case does turn on a conflict between the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of the accused and you might ask yourselves who is to be believed, but even if you think the  
        prosecution 
         witnesses are  
        not 
         telling you the truth that does not conclude the issue whether the prosecution has proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Even if you prefer the evidence of the prosecution, your should not convict the accused unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt and the truth of the evidence of the complainant. (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    126   It was submitted that his Honour ought to have told the jury that the Crown case depended upon their accepting that the evidence of its principal witness was true beyond reasonable doubt, notwithstanding the appellant’s sworn denial, and that they did not have to believe that he was telling the truth before they were entitled to acquit him. 
     
      
    127   These grounds of appeal and the submissions made under them exemplify the unrealistic nature of this appeal, lifting words out of one part of the summing-up and paying no attention to the summing-up as a whole. In other parts of the summing-up his Honour told the jury that the burden of proof of the guilt of the accused rested upon the Crown, that the Crown had to establish each element of the charges beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused bore no onus of proof of any matter. His Honour told the jury that they did not have to be satisfied that the accused was innocent before they might acquit him. They were told that if they did not know where the truth lay the accused was entitled to the benefit of that doubt. Even if they were suspicious that the accused might have committed the crimes or some of them or one of them that would not be enough, because suspicion was no substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt, not even grave suspicion. His Honour told the jury that there was one witness in the case who was essential to the proof of all the charges against the accused, namely the complainant. They were told to examine and scrutinise her evidence with great care before they decided that a verdict of guilty should be returned on any of the charges and they should find him guilty only if they were satisfied about the truth and accuracy of her evidence. 
     
      
    128   In my opinion the summing-up as a whole gave the jury proper directions about the circumstances in which they might properly convict the appellant on any of the charges. 
     
      
    129   I have emphasised the words “prosecution” and “not” in quoting the passage relied on in the second of these grounds, because one of them must be erroneous. Perhaps, by a slip of the tongue, his Honour said “prosecution” instead of “defence” or unintentionally added the word “not”. Perhaps the passage has been mistranscribed. If it was the former, the slip was immediately corrected by the sentence which followed. 
     
      
    130   The failure of either counsel to draw attention to the matter suggests that the error was one of transcription. I do not think that the jury were misled. I would refuse leave to appeal on these grounds. 
     
      
    131   The final ground of appeal was that the verdicts were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    132   It was submitted that the delay in bringing these matters to trial had irretrievably prejudiced the appellant’s ability to meet the case against him. The wide range of dates over which the events the subject of the first two counts were said to have taken place made it impossible for the appellant to say where he was and, perhaps, produce evidence of alibi. 
     
      
    133   It seems to me that the appellant was in no worse position than an accused in most cases where the Crown cannot precisely identify the date of the acts giving rise to the charge. The appellant was in the fortunate position that he was able to call the complainant’s aunt to say, with respect to the first count, that she had never given the complainant a lift back to Dubbo and had never seen her in a car driven by the appellant. He was also able to call the complainant’s mother to say that she had never sent the complainant off to Cobar with the appellant. The jury did not believe them, but there is no reason to suppose that they would have been any more believable if they had been speaking about recent events. 
     
      
    134   The events the subject of the second count took place at the complainant’s home when only the two were present. The simple issue was whether the events had happened at all, and the appellant was able to deny them on oath. 
     
      
    135   Immediately after the assault the subject of the fourth count, the complainant complained to a number of people, including police officers. Although no charges were laid at the time the appellant was well aware of what the complainant was saying and was in a position, if he should wish, to make a record of his movements at the time. 
     
      
    136   It was submitted that the delay had robbed the appellant of the benefit of the rule, since repealed, that an accused person could not be convicted on the unsworn and uncorroborated evidence of a child. As to that, the passage of time produced the advantage for the appellant that the complainant was required to take an oath to tell the truth. Secondly, the appellant has no valid complaint because he received a trial according to law. 
     
      
    137   The appellant submitted that the complainant’s evidence was uncorroborated. The evidence of complaint was unimpressive. It was not confirmed on the first count and there was none on the second. The complaint on the final count failed to mention the appellant’s most serious act. It was submitted that the complainant’s evidence was “clearly lacking in veracity”. Long passages of her evidence were referred to. 
     
      
    138   I have read a transcript of the evidence the complainant gave but, allowing for the fact that there was no corroboration, that the appellant gave sworn evidence denying the acts alleged and that the evidence of complaint was not of the strongest kind, it does not seem to me that the jury were bound to doubt that she was speaking truthfully and accurately in her account of what the appellant did to her. 
     
      
    139   Particular reliance was placed on a retort the complainant made towards the end of her cross-examination, when she said - 
     
      
       
        
        My head’s that drug fucked it’s not funny. I can’t remember what I did yesterday and you want me to remember back years ago. Can you remember, can ya? 
        
       
      
    140   The complainant was apparently not the most sophisticated young woman. Also, as I have already remarked, she showed signs of distress as she gave her evidence. The passage relied on came almost at the end of a long cross-examination. The complainant spent almost one day out of a three day trial giving evidence. It seems clear that her outburst was not intended to be taken literally, because she claimed to be able to remember events much more than one day old. I think that the passage was merely an example of the complainant’s display of exasperation at having to endure the unfamiliar conditions of the witness box for so long. There are other examples in the transcript but it is not necessary to refer to them. The complainant’s reference to drugs was not followed up, perhaps advisedly, because the transcript shows that she responded coherently to questions asked of her. 
     
      
    141   The final submission was that the verdicts of guilty could not stand with the verdict of acquittal on the third count. However, it seems to me that there is a clear explanation for the jury’s discrimination. On the third count the complainant was quite vague about important details of the events she was describing. She was unsure how she had come to be at the swimming hole. She could not remember the names of other children present or their gender. She could not remember what she was wearing. More importantly, she could not remember whether the swimming hole was in Cobar or some other place. That must have achieved some importance in the minds of the jury when they were told by his Honour that the first element that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt was that at the time and place stated the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. 
     
      
    142   In the circumstances the acquittal is not surprising, though nothing about the circumstances of it suggests to me that the jury ought on that account to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant on the other counts. The jury were told, of course, that they could accept part and reject part of what a witness said. They were told that they had to consider the counts separately. 
     
      
    143   In my opinion this ground of appeal has not been made good. I would dismiss the appeal against the convictions at the second trial. 
     
      
       
      The third trial 
       
      
    144   There were two counts. The evidence of the complainant, SLP, on the first count was that between 30 June 1980 and 29 June 1981, when she was nine years old, she was visiting the house of her grandparents. The appellant was there too. She accepted an invitation from the appellant to go a water tank to get water for the house, which had only rain water tanks and a tank that had to be replenished from time to time. That was done by carting water from the village tank in a portable tank mounted on a utility truck. 
     
      
    145   The village tank was situated about one kilometre from the village in a fenced and gated enclosure. There were apparently no buildings around and it was a quiet spot. 
     
      
    146   The appellant drove the utility truck through the gate and positioned it under the outlet hose. He turned on the tap and got back into the utility where the complainant had remained during that operation. The utility had a bench seat. The appellant told the complainant to say nothing about this to anyone, lay her on her back on the bench seat, pulled down her pants and her trousers to her knees and lay on top of her. She did not remember whether his clothes were on. 
     
      
    147   A man called Ronnie Southern drove in through the tank gate in a blue Suzuki motor vehicle. The complainant heard the vehicle coming. The appellant must have heard it too, because he got up, got out of the utility and went to speak to Mr Southern. The complainant stayed where she was and pulled up her underpants and shorts. She remained in the utility while the accused spoke to Mr Southern. 
     
      
    148   The complainant did not say whether the appellant filled the tank but said that he got back into the utility and moved off. However, the utility broke down and they managed to push start it with the help of local children. This implies that Mr Southern had left by then. 
     
      
    149   In his evidence, the appellant said that although he had carted water for his parents up to about 1975 or 1976, he had not done so after that because there had been no need to do so. Some fruit trees his father had owned had died and that and other events made it unnecessary for the household to cart water any longer. Besides, the appellant moved away from the district in 1977 and got a job at Kemps Creek. He had never been to the tank in the company of the complainant and Mr Southern. 
     
      
    150   Evidence was adduced from the officer in charge of the investigation that inquiries undertaken to find Mr Southern had been unsuccessful. 
     
      
    151   The second count concerned the events of Melbourne Cup Day 1994, which was also the Cobar Mine picnic day. The complainant went to the picnic with her father and mother and afterwards went to her Aunty Cath’s house in Yarran Circle, Cobar. The appellant was there with some friends of his. The complainant was at the front of the house when the appellant received a telephone call for her from her mother. He called the complainant into the kitchen, where the telephone was and she entered the kitchen and took the telephone from him. As she was speaking to her mother on the phone the appellant was seated near her, feeling the outside of her clothes over her vagina. She told him to stop. 
     
      
    152   The appellant said that although he was in that house on that day he did not receive any telephone call for the complainant or call her to the telephone. He was on his way to the shower when he heard the telephone ring. 
     
      
    153   The complainant told nobody anything about these matters until about a year after the second of them. 
     
      
    154   The appellant was convicted on both counts. 
     
      
    155   The first two grounds of appeal argued may be dealt with together. They were that the learned trial judge erred in not explaining fully to the jury the meaning and importance of the lack of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence and that his Honour erred in not fully explaining to the jury why it would be dangerous to convict the appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    156   The submissions made under this ground were identical to those made under a similar ground in the appeal from the conviction at the first trial. The directions given by his Honour were not significantly different from those at the trial. It is unnecessary to say more. I would refuse leave to appeal on these grounds. 
     
      
    157   The next ground of appeal complained that his Honour erred in providing irrelevant examples when explaining why a victim of sexual assault might hesitate to complain. 
     
      
    158   The complainant’s evidence was that she was too scared to tell anyone about the events the subject of the first count and that she did not want to have any fights with the family after the second attack. His Honour told the jury that there might be good reasons why a victim of sexual assault might hesitate to complain or refrain from complaining and went on to mention fear of the other party, not knowing what steps to take and confusion as examples, and pointed out that such problems might be greater for a child. 
     
      
    159   It was submitted that since the complainant never offered confusion or ignorance as a reason for not complaining, his Honour’s directions caused the trial to miscarry. 
     
      
    160   The submission was identical to one put under a similar ground in the appeal against the convictions at the second trial. For the reasons given in dealing with that ground I would refuse leave to appeal. 
     
      
    161   The final ground of appeal was that the verdicts were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. It was submitted that the delay in making complaint and bringing the matters to trial prejudiced the appellant’s ability to meet the prosecution case. 
     
      
    162   It was submitted that in the first count particularly, the effect of alleging such a wide range of dates and such a long time in the past prejudiced the appellant because he could not after such a time reasonably ascertain his whereabouts at the time of the incident alleged. The difficulty in establishing possible alibis was increased by the delay. 
     
      
    163   Given the absence of Mr Southern, the issues for determination on the first count were a contest of word against word. The trial judge gave the jury clear directions that each charge was to be considered separately and that the onus of proof was at all times on the Crown. His Honour told the jury that the Crown relied on the evidence of the complainant, which they had to scrutinise with great care. He told the jury that the delay in complaining was relevant to their assessment of the credibility of the complainant and warned the jury about the effects of delay upon the ability of the appellant to defend himself. No complaint was made as to the adequacy of those directions. 
     
      
    164   The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the complainant and there seems no reason why they should not have accepted her as a reliable witness. 
     
      
    165   In my opinion, the delay in complaining and the wide range of dates particularised on the first count were not in the circumstances of this case particularly likely to give the appellant difficulty in showing that he might have been elsewhere. His case was that he was not even in the district at the time, having left to take a job at Kemps Creek in 1977. Notwithstanding the passage of a substantial time, he could have subpoenaed his former employers to produce evidence of his employment. He could have obtained, by subpoena or otherwise, copies of taxation returns and other financial documents and the like. The passage of time would not seem to have made his task in such matters significantly harder. Although his parents died in 1979, there were other family members whom he could have called to say, if it were the fact, that he had moved out of the district and was not there during 1980 and 1981. 
     
      
    166   The next submission was that delay robbed the appellant of the advantage of the rule that he could not have been convicted upon the unsworn and uncorroborated evidence of a child. As the Court observed in dealing with an identical ground concerning the second trial, no injustice resulted because the appellant had a trial according to law. 
     
      
    167   This ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    168   In support of the appeal against the second conviction it was submitted that the evidence of the complainant should be doubted because she was at the time herself an adult and was in the company of a number of adults, including her cousin and her aunt and was on the telephone to her mother at the time, yet she did not complain for another year. 
     
      
    169   The appellant was asked why she did not complain and said that she did not want to create trouble in the family. These matters were all put before the jury by counsel and his Honour gave appropriate directions about the effect of delay in complaining upon the evidence of the complainant and how it gave rise to a need to scrutinise evidence carefully. 
     
      
    170   In my opinion this ground of appeal has not been made good. 
     
      
    171   The appeal against the convictions should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The fourth trial 
       
      
    172   There were two counts. The evidence of the complainant, LJH, was that on a day between 1 January and 25 December 1975 the appellant took the complainant to the same water tank on the back of his motor cycle. When they arrived at the gate the appellant said that they were running out of fuel and they stopped. The appellant and the complainant got off the motor cycle, he put his arm over her shoulder and pulled her into him, her back to his front, and started caressing her breasts on the outside of her clothing. She was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. He put one hand inside her T-shirt. She tried to pull away and kicked him and her shirt came off. He also began touching her on the vagina. 
     
      
    173   The complainant threatened to tell her father, a man the appellant feared, and he stopped his misbehaviour and drove her back to the village. The complainant was ten years old. 
     
      
    174   On the occasion giving rise to the second count, virtually the same thing happened. The motorbike stopped near the tank and the appellant placed his hand on the complainant’s breasts outside her clothing. 
     
      
    175   The complainant said nothing to anybody until she told her mother when she was about twenty-four or twenty-five years old. She remained silent in the meantime because she was frightened that any complaint would precipitate arguments and fights within the family and that she would be in trouble over it. 
     
      
    176   The appellant gave evidence to the effect that he had never taken the complainant on the back of a motorcycle to the tank and had never indecently assaulted her. He said that he left school in 1975 when he was fifteen or sixteen and started working shiftwork at the mine. He did not have a motor cycle in working order or any access to such a motor cycle. 
     
      
    177   The appellant was convicted on both counts. 
     
      
    178   The first two grounds of appeal argued may be dealt with together. They were that the learned trial judge erred in not explaining fully to the jury the meaning and importance of the lack of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence and that his Honour erred in not fully explaining to the jury why it would be dangerous to convict the appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    179   Identical grounds of appeal, supported by identical submissions, have been dealt with in the appeals against convictions at the earlier trials. The directions complained of at this trial were not significantly different from those given at the earlier trials. I would refuse leave to appeal on these grounds for the reasons given in the earlier appeals. 
     
      
    180   The next ground of appeal complained that his Honour erred in giving irrelevant examples when explaining why the victim of a sexual assault might hesitate to complain. 
     
      
    181   Identical grounds of appeal, supported by identical submissions, have been dealt with in the other appeals. For the reasons already given I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    182   The next ground of appeal complained that his Honour erred in granting leave to the Crown to adduce certain evidence from the complainant’s mother. 
     
      
    183   The complainant and her mother gave evidence of a conversation that took place between them in 1991, some sixteen years after the events complained of. They related to sexual advances made by the appellant towards the complainant. The Crown took the view that they were not admissible as evidence of complaint in view of the long delay that had taken place. However, as appears from an account given to his Honour by counsel after the jury retired, the Crown sought an assurance from defence counsel that it would not be suggested to the complainant that she had recently fabricated or reconstructed her evidence. The assurance was not given. The Crown prosecutor took the view that the evidence was admissible under s 108(3) Evidence Act, provided the Court gave leave. Defence counsel agreed. Evidence of the conversation was therefore adduced from the complainant and from her mother without objection from defence counsel. 
     
      
    184   However, counsel overlooked the requirement in s 108(3) that the Court give leave. The Crown realised its omission after the jury had retired and raised the matter with his Honour. The account that I have summarised was given. Defence counsel stated his position, concluding - 
     
      
       
        
        I do not raise any point about it now because it was both our oversights (sic) that it was not raised earlier. 
        
       
      
    185   Accordingly, the Court granted retrospective leave. 
     
      
    186   It was submitted on appeal that the receipt of the evidence caused the trial to miscarry. 
     
      
    187   In my opinion the evidence was properly admitted so that the Crown might re-establish the credit of the complainant in anticipation of a defence attack on her credit. Leave was properly given. The trial was conducted precisely as intended by defence counsel. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    188   The final ground of appeal was that the verdicts were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. As with the two counts in the third trial, this case was essentially one in which the jury were required to weigh word against word. The jury were appropriately instructed about the burden of proof and how it never shifted to the defence. They were told that they must carefully scrutinise the evidence of the complainant, especially in view of the delay in complaint. They had the advantage of seeing and hearing the complainant and there appears no reason why they should have doubted the accuracy of her evidence. 
     
      
    189   It was put on behalf of the appellant that the lapse of time between the supposed events and the bringing of charges had caused him particular difficulty, because he wished to assert that although there were motor cycle parts around his house at the time, there was no machine in working order. The appellant’s parents might have been able to give evidence about such matters, but they both died in 1979. 
     
      
    190   I do not consider that the want of such evidence produced a miscarriage of justice in all the circumstances. There were other family members the appellant could have called, and of course he gave evidence to like effect himself. The jury obviously took the view that his sworn evidence was insufficient so much as to raise a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant. 
     
      
    191   This ground of appeal has not been made good and the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The sentence appeal 
       
      
    192   The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
    193   His Honour regarded the most serious offence as having sexual intercourse with BLY without her consent, she being under sixteen. That was the first count in her trial. When she was eight years old the appellant forced her to suck his penis. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for ten years. His Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of eight years, comprising a minimum term of six years and an additional term of two years. His Honour intended that sentence to comprehend all the appellant’s criminality. 
     
      
    194   The other offences carried various maximum sentences up to ten years’ imprisonment and his Honour imposed fixed terms, concurrent with the minimum term of the sentence I have mentioned, ranging from one year to three years. 
     
      
    195   It was submitted that the sentences were manifestly excessive. Attention was directed to the age of the appellant, and it was submitted that at the time of the indecent assaults upon LJH he was himself a child, aged fifteen or sixteen years. The appellant was born in 1959. That submission takes an extreme view. At the time of most of the offences he was in his twenties. For the latter ones he was in his thirties. The most serious ones, those committed on BLY, happened when he was in his mid to his late twenties. 
     
      
    196   Then it was submitted that there had been a delay bringing the matters to trial. That is not something in my opinion that works in favour of the appellant, because delay in making such matters public is an ordinary consequence of the fear which sexual assaults engender in the minds of children. 
     
      
    197   Then subjective factors were pointed to, including the poor health of the appellant. 
     
      
    198   His Honour took all these matters into account. He observed that the appellant was thirty-nine years old and, at one hundred and fifty kilograms in weight, obese. His Honour recorded that there was a long-standing injury to the back and that the appellant suffered angina. His Honour observed that because of these matters and because of the fact that he would have to be held on protection he would find it more difficult to serve his sentences. His Honour also observed that there was no contrition and that the offences had had an effect upon the appellant’s victims, particularly BLY, who was badly affected. 
     
      
    199   It was also submitted that because, for the reasons I have summarised, the appellant will serve his sentence hard, his Honour ought to have found the existence of special circumstances justifying the imposition of an additional term which exceeded one-third of the minimum term of the longest sentence imposed. 
     
      
    200   No attack was made upon the structure of the individual sentences. 
     
      
    201   In my opinion there is no substance in the appellant’s submissions. The total effective sentence imposed by his Honour was well within the range of his sentencing discretion, as was the imposition of an additional term not exceeding two years. I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

        JUDGMENT 
        
         
        
         
       
      
     1     
     SPIGELMAN CJ:  
     I agree with Sperling J. 
      
       
      
     2     
     JAMES J:  
     I agree with the judgment of Sperling J. 
      
       
      
     3     
     SPERLING J:  
     On 28 September 1999, at a trial in the District Court, the appellant was convicted on a single charge of sexual intercourse without consent. The appeal is against the conviction.  
      
       
      
     4     
     There are two grounds of appeal:  
      
       
      
     1.  
     The verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence in the case. 
      
       
        
         
           
         
        
       
      
     2.  
     The learned trial judge’s directions to the jury on the evidence of other alleged sexual assaults, left to the jury as evidence of relationship and “guilty passion”, were erroneous and inadequate. 
      
       
        
       Unreasonable verdict 
       : 
        
       
      
     5     
     The ultimate question is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. Where the ground of appeal is that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable, the test promulgated in  
     M (1994) 181 CLR 487 
     , as explained in  
     Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439 
      is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the necessary elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt, making due allowance for the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses. 
      
       
      
     6     
     It was common ground at the trial that intercourse occurred between the appellant and the complainant at the appellant’s house on 31 August 1998. The only serious issue was whether the complainant had consented. She said, in her evidence, that she did not. The appellant said, in his evidence, that she did. It is apparent that the jury accepted the complainant’s evidence in that regard in preference to that of the appellant. The question on appeal is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent, making due allowance for the advantage which the jury had in assessing the credit of the witnesses. 
      
       
      
     7     
     Because it was open to the jury to reject the appellant’s sworn testimony and to put it entirely to one side, no purpose would be served in reviewing his account of events in this judgment. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The complainant’s account of events was as follows. The complainant said that Ms Emma Horton was a long standing friend. The complainant was also friendly with Ms Alison White. On Sunday afternoon, 30 August 1998, the complainant went to a barbecue at Ms White’s home. The complainant said she drank part of a stubby of beer there. She was introduced to the appellant at the barbecue. The two of them decided to go out for dinner together. The complainant drove her car to Ms Horton’s place to change. She intended to sleep there that night. At Ms Horton’s house she had a glass of white wine. The appellant collected the complainant from Ms Horton’s, and drove her to his house. The complainant said that she had a glass of champagne there.  
      
       
      
     9     
     The complainant said that she and the appellant then travelled by taxi to a restaurant at Parramatta, arriving there at about 8 pm. The complainant said that when she arrived at the restaurant she was feeling “really unsteady, really woozy, disoriented”. She said she had a sip of a martini, and a glass of wine with the meal. She then went to the bathroom, she said, because she was feeling so “unsteady”. Walking to the taxi, she said, she felt “terrible, very unsteady, really disoriented”. She said she thought she leaned on the appellant and might have grabbed his arm to steady herself. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The complainant said that she remembered only bits and pieces of the time in the taxi. She remembered lying down at one stage. She thought she had opened the door of the taxi at one point, and might have vomited. She had no memory of the appellant being in the taxi at all. She did not remember getting out of the taxi, but she thought she remembered walking up the driveway of the appellant’s house.  
      
       
      
     11     
     The complainant said that in the house the appellant was trying to undress her, trying to unzip her dress, but she was walking away through the house, trying, she said, to “get a little bit more control”. She said she did not remember very much of what occurred at this stage, that she was feeling “very disoriented” and wasn’t quite sure what was happening. She said she walked into the back yard, thinking to get out of the house because it was not right. She said she climbed the stairs of a cubby house in the back yard and lay on the floor. She thought she had “blacked out”. She thought she had her dress on at that stage. From there, she remembered seeing the appellant standing at what would have been the back door of the house, naked.  
      
       
      
     12     
     The complainant said that her next memory was of waking up in the appellant’s bed, lying on her side, naked. She said the appellant was lying next to her, naked. She said she felt him push against her from behind. This was at about 3.30 or 4 am. According to the complainant, she said “No” pretty loudly, because, as she put it, she “got a bit of a shock waking up”. She said she elbowed him. At that, the complainant said, the appellant grabbed her by the arm, flipped her onto her back, and got on top of her, holding her arms. She said “Why are you doing this?” She said that she started to cry, that he penetrated her vagina with his penis, and that he had intercourse with her. She said she was crying during this act, and that he said nothing. She said that, when the appellant removed his penis from her vagina, she felt “very dazed, very upset, but very tired”. She said that, when he got off her, she rolled over and eventually fell asleep. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The complainant said that she woke at about 5 am and went to the bathroom, where she noticed that her pubic hair was shaved off. She said she did not know how that had happened. She asked the appellant if she could go home. He said to wait until he had to go to work. He set the alarm. She lay down again. He got up fifteen or twenty minutes later, turned on the shower, grabbed her by the arm or hand, and pulled her into the bathroom. She said that under the shower, the appellant stroked her breast and patted her where her pubic hair had been, saying he had done a good job of that. She said she wrapped herself in a towel and walked out of the bathroom. She found her clothes in the loungeroom. Both of them got dressed.  
      
       
      
     14     
     The complainant said the appellant drove her to her home in his car. When they arrived there, he told her to go and get the “morning after pill”. When she arrived home, her sister was the only other person in the house. She was asleep upstairs. The complainant’s parents, the other occupants of the house, were away on holidays. This was at about 6 am. The complainant said she went to bed, that she was “still really drowsy”. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The complainant said that she saw Ms Horton at about 1 pm that day, and that she told Ms Horton that she and the appellant had had dinner, that she did not remember very much, that she had had a couple of drinks, and something of the conversations that had occurred between herself and the appellant. She did not say anything to Ms Horton about sexual intercourse having occurred “because of shock, disgust, horror, embarrassment, shame and fear”. She collected her car from Ms Horton’s place and returned home. 
      
       
      
     16     
     At 6 or 6.30 pm that night, the complainant received a telephone call from the appellant. He asked her if she had been to the doctor yet. She said she had not. He asked her what she had told Ms Horton, and she told the appellant that she had told Ms Horton nothing. 
      
       
      
     17     
     At about 7 pm the complainant went to the local medical centre at Prospect, where she saw a Dr Galvin, who was not her regular doctor. She said she went there to get the “morning after pill” and, as she put it, if her doctor had been there, to speak to him. Dr Galvin declined to prescribe the medication sought, as being immoral. The complainant said she said nothing to Dr Galvin about what had occurred, because of his attitude and because he was not her usual doctor. 
      
       
      
     18     
     About a week later the complainant spoke to her best friend, Ms Catherine Dolle. Ms Dolle was in Europe at the time of the trial. The complainant says she told Ms Dolle that “something awful had happened”, that she had “slept with a married man”, that she did not remember very much about it, but that she had not had very much to drink. The complainant said she had been unable to reach Ms Dolle during the intervening week. She said that when she spoke to her she was “still in a bit of shock about what had happened, and scared and disgusted”. 
      
       
      
     19     
     Shortly after, she spoke to her usual doctor, Dr. Watts. She said that she told him she was “raped”.  
      
       
      
     20     
     The complainant said that, about a week after that, she spoke to a female police officer, Constable Riley, in a carpark at Westpoint in Blacktown. How the conversation came to be held at that time and in that place was not revealed by the evidence. The complainant said that she subsequently spoke to a friend who was a police officer. Ultimately, she said, she made a statement to a police officer. At her first meeting with the last of these officers, she said, she was not able to provide a statement because she was “very emotional, very upset”. However, she returned on 14 October 1998 and made a statement on that occasion. 
      
       
      
     21     
     Under cross examination the complainant confirmed her evidence that, so far as alcohol was concerned, she had consumed only part of a stubby of beer, a glass of wine, a glass of champagne, a sip of martini, and one further glass of wine. That was a total of four drinks. However, she also confirmed that there were periods of time that she did not recollect at all. 
      
       
      
     22     
     Taxed with why she had not asked the appellant to take her back to Ms Horton’s place after the episode of sexual intercourse of which she complained, the complainant said that was because she was “disoriented and unsteady”. She said she did not know “what was happening”, that she “was not able to say very much to him”, and that she was “intimidated”. She said she was “not in a state to say anything or think rationally”. 
      
       
      
     23     
     The complainant denied being affectionate and sexually playful towards the appellant in the taxi. She said she did not remember having her head on his lap, and she denied fondling his penis through his clothing in that position. She denied trying to remove the appellant’s penis from his trousers. She said that, during the taxi ride, she was “passed out”. She said she did not remember the taxi ride “that well”. She agreed she did not know where the appellant was taking her when they left the restaurant. She said she was “not in a state to ask”. She said that, at that stage, she “did not really know where she was”. She remembered the taxi stopping at one stage, but she does not remember why. She now agreed that she remembered opening the car door, and remembered vomiting. Asked if she was well enough to speak at that stage, she answered “No, I was sick”. She said that, later, she was “a little better”. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The complainant agreed that she remembered walking up the driveway to the appellant’s house. She did not remember going in the door, and she did not remember any conversation. She said she had no recollection of how her clothes came to be removed after her memory of being in the cubby house. She had no recollection of how she got from the cubby house to the appellant’s bed. 
      
       
      
     25     
     The complainant agreed that she went back to sleep after the appellant had allegedly raped her. She agreed that at some stage she took his business card when it was offered to her, but she said that was not in the morning. By that, I take her to have meant that it was not after the event of which she complained. She said she remembered the events of the morning very well. She said that, after the shower, she was “still disoriented”. She said she felt better, but “not much better”. She said she remembered asking the appellant could she go home, or something to that effect, but she did not know how that had been phrased. 
      
       
      
     26     
     Taxed with why she had made no complaint to the appellant about what had occurred, the complainant said that was because of “shock and uncertainty”, because “he was acting like everything was still normal”, and because she was “not terribly good with confrontation”. She agreed that when the appellant telephoned her later in the day she made no complaint to him. She said that was for the same reason as before. She said she was “still in shock”. She said it was “not a very easy thing to have to accept what had happened”. She said “Denial, you don’t believe, just try and forget, the fact somebody would do this to me”. 
      
       
      
     27     
     The complainant agreed that she said in her police statement that she said to Ms Dolle “I’ve done something terrible, I’ve slept with a married man. I don’t remember much, but when I went out to dinner we ended up back at his place.” The complainant said that she conveyed to Ms Dolle that intercourse had occurred without her consent, but she had to agree that there was nothing to that effect in her statement. The complainant sought to explain that by saying that there was only one paragraph in the police statement to cover what had been an hour-long conversation with Ms Dolle. She disputed that it would have been easy to tell Ms Dolle straight out that she had been raped. She said “It is hard to say it like that after it’s happened, because it’s hard enough to accept what has happened”.  
      
       
      
     28     
     The complainant agreed that she may have told Constable Riley, during the conversation in the carpark, that she was unaware if she had actually been penetrated by the appellant. The complainant said she was very distressed when she was speaking to Constable Riley. She said that, at that stage, she had not intended to speak to the police at all. Indeed, she said she had vehemently told the police that she did not want anything done. She said she did not tell Constable Riley what had happened because she was very distressed. She said she was crying at the time, and did not remember much of what she had told Constable Riley. She agreed that she might have told Constable Riley that she recalled the appellant attempting to penetrate her vagina with his penis, and, being unsuccessful, rolling over and going to sleep. The Crown Prosecutor conceded that, according to the Crown’s information, that is what the complainant told Constable Riley.  
      
       
      
     29     
     The Crown’s case depended on acceptance by the jury of the complainant’s account of events, which, in turn, depended on the jury accepting her as a truthful and reliable narrator. The burden of the appellant’s argument on appeal was that the complainant’s conduct after the event, including things said by her, was so inconsistent with the absence of consent that a jury could not reasonably have been satisfied that her version of events was true.  
      
       
      
     30     
     The alleged inconsistencies were as follows. First, there was the conversation with Ms Horton at about 1 pm on the same day as the alleged offence. Ms Horton gave evidence. She said she asked the complainant how the night went, and that the complainant replied that it had been “Okay”, that it was “Alright”. That went somewhat further than the complainant’s concession in her evidence that she had not told Ms Horton anything about sexual intercourse having occurred. 
      
       
      
     31     
     Secondly, there was the failure to tell Dr Galvin what had allegedly occurred, particularly in the face of that doctor’s reported attitude that to prescribe the “morning after pill” would be immoral. 
      
       
      
     32     
     Thirdly, there was the conversation about a week after the event with Ms Dolle, as recorded in the police statement. Asked, under cross examination, whether these were the words that were said, the complainant said that they were, among other things. The question was ambiguous, which, in turn, made the answer ambiguous. It is not clear whether the witness was agreeing that the words in the police statement were as spoken by her to the police, or whether the statement accurately recorded the words the complainant had spoken to Ms Dolle. In her evidence in chief the complainant had said that she told Ms Dolle that something awful had happened, whereas in cross examination she agreed that she told the police (and perhaps adopted as correct) that she had told Ms Dolle she had done something terrible.  
      
       
      
     33     
     It appears that the trial judge recalled the terms of the evidence in chief, and did not recall the terms of the evidence in cross examination. During a break in the summing up, counsel for the appellant drew his Honour’s attention to the passage in cross examination. That was done in the presence of the jury. The trial judge said to the jury, when resuming his summing up: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, my interpretation of the evidence was different to that of Mr Korn.  
         (counsel for the appellant at the 
           
         trial) 
          However, you are the judges of the facts. You heard the evidence, and it is for you to determine what the evidence was.” 
         
        
        
       The error on the part of the trial judge is not relied on as giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
        
       
      
     34     
     As I have noted earlier, the complainant gave evidence that the police statement did not record the whole of what she told Ms Dolle and, in particular, her having conveyed to Ms Dolle, in terms she did not recall, that there had been sexual intercourse without her consent. 
      
       
      
     35     
     Fourthly, Dr Watts gave evidence. He said the complainant told him that the appellant had “attempted sexual intercourse” with her, during which he “wasn’t penetrating her”. He said, further, that the complainant’s knowledge of any other acts of a sexual nature occurring between her and the appellant was based on information that had been provided to her by the appellant.  
      
       
      
     36     
     Fifthly, there was the concession by the Crown that the complainant told Constable Riley only that there had been attempted penetration, which was unsuccessful. Then there was the complainant’s concession under cross examination that she had told Constable Riley she was unaware if she had been sexually penetrated by the appellant. 
      
       
      
     37     
     Sixthly, the police officer spoken to by the complainant after she had spoken to Constable Riley was Detective Senior Constable Parker. Although itemised as an inconsistency, there was nothing inconsistent with the complainant’s account of events emerging from her evidence. 
      
       
      
     38     
     There was, as I have said, no issue about intercourse having occurred. Accounts to the contrary, or from which the contrary could reasonably be inferred, were relied upon as going to the complainant’s credibility or reliability in relation to her account of events insofar as it differed from that of the appellant, in particular on the critical issue of consent.  
      
       
      
     39     
     In addition to the alleged inconsistencies relating to things said after the event, the appellant asserts inconsistency in relation to the complainant’s account of her alcohol consumption, and in her behaviour in staying with the appellant after the event rather than insisting on being taken home, or getting herself home. 
      
       
      
     40     
     The difficulty for the appellant is that a failure to complain in terms of what is alleged to have occurred and even statements made after the event which are positively inconsistent with what is alleged to have occurred are not considerations conclusive against acceptance of a complainant’s evidence on the main issue. It would be exceptional if inconsistencies of this kind were so gross as to require a jury to disbelieve the complainant in relation to what mattered. This was not such an exceptional case. There was the possibility that some of the persons to whom the complainant spoke may have misunderstood what she intended to convey to them. There were also the complainant’s explanations for her reticence when speaking to others, to which I have referred.  
      
       
      
     41     
     The inconsistencies were doubtless the subject of argument and counter argument in the addresses of the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the appellant. They were reviewed in detail by the trial judge. Credibility is quintessentially a jury question. The jury was not bound to disbelieve the complainant by reason of these inconsistencies. Having regard to the advantage which the jury had in seeing and hearing the witnesses, and in particular the complainant, it was open to the jury to find that the intercourse which occurred was without her consent, as she swore on her oath to have been the case. 
      
       
      
     42     
     The asserted inconsistencies in relation to alcohol consumption and the failure to leave immediately after the event had a possible association which the jury would have been entitled to infer. There was a considerable disparity between the complainant’s account of the amount of alcohol she had consumed, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, her description of her condition at the restaurant and thereafter. It was open to be inferred that the complainant had drunk a good deal more than she said, to the extent of not being able to think clearly about her situation. That disparity did not necessarily reflect adversely on the complainant’s credibility. To have drunk a good deal more than the person believes is common enough. 
      
       
        
       Direction on “guilty passion”

     The Crown concedes misdirection. The events leading up to the episode of sexual intercourse were relevant. The trial judge reviewed those events. In that context, the trial judge referred to the accused’s antecedent actions as “offences” and went on to say in connection with such antecedent acts the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is to place the evidence of the particular acts into a true and realistic context, and where appropriate to show the existence of a guilty passion on the part of the accused for the complainant. Otherwise you see a jury such as yourselves may wonder as to the likelihood of apparently an isolated act occurring suddenly without any apparent reason without being repeated. If a complainant gave evidence of an isolated act of that kind, you will be entitled to say to yourselves as people of commonsense, ‘Well, really, it is very odd for there to be such an isolated act between these persons which was not repeated or which had no precursor.’ For that reason, you might have cause to entertain some doubt as to the likelihood or accuracy of the witness. If, however, the particular act charged is placed in a wider context, that is a context of an on-going history and show or tends to show the existence of guilty passion on the part of the accused or the complainant, then the curious feature would disappear. It is for that reason that the law permits a wider sexual history to be proved. It is to avoid artificiality or unreality in the presentation of the evidence and to demonstrate, where appropriate, the existence and continuation of a guilty passion on the part of an accused person for another person.” 
         
        
       
      
     44     
     It is time for the expression “guilty passion” to disappear altogether from the legal vocabulary. In an appropriate case, a phrase such as “sexual interest” or “strong sexual interest” serves as well. By whatever terminology, the concept did not apply in the present case. It was common ground that sexual intercourse occurred, and the appellant’s sexual interest in the complainant did not bear upon whether the intercourse was with or without consent.  
      
       
      
     45     
     No objection was taken to this passage in the summing up. Rule 4 applies. I would not give leave to argue the ground pursuant to r 4. I would also apply the proviso to s 6 of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      The error did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. In the overall context of the case, the passage was innocuous. It made no material difference, in my view, to the appellant’s prospect of acquittal.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion and Orders 
        
       
      
     46     
     Both grounds of appeal fail. The order I propose is that the appeal be dismissed.

     Regina v Alan De Silva RAMOS 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    2   WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to S 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the sentence imposed upon the respondent by his Honour Judge J. B. Phelan, at the Wollongong District Court, on 7 October 1999. 
    3   Following his plea of guilty, at the Wollongong Local Court on 23 June 1998, the respondent was committed for sentence to the District Court on four counts of supply a prohibited drug contrary to S 25(1) Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 - offences for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for fifteen years or a fine of 2,000 penalty units, or both. 
    4   The respondent adhered to his plea and asked his Honour to take into account upon sentence, a further three matters on a Form 1, namely, drive an unregistered vehicle, use an uninsured vehicle, and drive while disqualified. The sentence imposed by his Honour, after taking into account those other matters, was one of imprisonment for twenty-four months, made up of a minimum term of six months, which expired on 31 March 2000, and an additional term of eighteen months. 
     
      
     Facts 
      
    5   The offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 related to the supply of methylamphetimine, on four separate occasions during the period 6 February to 27 February 1998, to an undercover police officer. This arose in the course of Operation Ghana, which was directed towards the sale of amphetamines and ecstasy. 
    6   The first offence occurred when the undercover officer met with the respondent in a car park at Lake Heights. The respondent quoted a price of $250 for a quarter of methylamphetamine, and indicated that he could supply in pounds or ounces. The quantity sold on this occasion was found to be 4.9 gms. 
    7   The respondent met the undercover agent again at the same place on 18 February 1998. On this occasion their conversation was recorded pursuant to a lawfully obtained listening device. The respondent produced a pair of electronic scales from the glove box of his car, and weighed out 27.4 gms, for which he was paid $800. The undercover agent indicated that, on the next occasion, he wanted to purchase 4 ounces. The respondent said that he could also sell ecstasy at a price of $35 each for ten or more tablets. 
    8   On 26 February 1998, the undercover agent rang the appellant on his mobile phone and organised the purchase of 100 ecstasy tablets and 4 ounces of methylamphetamine. When they met, the respondent produced two plastic resealable bags containing tablets and white powder respectively.  
    9   The operation was brought to an end at that point with the arrest of the appellant. The bags in his possession were found to contain 220 gms of methylamphetamine, and 100 tablets with a total weight of 26.6 gms,, containing traces of methylamphetamine and caffeine. A list of names and numeric accounts was found in his wallet, indicating that he was owed $6,000 by drug customers.  
    10   The Crown case, it may be accepted, was overwhelming, although clearly there was a significant utilitarian value in the pleas which were offered by the appellant at the first available moment. He was properly entitled to a discount in that regard. 
    11   In sentencing the applicant his Honour had before him the following subjective circumstances: 
    · the respondent was twenty-two years of age, and had a prior criminal record including one count of supply prohibited drug, and three counts of possession of prohibited drug; 
    · at the time of the offences he was subject to a bond and also a Community Service order, and in his Honour’s words he had been “completely arrogant in his attitude to the law”; 
    · he had completed a significant period of apprenticeship as a mechanic, and had a job with a construction company, the proprietor of which regarded him as a capable and energetic employee; 
    · his family was supportive, and he had a relationship with a lady who was adverse to drugs. 
    12   In my view, the sentence imposed was manifestly lenient and displayed error of law in several ways: 
     
      
     a) the offences involved were serious incidents, connected with the ongoing supply of drugs for reward, and were such that insufficient weight was given to the objective gravity of the respondent’s misconduct, or to the accumulation of offences which had to be taken into account in assessing the overall criminality involved:  
     Dodd 
      (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 and  
     Rushby 
      (1997) 1 NSWLR 594. 
      
      
     b) insufficient weight was given to the circumstance that the offences occurred at a time when the respondent was subject to a bond and to a Community Service Order, matters significantly aggravating his criminality:  
     Readman 
      (1990) 47 A Crim R 181 and  
     Tran 
      (1999) NSW CCA 109; 
      
      
     c) the respondent fell into the category of offender who sells for greed, but does not use - again a matter of aggravation:  
     Liang 
      CCA (NSW) 2 June 1995 unreported; 
      
      
     d) the sentences were so short and so structured as to provide no element of general deterrence, a matter of some significance in relation to the drug trade:  
     Myers 
      CCA (NSW) 13 February 1990 unreported,  
     Clarke 
      CCA (NSW) 15 March 1990,  
     Swann 
      CCA (NSW) 17 July 1992 unreported and  
     Cacciola  
     CCA(NSW) 15 October 1998; 
      
      
     e) His Honour, although appropriately acknowledging the respondent’s subjective circumstances and his progress towards rehabilitation, gave undue weight to those factors, at the price of not imposing a sentence which was called for by the offences; 
      
      
     f) His Honour also fell into error which was illogical, in the way that the sentence was structured. Having given the respondent the benefit of his favourable subjective circumstances and of his progression towards rehabilitation, in fixing an overall sentence, he then gave him a second benefit for the same matters, in finding special circumstances, and in structuring a sentence that was made up of a minimum term of only six months and an additional term of eighteen months. Yet, if the respondent had rehabilitated himself, as his Honour found, there was little purpose in an extended period of release on parole, particularly since in its pre-sentence report the Probation & Parole Service advised that it saw no need for supervision. 
      
    13   It is again necessary to make the point that sentencing Judges do neither the community, or the offender, any service by imposing sentences that are weakly merciful, or in being unduly influenced by apparently favourable subjective circumstances: Cacciola at 16, per Abadee J. Their duty is to sentence according to law, including the pronouncements of this Court in relation to sentences appropriate for drug dealers, and against the maximum penalty provided by the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act.  
    14   In my view, error has been established, and subject to the exercise of discretion, this Court should re-sentence. After giving the matter careful consideration, however, I reach the view that it would be inappropriate to intervene at this stage, ie at a time when the appellant has served the minimum term, has been released, and has returned to gainful employment. Although he has not reached the usual age regarded as a turning point for offenders with a history of criminality, there is nonetheless a public interest in not interfering in a process of demonstrated rehabilitation, particularly in this area of criminality. His employer and his mother have both provided information confirmatory of his continuing post release progress, and it may well be that he has received sufficient shock, from a first period of imprisonment, to turn his back on his former ways. He should, however, be under no illusion as to what might happen to him if he reoffends, whether during the period of release on parole, or subsequently. 
    15   I would propose that in the exercise of the Court’s discretion, the appeal be dismissed, and that the conviction and sentence below be confirmed.

    2     GROVE J :  I agree with the order proposed by Hidden J but wish to state my own reasons for rejection of ground 2 which asserted that there was error in admitting the evidence of acts of past identification by the witnesses Shane Goldsborough and Lee Paterson. 
     
      
       
      
    3     To recapitulate: Goldsborough was the de facto husband of the appellant’s daughter and, when called by the Crown, gave evidence in chief that the man depicted in the security camera photographs looked like the appellant. Leave was given to cross examine him as an unfavourable witness. He denied earlier making a positive statement that it was the appellant depicted in the photographs to Detective Dawson. Detective Dawson was permitted to give evidence contradicting that denial.  
     
      
       
      
    4     Paterson was the appellant’s current de facto wife. To the Crown Prosecutor in chief she said that the person depicted in the photographs was similar to the appellant. Leave to cross examine her was granted and she denied earlier saying that it was the appellant to Detective Stone. Detective Stone was permitted to give evidence contradicting that denial. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The thrust of argument in support of the ground was directed towards the admission of the evidence by the detectives.  
     
      
       
      
    6     In my view, the respective testimony of Detective Dawson and Detective Stone, whilst admissible at common law: see Alexander v The Queen 1981 145 CLR 395 per Mason and Aickin JJ; R v Barbaro & Ors 1993 67 A Crim R 456, must now be categorized as hearsay in the terms of s59 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “59(1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation”. 
         
        
       
      
    7     The asserted fact is the identity of the appellant as the person depicted.  
     
      
       
      
    8     It is my further view, however, that the evidence was admissible by reason of the exception available pursuant to s66(2) of the Act namely: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “66(2) If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) that person; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made; 
         
        
        
         
         if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.” 
         
        
       
      
    9     An issue arises as to what is required to be fresh in the memory in order to fulfil the requirements of the provision bearing in mind the necessity for fresh to be understood as recent or immediate: Graham v The Queen 1998 195 CLR 606. 
     
      
       
      
    10     In the case of recognition, what is fresh in the memory is the continuing familiarity with the features of the person depicted, in both these instances features of a de facto relation. Circumstances of recognition require distinction from those of identification where identification is made from previous encounter. In the latter case it would be the formation of the image, later drawn upon at the time of making the representation that the person depicted is identified, which is required to be fresh in the memory. The exception provided by s66(2) is available in these instances because of the peculiar qualities of recognition. 
     
      
       
      
    11     Finally, I would wish to reserve until it is necessary to decide the matter, whether the evidence of the early acts of expression of recognition by police officers should have been admitted. Whilst I accept that recognition is not, in the sense being now examined, affected by the passage of time, I can perceive that it may be argued that evidence of such early acts could legitimately be tendered to present a prosecution case in proper contextual continuity. 
     
      
       
        
        
       IN THE COURT OF 
       
      
    CRIMINAL APPEAL 
     
     60772 of 1998 
      
     SPIGELMAN CJ GROVE J HIDDEN J Friday 26 May 2000 
     
     Regina v Stephen Robert Gee 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
    12     HIDDEN J: The appellant, Stephen Robert Gee, was tried in the District Court on five charges of armed robbery. He was acquitted by direction of the third count after the Crown prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to be left to the jury on that count. He was found guilty of the other four counts. He appeals against conviction only. 
     
      
       
      
    13     The robberies, committed on one occasion in a bank and on the other occasions in building societies, occurred between June and August 1997 in what might loosely be described as the Newcastle/ Lake Macquarie area. On each occasion the offender acted alone. The only issue in the trial was whether the appellant was that man. 
     
      
       
      
    14     In the course of the robberies the subject of the first, second, fourth and fifth counts, a security camera photographed the offender. There was evidence from witnesses who knew the appellant that he was the man depicted in the photos relating to the first, second and fourth counts. It will be necessary to refer to this evidence when dealing with the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    15     There was no evidence identifying the man appearing in the photos relating to the fifth count, as they were generally of poorer quality and none of them afforded a clear view of the offender’s face. On the other hand, there was a body of circumstantial evidence tending to link the appellant with that robbery. The offender was seen by witnesses to leave the building society and get into a car very similar to the car in which the appellant was arrested some hours later. Indeed, one witness observed, and correctly recorded, its number plate. When the appellant was stopped by police in that car, he was in the company of another man, Christopher McLean. Mr McLean gave evidence that, as the police approached them, the appellant asked him to say that he was in his company at the time of the robbery when, in fact, he was not. The appellant also gave him several hundred dollars, asking him to hold it for him. 
     
      
       
      
    16     There was further circumstantial evidence upon which the Crown relied in relation to all the counts. For example, descriptions by witnesses of the offender were consistent with the appearance of the appellant and clothing similar to that described by witnesses was found in his car and at his home. In addition, it was the Crown case that there were similarities between the robberies, including the manner in which each of them was committed, such as to permit evidence of each count to be used in proof of the others as coincidence evidence: s98 of the Evidence Act 1995. It is this last matter which gives rise to the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    17     The appellant gave evidence in which he denied involvement in any of the robberies, as he had done in recorded interviews with police. He called evidence to the effect that his appearance at the time of the robberies was different from that of the offender described by the witnesses. No further examination of the defence case is necessary for the purpose of dealing with the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions on coincidence evidence 
        
       
      
    18     Neither at the trial nor in this Court was it argued that the similarities between the offences were not sufficient to amount to coincidence evidence. The complaint on appeal was that the trial judge’s directions to the jury about their approach to this evidence were inadequate. Those directions were couched by reference to the common law notion of “similar fact” evidence, but nothing turns on that for present purposes. What his Honour said was this: 
     
      
       
        
         
         As to all four charges, the Crown relies upon the evidence of the very many witnesses who described the person who entered the bank or building society. The evidence as to that person’s appearance, the Crown submits, is consistent with the accused’s appearance. However, in addition to the accused’s appearance, the Crown relies upon the manner in which of (sic) these robberies was carried out. In each case the modus operandi the Crown says was the same. In each case a tall male person of solid build, dressed in a very similar manner entered a bank or building society and approached a single teller. In each case an object resembling a firearm was displayed. In each case a verbal request for money was made. In each case that verbal request was made in a low tone of voice. In each case the robber left without fuss and each of the four robberies was committed within the same broad geographical area and within a comparatively short space of time. Those similarities the Crown submits are so striking that they prove beyond reasonable doubt that one offender was responsible for all four robberies.  
         
        
        
         
         This sort of evidence members of the jury is sometimes referred to as similar fact evidence. I direct you as a matter of law that in a case such as this where the accused is being tried on one occasion for two or more similar crimes, in this case of course he is being tried for four, you are entitled to take into account the whole of the similar fact evidence as evidence rendering more likely the accused guilt (sic) of an individual offence of a similar character. I direct you that you cannot use similar fact evidence against the accused unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts are indeed similar. The weight you attach to the evidence is a matter for you and the similar fact evidence must be considered in the light of all the other evidence. I must add this, it would be completely wrong to reason that because the accused has committed one crime, he is therefore the sort of person who would be likely to offend again. The evidence is admitted only because the similarities are such that you may be persuaded, because of those similarities, that it is more likely that the accused is guilty of an offence or offences of a similar character. As to all these alleged offences but in particular the robbery at Warners Bay, the Crown relies not only upon similar fact evidence, but also upon circumstantial evidence. As to those two types of evidence there is a certain degree of overlapping as similar fact is in itself a form of circumstantial evidence. 
         
        
        
       The robbery at Warners Bay was the subject of the fifth count.  
        
       
      
    19     A little later in the summing-up his Honour dealt with circumstantial evidence generally, giving the conventional direction that the appellant must be found not guilty if there were any reasonable explanation of the evidence consistent with his innocence. In that context, his Honour returned to the coincidence evidence, reminding the jury of the various similarities between the robberies upon which the Crown relied. His Honour concluded that part of the summing-up as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
         I remind you that before an accused person may be found guilty of a crime on the basis of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such a finding is not only reasonable but that it is the only reasonable finding to make on the basis of all the evidence you have before you.  
         
        
       
      
    20     The complaint on appeal was that the directions about the coincidence evidence failed to convey two essential matters: (a) before the jury could find the appellant guilty on any of the counts on the basis of the propensity evidence, they would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt of at least one of the counts in the light of the evidence relating to that count alone; and (b) they would have to find similarities between that count and another or others so striking as to lead them to conclude, again beyond reasonable doubt, that the robberies were committed by the same offender. At this point, I should record that the Crown and the appellant were represented in this Court by counsel different from those who had appeared at the trial. Counsel then appearing for the appellant has considerable experience in this jurisdiction and, significantly, the matters raised by this ground of appeal were not the subject of any application by him for re-directions.  
     
      
       
      
    21     Generally speaking, directions of the kind contended for are necessary where the Crown relies upon coincidence evidence in proof of guilt. This Court has held that, in determining whether the test of admissibility for tendency or coincidence evidence established by s101(2) of the Evidence Act is met, guidance is to be found in the authorities dealing with “similar fact” or “propensity” evidence at common law: R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 per Ireland J at 709. The considerations governing admissibility of the evidence are, in turn, a guide to appropriate directions to the jury if it is admitted: Sutton v The Queen (1983-4) 152 CLR 528 per Dawson J at 563-4. 
     
      
       
      
    22     Viewed in isolation, the passage from the summing-up quoted at par 18 of these reasons fails to convey either of the matters referred to. As to the need to instruct the jury that they had to be satisfied that the similarities between the robberies were such as to lead to the conclusion that they were committed by one offender, however, it must be remembered that his Honour concluded that passage with the observation that coincidence evidence “is in itself a form of circumstantial evidence”. As I have said, his Honour returned to this matter when dealing generally with circumstantial evidence and, at that point, gave the usual direction about drawing the inference of guilt from evidence of that kind. Presumably, the jury then understood that they could not conclude from the similarities between the offences that they were committed by the same man unless they were satisfied that it was the only inference reasonably to be drawn. 
     
      
       
      
    23     On the other hand, it does not appear that his Honour directed the jury at any stage that they could not conclude that the appellant was that man unless they were satisfied of his guilt of at least one of the counts on the evidence relating to that count alone. However, the fact that no such direction was sought may well be explained by the manner in which the case was conducted. A deal of the evidence led by the Crown was directed to the circumstantial case in respect of the fifth count. The summing-up suggests that counsel on both sides saw the evidence on that count as different from, and stronger than, the evidence relating to the others, and it appears to have been pivotal to their addresses to the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    24     Indeed, counsel for the appellant used the fifth count as the basis for an argument which sought to turn the notion of coincidence evidence to his advantage. He submitted that the identification evidence in relation to the first, second and fourth counts was unsatisfactory and that the circumstantial case in relation to the fifth count was inadequate. As his Honour summarised it, the argument then continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
         As to the circumstantial case, the defence puts to you that if the accused did not commit the last robbery at Warners Bay, it would be impossible to find him guilty of the other robberies, and it would mean that some other person of similar appearance to the accused had been committing robberies in the general area.  
         
        
       
      
    25     In effect, then, it seems that the jury were invited to determine whether they were satisfied of the appellant’s guilt in relation to the fifth count, in the light of the evidence referable only to it, before turning their attention to the others. This approach was reinforced by some directions his Honour gave at the end of the summing-up, which I do not find it necessary to set out, and at that point his Honour reminded the jury that they needed to consider each count separately and that their verdicts on the various counts need not necessarily be the same.  
     
      
       
      
    26     In any event, this was not a trial in which the Crown case was dependent upon coincidence evidence. Reliance was placed upon the similarities between the robberies but, at the end of the day, the Crown case turned primarily upon the identification evidence for the first, second and fourth counts and the circumstantial evidence referable to the fifth count. No doubt, this explains his Honour’s observation to the jury, in the passage quoted at par 18, that they might find the accused’s guilt “more likely” in the light of the similar fact evidence. Examining the summing-up as a whole, and in the light of the way in which the case appears to have been conducted, I am not persuaded that there is any deficiency in his Honour’s directions giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
       
        
       Recognition evidence 
        
       
      
    27     The appellant’s former de facto wife, Ms Lea Walker, gave evidence identifying him as the person depicted in the security camera photos related to counts one, two and four.  
     
      
       
      
    28     Ms Lee Paterson, the appellant’s current de facto wife, gave evidence that the person depicted in photos relating to count two was “similar to” the appellant. The Crown prosecutor was permitted to cross-examine her under s38 of the Evidence Act, and it was put to her that she had positively identified the man in those photos as the appellant when they were shown to her by one of the police officers involved in the investigation, Detective Senior Constable Mark Stone. She denied having done so, although she did say that she had whispered to herself, “That’s him”. Detective Stone gave evidence that she had positively identified the appellant in the photos.  
     
      
       
      
    29     Mr Shane Goldsborough, the de facto husband of the appellant’s daughter, gave evidence that the man depicted in photos relating to all three counts looked “a bit like” the appellant. He also was cross-examined by the Crown prosecutor, and it was put to him that he had expressed no doubt that the man in the photos was the appellant when he was shown them by Detective Senior Constable Wayne Dawson. Mr Goldsborough denied this. Detective Dawson gave evidence that he also had made a positive identification. 
     
      
       
      
    30     The evidence that Ms Patterson and Mr Goldsborough identified the appellant when first shown the photos was objected to at the trial, and its admission is the subject of the second ground of appeal. It was submitted that evidence of those earlier acts of identification, having been denied by the two witnesses in the trial, was inadmissible. Alternatively, it was argued that, even if it were admissible, its probative value was so slight that his Honour ought to have exercised his power under s137 of the Evidence Act to reject it. 
     
      
       
      
    31     Counsel for the appellant in this court relied upon R v McGuire [1975] 4 WWR 124, a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal which was referred to with approval by Gibbs CJ in Alexander v The Queen (1980-81) 145 CLR 395 at 407. In McGuire two prosecution witnesses, who had identified the appellant to police, denied in evidence at the trial that he was the man whom they had seen on the occasions in question. The Crown led evidence of their earlier acts of identification, and that evidence was left to the jury in support of the Crown case that the appellant was the offender.  
     
      
       
      
    32     The Court of Appeal held that evidence of those acts of identification was inadmissible and, having been led, the jury should have been told to disregard it. Robertson JA, who delivered the judgment of the court, referred to a passage in Wigmore on Evidence in which it was said that, where a witness identifies an accused in court, it is proper to prove that he also identified that person at an earlier time in circumstances rendering that identification more reliable. His Honour continued (at p130): 
     
      
       
        
         
         From this it appears that, where a person under oath identifies an accused at a trial, his statement may be supported by evidence that the person had identified the accused on an earlier occasion.  
         
        
        
         
         It is, however, elementary that, if the person does not himself give evidence, evidence of his earlier identification cannot be given. By the same token, if at the trial the person does not identify the accused, evidence that he did identify him on an earlier occasion cannot be admitted except by way of cross-examination of the person himself as to credibility, and even then is not evidence of the content of the earlier statement. 
         
        
       
      
    33     In other words, the court treated the earlier acts of identification simply as prior inconsistent statements by the witnesses, governed by the common law rule that they went only to credibility and were not evidence of the facts asserted. For the same reason, the court was of the view that it was not open to the Crown to lead that evidence from the witnesses unless they had been declared hostile: Robertson JA at 132.  
     
      
       
      
    34     The court’s conclusion was founded upon the proposition that evidence of an out of court act of identification by a witness is admissible only to afford weight to that witness’ identification of the accused in court: as Gibbs CJ put it in Alexander (at 406) “… to show that the identification made by the witness in court was not an afterthought or a mistake”. On the other hand, in Alexander Mason J concluded that evidence of an out of court identification, subject to discretionary considerations which might arise from the circumstances in which it was made, was admissible in any event. His Honour said (at 427):  
     
      
       
        
         
         For my part, I see no violation of the hearsay rule, nor do I think it necessary to resort to the doctrine of recent contrivance to sustain the admission of the evidence. In my opinion an identification made out of court by a person qualified to make it is admissible in evidence, subject to qualifications later to be mentioned. This is because an identification out of court, being earlier in time and made under circumstances which involve a selection in the absence of any compulsion, is more likely to be reliable than an identification made in court. 
         
        
       
      
    35     Later, his Honour referred to R v Osbourne [1973] QB 678, in which it was held that evidence from a police officer that two witnesses identified the accused at an identification parade was correctly admitted, even though at the trial those witnesses did not recall having made that identification and one of them was unable to identify the accused in court. Of that case Mason J said (at 432-3):  
     
      
       
        
         
         The Court proceeded according to the view, which in my opinion is correct, that the reception of such evidence does not violate the hearsay rule or the best evidence rule. It is the act of identification that is relevantly in issue. An observer of the act may give evidence of it. Obviously the weight to be given to this evidence varies with the circumstances  
         . . . 
           
         
        
       
      
    36     This was the view adopted by this Court in R v Barbaro & Ors (1993) 32 NSWLR 619. The leading judgment was delivered by Carruthers J, with whom Campbell and Ireland JJ agreed. His Honour arrived at that view after a careful examination of Alexander and other authorities, including McGuire, at 627-34 of the report. Accordingly, it now appears to be settled law in New South Wales that evidence of an out of court identification is admissible (subject to considerations of its reliability and of fairness to the accused) because that act of identification is itself relevant and, indeed, is likely to have much more probative value than an identification in court. The evidence is admissible whether or not the identifying witness adheres to that identification in court. 
     
      
       
      
    37     That said, the evidence with which this ground of appeal is concerned is not identification evidence as that term has generally been understood in the criminal law. “Identification evidence” is defined in Part 1 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
         identification evidence 
          means evidence that is: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (ii) an act connected to that offence was done; 
         
        
        
         
         at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw or heard at that place and time; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion.  
         
        
        
       Broadly speaking, this is consistent with the concept of identification evidence at common law although, in so far as it includes an assertion merely of resemblance and embraces observations by senses other than sight and hearing, it may be somewhat wider: see the article by his Honour, Judge Howie QC in (1996) 3 Crim LN 13 [543].  
        
       
      
    38     The present case is concerned with a different type of evidence: the recognition by witnesses in photographs of a man previously known to them. Evidence of that kind was examined by this Court in R v Mundarra Smith (1999) 47 NSWLR 419, although that case was not concerned with the precise question which arises here. It involved an armed robbery at a bank, during which the offenders were photographed by a security camera. Evidence was admitted of police officers, to whom the appellant was known, identifying him as one of the persons appearing in the photos. It was held that the evidence was rightly admitted. Sheller JA, with whom Grove J and I agreed, concluded that the evidence was not identification evidence for the purposes of the Evidence Act, so as to attract the provisions of Part 3.9 of that Act, and it was not opinion evidence within the meaning of s76.  
     
      
       
      
    39     In that case evidence was led that the police officers identified the appellant in the photos when they were shown them about a week after the robbery. No point was taken about that on appeal but, upon reflection, I consider that that evidence should not have been led. Recognition of a person known to the witness is not affected by the passage of time. The primary evidence of a witness’ recognition of a person in a photo is that witness’ testimony in court, and that evidence is afforded no greater weight by the fact that the witness also recognised the person when shown the photo at some earlier time. Nor is the reliability of the evidence reduced because of the presence of the accused in court at the time it is given.  
     
      
       
      
    40     This is not to deny that recognition evidence may have its weaknesses, as Sheller JA pointed out in Mundarra Smith at par 23, and the circumstances of a particular case may call for appropriate directions. In the present case his Honour gave directions, about which no complaint has been made.  
     
      
       
      
    41     Evidence of recognition on an occasion out of court would become admissible only if, as in this case, developments at the trial made it relevant. In evidence, Ms Paterson and Mr Goldsborough would say no more than that the man depicted in the security camera photos resembled the appellant. Having been given leave to cross-examine them, the Crown prosecutor was entitled by s43(1) of the Evidence Act to put to them that they had earlier made positive identifications of the appellant. When they would not admit having done so, the prosecutor was entitled to call evidence from police officers that they had: s43(2). By virtue of s60 of the Act, the jury were entitled to treat that as evidence that they had indeed recognised the appellant: R v Adam (1999) 47 NSWLR 267 at par 110ff. Accordingly, the evidence was admissible and I can see no basis upon which it should have been rejected under s137 of the Act. This ground of appeal also fails.  
     
      
       
      
    42     Since preparing these reasons, I have had the benefit of reading in draft the brief judgments of Spigelman CJ and Grove J. Whatever be the ambit of s66 of the Evidence Act, I doubt that it is applicable to the present case. It does not appear to me that a witness’ recognition of a person in a photo could be described as an “asserted fact”, the occurrence of which was “fresh in the memory” of the witness at that time. However, there is no need to express a concluded view about the matter. 
     
      
       
      
    43     I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     SPIGELMAN CJ: 
       
     An issue has arisen as to the appropriate form of the order for this Court to make in the case of a successful Crown appeal. When the Respondent was sentenced by Woods DCJ the sentence was imposed pursuant to the provisions of the  
     Sentencing Act 
      1989 then in force. Section 5 of that Act would have required his Honour, if he had imposed a full time custodial sentence, to have fixed a minimum term and then an additional term. That Act is now repealed. The equivalent provision under s44 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      1999 requires the identification of a term and then a non-parole period. 
      
       
      
     2     
     In what form should this Court make a new sentence upon a successful Crown appeal? The issue is one of statutory construction. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The matter comes before this Court pursuant to s5D of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
      1912 which relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “5D(1) The Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party and the Court of Criminal Appeal may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper”. 
         
        
       
      
     4     
     Of particular significance for present purposes is that the statutory power is conferred in terms of the formulation “vary the sentence”. This is in contrast with s6(3) of the Act with respect to appeals by convicted persons against severity of a sentence, which is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “6(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal”. 
         
        
        
       This power expressly provides for a quashing of the original sentence and the substitution of another sentence therefore. 
        
       
      
     5     
     Section 44 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      1999 is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “44(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court is required: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) secondly to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) The non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision. 
         
        
        
         
         …”. 
         
        
       
      
     6     
     As can be seen from the introductory words of s44(1) the relevant obligation is imposed upon “a court”. That word is defined in s3(1) to include the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
      
       
      
     7     
     Section 3(1) also provides a definition of sentence which means, relevantly: 
      
       
        
         
         “(b) when used as a verb, to impose a penalty for an offence”. 
         
        
       
      
     8     
     The phrase in s44(1) “when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence …” can be read as “when imposing a penalty for an offence”. In my opinion when this Court, pursuant to s5D, exercises the discretion to “vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the Court may seem proper” it is “sentencing an offender” within the meaning of s44(1) of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      1999. Accordingly it is obliged, subject to any statutory provision to the contrary, to impose a sentence in the form for which s44 provides. 
      
       
      
     9     
     In its submissions in the present proceedings, the Crown drew to the Court’s attention the possibility, without formally submitting, that such contrary provision could be found in cl 37 of sch 2 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      1999 which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “37 Subject to the regulations: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) anything begun before the appointed day under a provision of the old legislation for which there is a corresponding provision in this Act maybe continued and completed under the old legislation as if the  
           Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing)Act 
            1999 had not been enacted ….”. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
     10     
     It is the  
     Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 
      1999 which, by s3, repeals the  
     Sentencing Act  
     1989. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The suggestion put forward is that the imposition of a sentence can be characterised as “anything begun” within the meaning of that phrase as it appears in cl 37(a) and that the consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the exercise of its discretion to “vary the sentence and impose such sentence …” under s5D(1) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act, 
      can be characterised as that “thing” being “continued and completed” also within cl 37(a) of the 1999 Act. 
      
       
      
     12     
     In my opinion, the imposition of a sentence is not something “which begins” at a certain point of time. Nor can it be said to be “continuing” until “completed” in an appellate court. (It may be that the position is different in the case of a sentence hearing which was being conducted on the day that the new Act came into force and which was completed after the Act was in force. That is not this case.) 
      
       
      
     13     
     Section 5D(1) begins with the proposition that a particular sentence has been “pronounced”. All things that are required to be done, have been done. Nothing, in terms of the judicial process, as distinct from the sentence itself, can be described as “begun”. The process of appeal does not involve a “continuation” of any process. Nor does a determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal involve the “completion” of any process. Although what the Court is empowered to do is expressed in terms of “vary the sentence”, these words do not, in this context, suggest that any particular “thing” has been in process over a period of time.  
      
       
      
     14     
     In my opinion, cl 37(a) does not constitute a statutory provision which leads to a conclusion that s44 of the 1999 Act is not applicable in the present case. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      is in large measure a consolidating Act, but it is not only a consolidating Act. A specific difference is found in the comparison between s44 of the 1999 Act and s5 of the 1989 Act. The previous legislation provided for the setting of a minimum term and an additional term. The new legislation provides, firstly, for the setting of a total term and then, for a non-parole period. This Court had rejected a construction of the  
     Sentencing Act 
      1989 that in some way it was appropriate to proceed on the basis that the total sentence was a primary consideration. (See  
     R v GDR 
      (1994) 35 NSWLR 376 at 376-377, 378;  
     R v Hampton 
      (1998) 46 NSWLR 729 at 731-732;  
     R v Bloomfield 
      (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 740).  
      
       
      
     16     
     The 1999 Act makes it clear that the Court must first set the total sentence. Accordingly under this Act, unlike the 1989 Act, a finding of “special circumstances” would necessarily result in the reduction of what is now called the “non-parole period”. 
      
       
      
     17     
     Perhaps there are other changes in the new sentencing regime which may give rise to issues as to whether or not a previous provision continues to apply. I have in mind in particular s55 of the  
     Interpretation Act  
     1987 concerning an Act which “increases the penalty” for an offence. This section is repealed by cl 4.33 of sch 4 of the  
     Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 
      1999 and re-enacted as s19 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      1999.  
      
       
      
     18     
     No issue was raised in the present proceedings that any aspect of the course of resentencing by this Court under s44 of the 1999 Act would involve any “increase in penalty” within the meaning of the traditional provision now found in s19 of that Act. Nor was any submission made to the effect that any provision of s30(1) of the  
     Interpretation Act 
      1987, which also impinges on the continued operation of repealed Acts, was relevant to the decision before the Court. 
      
       
      
     19     
     The identification of when a change in sentencing regime ought to be characterised as an “increase in penalty” or when the common law principles reflected in s30 of the  
     Interpretation Act 
      apply, sometimes gives rise to difficult questions, which it is unnecessary to answer. (See

     23     
     GROVE J : 
       
     This is a Crown appeal asserting inadequacy of sentence imposed by Woods DCJ in the Sydney District Court. The respondent had pleaded guilty to two counts of knowingly taking part in the supply of prohibited drugs, respectively that commonly referred to as ecstasy and 
       
     cannabis leaf.  
      
       
      
     24     
     The circumstances found by the learned sentencing judge included the following. Intense police surveillance including the use of listening devices was directed at a flat in Clovelly occupied by one Leslie Kalache, a person significantly involved in drug trafficking. On 21 May 1997 the respondent’s brother Ray Carrion was released from gaol. Between 24 May and 21 June 1997 the two brothers visited the Clovelly flat on ten occasions. On 21 July 1997 the respondent visited the flat alone. Conversations were recorded. It is unnecessary to recite the content. His Honour found that collective involvement in selling drugs was unequivocally demonstrated and no challenge to that finding is made. He sentenced the respondent in each case to three years imprisonment (presumed to be understood as concurrent fixed terms) to be served by way of periodic detention.  
      
       
      
     25     
     His Honour acknowledged that he had been expressly referred by the Crown to the decision of this Court in  
     R v Cacciola 
     , unreported 15 October 1998 which reaffirmed that trafficking in illicit drugs must attract full time custodial sentence other than in exceptional circumstances. He found that the circumstances in this case were exceptional.  
      
       
      
     26     
     His Honour listed two groups of matters which he categorized as common place and exceptional. In the former category he included the guilty plea, remorse, an intention not to reoffend and proven rehabilitation in relation to the respondent’s own drug use (demonstrated by a series of clear urine tests). In the latter he specified five matters which he considered were all relevant to the relationship between the respondent and his brother Ray. First, they shared an institutional history in the sense that both had served lengthy periods in prison; second, the respondent was under the influence of his brother in an unusual and exceptional way; third, fears of security in gaol arising out of a belief that he was a selected victim for a fate similar to his brother who was murdered after his return to prison; fourth, it was clear from the taped product of the listening device that the respondent did not want to become involved and, fifth, that Kalache had preyed on Ray Carrion before he was released with the intention of recruiting him to his drug trafficking operation and this in turn drew the respondent into them.  
      
       
      
     27     
     The Crown has submitted that none of these matters was capable of constituting exceptional circumstances which would justify the imposition of a sentence other than full time custody. I would uphold the Crown submission and I deal with the five aspects indicated by his Honour seriatim.  
      
       
      
     28     
     The sharing of an institutional history demonstrates that the brothers had significant individual criminal records. Possession of such a record denies leniency. It is antithetical to principle to consider it a matter of mitigation, still less a matter of exceptional mitigation.  
      
       
      
     29     
     There is no elaboration of what is conceived to be the unusual and exceptional influence of his brother Ray upon the respondent. Earlier in his remarks his Honour had referred to Ray Carrion being described as a self centred and forceful personality who made decisions for other family members not necessarily in their best interests. It is not clear why this should particularly translate into a strong influence on the respondent and further translate into a significant mitigation of his criminality. The extent of influence would rationally be measured in the context of the earlier specific finding that his Honour did not accept that “in any way Roy Carrion was a powerless tool of his brother”. 
      
       
      
     30     
     The particular fear for safety of the respondent if returned to prison was sought to be evidenced by testimony from Mr O’Brien his solicitor. He referred to a murder in Goulburn Gaol, now about four to five years ago, of an unnamed aboriginal prisoner. Five men including Ray Carrion were charged with that murder. The respondent was not one of these and has never been charged in respect of that murder. Mr O’Brien stated that a list of those five charged was circulated within the aboriginal community. He reported that one person on the list, in addition to Ray Carrion, was now dead and that two others had been bashed whilst in gaol. Mr O’Brien’s thesis was that, because the respondent was Ray Carrion’s brother, there was an assumption in the aboriginal community that he would seek to revenge his brother, thus he became a marked man and therefore his life would be placed at risk. 
      
       
      
     31     
     The theoretical premises of Mr O’Brien’s evidence do not provide objective evidence for reasonable fear. Although his Honour included reference to this in the list of exceptional matters, he observed that the expressed fears did not of themselves justify other than a full time custodial sentence. It was not a relevant factor in the assessment of the sentence imposed and could not constitute an exceptional reason for departing from applicable authority. 
      
       
      
     32     
     The fourth matter to which express considerable weight was given, was a finding that it was clear from the tapes that the respondent did not want “to be involved”. Insofar as this is to be understood as a finding that the respondent did not wish to involve himself in the commission of crime, the finding is demonstrably wrong. 
      
       
      
     33     
     Two statements from the listening device product identified as Tape 494A have been referred to in submissions. It can be mentioned in passing that this is a recording of conversation between the respondent and Kalache in the absence of Ray Carrion. Both counsel for the Crown and for the respondent agreed that the statements should be interpreted in their context. I agree.  
      
       
      
     34     
     The first statement “I never wanted to be involved with it” is part of a conversation about Ray Carrion’s lavish spending and his gambling. It is the latter about which the respondent is saying that he does not wish to be involved as his added remark “I reckon he (Roy) shouldn’t do it” shows. There is nothing to suggest that the respondent is telling the principal drug trafficking operative that he or his brother did not or do not wish to be involved in that activity. Their actions contradict any such understanding. The second statement, in part “I hate doing the gear mate” is plainly a reference to the respondent’s own drug use. It follows immediately his statements that he doesn’t like heroin, he does like pot and that the only thing he has done with E’s (ecstasy) is smoke it. 
      
       
      
     35     
     There is force in the Crown submission that what is manifest is the respondent’s preparedness to engage in drug trafficking whilst being discriminating about his own drug use. Rather than being a matter of mitigation, the respondent’s remarks are capable of enhancing his culpability.  
      
       
      
     36     
     So far as the fifth matter is concerned, it is not possible to conceive how a circumstance that Kalache may have recruited Ray Carrion to his organization before he left gaol and that subsequently the respondent also joined in, can become a matter of mitigation at all.  
      
       
      
     37     
     There is no basis for categorizing this case as exceptional. In my opinion the sentences were manifestly inadequate and should be quashed and the Court should proceed to resentence.  
      
       
      
     38     
     Before turning to deal with this matter an issue arises as to whether the resentence in this Court should be expressed and imposed in terms of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which was proclaimed in force on and from 3 April 2000. It is contended by the Crown that it is unclear whether resentence following a successful appeal pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should apply the new Act having regard to transitional provisions therein. Reference is made to clause 37 of schedule 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and submission is made that the applicability is dependent upon construction of a phrase appearing therein “anything begun before the appointed day”.  
      
       
      
     39     
     Attention is drawn to the different language in s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act which empowers the Court to “vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the (court) may seem proper” and s6(3) of that Act which provides that in respect to an appeal under s5(1) against sentence the Court may “quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution thereof”. The Crown therefore observed that upon particular construction of the language in the schedule of the 1999 Act  
      
       
       and by reference to the statutory language it can be concluded that whilst an exercise of power pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is a fresh sentencing exercise, resentencing under s5D of the Act is not, but is rather a variation of sentence which therefore is to be regarded as continuance and completion of something and governed by the legislation in effect prior to 3 April 2000. 
        
       
      
     40     
     Section 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 has been described as “truly appellate” in nature:  
     Griffiths v The Queen 
      1977 137 CLR 293. When a court upholds an appeal it sets aside the sentence originally imposed and when it imposes some other sentence it exercises its own powers of finding, discretion and assessment. It is therefore in a real sense a fresh sentence and not a continuation of the sentence which has been previously imposed and is not to be categorized as a variation. The earlier sentence which has been quashed has no continuing existence. That, therefore the court after a successful Crown appeal pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act is engaged in a new sentencing exercise, is confirmed by the perception that the earlier sentence has been set aside: compare  
     R v Bond 
      1990 48 A Crim R 1. There is no continuing sentence and the construction suggested by the Crown to be applied to the words in clause 37 of schedule 2 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 should not be adopted.  
      
       
      
     41     
     Since preparing the foregoing I have had the opportunity to read in draft form the detailed judgment on this issue prepared by Spigelman CJ. I agree with his reasons. 
      
       
      
     42     
     I would therefore proceed to resentence in this appeal in terms of the lastmentioned Act. 
      
       
      
     43     
     This Court makes its own findings in respect of sentence and it is unnecessary to resolve debate about whether or not particular findings in the court below in addition to those already discussed were or were not properly viewed as mitigating factors.  
      
       
      
     44     
     The respondent together with his brother and Kalache were involved in selling drugs. The counts demonstrate involvement of the respondent in the sale of two separate types of drugs. He was engaged in this traffic for financial gain and was active between May and July 1997.  
      
       
      
     45     
     The respondent was born on 24 April 1959. He has a considerable prior record including convictions for armed robbery in both New South Wales and South Australia. He has been sentenced for escape from lawful custody. He has had problems with personal drug use which he is taking steps to address and there is a report from Dr Roberts, a psychiatrist in this regard. I will not repeat the matters discussed in connection with the finding in the court below of exceptional circumstances. I would find that the respondent’s expressions of remorse and intention not to reoffend were matters of speculation. He did not himself give evidence in the sentence proceedings and the court below has no advantage in that regard. 
      
       
      
     46     
     Some matters are of benefit to the respondent on resentence. Following a successful Crown appeal it is appropriate to approach the new sentence with a degree of restraint bearing in mind what is referred to, and readily understood, as double jeopardy. There is evidence of the satisfactory service to date of the periodic detention ordered by the sentence which I propose should be quashed. 
      
       
      
     47     
     Finally there is the weight to be given to the pleas of guilty. What was described as legal argument proceeded before the District Court on 21 and 22 July 1999. Being raised were objections concerning the validity of the listening device warrant, objections to the terms of an intended count for conspiracy and its specification of various sorts of drugs and, in the event of admission otherwise, to particular content of the product of the listening device. On the latter day, it was indicated that the respondent would plead guilty to what was described as a new indictment and on 23 July he pleaded guilty to the two counts mentioned at the commencement of this judgment.  
      
       
      
     48     
     The pleas of guilty therefore were offered at the earliest effective opportunity. Counsel for the respondent submitted that there should be a substantial discount on pragmatic grounds, the avoidance of a long and expensive trial.  
      
       
      
     49     
     The Crown acknowledged that the pleas of guilty had the utilitarian benefit of saving time and the expense of a trial. It was submitted, however that beyond that, once the respondent was identified as a participant in the taped conversations the case against him was overwhelming. His identification was made certain by the availability of the surveillance evidence of the flat in Clovelly.  
      
       
      
     50     
     The respondent should receive a benefit for his pleas of guilty based upon these pragmatic considerations.  
      
       
      
     51     
     I find there are no special circumstances leading to a departure from the proportion between head sentence and non parole period specified in s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Three days pre-sentence custody before entry to bail should be credited. 
      
       
      
     52     
     I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) The Crown appeal be allowed. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) The sentences imposed in the court below be quashed. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced on each count to three years imprisonment to commence on 23 May 2000 to be served concurrently. I would specify a non parole period of two years and three months to commence also on 23 May 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) I would order the release of the respondent to parole on 22 August 2002. 
         
        
       
      
     53     
     JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Grove J and I also agree with the judgment of Spigelman CJ.

     GROVE J : 
       
      The appellant Pasquale Barbaro was arraigned before Shadbolt DCJ on Monday 5 July 1999 together with two men, Domenic Pangallo and Domenic Romeo: 
      
       
        
         
         “For that they between 1 August and 12 December 1989 at Moulamein in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the cultivation of cannabis plants not less than the large commercial quantity.” 
         
        
       
      
     4     
     The appellant Carmelo Rovere was arraigned to be jointly tried with them upon a count: 
      
       
        
         
         “For that he between 1 June and 12 December 1989 at Griffith and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did conspire with Pasquale Barbaro to cultivate cannabis plants not less than the large commercial quantity.” 
         
        
       
      
     5     
     The four accused were ultimately convicted after trial. These appeals are brought by Barbaro and Rovere.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The four men mentioned (together with a fifth man who was acquitted on the jointly charged count) had been arraigned in September 1991 in the Albury District Court on identical counts and each of them was, after conviction, sentenced. An appeal to this Court was listed and heard in September 1992 and March 1993. On 24 May 1993, appeals against the convictions at Albury District Court were upheld, the convictions and sentences quashed and new trials ordered. The present appellants, Barbaro and Rovere, applied for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia. On 4 March 1994, special leave was refused.  
      
       
      
     7     
     The hearings presided over by Shadbolt DCJ were the new trials ordered by this Court in May 1993. Neither the appellants nor the Crown invited investigation of the considerable delay apparent before the matters were retried. Some explanation can be gained by reference to the extended course of related litigation:  
     Mackenzie v The Queen 
      (1996) 190 CLR 348 and the detailed chronology annexed to the interlocutory judgment delivered by Shadbolt DCJ on 9 July 1999.  
      
       
      
     8     
     Some background facts should be sketched. On 12 December 1989 a police helicopter crew detected a plantation of cannabis concealed within a large crop of corn upon a property, “Lenlin” which was located about twenty kilometres from Moulamein. Police officers visited the property and found no person present but there were signs of current occupation. Later investigation revealed a camouflaged “hide” into which it was deduced that a person seen on the property from the air, must have gone. An irrigation system was in place for the crop which was found to consist of about 20,000 plants which were removed by police and destroyed.  
      
       
      
     9     
     Lenlin was owned by Bruno Taverna, his wife and members of his family. The appellant Rovere was a stock and station agent with offices in the Irrigana Hotel building at Griffith. He was a cousin of Bruno Taverna. He introduced to the Tavernas a man giving the name Pat Trimarchi. Negotiations for the lease of Lenlin resulted in instructions being given to Mahon, a solicitor in Victoria, to prepare a lease. The necessary documentation was forwarded to an address given as 13/116 Cabramatta Road, Sydney and it was returned apparently executed by “Tony Trimarchi”. The lease was for a term of twelve months commencing on 1 August 1989 and provided for rental by six instalments each of $13,333.  
      
       
      
     10     
     The Crown case was simply that Pat Trimarchi (and others) knowingly took part in the cultivation and that a person masquerading as Pat Trimarchi was in fact the appellant Barbaro.  
      
       
      
     11     
     As mentioned, Barbaro and Rovere were arraigned upon different counts. About ten days prior to the hearing of this appeal, the appellant Rovere was released on parole after serving the minimum term component of the sentence imposed upon him by Shadbolt DCJ. He applied for adjournment of the hearing of his appeal in order to enable him to raise funds for legal representation. He did not have the benefit of a grant of legal aid. I shall return to the issues in his appeal but it is convenient to deal first with the grounds advanced on behalf of the appellant Barbaro which, insofar as they touched upon his own case, Rovere adopted. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The grounds advanced on behalf of the appellant Barbaro (including an amended ground) were expressed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The trial judge erred in admitting evidence from police officers of what was said to them by witnesses purporting to make an identification of the Appellant about the fact of identification. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The trial judge erred in admitting evidence from witnesses who purported to make an identification of the Appellant of what it was that they said to police officers about the identification. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the witness Peach concerning the identification of the Appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to cross examine its own witness Bruno Taverna. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The trial judge erred in not granting the Appellant a separate trial. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The trial judge erred in not granting the Appellant a stay of proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         6A. The trial judge erred in not rejecting the identification evidence which depended upon the use by the police of the photoboard (Exhibit Q). 
         
        
        
         
         7. The trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the manner in which they should approach the evidence of the witness Bruno Taverna. 
         
        
        
         
         8. The trial judge erred in directing the jury that they should treat the evidence of Andrew Coburn and the witness Lindsay Lowe as evidence of identification rather than evidence of similarity. 
         
        
        
         
         9. The trial judge erred in directing the jury as to how they could use evidence of similarity as opposed to evidence of identity. 
         
        
        
         
         10. The verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
        
        
        
       Grounds 1 and 2 
        
       
      
     13     
     Grounds 1 and 2 were argued together. A number of propositions were advanced in support of them. 
      
       
      
     14     
     The first requires some background reference. Judgments in  
     Alexander v The Queen 
      1981 145 CLR 395 reveal a difference in opinion concerning the nature of evidence by a witness testifying to an act of identification performed by another. The most common example would be a police officer giving evidence that a person, on being shown a selection of photographs pointed out a particular image in response to a request to attempt identification. Such photographs are usually numbered and no doubt it may frequently arise that an identifier, called to give evidence much later, might remember performing an act of identification but by that time can, either not remember the number or the particular image, or neither of them. By reference to records, the police officer can supply necessary detail. The issue could be further complicated by the identifier seeking to resile from the act of identification. Such is the present situation (in the cases of some witnesses) and I will turn to that aspect later. 
      
       
      
     15     
     A primary issue is the status of the evidence of the policeman (or other) who witnessed the act of identification. The judges in  
     Alexander 
      were agreed that such evidence was admissible. If I may epitomise the principal contrasting views, Mason J (as he then was) held that such evidence did not violate rules relating to hearsay or best evidence and thus testimony of the nature of that under discussion should be classified as direct evidence of an act of identification. Gibbs CJ regarded the principle justifying the admission of such evidence as obscure and opined that, if not an exception to the hearsay rule, the rationale of its admission must be to show consistency between testimony and the previous act of the identifier, along the lines that evidence of complaint was admitted in sexual cases. Thus the Chief Justice would admit the evidence where the identifying witness was consistent or where that witness had forgotten the detail but would hold otherwise in a case where the witness did not adhere to his or her earlier act of identification. It is not necessary to elaborate upon the views of other members of the Court. Aickin J agreed with Mason J. Murphy J held the evidence admissible in the instant case because it proved what had become an issue therein, namely the reliability of in-court identification or the completion of an incomplete in-court identification. Stephen J dissented from the orders agreed by the balance of the Court for reasons which need not now be explored.  
      
       
      
     16     
     It is significant that the views expressed in  
     Alexander 
      expose the position at common law and it will be necessary to consider any consequences of the passage of the Evidence Act 1995. The application for special leave by the appellants to the High Court of Australia in respect of the appeal to this Court in connection with the trial at Albury also preceded the changes wrought by that Act.

     A transcript of the hearing of that application was supplied and reference to it was made by all parties. From it, it appears that in the course of exchange with counsel, the presiding judge (Brennan J, as his Honour then was) with reference particularly to foreshadowed challenge by the appellants to the views of Mason J in  
     Alexander 
      remarked that if it was “a live problem, then one would think that special leave should be granted in this case”. There followed discussion in which counsel then appearing for the Crown (at the time holding office as Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions) asserted that, at the retrial ordered by this Court, it was expected that there would be an abundance of (incriminating) evidence other than that of police witnesses testifying to acts of identification by persons who had, when called, either recanted or qualified such earlier act when called to testify. 
      
       
      
     18     
     Special leave was ultimately refused, the presiding judge concluding with the observation that there was “uncertainty as to whether the evidence on ……..retrial would give rise to a consideration of the competing views” expressed in  
     Alexander 
     . 
      
       
      
     19     
     The discussion noted in the transcript included observations by counsel for the Crown that there seemed little point in “running again” with evidence of the acts of identification by persons who would be expected not to adhere to having done so when called to the witness box, inter alia, he stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am not making any concessions in relation to that (that is, the calling of observers at the trial in 1991) but I would anticipate that if a further trial was ordered that the Crown would not approach the evidence of the observers in the same way that it did in this trial.” 
         
        
       
      
     20     
     At the trial in 1999 the subject evidence was led. It is contended that this represented a retraction by the Crown from an implicit undertaking or, at least a representation, that the evidence would not be called at retrial and this Court should, in the enforcement of standards of fairness, hold the Crown to the position which it was asserted to have adopted in the High Court.  
      
       
      
     21     
     The intention of the Crown to adduce the evidence was notified in advance of the retrial and a ruling sought from Shadbolt DCJ. His Honour dealt with this and other issues in his judgment of 9 July 1999. On this issue he held that he was unpersuaded that the appellants had been deprived of some chance (of a judgment of acquittal in lieu of the order for new trial) as a result of undertaking by the Crown because a “revisiting of  
     Alexander’s 
      case would not of necessity resolve problems in any retrial”.  
      
       
      
     22     
     His Honour’s conclusion was correct. The exchange between members of the High Court bench and counsel does not reveal an undertaking express or implied, to refrain from calling evidence and it is apparent that the primary reason for refusal of special leave was the absence of conclusiveness that there was likely to be required for determination, a definitive preference for one or the other of the different views expressed in  
     Alexander 
     . 
      
       
      
     23     
     The opinion of Mason J (Aickin J agreeing) in  
     Alexander 
      was followed in this Court in the earlier appeal:  
     R v Barbaro & Ors 
      1993 67 A Crim R 456. That decision (and hence the opinion of Mason J) has been followed by a Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia:  
     Murphy v R 
      1994 62 SASR 121. The differing view was adopted in New Zealand:  
     R v Birkby 
      1994 2 NZLR 38. 
      
       
      
     24     
     There is no case made out for the departure by this Court from its previous decision in  
     Barbaro 
     . That adherence redeclares the common law in this State. The question arises whether the common law has been relevantly qualified by the Evidence Act. The rejection of the contention of the appellants, that the view of Gibbs CJ in  
     Alexander 
      is to be preferred and their contention that  
     Barbaro 
      was wrongly decided, does not answer that question. 
      
       
      
     25     
     It is convenient to interpolate reference to the Crown submission that it follows from accepting the correctness of  
     Barbaro 
      that the evidence of observers is primary evidence of the occurrence of an act of identification and available to prove the truth of its content, namely that the image is that of a person whom it is stated to be. It is therefore contended to be otiose to consider the provisions of the Evidence Act concerning hearsay (Part 3.2). Alternatively, the Crown submits that if the provisions do apply, the evidence is admissible pursuant to s66. Unless otherwise stated, unreferenced section numbers herein are to the Evidence Act 1995. I do not consider that the legislation can be treated as inapplicable in any sense. 
      
       
      
     26     
     Evidence is excluded by force of s59(1). That provision operates in its own terms and is not expressed to operate in respect of everything or any specified range of things which would be classified as hearsay at common law although obviously there is much commonality. 
      
       
      
     27     
     Section 59(1) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation.” 
         
        
       
      
     28     
     Both “previous representation” and “representation” are defined in the dictionary within the statute namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Previous representation 
          means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced. 
         
        
        
         
         Representation 
          includes: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing), or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a representation to be inferred from conduct, or 
         
        
        
         
         (c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person, or 
         
        
        
         
         (d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated.” 
         
        
       
      
     29     
     In the present context I find it inescapable to conclude other than that a statement by a person viewing a collection of photographs, that one of them is recognized as a particular individual (whether by name, or by reference to identifying that person as the perpetrator of some viewed activity, or in some given circumstance) is a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. In effect the identifier is saying: “that is the person”. Such representation has inevitable reference to something which has occurred in the past and necessarily then, previous to giving evidence and thus is, unless otherwise permitted, excluded by force of s59. 
      
       
      
     30     
     The Crown did seek to rely (in its alternative stance) on s66. The relevant part of that provision is s66(2) namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) that person, or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.” 
         
        
       
      
     31     
     An issue was raised concerning what is the asserted fact, in the context of evidence of observation of an act of identification, which is required to be fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation. In  
     Graham v The Queen 
      1998 195 CLR 606 in their joint judgment, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “The word ‘fresh’ in its context in s66, means ‘recent’ or ‘immediate’. It may also carry with it a connotation that describes the quality of the memory (as being ‘not deteriorated or changed by lapse of time’ Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed (1989), ‘fresh’ sense 7a) but the core of the meaning intended, is to describe the temporal relationship between ‘the occurrence of the asserted fact’ and the time of making the representation. Although questions of fact and degree may arise, the temporal relationship required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not, as was the case here, in years.” 
         
        
       
      
     32     
     Callinan J (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “I return to the appellant’s argument that the Court of Criminal Appeal misconstrued s66 of the Evidence Act. Whilst it cannot be doubted that the quality or vividness of a recollection will generally be relevant in an assessment of its freshness, its contemporaneity or near contemporaneity, or otherwise will almost always be the most important consideration in any assessment of its freshness”. 
         
        
       
      
     33     
     The Crown submission was that what was required to be fresh in the memory was the mental image corresponding with the photographic image being indicated at the time of identification. It therefore was contended to follow that the evidence of the observer was admissible pursuant to s66(2)(b). 
      
       
      
     34     
     What are under consideration are cases where the witness has recanted or qualified an alleged act of identification and evidence is being adduced from a person who saw, heard or perceived the representation being made. There is obvious contemporaneity between an act of identification, for example “this is a photograph of (the offender) whom I saw in such and such a circumstance” and the witnessing of this by an observer and hence there could be little argument, if the Crown’s contention be correct, that that occurrence was fresh in the memory. The same contemporaneity attaches to the conceptualization of the image and the statement by the identifier. But, in the example given, the asserted fact is not the unembellished parts of the statement “this is (the offender)”. It cannot be severed from the balance “whom I saw in such and such a circumstance”. The latter is an assertion of fact, the former a conclusion based on that assertion. This construction and application gives natural meaning to the word “memory”. The image which is called to mind at the time of making the statement of identification is that which the identifier has seen before. In my opinion it is the remembered circumstance which enables the statement of conclusion and it is therefore the enabling remembered fact which must be fresh in the memory in order to fulfil the requirement of s66(2)(b).  
      
       
      
     35     
     As I have noted, the testimony of the observer of the act of identification may be classified as primary evidence at common law but the provisions of the Evidence Act, s59 in particular, operate so as to encompass that evidence within a statutory concept of hearsay. 
      
       
      
     36     
     None of the memories of the recanting or qualifying witnesses of their respective encounters with Pat Trimarchi, upon which they were drawing for the purpose of making identifications of which the Crown tendered evidence by the observer, was at all proximate in time so as to fulfil any criterion making it fresh as it must be understood in relation to s66(2)(b):see  
     Graham v The Queen  
     1998 195 CLR 606;  
     R v Adam 
      1999 47 NSWLR 267. 
      
       
      
     37     
     At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Crown expressly disavowed any reliance upon s60, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “60. The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation”. 
         
        
       
      
     38     
     The Court had reserved its decision and thereafter an additional written submission was forwarded on behalf of the Crown and, later, a response on behalf of Barbaro. Reference was made to evidence given by Bruno Taverna. There were two photographs of Barbaro in the selection numbered 28 and 30. Bruno Taverna gave evidence that when shown photograph number 30 he had said “it looks a bit like Pat Trimarchi” and that when shown photograph number 28 it looked “familiar” as Pat Trimarchi. Leave was granted to the Crown Prosecutor to cross examine Bruno Taverna as an unfavourable witness. Further reference will be made to this in connection with Grounds 4 and 7. When further questioned he conceded that when shown photograph number 30 he had said to the police officer “photo 30 is definitely a photograph of the man I know and was introduced as Pat Trimarchi”. When shown photo number 28 he conceded that he had said “this photograph is very similar to the man Trimarchi although I believe that when I saw this man the hair was a lighter colour”. 
      
       
      
     39     
     The Crown now submits that, because the representation by Bruno Taverna out of Court that the man in photograph number 30 was definitely the man he had known as Pat Trimarchi was relevant for the purpose of showing that he had made a prior statement inconsistent with his evidence in court (that the man in the photo looked a bit like Pat Trimarchi), the hearsay rule did not apply and, for like reasons in respect of photograph number 28, that the person shown in it was very like him. There is a particular problem with the belated attempt to raise this issue. Had the matter been advanced on this basis, at the very least the trial judge would have been required to give consideration to placing limitation upon the use of the evidence pursuant to s136. Even if the argument how sought to be raised by the Crown were held to be correct, there would be manifest unfairness in depriving the appellant of any opportunity to be heard in connection with what limitations should be applied pursuant to that provision. This is not an issue which this Court can resolve and for my part I would not permit the Crown to repudiate its earlier disavowal of reliance upon s60. 
      
       
      
     40     
     In a like situation is a further submission sought to be made concerning s72. The likeness in situation is that reliance upon s72 was disavowed by the Crown during the course of oral submissions. It provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “72. The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation made by a person that was a contemporaneous representation about the person’s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind”. 
         
        
       
      
     41     
     The submission now sought to be made is that an indication by a witness to a police officer, identifying a person shown in a photograph, is a statement by that person as to the person’s state of mind and that therefore evidence from the police officer who was present is evidence of a representation made by a person that was a contemporaneous representation about that person’s state of mind. 
      
       
      
     42     
     There are perceptible difficulties in adopting this approach to photographic identification evidence not the least of which is the specific requirement in s66(2) concerning freshness in memory. In the situation under consideration the statement by the witness, although in one sense a current state of mind, is in another an expression of identity with a mental image of something that has been seen on a previous occasion. I would consider that there would be a prima facie inhibition against treating a general provision, as s72 is, as permitting circumvention of an express requirement such as legislated in s66(2). However the matter was not argued upon this basis and again I would refuse leave to the Crown to belatedly alter its stance in this regard. 
      
       
      
     43     
     Ground 1 is made out to the extent that the evidence of police officers of what was said to them by the alleged identifiers was inadmissible. There is no reason why the witnesses themselves could not testify to the circumstances of their individual acts of identification. That would amount to original evidence of their own states of mind and the evidence would merely be an expression of it. To exclude such evidence would invest an unwarranted element of artificiality into a trial. It is common practice for an identified photograph (or a copy of it) to be signed or otherwise endorsed by the identifier and there is again, no reason why reference to such may not be made. Such evidence may be led from a witness or, in accordance with appropriate procedures, put to an unfavourable witness. Ground 2 is not sustained. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
       
      
     44     
     An application to exclude the evidence of the witness Charles Peach was made on the ground that it was not evidence of identification and was generally unsafe and unreliable. The application was refused. Mr Peach was familiar with Lenlin and knew Bruno (Taverna) as the owner of the property. In October 1989 he spoke to a man who had been on a tractor and gave his name as Mick. Another man later came up to them and Mr Peach remembered that he also gave his name as Mick. Some time later he was shown photographs by police and indicated photograph No 28 (Barbaro) as the “first Mick” he had spoken to. However he added: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the chap in photo 28 - if you put beanie - which was a very heavy beanie - and a pair of dirty overalls, it could possibly be him” 
         
        
        
       and further 
        
        
         
         “It could possibly be somebody else too, I am sorry”. 
         
        
       
      
     45     
     This is plainly inadequate evidence of identification. The learned trial judge dealt with it as similarity evidence. He gave the jury some explicit directions about the approach to such evidence including these: 
      
       
        
         
         “………but I want to point out two similarities or two hundred similarities do not make a positive. You cannot aggregate the similarities and say well he was identified by one person and - I am just picking a number out of the air - a hundred people said it was similar. That kind of aggregation is not permissible. That kind of adding them together is not permissible. All that you can say about that similarity evidence is that it does not cast a shadow across the person who has positively identified another person, that is all. That is as far as it goes and you must not attempt to aggregate it and say well if so many people said it was similar then it must be that person. That would not be a proper way of going about your task.” 
         
        
       
      
     46     
     The evidence of Mr Peach was obviously tentative but it was capable of being used to the extent that his Honour had indicated to the jury. Admission of the evidence did not lead to miscarriage and this ground should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 4 and 7 
        
       
      
     47     
     The Crown sought to tender evidence against Rovere through the witness Bruno Taverna. In chief he agreed that after he spoke to police on 12 December 1989, he received a phone call from Rovere which he “thought” he brought to the attention of a police inspector at Deniliquin. He agreed that he received a second call from an anonymous caller. He claimed to remember only that Rovere had asserted that he had nothing to do with the crop and that he had been “conned”. He denied that anything about photographs had been mentioned in the call. It would not be a likely secret that police were showing a photographic selection to potential witnesses.  
      
       
      
     48     
     Application was made by the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to s38 and, if it arose s44, for leave to cross examine the witness as unfavourable. In support of this a copy of a police occurrence pad entry was produced. It was marked for identification 55. A copy of the document was made available in the appeal. The entry had been made on 20 December 1989 by Detective Sergeant Bellis. The content was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM INSPECTOR MARHEINE DENILIQUIN POLICE FROM BRUNO TAVERNA 
         
        
        
         
         This date Chief Inspector MARHEINE of Deniliquin Police contacted this office and stated the following: 
         
        
        
         
         Last Friday Bruno TAVERNA, (telephone 050 324354) owner of ‘Lenlin’ where the cannabis plantation was located contacted a member of the Swan Hill Police whom he knew. Apparently Bruno is concerned about who he can trust and was not prepared to contact local detectives at Swan Hill. The member then referred Bruno to Inspector MARHEINE and Bruno then passed on the following information. He had been contacted by Charlie ROVERE by telephone and Charlie allegedly said ‘You will be shown a number of photographs shortly by the Police. Tell them that you don’t recognise any one and that you’ve never seen them before.’ Charlie then went on to say ‘I have spoken to the man in Sydney in relation to your money and everything is alright, you will still get your money each month.’ Bruno is very concerned and does not want to accept any money from these people for fear of implication. Attempts were made this date to contact Bruno by telephone but there was no answer. Further attempts will be made by either BELLIS or DOLAN.” 
         
        
       
      
     49     
     Pursuant to leave granted, Bruno Taverna was asked to read MFI 55 and he was later asked questions and gave this evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Yes. Having examined that passage that has been coloured in yellow or green, do you maintain the answer you gave to the question whether or not in the phone call, Mr Rovere said anything concerning photographs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, after reading that, it could have - I think that could have happened. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What was said by Mr Rovere in the phone call concerning photographs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, could have been similar to what’s written down there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, what is that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I sort of can’t remember at the time but reading that, probably would have been into - close to those words. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well, what was it, Mr Taverna? Please tell us. What did he say to you about photographs? Did he say something to you about being or that you would be shown a number of photographs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I sort of don’t - after reading that, I recall we did have that conversation but the words that were said at the time, I can’t remember but must be similar to that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you say to you that you would be shown photographs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. (No answer). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I will ask you again, Mr Taverna -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. I know, look, it is very hard to remember what happened ten years ago. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did Mr Rovere say to you in the phone call that you would be shown photographs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Can I use that to go on or not? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         A. To answer the question? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: You can use that. 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS: I will have to say yes. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Did he tell you that you should tell the police that you don’t recognise anybody? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, going back to that, I would have to say yes/ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did he tell you that you should tell the police that you had never seen them before? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, as I said, going on to that, I’d have to say yes.” 
         
        
        
       And further: 
        
        
         
         “Q. Having read that, do you stand by the evidence you gave earlier about whether there was any conversation about the rental payments? 
         
        
        
         
         A. As I said, if I can go with that, I will say yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I am sorry? 
         
        
        
         
         A. If I can quote that, I will say yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. If you can quote that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. By that, you mean if you can quote what is in that document in front of you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. As I said, I can’t remember but I do - I do remember we did that. I had forgotten all about that but that must be right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what was said to you by Charlie Rovere in that phone call about payments? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, according to that, not to worry about it, the payments will be all right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What about -- 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION. (FINCH). BREACH OF SECTION 44(3)(d). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he tell you that he had spoken to the man in Sydney? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well what’s said in that probably is right. I just can’t remember what was said but if I can refer to that, I will say yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did he tell you he had spoken to the man in Sydney in relation to your money? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did he tell you that, ‘Everything is all right, you will still get your money each month’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did you pass that information on to the inspector, whoever he might be and at whatever police station he may have been? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
      
     50     
     The objection pursuant to s44(3)(d) noted in that portion of transcript was taken by counsel appearing for Rovere up to Wednesday 28 July 1999. On the following day his Honour was informed that his and his solicitor’s instructions had been withdrawn and new counsel appeared for Rovere. No evidence was taken on that day or the next. On the Monday morning when hearing was scheduled for resumption, the Crown Prosecutor informed his Honour that the witness Bruno Taverna had come forward with information concerning the evidence which he had given on the previous Wednesday. Inter alia, his Honour was informed: 
      
       
        
         
         “In summary what Mr Taverna has put forward is this; he now says he didn’t receive the phone call in the terms traversed in the occurrence entry in which he embraced on Wednesday. That phone call was received by his brother Steven in those terms. There is some question and some confusion about whether this was Mr Rovere who identified himself on the phone call or whether it was an anonymous phone call. 
         
        
        
         
         He says that as a result of that phone call he approached a Detective Dalton at Swan Hill and sought his assistance because of concerns he had about his safety in New South Wales. Detective Dalton put him in touch with a man named Charlie who was a Detective at Deniliquin. We have since confirmed that was now Superintendent Charles Sanderson. That when there was that conversation those police then put him in touch with Inspector Marheine.” 
         
        
       
      
     51     
     There followed a voir dire hearing (in the nature of a “Basha” enquiry, there being no issue to be determined upon it) in the course of which Bruno Taverna and several police and former police officers gave evidence about various contacts including contacts involving Bruno Taverna’s brother Steven. An application was made for discharge of the jury without verdict on behalf of Barbaro. In summary, it was based upon the dilemma that Bruno Taverna’s credit had been impugned in respect of evidence which was being tendered against Rovere but not against Barbaro, Barbaro however wished to rely upon the credibility of Bruno Taverna’s description of Pat Trimarchi but he could only seek to restore his credit by reference to matters concerning Rovere and the content of anonymous phone calls. His Honour refused the application but it is to be noted that, importantly, in his charge to the jury he suggested to them (with proper qualification) that they might set aside his evidence upon two issues about which there was a pattern of repeated contradiction; those issues being the identification of Barbaro as Pat Trimarchi and the content of the telephone calls. The suggestion to the jury did not include setting aside evidence given by Bruno Taverna of his description of Pat Trimarchi which was of a man with “fairish” hair.  
      
       
      
     52     
     When Bruno Taverna resumed giving evidence he agreed (when cross examined by counsel for Rovere) that his brother Steven told him that he (Steven) had received a telephone call from Rovere in which a message was passed that his cousins (the Tavernas) should keep their mouths shut and they would get their money, presumably the balance of rent due under the lease. It can be mentioned that Rovere in his unsworn statement confirmed that he had passed such a message. This was consistent with an answer given by him to Detective Bellis in an interview at Griffith Police Station on 4 March 1990: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q 36. Steve has told us that you said I have been told to tell you don’t worry about anything, the money will be alright, just keep your mouth shut, or words to that effect. Do you recall a conversation of this nature between yourself and Steve Taverna. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. I told Steve exactly what was told to me. Ring your cousins, tell them to shut their fucking mouths and they will get their money. There was actually two calls that I got. One was a hang up call and the second one was to the effect that your cousins are in trouble at Moulamein. Tell them to shut their fucken mouths and they will get their money.” 
         
        
       
      
     53     
     This material was of course not admissible against Barbaro but it offers some explanation of the confusion and the sources of confusion which have been highlighted.  
      
       
      
     54     
     Seen in its context, his Honour’s direction did not denigrate submission on behalf of Barbaro seeking attachment of credibility to Bruno Taverna’s description of Pat Trimarchi and his separate personality from that of Barbaro. Ground 7 is not made out.  
      
       
      
     55     
     There was ample basis for conclusion that Bruno Taverna was an unfavourable Crown witness and for the grant of leave pursuant to s38. Insofar as the particular content of MFI 55 might have involved contact between Steven Taverna and police, the premises upon which Bruno Taverna was questioned were unsound, however in all the circumstances it did not lead to miscarriage. At material times Bruno Taverna was aware that the message had been received that they should keep their mouths shut. That adjuration would be understood to mean not to identify anyone either by the use of photographs or otherwise. In his reasons for refusing to order discharge, Shadbolt DCJ observed that any potential finding of unreliability in a witness and the consequent diminution in utility to the defence of anything said by that witness, is not a basis for discharge and that the prejudice claimed to be suffered by Barbaro was no more than that of any co-accused in respect of evidence which is more weightily incriminating of the other. I do not consider his Honour erred either in permitting cross examination or in refusing the application to discharge without verdict. Ground 4 should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 5 
        
       
      
     56     
     At the commencement of the trial Barbaro sought a separate trial from Rovere. As mentioned, Rovere was indicted for conspiracy with Barbaro whereas Barbaro was not charged with conspiracy with Rovere but with knowingly taking part in the cultivation of the cannabis crop. Shadbolt DCJ delivered brief reasons for refusing the application. The alleged activities of each of the appellants were centred upon the use of Lenlin by Pat Trimarchi. It was anticipated that a significant volume of evidence would be common to both of the then accused and merely because some pockets of evidence may have been admissible against one but not the other did not require separate trials:  
     R v Guldur 
      1986 8 NSWLR 12. I perceive no error in his Honour’s ruling. 
      
       
      
     57     
     The issue for this Court is whether, in the event, the joint trial has been unfair and led to miscarriage.  
      
       
      
     58     
     It is complained on behalf of Barbaro that Rovere, if a compellable witness which as co-accused he was not, could have provided important evidence particularly that Barbaro and Trimarchi were separate identities. Rovere’s unsworn statement to that effect in the joint trial was not available for consideration in the case concerning Barbaro. Next, he may have provided evidence of dates upon which he accompanied Pat Trimarchi to Lenlin in respect of which Barbaro could have raised alibis and, thirdly, the handling of the lease when he helped Rovere move offices in Griffith could be confirmed. So far as the last is concerned, by January 10, 1990, police had identified Barbaro’s fingerprints on the lease and such could not have been deposited as a result of his handling it at a police interview which was after that date. Counsel acknowledged that it was in a practical sense critical for Barbaro to explain the presence of those fingerprints which are to be distinguished from other deposited prints which were not detected until re-examination of the document a long time afterwards. 
      
       
      
     59     
     The appellant Barbaro also relied upon the matters pertinent to ground 4 and the content of MFI 55 above discussed. These matters were contended to contribute to miscarriage.  
      
       
      
     60     
     It can be observed that separate trials would not necessarily result in Barbaro being able to compel Rovere to answer. Given the Crown allegations as to the respective seriousness of the involvement of the appellants, if the trials were separated, it might be predicted that Barbaro would be likely to be tried first. However it is the trial which was in fact conducted which requires examination. The cardinal Crown allegation was that Barbaro was Pat Trimarchi and a great volume of evidence was directed to proof this fact. Miscarriage could be discerned if the joint trial deprived either Barbaro or Rovere of a fair chance of raising a doubt about that central fact. Given the course of trial and the content of the evidence, I am unpersuaded that this can be discerned and I would reject this ground. 
      
       
      
     61     
     Even if this conclusion be wrong it is a necessary consequence of the orders which I will propose that there will not be a further joint trial of the appellants.  
      
       
        
        
       Grounds 6 and 6A 
        
       
      
     62     
     Application was made at trial for permanent stay of the presentation of the indictment as an abuse of process which was dealt with by his Honour in a judgment also ruling upon a motion to exclude certain evidence. As is obvious, the trial conducted in 1999 concerned events which had happened ten years previously. Shadbolt DCJ approached his task by attention to the five reference points collated by Deane J in  
     Jago v District Court of New South Wales 
      1989 168 CLR 23: the length of delay; the explanations by the prosecution; the responsibility of the accused; likely prejudice to the accused and public interest in the conviction of those guilty of serious crime. No ground has been made out for intervention by this Court in respect of his Honour’s assessment and judgment. 
      
       
      
     63     
     Significant argument in support of the stay was directed to challenge against what were alleged to be inherently flawed circumstances concerning the identification evidence and, in particular, the folder of photographs prepared by police to show to potential identifying witnesses. 
      
       
      
     64     
     Police originally compiled a collection of photographs numbered 1 to 26. None of these was a photograph of the appellant Barbaro. This folder was shown to a number of witnesses between December 1989 and February 1990. No one identified Pat Trimarchi in this collection. On 29 March 1990 police surveillance obtained a photograph of the appellant who is shown standing next to a tractor. The print depicts a left profile. A full face photograph was also acquired which was described by a witness (Pillon) who knew Barbaro in 1989 as a good likeness of him at the time. These photographs and eight others were added to the original folder, the profile shot of Barbaro was numbered 28 and the full face shot numbered 30. 
      
       
      
     65     
     This compilation of thirty six photographs was shown to witnesses (Bruno and Steven Taverna, Andrew and Max Coburn and Barry Collins). Steven Taverna, Andrew Coburn and Barry Collins referred to number 28 and Bruno Taverna and Max Coburn to both numbers 28 and 30. They offered varying degrees of certainty about the similarity or identity of the photographs with the man they knew as Pat Trimarchi. It is not necessary to deal with these grounds to trace all the details of what they said or what they are said to have said.  
      
       
      
     66     
     The appellant Barbaro was arrested on 1 April 1990 and responded to a request to participate in an identification parade that he would rely on legal advice. No identification parade was in fact held. 
      
       
      
     67     
     After that arrest a further six photographs (of men other than the appellants) were added to the compilation and forty two photographs were shown to witnesses (Lorraine Taverna, Lindsay Lowe, Anthony Pumpa, Charles Peach, Rex Oswin and Michael Hind). Each of these witnesses referred to photograph 28, again with varying degrees of certainty about similarity or identity. 
      
       
      
     68     
     The appellant complains about the constitution of the collection. Many witnesses had seen Pat Trimarchi in a rural context yet the only photograph showing anybody in such a context was number 28 which depicted Barbaro standing next to a tractor. Bruno Taverna had described Pat Trimarchi as having “fairish” hair, Lorraine Taverna called it “light”, Anthony Pumpa, “sandy” and Steven Taverna, “straw coloured or mousey”. The appellant had dark hair. None of the photographs (with the possible exception of number 41 which was added after Barbaro’s arrest) depicted a fair haired man.  
      
       
      
     69     
     It was further argued that the compilation was unfair in the sense that witnesses who had rejected the twenty six photographs when later confronted with the expanded compilation of thirty six photographs, were effectively being asked to make an identification only from the added ten, two of which were photographs of Barbaro. The compilation was only rendered slightly less unfair by the second addition.  
      
       
      
     70     
     By the time of trial in 1999, witnesses were being asked to offer identification evidence to the jury derived from encounters in 1989, most of which were of extremely short duration. It would appear to be fair comment that, in all likelihood, the witnesses were recapitulating and adhering to their earlier testimony rather than pledging their oaths to identifying the particular photographs as the person they remembered seeing in 1989. 
      
       
      
     71     
     Reference was made to the evidence of Professor Thompson who was called by the defence. It was for the jury to assess its cogency and they were not obliged to give it any particular weight. 
      
       
      
     72     
     In  
     R v Blick 
      (2000) NSWCCA 61, a case dealing with the proper approach to objection based on s137, it was remarked that to show a group of photographs in which only one was a man with a goatee beard, when that was the identifying factor in the witness’s mind, was little better than showing him only one photograph. 
      
       
      
     73     
     In the present case the probative value of identification, where it is made from an effective reduction to a selection from ten photographs (of which two were the suspect) and the absence of images fulfilling the criteria of witness’s suggestions of fair hair, was contended to be low. The unfair prejudice to Barbaro whose image appears twice among the additional ten photographs was said to be high. 
      
       
      
     74     
     The argument was premised upon the discretion of Shadbolt DCJ having miscarried although, as pointed out in  
     Blick 
      (decided after hearing of this appeal), the correct approach (to objection under s137) is to perform the weighing exercise and, if the probative value is outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice, there is no residual discretion. 
      
       
      
     75     
     I consider that there is substance in the appellant’s complaint but I am unpersuaded that it could not be found that the unfair prejudice was outweighed by the probative value of this evidence. It is possible, and I refrain from expressing a view, that the addition of ten photographs might be regarded differently from the addition, ultimately, of sixteen photographs. The Crown contends that a case is maintainable against Barbaro from evidence outside of that of the identifiers. Counsel for Barbaro claimed that such evidence, in particular the fingerprints on the lease, would not be sufficient to prove the appellant’s involvement in the cultivation. I do not accept that forecast. Sustaining this ground would not of itself, lead to a judgment of acquittal. 
      
       
      
     76     
     As for other reasons I am of a view that, in the appeal of Barbaro, it should be allowed and a new trial ordered, I consider that the desirable course is for the matter to be weighed by a judge of first instance at any new trial that comes to be held. At such trial there is the available guidance of  
     Blick 
      and the opportunity for specific focus on the matters of probative value and unfair prejudice which are required to be weighed.  
      
       
        
        
       Ground 8 
        
       
      
     77     
     This ground relates to asserted error by the trial judge leaving the evidence of witnesses Andrew Coburn and Lindsay Lowe as evidence of positive identification. His Honour did not leave this testimony to the jury in a fashion which suggested that they had testified to such positive identification and the use of expressions such as “an identification” or “identification” needs to be assessed in context.  
      
       
      
     78     
     Regarding Andrew Coburn his Honour charged the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “Andrew Coburn made sightings between October 1989 and December 1989. He had conversations with the person calling himself Pat and one calling himself Steve and one calling himself Mick on four different occasions. He made an identification five months later. He identified nine and thirteen as Mick and you will recall that they are the photographs of Pangallo who he said had a lisp and twenty eight was Pat. He agreed under cross examination that he had only seen the person who he identified as twenty eight on two occasions, not four, it was a five minute conversation and twenty eight is someone who resembled Pat. He is not absolutely certain and could be mistaken.” 
         
        
       
      
     79     
     And regarding Lindsay Lowe his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Lindsay Lowe made an observation in August of a person who paid him $1,000 and a later observation for some work he had done on a tractor. It was a thirty second observation and he saw him with Rovere for about perhaps less than five minutes. The date that he was asked to make an identification was 5 May. He identified twenty eight and seventeen which is Rovere. He believes his identification was correct but cannot be one hundred percent sure. He did not identify thirty and he had no particular reason to remember the person he identified.” 
         
        
       
      
     80     
     Given his Honour’s directions discriminating identification and similarity to which I will turn in relation to ground 9, and the recitation of the qualifications in the evidence of Andrew Coburn and Lindsay Lowe, it cannot fairly be concluded that the jury could have been misled. I would reject this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground 9 
        
       
      
     81     
     The principal complaints of the appellants are directed to a passage early in his Honour’s summing up. He had pointed out a number of matters as defects in the prosecution case on identification with particular reference to the assembling of the photographic folder display. He continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “But there were people who never made an actual identification. They said it is merely similar and what then should be done with those people. If I can give you a little example, if there were six people and they are shown a board of six people with one suspect who they have all seen and they all pick a different person, each one picks a different person from the other and even though one of them appears to have picked the suspect, you would have the greatest possible misgivings that that was a real identification. 
         
        
        
         
         If six people, all having seen the same person, again are shown six photographs including the suspect, and one person identifies that person and the other five say that it is very similar, then that evidence is not just to be put to one side because for one thing it helps not to throw a shadow over the one who has identified the person. And the other thing is that those people who maintain that it is similar are in reality, and as a matter of common experience over 150 years of photography in this world, saying that some of the features which they have recorded in their minds eye accord with some of the features in the person before them. They may of course be different features. One person may have well remembered a hairline, a mouth, jaw. Another person might have remembered the eyes or the colouring or the nose, but each of them is saying that there is some feature which is in their minds eye which accords with that particular photograph. So what it does is to throw no shadow over the one who does positively identify the person and secondly, it may give some support to that person who does positively identify the suspect.” 
         
        
       
      
     82     
     The argument included assertion that the jury were invited to re-assemble a patchwork of features “identified” by similarity witnesses in the absence of any evidence by witnesses as to which particular feature of the person, if any, was facilitating the making of the statement of similarity. The critical matter is whether the jury were misdirected or in some way the case of the appellant unfairly dealt with.  
      
       
      
     83     
     Immediately following the passage above extracted his Honour told the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “So when you come to deal with the identification evidence and in summing-up to you on the evidence I am going to separate them, have regard to those matters that it has some value but it is not identification in itself. 
         
        
        
         
         The thing I want to point out to you is that all of these people were asked to perform an identification months after the event. They had been required to carry in their minds eye, as it were, a casual meeting for a period of months and then to identify a person from the photo board. Some were shown the board twice with additional photos which narrowed the choice. It is claimed on behalf of Barbaro, Romeo and Pangallo that the board was unfair, Barbaro, because the pictures were inherently bad. Both of them were together. There were two on the one board and one of them was in contact with the tractor. Pangallo maintains that there are several, three photographs of him and Romeo because his alone is in colour and amongst additional photographs to those that had already been shown to those witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         I must point out to you that it will be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone. It would need support or corroboration from other sources.” 
         
        
       
      
     84     
     Later in his summing up, his Honour also gave the caution which I have set out in relation to ground 3. The interests of the accused at trial were adequately and fairly protected. There was no misdirection. 
      
       
        
       Ground 10 
        
       
      
     85     
     This ground was argued on the basis that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence and that there had been miscarriage. There is evidence capable of convincing the jury of a guilt of the appellants. Setting to one side the evidence relative to the issues in connection with grounds 1 and 2 and, for present purposes ground 6A, I do not come to the conclusion that, on the balance of the evidence the jury ought to have acquitted the appellants. I would not uphold this ground. 
      
       
        
       Rovere 
        
       
      
     86     
     Although grounds 1 and 2 relate to the identification of Barbaro as Pat Trimarchi, it is clear that it in a practical sense if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barbaro was masquerading as Pat Trimarchi then Rovere, who knew Barbaro had introduced him to become the lessee of Lenlin would inevitably be inculpated. It is true that much evidence pointing to the masquerade was admissible only against Barbaro but it would clearly be unsafe to allow a guilty verdict against Rovere to stand in all the circumstances.  
      
       
      
     87     
     Rovere has served the entirety of the custodial element of his sentence. Whilst I am of the view that there is available evidence capable of leading to his conviction at a new trial, it would be consistent with the practice of this Court not to exercise its discretion so to order:  
     King v The Queen

       Barbaro 
        
       
      
     88     
     Taking into account time served following the Albury trial, Barbaro was sentenced to a minimum term of three years and six months from 9 September 1999 with an additional term one year and two months. On 3 December 1999 he was released to bail pending this appeal and has continued to have conditional liberty. He has been in custody in all some twenty one months. The original sentence passed following the Albury trial had a minimum term element of ten years six months. 
      
       
      
     89     
     I recognize that it is now ten years since the events giving rise to the indictment and it will be even longer before any new trial can be held. However, taking all matters into account and in particular the grounds giving rise to the appeal being allowed, I am of opinion that the discretion of this Court ought be exercised to order a new trial. Whether the appellant is in fact called for retrial depends upon the exercise of a different discretion by the prosecuting authority. 
      
       
      
     90     
     In the case of Barbaro I propose that the appeal be allowed, the conviction and sentence quashed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
      
     91     
     In the appeal of Rovere I propose that the appeal be allowed, the conviction and sentence quashed and a verdict and judgment of acquittal entered.

     REGINA v Heeng UNG  
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
    1 IRELAND J:  I agree with Smart AJ and with his Honour’s reasons. 
    2 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Smart AJ and, subject to one matter, with his Honour’s Reasons. The one matter to which I refer is his Honour’s statement that the sentence imposed was well within the permissible range. 
    3 The Customs Act provides that the maximum penalty for being knowingly concerned with the importation into Australia of between 2gms and 1.5kgs of heroin is imprisonment for 25 years. (Having regard to the absence of remissions in the case of sentences imposed in New South Wales, that period must be understood as reduced by about one-third - see Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 16G and El Karhani (1991) 51 ACrimR 123). 
    4 The maximum penalty prescribed by the Customs Act where the quantity is 1.5kgs or more is life imprisonment - a period which requires no such adjustment - see Lee Vanit v R (1997) 190 CLR 378. 
    5 Having regard to the quantity of heroin involved, 54.5kgs (pure) - some 36 times the minimum commercial quantity - and its value - $14.5M wholesale and of the order of $110M street value - and notwithstanding that the Appellant may not have been a principal in the importation - as to which see R v Olbrich (1999) 73 ALJR 1550 - there is much to be said for the view that the sentence imposed was below the appropriate range. However, there was no appeal by the Crown and no final conclusion on that topic is required. 
    6 SMART AJ: Heeng Ung appeals to this Court against his conviction of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of not less than the commercial quantity of heroin. He was sentenced to 16½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years. The grounds upon which the conviction was challenged were that evidence was wrongly admitted and that, even if it was correctly admitted, the jury should have been warned about the risks of acting upon it. No objection was taken to the admissibility of the evidence at the trial and no warning was sought. 
    7 At the trial, there was no issue that there had been an importation of heroin and that the appellant was involved in that importation. There was one issue, namely, whether the appellant knew that heroin was being imported. The Crown case was that the appellant was closely associated with Mrs Vo in the importation, that she knew that heroin was being imported and that, by virtue of his involvement with her in the importation, his conduct and the surrounding circumstances, he must have known that heroin was being imported. The Crown case was based on circumstantial evidence. 
    8 On 28 February 1997, Mrs Vo caused her bank to remit $28,252 to the Bank of China in China for the credit of a Chinese supplier of canned pineapple. The Combined Transport Bill of Lading was issued on 9 April 1997. The consignee was Mrs Vo’s company and the address shown was at Warwick Farm. 
    9 On 21 April 1997, Mrs Vo entered into a lease for twelve months of shop premises at 139 Hollywood Drive, Lansvale. These were in a small neighbourhood shopping centre. The premises were to be used only as “storage and warehouse”. 
    10 On 23 April 1997, the vessel “Sha Ha” arrived at Port Botany from China and unloaded a container of ostensibly 800 cardboard boxes of tins of canned pineapple. On 28 April 1997, by a process of weighing and X-ray, it was discovered that seven boxes each weighed less than the other boxes and were sealed with a different coloured packing tape. The tins in these boxes contained heroin. That was removed by the police. The heroin weighed 78.073kg in bulk and about 54.504kg in its pure form. Its wholesale value in Australia was $14.5million and its street value approached $110million. The boxes were repacked with substitute material and small samples of heroin. The delivery of the container was permitted to proceed as if the heroin had not been detected. 
    11 On 30 April 1997, the appellant and Mrs Vo met with Mr Norman Daniels, the marketing manager of the Customs Agent retained by Mrs Vo to have the goods cleared through Customs and delivered. At this meeting, the appellant handed over four money orders totalling $3,736.15 to Mr Daniels in payment of a past debt of Mrs Vo’s company and the moneys due to the agent for handling the subject importation. The appellant changed the date of the delivery from Thursday 1 May to Friday 2 May and told Mr Daniels that the container was now to be delivered to 139 Hollywood Drive, Lansvale. Mr Daniels discussed the transport arrangements with the appellant as he seemed to be looking after these. In response to Mr Daniels’ queries, the appellant said that they would have enough labour to unpack the container, even if the container was delayed for an hour or so. The container was to be delivered between 11.00am and noon on Friday. The appellant gave Mr Daniels his mobile telephone number so the latter could contact him when the container was leaving the wharf. The appellant stated that one hour’s notice would be sufficient to get the labour in. The appellant left virtually immediately saying that he was in a hurry. Mrs Vo and Mr Daniels conversed further for a relatively short period and confirmed the earlier arrangement. 
    12 On 2 May 1997, the delivery of the container of canned pineapple was delayed. The truck carrying it arrived outside the Lansvale shop at about 2.40pm. Mrs Vo arrived at about 2.50pm. The truck was driven to the parking lot behind the shop and at about 3.05pm the truck driver and his assistant (Federal Agent Smith) started unloading the boxes. During the afternoon a number of Asian males arrived and assisted with the unloading. The boxes were carried into the shop and stacked under the directions of Mrs Vo in a way which permitted each box to be seen. 
    13 According to Federal Agent Smith, the appellant arrived at the Lansvale shop at about 3.30pm and helped with the unloading for about one hour. The videotape records the appellant first appearing at 3.31pm. In cross-examination, it was suggested that the appellant stayed for 45-50 minutes. While at the area of the shop, the appellant helped unload the boxes spending much of his time in and near the container and the back of the truck. The unloading was observed by Federal Police agents and recorded by videotape by police from nearby, by a listening device in one of the boxes and by a camera/microphone under the truck. During its case in chief, the Crown tendered an edited videotape which was admitted. It showed the presence of Mrs Vo and the appellant. 
    14 During the unloading, Mrs Vo approached the back of the truck and the open end of the container. The appellant was inside the container moving boxes. She called out, “Too many heh”, looked around (seemingly to check that no one else was around and could hear) and said, “Hey, Hey, you don’t know which one(s)?” It was open to the jury to find that the latter words were said in a lowered voice. The appellant’s reply cannot be discerned. On the Crown case, the words meant, “you don’t know which one(s) (boxes) contain the heroin?” It was the reception of these words into evidence and their use which is the basis of the challenge to the verdict. That evidence emerged in unusual circumstances as a result of calls for tapes during Federal Agent Smith’s cross-examination. 
    15 Federal Agent Smith asserted that he saw the appellant and Mrs Vo at the shop area after 5.00pm that day conversing. This evidence was the subject of a substantial challenge as were other aspects of his evidence.  
    16 On 3 May 1997, the appellant was at the shop from 11.36am to 12.07pm. Mrs Vo was present but no one else attended. The Crown alleged that the appellant was seen to wait and watch outside the rear door of the premises. The Crown contended that this indicated an expectation on his part that the boxes containing the heroin were to be collected that day. 
    17 On 4 May 1997 at 11.50am, two men named Tung and Leung collected the seven boxes containing the substituted material and small amounts of heroin. Mrs Vo was present but the appellant was not. He had gone fishing. Tung and Leung took the boxes in a car to a unit at Lakemba. Later that day, the police arrested both men outside the unit. The boxes and tins which were inside the unit had been opened. 
    18 Between 29 April and 4 May 1997, there were 29 mobile telephone calls between the appellant and Mrs Vo. 
    19 In the conduct of the defence case, a major attack was launched on the veracity of Federal Agent Smith. His evidence linked Mrs Vo and the appellant, their alleged conversations helping the Crown to establish knowledge of the heroin on the appellant’s part. 
    20 Counsel for the appellant cross-examined Officer Coldwell, who was in charge of the case, extensively about the edited videotape and the police investigation into the appellant and other persons associated with the importation. It was elicited that, although there was no soundtrack on the edited videotape, there were soundtracks “by way of one or more listening devices installed by the police”. Mr Coldwell was cross-examined about his knowledge derived from listening to the various tapes. He agreed that there were conversations recorded from time to time between the appellant and Mrs Vo and that these were in English. 
    21 Federal Agent Smith gave evidence in chief that he had observed the appellant and Mrs Vo speaking on a number of occasions during the afternoon on 2 May 1997. He thought that was inside the premises. He also asserted that sometime between 5.15pm and 6.00pm he saw the appellant talking to Mrs Vo inside the shop. Federal Agent Smith said that at about 5.00pm and shortly thereafter, he saw a number of boxes with clear tape being carried into the shop. Such boxes contained tins with a little heroin and the substitute material. Federal Agent Smith was cross-examined to the effect that the appellant last appeared on the video at 4.18pm and that he (Smith) had not seen the appellant after that time and that he had not seen the appellant after it became dark about 5.00pm. Federal Agent Smith adhered to what he had earlier said but the cross-examination had some bite. There was no mention of this last conversation in Federal Agent Smith’s statement. Federal Agent Smith gave various explanations, none of which were convincing. He claimed that this conversation between the appellant and Mrs Vo was in a foreign language which he was unable to identify. This was challenged. Mrs Vo was Vietnamese and the appellant was Cambodian. All other conversations appeared to have been in English as the appellant asserted. Federal Agent Smith acknowledged the importance of the evidence. He denied that he was lying and that he had fabricated this piece of evidence. 
    22 During Federal Agent Smith’s cross-examination on 22 July 1998 and shortly after the evidence as to the appellant and Mrs Vo speaking in a foreign language, counsel for the appellant called for the “original tape (videotape) including the soundtrack of the entire surveillance in the afternoon of the premises” (Lansvale shop). The morning adjournment was taken. It turned into a long adjournment. Upon resumption, the judge told the jury that it had been agreed that the tape be shown and that the sound was not clear as it came from three microphones secreted in different places. He explained that close attention would be required to make out what was being said. 
    23 The videotape was played and Federal Agent Smith commented upon what was happening and was cross-examined with attention being paid to aspects of his evidence as to the appellant’s activities which were not captured on the videotape. It appeared that Mrs Vo spoke to some of the manual workers recruited to unload the container in a foreign language (Vietnamese). 
    24 During the cross-examination, it was suggested that Federal Agent Smith might have confused the appellant with another Asian male who spoke to Mrs Vo. To meet this suggestion, the Crown Prosecutor sought to tender another tape. As counsel for the appellant had not seen it, the trial was adjourned to give him the opportunity to do so. Apparently, none of the counsel had seen or heard it previously. 
    25 On resumption of the hearing on 23 July 1998, the jury asked to hear the individual recordings for each listening device. The Crown Prosecutor stated that he was instructed that there was no material on the recorder mounted under the truck which was intelligible or useful. The judge stated that he would give both counsel the opportunity to hear it and see a further videotape which had been produced but which was stated to have deficiencies. The Court adjourned early for that purpose. 
    26 On resumption on 24 July 1998, counsel for the appellant stated that he had difficulty listening to the tape and requested more time. That was granted. Upon the hearing continuing, the Crown Prosecutor applied to revoke the appellant’s bail based on the contents of the videotape produced on 23 July 1998. The tape was played. It contained the words “Too many, hey” and “Hey, Hey you don’t know which one, hey?” That evidence had not previously been led. During submissions, the Crown Prosecutor conceded that it was not a strong circumstantial case until the emergence of this piece of evidence (T.201). However, from this piece of evidence, “the jury could infer knowledge”. Counsel for the defendant submitted that it was “still an incredibly weak [Crown] case”. The judge ruled, “The strength of the Crown case would now appear to be strong” and “… in the light of the evidence which is contained within [the tape] … bail should be revoked”. 
    27 The afternoon of 24 July 1998 was devoted to the appellant and his counsel watching films which the Crown intended to show and to the appellant giving instructions to his counsel in the absence of the judge and the prosecution. 
    28 On Monday 27 July 1998, the tape containing the words quoted was played in the presence of the jury and admitted into evidence without objection. On the bail application, the Crown Prosecutor had also said “That was a very significant private communication between those two people [the appellant and Mrs Vo], a very substantial strengthening of the Crown case, that Mr Ung had the same knowledge that Mrs Vo had, and that they were talking in a clandestine way about what boxes were of interest”. Counsel for the appellant could not but realise the importance of the words quoted and the turn for the worse which the trial was taking from the appellant’s point of view. Counsel who was experienced in the practice of the criminal law would have wished to exclude that evidence if there was a legitimate ground of objection available. He had the weekend to think about the matter. 
    29 In summing up, the judge said: 
     
      
       
       “… there is no dispute that the heroin was imported into Australia. What is in dispute is whether the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had knowledge, that is that he knew that the container of pineapples contained heroin …” 
        (SU.6 of 3/8/98) 
       
      
    30 The judge explained that the Crown case was a circumstantial case and he set out the circumstances upon which the Crown relied. The judge directed the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Vo knew that the container of pineapples contained heroin. If they were not so satisfied, they were directed to find the appellant not guilty. This was consistent with the way in which the Crown presented its case. 
    31 In his evidence the appellant asserted that he did not know that there were drugs in the goods in the container. He said that Mr Tan Tu for whom he had done some car repairs had told him in early 1997 that a container was arriving from overseas. Mr Tan Tu told the appellant that he was going overseas and asked him to give Mrs Vo (his wife) a hand if he was needed. The appellant, a panel beater, knew her, agreed and wanted $100 per day. 
    32 On 29 April 1997 Mrs Vo telephoned him. There is a record of such a call being made. Mrs Vo asked him to come down and meet her at a post office where she was buying money orders for delivery of goods. He could not do so immediately but eventually went to her home. She asked him to take the money orders to a meeting. She was worried that her bag might be snatched. He was given four money orders to take to the meeting at McDonalds, Fairfield and hand them to the person whom they were going to meet. The appellant said that he understood that the container contained foodstuffs. Mrs Vo gave him a piece of paper containing an address to which the foodstuffs were to be delivered. This was the address he gave to Mr Daniels. As a forklift could not be used he suggested the Friday delivery date so he could procure people to unload the container. The appellant said that after this Mrs Vo told him that he was finished for the day and could go home. 
    33 There were several telephone conversations between the appellant and Mrs Vo on 1 and 2 May 1997. About 2.51 pm on 2 May 1997 she telephoned him and asked if he was coming over. The appellant declined as he was busy with work and thought that she had everything organised. He agreed to go over to the Hollywood Drive premises and give her some help for a short period until more people came. He did so and told her on his arrival that he was unable to stay too long. He had to complete work on a car and see the owner of a boat about it. He knew but two of the men who were doing the unloading. 
    34 As to the conversation “too many you don’t know which one” he said a number of things including that he did not respond as he did not understand what she meant and that he was busy unloading. He heard Mrs Vo talk in a foreign language about 4.08 pm. He left the truck at 4.09pm and spent 7 or 8 minutes in the shop. He spoke with Mrs Vo. He went home, collected his girlfriend and went to inspect a boat. 
    35 On 3 May 1997 he wanted money and telephoned Mrs Vo to see if she had any work for him. He was at the shop on that day for about 40 minutes. Mrs Vo told him she was expecting friends and asked if he could help carry some boxes. He was not waiting for anyone to come. Later that day he telephoned Mrs Vo and told her that he was going fishing the following day, (Sunday 4 May 1997). He telephoned on his return to see if she needed a hand. 
    36 The appellant said that he had no suspicion that drugs were in the container and no suspicion that Tan and Vo were involved in drug dealing. He had no idea who the men were who took the drugs on 4 May 1997. In his evidence the appellant sought to explain away the suspicious circumstances. 
    37 Appeal Ground 1 
     
      
       
       “His Honour erred in admitting evidence as to the state of knowledge of Mrs Vo which was irrelevant to the guilt of the appellant: namely, (1) that Mrs Vo directed the unloading of the shipment in such a way as to facilitate removal of the boxes containing heroin; (2) that Mrs Vo shook one of the tins; (3) that Mrs Vo went to the shop on 3 May 1997; (4) that on 4 May 1997, Mrs Vo met two men who removed boxes containing heroin; and (5) Mrs Vo said during the unloading,  
       “you don’t know which one” 
       .” 
       
      
    38 The Crown alleged that Mrs Vo and the appellant were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise. Previously, there had been a joint trial. Mrs Vo had given evidence that the appellant was the prime mover and that she was innocent. Her evidence led to the joint trial being stopped and separate trials being ordered. 
    39 In his written and oral submissions, counsel for the appellant only addressed point (5) of this ground, submitting that the evidence of the recording of Mrs Vo saying to the appellant, “Too many, hey” and “Hey, hey, you don’t know which one, hey” was inadmissible. 
    40 The appellant’s attack was twofold. Firstly, the evidence was hearsay and was not admissible as it did not fall within any of the exceptions. Secondly, the Evidence Act 1995 constituted a code and the evidence was not admissible by virtue of s 59 of the Evidence Act 1995. The Crown contended that the evidence was not hearsay, that even if it was, it fell within an exception to the hearsay rule and that the Evidence Act did not constitute a code. The Crown submitted that as the evidence was not hearsay s59 of the Evidence Act did not arise.  
    41 Many out of court statements are admissible and not hearsay. In Walton v The Queen 166 CLR 283 at 288, Mason CJ said: 
     
      
       
       “The hearsay rule applies only to out-of-court statements tendered for the purpose of directly proving that the facts are as asserted in the statement. Generally speaking, evidence of out-of-court statements relied on for another purpose is not excluded by the rule. Thus, evidence of a relevant out-of-court statement is admissible evidence of the maker’s knowledge or state of mind when he made the statement in a case where such knowledge or state of mind is a fact in issue or a fact relevant to a fact in issue:  
       Reg v Blastland 
         
       [1986] AC 41. Similarly, a person’s statements or declarations are an accepted means of proving his intentions in circumstances where it is material to prove what those intentions were. As Mellish LJ remarked in  
       Sugden v Lord St Leonards 
        (1876) 1 PD 154 at p 251: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘[W]herever it is material to prove the state of a person’s mind, or what was passing in it, and what were his intentions, there you may prove what he said … .’ 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The point is that the making of the statement is itself evidence of the author’s intentions at the time the statement was made. Evidence of the making of the statement may be given by the author himself or, in the case of an oral statement, by any person who heard it made.” 
       
      
      
     At p 289, the Chief Justice continued: 
      
       
       “Even when the testimony proffered is not that of the maker of the statement, but that of a person who heard the author make the statement, it is original evidence. It is because the making of the statement has independent evidentiary value in proving the author’s intentions, those intentions being a fact in issue or a fact relevant to a fact in issue, that the witness’s testimony does not infringe the hearsay rule. It is original evidence rather than an exception to the hearsay rule … .” 
       
      
      
     The Crown tendered the statements not on the ground that the applicant adopted them or acquiesced in them, but on the footing that they tended to establish a fact relevant to a fact in issue and also a fact in issue, namely, the appellant’s knowledge. 
      
    42 In their joint judgment, Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ, at p 302, acknowledged that, “it may be true in some cases to say that statements made by a person indicating his state of mind involve no element of hearsay”, but that, “in other cases a person’s statements about his state of mind will only have probative value if they are truthful and accurate and to rely upon them is to rely to some extent upon the truth of any assertion or implied assertion contained in them”. They continued: “To that extent an element of hearsay may be said to be present … . But the element of hearsay need not necessarily preclude evidence of that kind being treated as conduct from which an inference can be drawn rather than as an assertion which is put forward to prove the truth of the facts asserted.” At p 304, the Justices continued: 
     
      
       
       “However, as we have said, not all conduct involving an assertion, expressed or implied, is treated as hearsay and held to be inadmissible in evidence. If it were, the available evidence in many cases would be seriously depleted. The distinction to be drawn is that to which we have referred, namely, the distinction between evidence of conduct which, even though it may contain an assertion, is tendered as a relevant fact or a fact relevant to a fact in issue and is therefore admissible and evidence of conduct which has no probative value other than as an assertion and is therefore not admissible. 
       
      
      
       
       An assertion may be admitted to prove the facts asserted if it is part of the res gestae, but it is then an exception to the rule against hearsay … .” 
       
      
    43 The knowledge of Mrs Vo was a fact relevant to a fact in issue. It is true that it was the knowledge of the appellant which was in issue. However, the knowledge of Mrs Vo was relevant to the joint enterprise and was a stepping stone in proving the appellant’s knowledge. It could be argued that, by her statement, Mrs Vo was confirming to the appellant that there was heroin in some of the boxes of the shipment and that he therefore had knowledge. 
    44 The Crown also relied on R v Chin (1985) 69 ALR 1 at 6, 14 and 15, but it is not necessary to refer to that decision in greater detail. It pre-dates and conforms with Walton. 
    45 The statement of Mrs Vo should not be regarded as hearsay. Even if it be so regarded, it is still admissible on the alternate basis propounded by Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ, at p 302, previously mentioned. The statement in the present case was made in the final stages of the importation while the important task of unloading was taking place. It was part of the res gestae. 
    46 Counsel for the appellant submitted that since the passing of the Evidence Act 1995, it was impermissible to look at Walton to determine what was hearsay or to divine the scope of any exceptions to the hearsay rule. Such exceptions had to be found in the Evidence Act 1995. On this point that Act was a code. 
    47 Section 9 of the Act provides that the Act does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law or equity in relation to evidence in a proceeding to which the Act applies except so far as the Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment. 
    48 Section 59 provides: 
     
      
       
       “ 
       (1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation 
        
       (2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an asserted fact. 
       ”  
       
      
    49 By virtue of the Dictionary to the Act “previous representation means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced”. Representation includes an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing) or a representation to be inferred from conduct. 
    50 Section 60 provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation. In Lee v The Queen (1998-1999) 195 CLR 594 at 599 the High Court pointed out that the starting point was the general exclusionary rule created by s59 (the hearsay rule). At 600 the Court said: 
     
      
       
       “ 
       The rule’s operation requires consideration first of why it is sought to lead evidence of something said or done out of court (the previous representation). What is it that the representation is led to prove? In particular, is it sought to lead it to prove the existence of a fact that the person who made the representation intended to assert by it? The fact that the statement or the conduct concerned might unintendedly convey some assertion is not to the point. The inquiry is about what the person who made the representation intended to assert by it 
       .” 
       
      
    51 In the present case the representation was led to prove that the appellant knew that some of the canned tins of pineapple contained heroin. It was not led to prove that some tins did contain heroin although that was the fact which Mrs Vo intended to assert. At 601 the Court said: 
     
      
       
       “… 
       S.60 does not convert evidence of what was said, out of court, into evidence of some fact that the person speaking out of court did not intend to assert.” 
       
      
    52 That is not the present case. 
    53 In my opinion, the challenged evidence was not hearsay: Chin, supra 5 (per Gibbs CJ and Wilson J) and Walton at 288 (per Mason CJ). Even if I were incorrect in that opinion and the challenged evidence were hearsay the exception contained in s60 of the Act would apply. The Evidence Act 1995 does not amount to a code which would render inadmissible the challenged evidence. The challenged evidence was correctly admitted. 
    54 To overcome the difficulty that no objection was taken at the trial to the admissibility of the challenged evidence the appellant relied on an affidavit from counsel who appeared for him at the trial stating, amongst other things,: 
     
      
       
       “8.  
       I did not have an adequate opportunity to consider the question of the admissibility of the material or the use to which it would eventually come to be put by the Crown. 
        
       9. I did not make a considered decision to acquiesce in the tender of the material 
       ?” 
        
       
      
    55 I am unable to agree that counsel did not have an adequate opportunity to consider the admissibility of the material. From the time of the application to revoke bail on 24 July 1998 (if not before) counsel could not but appreciate the significance of the challenged evidence. He had from lunchtime Friday (24 July) to Monday (27 July) to consider the admissibility of what was obviously important evidence and the course he would take. The explanations of the experienced counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial do not overcome the point that the challenged evidence was admitted without objection. 
    56 The Crown relied on an alternative submission, namely, that the challenged evidence was admissible to establish the knowledge of Mrs Vo of the existence of the heroin in some of the tins of pineapple. Her knowledge was an important part of the Crown case which alleged that she and the appellant were engaged in a common enterprise. The evidence of their close association and joint activity in importing the container with the tins of pineapple, some of which contained heroin, was strong. Her knowledge and involvement was an important part of the Crown case against the appellant. The evidence was also admissible on this basis. 
    57 Appeal ground 1 fails. 
    58 Appeal ground 2 reads: 
     
      
       
       “2. His Honour erred in his summing up …. in relation to circumstantial evidence.” 
       
      
    59 That ground was advanced upon the basis that the challenged evidence was admissible. It was submitted that as the Crown contended that the appellant must have known of the presence of the heroin because Mrs Vo did and had conducted herself in particular way there was a palpable risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant. It was not for the appellant to defend Mrs Vo in order to defend himself. This was not suggested by the Crown or in the summing up. The appellant further submitted that it was not for him to place a different complexion upon the statement made by her and not responded to by him. The appellant complained that the Crown had not called Mrs Vo. He submitted that it was incumbent upon the judge to warn the jury in strong terms as to the risks involved in endeavouring to determine, absent evidence from the representor (Mrs Vo), what was in the representor’s contemplation when a particular representation was made and that the appellant was at a distinct disadvantage in his defence because the Crown had chosen not to call Mrs Vo.  
    60 The submissions as to the non-calling of Mrs Vo were a little precious. There had been a joint trial of her and the appellant but the judge severed the indictment and ordered separate trials when it became apparent firstly that she was going to say that he directed the operation and that she acted at his behest and, secondly, counsel for Mr Ung was proposing to cross-examine her on certain statements which she had made to the police. The judge had ruled that these were inadmissible.  
    61 Theoretically, Mrs Vo could have been called by the Crown or the accused but neither party would have wished to call her. In Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 186 Hunt CJ at CL observed “The Crown may always call a co-accused who has not been dealt with but it cannot generally be criticised for not doing so.” 
    62 There was no dispute about what was said by Mrs Vo. There was no request by the appellant for a warning.  
    63 Absent a request for a warning this was not a case where a warning was required. Even if a request had been made I doubt if a warning was required. Evidence had been led of the close association between the appellant and Mrs Vo. It included their joint attendance at the site on the day the tins of pineapple were delivered and their conversation, the attendance at the site on the following day and their telephone calls. As earlier mentioned, the evidence was not hearsay and there was no dispute about what Mrs Vo had said. It is hard to see the basis on which it could be said that the evidence was unreliable. 
    64 As argument proceeded counsel for the appellant developed a further line of attack. He submitted that the judge should have given strong and explicit directions as to how the remarks by Mrs Vo should be used, the evidence generally as to her role and how her knowledge impacted or could have impacted upon the appellant. Otherwise there was a great risk that the evidence might be mis-used by the jury. Such directions were not sought at the trial. 
    65 As mentioned the only live issue at the trial was the appellant’s knowledge. Because of the way the Crown case was presented a subsidiary and necessary issue was the proof of Mrs Vo’s knowledge. The importation of heroin and the involvement of the appellant were not in issue. There was ample evidence of these matters. The evidence went to knowledge, being the matter in issue. This is thus not a case where the jury could have misused the evidence. The judge on a number of occasions reminded the jury that the issue was whether the appellant knew that there were drugs in the goods in the container. By directing the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Vo knew there were drugs in the container the judge imposed an additional matter of proof on the Crown. On the Crown case there was a joint enterprise involving Mrs Vo and the appellant. The judge’s directions as to circumstantial evidence were sufficient. Indeed, they were full and related to the evidence. The judge did not err. 
    66 Appeal Ground 3 is that that the sentence was too severe and harsh. While the appellant received legal aid and was represented by counsel as to grounds 1 and 2, he was not granted legal aid as to ground 3 and appeared in person. He has made written submissions. He asserts that he had neither a role in the importation nor any knowledge of any drugs in the container or at all. He had done other people’s dirty work without any knowledge of illegality. He submitted that he could not look into Mrs Vo’s mind and that so far as he was aware she was a trusted and honest businesswoman. He submitted that the sentence was too severe for the innocent role he played. 
    67 These submissions seemed to be directed primarily to the appellant’s innocence or lack of proven guilt. There was ample material from which the jury could reasonably and sensibly conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. 
    68 The sentence of 16 ½ years with a non parole period of 11 years is a severe one but the offence was very serious. The amount of pure heroin was about 54.504 kilograms. Its estimated wholesale value was $14.586 million and its estimated street value was $109.2 million. The judge was satisfied that the appellant was not a principal and that his involvement was less than that of the co-offender, His role was to facilitate the transfer of the heroin from the wharves at Port Botany to the premises where the heroin was unpacked and uplifted. The judge found that the appellant played a significant role in the overall operation. The materials justified that finding. The judge also found that the appellant knew that a large quantity of heroin of approximately the amount seized was involved. 
    69 The judge took into account the appellant’s offer to give evidence against Mrs Vo but noted that the Crown did not propose to call him and that he was a compellable witness. 
    70 The appellant was born in 1972 in Cambodia and came to Australia in 1980. His criminal record comprised convictions for traffic offences and dishonesty offences at the lower end of the scale. He had no previous convictions for drug offences. He showed no contrition or remorse. 
    71 The judge started with a head sentence of 25 years which he reduced to 16 ½ years because New South Wales does not have remissions. The judge was much influenced by the size of the importation and the appellant’s knowledge that it was a large importation. 
    72 The sentence imposed by the judge was a heavy one but it was well within the permissible range. The appellant’s criminality was of a high order. No error of fact or law is disclosed. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
     1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
      
     2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. Appeal against sentence dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONO'KEEFE JWednesday 31 May 200010491/00 - DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) -V- MALCOLM SINTONJUDGMENTBACKGROUNDHIS HONOUR: 1    Malcolm Sinton (the defendant) was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 5 November 1997 in which one person was killed and another injured. As a consequence, he was charged with the indictable offences of driving in a manner dangerous occasioning death (Crimes Act 1900 s 52A(1)) and driving in a manner dangerous occasioning grievous bodily harm (Crimes Act 1900 s 52A(3)). He was also charged with the summary offence of negligent driving (Traffic Act 1909 s 4(1)). 
     
      
    2    On 23 September 1998 the defendant was committed to stand trial in the District Court at Wollongong in respect of the charges under s 52A(1) and (3) of the Crimes Act 1900. At the time of such committal the prosecutor advised the presiding Magistrate that the charge of negligent driving was a back-up charge, but did not produce to the Magistrate a certificate under s 34A(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 specifying such charge. This is said to have occurred because the provisions were then relatively new and the prosecutor was unaware of them. The factual situation is novel, unlikely to be common in the future. 
     
      
    3    On 29 July 1999, following a hearing in the District Court, the jury, at the direction of the presiding Judge, returned verdicts of not guilty on both charges and no application was made pursuant to s 35(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to the trial Judge in respect of the charge of negligent driving. 
     
      
    4    The charge of negligent driving was subsequently re-listed before a Magistrate in the Wollongong Local Court and, following argument, the Magistrate on 13 December 1999 permanently stayed the prosecution of the defendant on such charge. The Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) has appealed from that decision of the Magistrate and has sought orders to set the Magistrate's decision aside and to remit the matter to him to hear and determine the charges against the defendant. For his part, the defendant has filed a notice of contention seeking to have the decision of the Magistrate confirmed, either on the grounds on which the Magistrate determined that the further prosecution of the negligent driving charge should be permanently stayed or, alternatively, on the ground that the failure of the DPP to comply with the provisions of s 34A(1)(b) (now s 36(1)(b)) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 deprived the Wollongong Local Court of jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge of negligent driving or otherwise provided a ground for staying the prosecution.  
     
      
       
      STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
      
    5    Prior to 1990 there was no power in the Supreme Court or the District Court to deal with charges for summary offences which had been laid as a consequence of the events which had given rise to indictable offences which had been tried in those courts. It was common to refer loosely or colloquially to such charges as ""back-up charges"". The procedure adopted in respect of such charges was that in the event that an accused person was acquitted of the indictable offences, the summary offences were then dealt with in the Local Court. There was argument in some cases that the acquittal on the indictable offences effected a discharge in respect of the summary offences either on the basis that there was an autre fois acquit or that it was otherwise not open to the Crown to pursue the back-up charges. In the event that an accused person was convicted, the summary offences were dealt with, if still appropriate, or simply not proceeded with by the Crown. 
     
      
    6    This procedure was said to be wasteful of the time of the Local Court and to give rise to possible unfairness to an accused person. As a consequence, it was considered by the legislature that in the interests of justice the position should be clarified. This was done by the insertion of Pt 10 into the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the Act) in 1990. This empowered the trial court, be it the Supreme Court or the District Court, to deal with a related summary offence at the completion of a trial, provided that the consent of both the defendant and the prosecution was forthcoming. The relevant parts of this amending legislation were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""PART 10 - SUPREME OR DISTRICT COURT MAY DEAL WITH SUMMARY OFFENCES RELATED TO INDICTABLE OFFENCES

          (3) In sentencing or otherwise dealing with a person for a related summary offence, the court has the same functions and is subject to the same restrictions and procedures, as a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate. 
          
         
          
         
          
          (4) Rules of court may be made with respect to related summary offences dealt with under this Part. 
          
         
          
         
         Remission of related summary offence to 
         
         Local Courts 
         
         
          
          37. A court which is dealing with a related summary offence under this Part may, at any time, remit the matter to a Local Court."" 
          
         
        
       
       
      As a consequence of this legislation a judicial gap was filled, albeit in a way that was entirely in the discretion of the Supreme Court or District Court. 
       
      
    7    The provisions in s 35(1) gave to the trial court a general discretion to deal or not to deal with a related summary offence. This was reinforced by s 35(3). Since the jurisdiction was entirely discretionary and there was no requirement for the trial court to deal with such matters, even with the consent of the accused person and the prosecutor, trial courts tended not to utilise the jurisdiction. The absence of any machinery for its implementation contributed to this as well. 
     
      
    8    The legislation was further amended in 1997 because of what was perceived to be an under-utilisation of the amendments effected in 1990. The 1997 amendments came into force on 30 March 1998. 
     
      
    9    In his Second Reading Speech in relation to these later amendments the Attorney-General adverted to the absence of adequate machinery in Pt 10 when he said that the under-utilisation of Pt 10 had arisen: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... in part because it is often unclear in the trial court, and to the prosecutor, which summary matters are related to which indictable matters and in some cases whether those summary matters are actually back-up matters or are merely other related summary matters. Accordingly trial courts often decline to deal with any of the summary matters, electing instead to allow a local court to sort them out at some later time... The amendments will require the prosecuting authority to tender to the local court, at the time of committal for trial a certificate detailing, in respect of each charge to be dealt with on indictment any 'back-up' summary offences and any other related summary offences ... the proposal will ensure that clear information is provided to the trial court as to what summary matters exist, and whether those summary matters are 'back-up 
         
        summary matters' or merely 'related' summary matters (Hansard 7 May 1997 page 8252)."" 
        
       
      
    10    The Second Reading Speech noted that whilst the 1997 amendments to Pt 10 did not ""formally"" provide for a stay of proceedings in the Local Court in relation to matters which had been included in a certificate under the Part, it was the practice of those courts to await the outcome of the trial court's deliberations in relation to such matters, and it was envisaged that this practice would continue. 
     
      
    11    The amending legislation in 1997 added a definition of ""back up summary offence"", added a consequent phrase as to the definition of ""related summary offence"" and changed its name, amended s 34A, amended s 35(1) replacing it with a new s 35(1) and (1A), and made a consequential amendment to s 35(2). Sections 37 and 37 were left in their original forms. As amended Pt 10 then provided: 
     
      
       
        
        ""34. Definitions and application 
         
         
        (1) In this Part: 
         
         
         back up offence, in relation to an indictable offence, means an offence: 
         
         
         (a) that is: 
         
         
         (i) a summary offence, or 
         
          
           (ii) an indictable offence that is capable of being dealt with 
           
            
             summarily by a Local Court in accordance with the provisions of Part 9A, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) all the elements of which are elements that are necessary to constitute the first indictable offence, and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) that is to be prosecuted on the same facts as the first indictable offence. 
          
         
         
         court means the Supreme Court or District Court, 
         
         
         related offence, in relation to an indictable offence, means an offence: 
         
         
         (a) that is: 
         
         
         (i) a summary offence, or 
         
          
           (ii) an indictable offence that is capable of being dealt with  
           
          summarily by a Local Court in accordance with the provision of 
           
          Part 9A, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) that arises from substantially the same circumstances as those from which the first indictable offence has arisen, but does not include a back up offence. 
          
         
         
        (2) This Part extends to proceedings commence, but not concluded, before the commencement of this Part. 
         
         
        34A Certification of back up and related offences 
         
         
          
          (1) On committal for trial of a person charged with an indictable offence: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the prosecuting authority must inform the Magistrate (or justice or justices), as to whether or not the person has been charged with any back up offence or related offence, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) if the person has been charged with any back up offence or related offence, the prosecuting authority is to produce to the court a certificate specifying each back up offence and related offence with which the person has been charged. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) This section does not prevent the person referred to in subsection (1) being charged with any offence after committal. 
          
         
         
        35. Manner of dealing with certain offences relating to indictable offences 
         
         
          
          (1) If at the conclusion of the trial of an accused person for an indictable offence, a court finds the accused person guilty of the offence, the court: 
          
         
         
         (a) is (unless it considers it inappropriate 
         
          
           in the circumstances to do so) to order that the charge in  
           
          relation to each back up offence be dismissed, and 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) may deal with any back up offence the charge for which is not dismissed under paragraph (a) and any related offence with which the accused person has been charged in accordance with this Part. (1A) If at the conclusion of the trial of an accused person for an indictable offence, a court finds the accused person not guilty of the offence, the court may deal with any back up offence or related offence with which the person has been charged in accordance with this Part. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) A court may deal with any back up offence referred to in subsection (1)(b) or (1A) or a related offence on its own motion, or on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor, but may not do so unless both the accused person or the prosecutor, but may not do so unless both the accused person and the prosecutor have consented to the offence being dealt with under this Part. 
          
         
         
          
          (3) Except as provided by subsection (1), nothing in this section requires a court to deal with a back up offence or related offence under this Part. 
          
         
         
          
          (4) A court may deal with a back up offence or related offence with which an accused person has been charged even though it is not doing so in relation to a back up offence or related offence with which another accused person in the same proceedings is charged. 
          
         
         
        36. Procedures for dealing with certain offences related to indictable offences 
         
         
          
          (1) The court is to deal with a back up offence or related offence under this Part without a jury and on the basis only of evidence given during the trial of the accused person for the relevant indictable offence in the same proceedings and additional evidence given under this section. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) The prosecutor or accused person may, with the leave of the court, call additional evidence in relation to the back up offence or related offence. 
          
         
         
          
          (3) In sentencing or otherwise dealing with a person for a back up offence or related offence, the court has the same functions and is subject to the same restrictions and procedures, as a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate. 
          
         
         
          
          (4) Rules of court may be made with respect to back up offences or related offences dealt with under this Pat. 
          
         
         
        37. Remission of certain offences related to indictable offences to Local Courts 
         
         
         A court which is dealing with a back up offence or related offence under this Part may, at any time, remit the matter to a Local Court."" 
        
       
      
    ANALYSIS12    Section 34A uses two different verbs in relation to the functions cast upon the prosecuting authority, namely, ""must"" and ""is to produce"". Section 34A(1)(a) provides that ""the prosecuting authority must inform the Magistrate ..."" Section 34A(1)(b)provides that the ""prosecuting authority is to produce to the court a certificate ..."" (Italics added) 
     
      
    13    It is clear from s 34A(2) that the requirements of s 34A(1) apply to all back-up and related offences with which an accused person has already been charged at the time such person is committed for trial. If other charges are preferred after committal, s 34A(1) could not have any application to them, since the time at which the functions are to be performed by the prosecuting authority is ""on committal for trial"". Nevertheless, the legislature has expressly confirmed this, no doubt for more abundant caution. 
     
      
    14    In construing s 34A(1)(b) it is necessary to ascertain whether the compound verb ""is to produce"" is to be understood in the sense of a command or requirement, i.e. in the sense of ""must"", or whether it should be understood to have a meaning that is merely facultative; i.e., enabling the act to be done, but not requiring or commanding that it be done. 
     
      
    15    As a matter of construction, like words or phrases which are used in the same section or in related sections of an Act will usually be given the same meaning. On the other hand, when different words (in this case, verbs) are used, they are usually expected to carry different meanings. It is therefore useful to consider the use of the same and cognate verbs in ss 35 and 36 of the Act. 
     
      
    16    Section 35(1)(a) uses the compound verb ""is ... to order"". This provision is to be contrasted with the use of the permissive ""may"" in s 35(1)(b), (1A), (2) and (4). Whilst s 35(1)(a) has a discretionary exception created by a parenthetical clause, namely ""(unless it considers it inappropriate in the circumstances to do so)"", the provisions of s 35(3) make it clear that, dehors such exception, s 35(1)(a) requires the court to exercise the function conferred upon it by s 35(1)(a). Were this not so it would be unnecessary to include the words ""Except as provided by sub-section (1)"" in s 35(3). 
     
      
    17    An examination of s 36 reveals a similar use of a compound verb in contrast to the discretionary verb ""may"". Section 36(1) provides that the court “is to deal” with any back-up or related offence ""without a jury and on the basis only of evidence given during the trial for the relevant indictable offence ..."". This provision clearly gives a command to the court in relation to the procedure to be taken, and proscribes any other procedures. There can be no doubt that if a trial Judge in the District Court were to empanel a jury and take a verdict on such a charge, the outcome would be a nullity. The proscriptions in s 36(1) are to be contrasted with the facultative or permissive provision of s 36(2), which gives the prosecutor and the accused person the option of calling additional evidence, but only ""with the leave of the Court"". Section 36(4) empowers the making of rules with respect to back-up and related offences dealt with under Part 10 but does not require them to be made. No rules have yet been made pursuant to this provision. Undoubtedly when used in Part 10 of the Act ""may"" means ""may"". (Contrast Ward v. Williams (1953) 19 LGR 190.) 
     
      
    18    From the foregoing it can be seen that when a compound verb is used in Pt 10, it is used in the sense of a command, an imperative stating a requirement or imposing a restriction. The compound verbs are used in the sense of ""shall"" or ""must"", in the same way as in the emphatic statement: ""It is to be""; a use similar to the old Navy command: ""Make it so, Mr Hornblower"". Thus, in my opinion, the compound verb ""is to produce"" in s 34A(1)(b) should be understood in the sense of imposing a requirement in the same way as the word ""must"" does in s 34A(1)(a). 
     
      
    19    This is consonant with the legislative intent expressed by the Attorney-General in his Second Reading Speech: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the amendments will  
        require 
         the prosecuting authority to tender to the local court ... a certificate ..."" (Supra, italics added.) 
        
       
      
    20    Part 10 of the Act was introduced to enable the Supreme Court and the District Court to deal with matters that they would not otherwise have been able to deal with. As enacted in 1990, the power created by the Part extended only to a related summary offence. A related summary offence was then defined as meaning ""in relation to an indictable offence, ... a summary offence capable of being dealt with by a Local Court that arises from substantially the same circumstances as those from which the indictable offence has arisen"". The power so conferred on the trial court conferred a benefit on an accused person. That person was given the option of consenting to any related offences being dealt with by the Court before which the indictable offence was dealt with. 
     
      
    21    The 1997 amendments extended the benefits so that they applied not merely in respect of a related offence, but also in respect of a back-up offence. Together these two categories of offences are apt to cover not merely those summary offences which depended ""on the same facts"" as the indictable offence (back-up offence) but also those which arose ""from substantially the same circumstances"" as those from which the indictable offence had arisen (related offence)- a wide coverage. 
     
      
    22    There were benefits to the justice system from the introduction and later expansion of Pt 10. Some of these were adverted to by the Attorney-General in his Second Reading Speech (supra). They included those conferred on an accused person. Prior to the enactment of Pt 10 of the Act there was no way in which an accused person could know whether or not what were loosely of colloquially described as back-up offences would be prosecuted after the trial of an indictable offence which arose out of the same or a similar set of circumstances. The amendments effected to Part 10 in 1997 made the circumstances in which such offences were able to be dealt with by the trial court or prosecuted summarily after the proceedings on indictment had been concluded quite clear. When the regime provided for in s 34A(1)(a) and (b) has been complied with, an accused person is in a position to know, before his or her trial for the indictable offence, that evidence given by him or her on such trial would be available to be used in relation to outstanding summary offences which fell within the definitions of ""related offence"" or ""back-up offence"". When any such offences have been charged prior to the accused person's committal for trial and the procedures specified in s 34A complied with, an accused person is put in a position of being able to make his or her election on an informed basis as to whether or not to give evidence at the trial of the indictable offence; a significant benefit that may impact upon, and be a very important factor in relation to the trial process. 
     
      
    23    The benefit introduced by s 34A of the Act is valuable to an accused person. 
     
      
    24    It is clear there was no compliance or attempted compliance with s 34A(1)(b) of the Act notwithstanding that it is couched in terms that command or require the doing of a particular act, in the same way as s 34A(1)(a) does. In the light of this conclusion it is necessary to determine the effect of such non-compliance. 
     
      
    25    In Clayton v. Heffron (1960) 105 CLR 214, Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Taylor and Windeyer JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Lawyers speak of statutory provision as imperative when any want of strict compliance with them means that the resulting act, be it a statute, a contract or what you will, is null and void. They speak of them as directory when they mean that although they are legal requirements which it is unlawful to disregard, yet failure to fulfil them does not mean that the resulting act is wholly null and void. It is almost unnecessary to say that the decided cases illustrating the distinction relate to much humbler matters than the validity or invalidity of the Constitution of the Legislature of a State. But in them all the performance of a public duty or the fulfilment of a public function by a body of persons to whom the past is confided is regarded as something to be contrasted with the acquisition or exercise of private rights or privileges and the fact that to treat a deviation in the former case from a conditions or directions laid down as meaning complete invalidity would work, inconvenience or worse on a section of the public is treated as a powerful consideration against doing so."" (At 247) 
        
       
       
      They also pointed out that: 
       
        
        ""In the end the distinction must be governed by the intention expressed by the legislature conferring the power and prescribing the steps to be taken in the course of its exercise. But commonly no express declaration is to be found in a statutory power as to the effect on validity of departures from procedures laid down. The question is then determined by reference to the nature of the power conferred, the consequences which flow from its exercise, the character and purpose of the procedure prescribed."" (Supra at 246) 
        
       
      
    26    Fullagar J dissented in Clayton v. Heffron, although he embraced ""the well known distinction between enactments that are 'mandatory' or 'imperative' or 'absolute' and enactments which are merely 'directory'. He quoted with approval Craies on Statute Law (1952) 5th ed p 240. However, in determining the characterisation effect of s 5B of the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW), which prescribed the manner and form in which amendments to the Constitution of New South Wales were to be effected, Fullagar J. sought to ascertain the legislative intent in relation to the particular provision and for that purpose examined the process which the legislature had provided in the section. I shall return to this later in the judgment. 
     
      
    27    The distinction between mandatory and directory provisions has been criticised. In Tasker v. Fullwood (1978) 1 NSWLR 20 it was said that it is ""an invitation to error"" to examine whether a particular ""statute is mandatory or directory in its terms"" (at 24) and that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... it is wrong to say that, if a statute is couched in directory terms, the act will be invalid unless substantial performance is demonstrated. A statute which, on its proper construction, does not nullify the act in question, even for total non-observance of the stipulation is also described as directory in terms:  
        Victoria v. The Commonwealth 
         (1975) 134 CLR 81 to 118."" 
        
       
       
      The correct approach was said to be based on the following propositions: 
       
        
        ""(1) The problem is to be solved in the process of construing the relevant statute. Little, if any assistance, will be derived from the terms of other statutes or any supposed judicial classification of them by reference to subject matter. (2) The task of construction is to determine whether the legislature intended that a failure to comply with the stipulated requirement would invalidate the act done or whether the validity of the act would be preserved notwithstanding non-compliance. (3) The only true guide to the statutory intention is to be found in the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The intention being sought is the effect upon the validity in question having regard to the nature of the pre-condition, its place in the legislative scheme and the extent of the failure to observe its requirement."" (At 23-24) 
        
       
      
    28    The approach taken in Tasker v. Fullwood was endorsed by the High Court in Project Blue Sky v. Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 35. McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition. Unfortunately, a finding of purpose or no purpose in this context often reflects a contestable judgment. The cases show various factors that have proved decisive in various contexts, but they do no more than provide guidance in analogous circumstances. There is no decisive rule that can be applied; there is not even a ranking of relevant factors or categories to give guidance on the issue. Traditionally, the courts have distinguished between acts done in breach of an essential preliminary to the exercise of a statutory power or authority and acts done in breach of a procedural condition for the exercise of a statutory power of authority. Cases falling within the first category are regarded as going to the jurisdiction of the person or body exercising the power or authority. Compliance with the condition is regarded as mandatory, and failure to comply with the condition will result in the invalidity of an act done in breach of the condition. Cases falling within the second category are traditionally classified as directory rather than mandatory."" 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
        
        ""The classification is the end of the inquiry, not the beginning. That being so, a court, determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory provision, may easily focus on the wrong factors if it asks itself whether compliance with the provision is mandatory or directory and, if directory, whether there has been substantial compliance with the provision. A better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid. This has been the preferred approach of courts in this country in recent years, particularly in New South Wales. In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'."" 
        
       
      
    29    In the present case the statutory provision in question casts obligations on the prosecuting authority. It does so in positive, affirmative and imperative terms. The section is included in a part of the Act which was amended so as to require certain things to be done, as opposed to merely permitting things to be done, as had been the situation under the 1990 enactments. By virtue of the 1997 amendments Pt 10 was made stronger, more useful and beneficial and those benefits extended not merely to the justice system operating through the courts but to an accused person. The provision was not introduced solely for the benefit of the Crown. That being so, it is not up to the Crown to renounce such benefits by a failure or refusal to fulfil the commands included in s 34A(1)(a) and 1(b). Whilst not directly applicable, the maxim quilibet potest renunciare juri pro se introducto is not without relevance. Were the provisions solely for the benefit of the Crown, the argument that it could renounce that benefit would assist the proposition that if the provision were not complied with the effect of non-compliance would not be to invalidate that which followed and was dependent upon the provision or provisions not complied with. However, as Sugerman J pointed out in James v. Ronald (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 473, where the provision is ""something more than jus pro se introductum"", such an approach is inappropriate since a person ""cannot renounce that which has been introduced for the benefit of another (person)"" (at 478); (see also Broom's Legal Maxims 10th ed (1939) p 480). 
     
      
    30    I have already dealt with the requirement in s 36(1) that the trial court deal with a back-up or related offence without a jury, and concluded that were such an offence to be dealt with by a jury the outcome would be void, a nullity. In one sense, s 36(1) is procedural. It prescribes the procedure for determining back-up offences or related offences by the trial court. However, the provision is also substantive in the sense that it confers upon the accused person a right to a particular form of trial. It is the end point of the regime created by Pt 10 of the Act. Should the starting point of the regime be treated in any different manner? In a sense s 34A is also procedural, but no more than is s 36(1). It is also a section which is the lead-up to the benefits or rights conferred by Pt 10 and in particular the right created to have each back-up offence in respect of an indictable offence for which the accused person has been found guilty, dismissed (s 35(1A)). 
     
      
    31    Section 34A is part of a legislative continuum which has the general effect of conferring rights and benefits on an accused person, as well as on the justice system. It is in effect a statutory code in which each provision has a role to play, work to do. It would be a strange construction of the Part if the end point of the process was of such a kind that non-compliance with its requirement would invalidate the outcome, but a like effect was not given to the opening steps in the same regime. 
     
      
    32    The reasoning of Fullagar J in Clayton v. Heffron (supra) in relation to the provisions of s 5B of the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW) is material in this context: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A manner and form are prescribed by section 5B, and that manner and form must be observed if a valid law is to be produced. Any prescription of manner and form may be repealed or amended, but, while it stands, the process prescribed by it must be followed. That was decided  
        Trethowan's 
         case and I think that the whole of what is prescribed by section 5B relates to manner and form. It does not seem to me to be possible to say that some of the requirements of the section are matters of manner and form while others are not. The section describes one entire process - a series of steps, one following on another - and only the completion of the entire process can produce a valid law."" 
         
        (Supra at 262) 
        
       
      
    33    In the present case, that line of reasoning is directly applicable to Pt 10 of the Act. The Part provides for and describes a regime or entire process. It sets out a series of steps, one following the other. It is only if such steps are followed that a valid end result or outcome is achieved. 
     
      
    34    Compliance by the Crown with s 34A(1)(a) and (1)(b) is a requirement. This is apparent both from the words of the Act itself and from the statement by the Attorney-General in his Second Reading Speech (Interpretation Act 1987 s 34(2)(e)). The legislative intent may be tested by reference to a situation in which a person is charged with an indictable offence and a summary offence, which is a back-up offence within the meaning of s 34 of the Act. If the Crown has not complied with s 34A(1), the trial court will not be in a position to fulfil the function imposed upon it by s 35(1)(a) in the event that the accused person is found guilty of the indictable offence. This could be a substantial detriment to an accused person. The requirement that the trial court ""is ... to order that the charge in relation to each back-up offence be dismissed"" means that an accused person is not in jeopardy of further proceeding in respect of the same facts as those involved in the indictable offence, with all the costs and other detriments that such a jeopardy would carry with it. However, absent the informing of the Magistrate and production of a relevant certificate as required by s 34A, there would be an assumption on the part of the trial court that there is no back-up offence. 
     
      
    35    Counsel for the DPP submitted that s 34A(1)(b) was merely a ""good housekeeping"" provision. As a consequence, so his argument ran, it should not be characterised as imposing any obligation on the prosecuting authority and non-compliance with it did not have any affect. However, his argument stopped short of asserting that the same was true in relation to the requirements of s 34A(1)(a). No doubt this was because of the use of the word ""must"" in s 34A(1)(a). However, as I have construed the Act, the use of the compound verb ""is to produce"" in s 34A(1)(b) has the same meaning as the use of the verb “must” in s.34A(1)a. The consequence of the argument advanced on behalf of the DPP is that s 34A(1)(b) has no real work to do. By logical extension, the same can be said in relation to the whole of s 34A(1), if the argument of the DPP is accepted. However, the adoption of a construction that leads to such a consequence is to be avoided, both in relation to s 34A(1) as a whole and s 34A(1)(b) as part of that section. Moreover, the argument in relation to s 34A(1)(b) flies in the face of the statement made by the Attorney-General in his Second Reading Speech that s 34A(1)(b) imposed a requirement on the prosecuting authority. 
     
      
    36    Counsel for the DPP further submitted that s 34A(1) was merely procedural and created no rights in the defendant. However, the Part itself does confer benefits on an accused person. Furthermore this argument seeks to isolate one element in the process or regime created by Pt 10 of the Act. Yet it is inappropriate to consider each sub-section in the Part in isolation. The approach of Fullagar J in Clayton v. Heffron (supra) sounds a powerful warning against adopting such an approach. 
     
      
    37    Finally in this context, counsel for the DPP submitted that ""to hold that s 34A(1)(b) is a mandatory provision produces inconvenience and effectively defeats the purpose of Pt 10 which is to facilitate the disposal of back-up and related offences in the court of trial"". This argument proceeds on the basis that it is alright for a prosecuting authority to ignore the provisions of s 34A(1)(b), probably the whole of s 34A(1). But prosecuting authorities should know and comply with statutory provisions which require them to do something. They will not be encouraged to do so if they know they can fail to do so with impunity. Whilst the failure to comply with s 34A(1)(b) in the present case is said to be a matter of oversight, cases can be envisaged in which a deliberate decision could be made not to comply with the section and thus deprive an accused person of the rights, benefits and privileges conferred by ss 35 and 36 of the Act. Furthermore, the statement of the purpose of the Part in this part of the argument is less than complete (vide supra). 
     
      
    38    If the propositions referred to in Tasker v. Fullwood (supra) are applied, it can, in my opinion, properly be said that on construing the statute by reference to the words of the relevant section in the context of the Part of the Act, the scope and object of the Part and the legislative intent as stated by the Attorney-General in his Second Reaching Speech, the result is that compliance with its provisions is essential; non-compliance vitiating. The nature of the provision, its place in the legislative scheme, and the effects of a non-compliance with the provisions of the relevant sections in the Part also point to the invalidating effect of non-compliance.39    If the test propounded by the High Court in Project Blue Sky v. Australian Broadcasting Authority (supra at 390), namely: 
     
      
       
        
        ""to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision would be invalid"" 
        
       
       
      and that 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ""in determining the question of purpose regard must be had to the relevant provision and the scope and object of the statute"" 
         
        
       
      is applied, the result is the same. Furthermore, the approach adopted by Fullagar J in  
      Clayton v. Heffron 
       (supra) brings about the same result. 
       
      
    40    Even if the terminology criticised in Tasker v. Fullwood (supra), Project Blue Sky v. Australian Broadcasting Authority (supra) and Barwick v. Law Society of New South Wales (2000) 169 ALR 236 at 245-246 is resorted to, the provisions of s 34A can properly be seen to be mandatory in the sense that such term was used by the High Court in Clayton v. Heffron (supra). 
     
      
    41    The end point reached as a result of adopting each of the above approaches is that non-compliance with the terms of the section deprives the trial court, be it the Supreme Court or the District Court, of the powers conferred by Pt 10 of the Act- powers which it did not have until the enactment of that Part of the Act. 
     
      
    42    In order to be able to exercise those powers, the statutory provisions that set out the steps in the process, must be complied with. Only then, may the powers be exercised and they must be exercised in accordance with the Part. 
     
      
    43    For these reasons, I am of opinion that the defendant in the present proceedings, the accused person before the trial court and the defendant before the Local Court, was deprived of the benefit, entitlement, privilege or right to have the trial court exercise its powers under ss 35 and 36 of the Act. Furthermore, the accused person in such a situation was deprived of the opportunity to make informed decisions in relation to the conduct of his trial, whether those decisions relate to an election to give evidence or to other matters relating to the conduct of the trial. 
     
      
    44    The failure of the prosecuting authority to comply with s 34A(1)(b) of the Act had the effect of depriving the trial court (in this case the District Court) of jurisdiction to deal with the charge of negligent driving. Furthermore, it resulted in the summary offence never having left the Local Court. If the requirements of s 34A had been complied with, the certificate would, in the ordinary course of administration, have been forwarded to the District Court - as the Magistrate indicates in his judgment. The District Court Judge would then have been aware of the pendency of such matter and of the court's jurisdiction in relation to it under Part 10 of the Act. Furthermore, the defendant would have been aware that he had the right to request the trial court to deal with the summary offence and the benefit, capacity or privilege of being able to consent to it being so dealt with. 
     
      
    45    The failure on the part of the prosecuting authority to comply with the provisions of s 34A meant that the Local Court retained sole jurisdiction in respect of that summary offence. This is what the Magistrate in the Local Court held.  
     
      
       
      STAY OF PROCEEDING 
      
    46    Having determined that the summary offence of negligent driving was still in the Local Court, the Magistrate proceeded to consider the principles applicable to a permanent stay in relation to that summary offence.  
     
      
    47    The power to grant a stay involves the exercise of a discretion (Dietrich v. The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 311 per Mason CJ and McHugh J.) It is a power possessed by a Local Court in the course of conducting the summary trial of an information. Such a court, like a superior court, has the power in appropriate circumstances permanently to stay criminal proceedings (DPP v. Shirvanian (1998) 44 NSWLR 129). The power of a court to grant a stay of proceedings as part of its necessary powers to ensure a fair trial was firmly established in Barton v. The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 Gibbs ACJ and Mason J)at 96 made this clear. Murphy J expressed the principle in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Every court hearing criminal proceedings has power to control those proceedings in order to avoid injustice; where necessary it may stay proceedings."" (At 107) 
        
       
      
    48    Wilson J linked the power to grant a stay to the concept of abuse of process which carried with it ""the inference of a trial which if allowed to proceed must necessarily be unfair to the accused. It is a fundamental defect that goes to the root of the trial, of such a nature that nothing that a trial Judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences."" (at 111) 
     
      
    49     A stay granted in respect of the prosecution of serious criminal offences where the accused person is unable to obtain legal assistance and as a consequence is without legal representation, is one example of such a stay (Dietrich (supra)); a stay granted pending the hearing of a Basha inquiry consequent upon the Crown declining to provide particulars of an offence is another. 
     
      
    50    The onus of establishing that the circumstances are appropriate for the grant of a stay lies on the applicant for that stay. It is not an onus which is discharged lightly (Barron v. Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 10 NSWLR 215), indeed to satisfy the onus the applicant needs to show strong and powerful grounds: Barron v. Attorney-General (NSW) (supra at 219; 233). 
     
      
    51     The exercise of the discretion to grant a stay requires the Court to consider, and in an appropriate case to safeguard, the interests of the accused person. In Jago v. District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23, Mason CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the safeguarding of the interests of the accused in the manner I have described, the touchstone in every case is fairness ... The test of fairness which must be applied involves a balancing process, for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community's right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial"" (at 33). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      and: 
       
        
        ""To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial Judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences'."" (at 34; see also  
        Barton v. The Queen 
         (supra). 
        
       
       
      Gaudron J said: 
       
        
        ""The nature of the power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings itself reveals an important principle which confines its exercise. The power is in essence a power to refuse to exercise jurisdiction. It is thus to be exercised in the light of the principle that the conferral of jurisdiction imports a prima facie right in the person invoking that jurisdiction to have it exercised."" 
        
       
      
    52    In this context it is also relevant to note the remarks of Deane J in Re Queensland Electricity Commission Ex Parte Electrical Trades Union of Australia (1987) 61 ALJR 393 that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The prima facie right to insist upon the exercise of jurisdiction is a concomitant of a basic element of the rule of law, namely, that every person and organisation, regardless of rank, condition or official standing, is 'amenable to the jurisdiction' of the courts and other public tribunals."" (at 399) 
        
       
      
    53    Thus, the power is one that is readily seen as exercisable (whether in civil or criminal proceedings) only in exceptional cases or, as was said by the court in Attorney-General (NSW) v. Watson in refusing special leave to appeal to exercise ""sparingly and with the utmost caution"". (supra at 76) 
     
      
    54    The Magistrate referred to the above principles. He recognised that the power to grant a stay was discretionary, to be exercised in exceptional cases, and sparingly. He expressly stated that the granting or withholding of a stay involved an exercise of the court's discretion.  
     
      
    55    He quoted and applied the analysis of the power as set out in the judgments of Brennan and Gaudron JJ in Jago v. District Court (NSW) (supra). He referred to and applied Barton v. The Queen (supra) and, whilst referring to the cost and stress to the defendant, did not rely upon these as grounds as the basis for the exercise of his discretion. The essential grounds on which he exercised his discretion in favour of the defendant were the lost opportunity before the District Court and the effluxion of time. These meant that the evidence before the Local Court would be unlikely to be the same as that before the District Court. Furthermore, he recognised that memories faded, that as a consequence the recreation of a situation would be less likely to be adequate, certainly not as precise as it had been at the trial, and that there was a prospect of different findings in relation to the same set of circumstances, based upon different evidence and a different judicial mind being brought to bear on such evidence. 
     
      
    56    This, the Magistrate held, was a prejudice to the defendant that went to the root of the process hearing and determination and could not be relieved by anything that he could do. He therefore was of the view that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""This is one of those rare cases where exceptional circumstances have been established, where despite using the utmost caution, which I have endeavoured to do, it seems to me that this is a case where a permanent stay of proceedings should be granted and I do so."" 
        
       
      
    CONCLUSION57    I do not detect any error in the approach taken by the Magistrate in relation to his exercise of the discretionary function of granting a permanent stay. He stated the principles correctly. The outcome does not itself bespeak error. No error is to be found in the application by him of the principles to the facts as found. Interference with a factual finding would be inappropriate, having regard to the appeal mechanism provided for in this case. Moreover, interference with the exercise of a discretion is circumscribed by long-established principles. In House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR at 499 Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary Judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonably or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred."" 
        
       
      
    58     In my opinion, the conclusion reached by the Magistrate in the exercise of his discretion does not reveal any error of the kind described in House v. The King. There is no proper basis for interfering with the exercise by the Magistrate of his discretion in the instant case. He acted on a correct principle. He does not appear to have been influenced by extraneous or irrelevant matters. He does not appear to have mistaken the facts. He does not appear to have failed to take into account a material consideration. In those circumstances, there is no basis in law on which this court with the jurisdiction that it has in this case would be entitled to interfere with the exercise of that discretion. 
     
      
    59    For those reasons, I am of the opinion that the decision of the Magistrate should stand and that the summons should be dismissed. 
     
      
    60    The order of the court will be the summons is dismissed. The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
        
        
       
      
     1     
     GILES JA: The Court is in a position to give judgment and I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment.  
      
       
      
     2     
     GROVE J : This is an appeal against conviction of the appellant on a count of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm following a trial before Latham DCJ and a jury in the Sydney District Court. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The indictment presented against the appellant included two counts pleaded in the alternative to that upon which he was convicted. As the jury found a verdict of guilty upon the principal count, verdicts were not taken on these alternatives which charged, in the second count using an offensive weapon with intent to hinder a member of the police force from investigating an act which reasonably called for investigation, and the third count, malicious wounding. All counts related to the same incident and were directed against the same victim. The third count, which I have mentioned simply charged malicious wounding, was in any event an available verdict to the jury in respect of the first count if they were not satisfied of the specific intent requisite to sustain that count but the Crown was entitled, if it chose, explicitly to plead the count as an alternative. 
       
       
      
       
      
     4     
     The appeal against conviction is focussed upon two grounds which assert that the trial judge misdirected the jury in relation to the third count and erred in not distinguishing between the first and third counts. The grounds are obviously related and it will be convenient to deal with them together. It will not be necessary to make further reference to the second count. 
      
       
      
     5     
     On 14 October 1997 the victim, a female sergeant of police, was driving her private vehicle after completing her shift at the Newtown Police Station. She was not carrying her appointments and was not in uniform in the sense that she was wearing a civilian windcheater style jacket on the upper part of her body. She saw a vehicle perform a manoeuvre upon a public street in Ultimo and that vehicle, which contained a group of young men, then stopped beside her vehicle in traffic. The appellant was seated in the front passenger’s seat. The police sergeant made a reproving gesture, her intention being to refer to the driving manoeuvre which she had witnessed. The appellant spat on the bonnet of the vehicle which she was driving. That he did so was the subject of an express admission at trial made pursuant to s184 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
      
     6     
     Thereafter the vehicle in which the appellant was riding as a passenger stopped and the sergeant pulled up her vehicle behind it. She alighted, approached the driver and showed her police identification. She said to the driver that he should stay where he was as she wished to speak to the passenger and that he should not move the vehicle. She walked to the front passenger window and as she approached it, the window which was open, was closed. A similar event occurred as she took a short step to the rear passenger’s window but while it was open she said again to the driver that he should not move his vehicle and she emphasized this by saying it was a direction and she wanted to speak to him.  
      
       
      
     7     
     The sergeant walked to the front of the vehicle by which time all car windows had been wound up. She was standing in the front of the vehicle and had a clear view through the front windscreen and she observed what appeared to be a heated discussion between the driver and the appellant who was still in the front passenger seat. She then saw the driver get into the back seat by passing between the two front bucket seats and she saw the appellant get into the driver’s seat. At all times the vehicle’s engine was running. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The appellant was then in the driver’s seat and therefore in control of the motion of the vehicle. It lurched forward about twelve inches and stopped at the sergeant’s knees. She placed her hands on the bonnet and stepped back about twelve inches and the vehicle suddenly accelerated towards her again. She was struck as a result of which she came to be lying across the bonnet. The vehicle continued in motion as a result of which she fell from her position on the bonnet and her leg went underneath the vehicle and the rear wheel ran over it. She had fallen hard to the bitumen surface.  
      
       
      
     9     
     There was a second formal admission at trial that the victim suffered wounding and actual bodily harm in the form of lacerations and contusions. The issue fought at trial was proof by the Crown that the appellant was the driver of the vehicle when the victim was wounded. He denied that he was the driver and gave and called evidence in his case to that effect. Manifestly, the jury were satisfied of the evidence of the victim’s observations which I have above recounted. The learned trial judge emphasized to the jury on several occasions during her charge to them that they would need to be satisfied of the truth of her evidence beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict.  
      
       
      
     10     
     The submissions on behalf of the appellant assert that her Honour failed to clearly distinguish the nature of the first and the third counts. It should be observed that from the very commencement of the trial each juror had been supplied with a copy of the indictment. It would scarcely need instruction from the trial judge to anticipate that jurors would observe that the only difference in the formulation of the first and third counts was that the first count added the words “with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to her”.  
      
       
      
     11     
     Although that contrast or comparison could easily be made it remained incumbent upon the judge to explain to the jury the ingredients of the charges which were requisite to be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. She did so. No complaint is made of her explanation of the meaning of the word maliciously in the context of the charges nor, of what constitutes wounding in law although, as I have observed, there was an admission in respect of this. Nor was there any complaint about the content of her explanation to the jury of what was required to be proved to demonstrate that the assailant had acted with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  
      
       
      
     12     
     Although all of the ingredients in the third count were duplicated in the first count, the distinction being the additional matter to be proved in order to sustain the first count, the learned trial judge nevertheless separately reminded the jury of the ingredients of that count and repeated her adjuration that the outcome would hinge entirely upon whether or not they accepted that it was the appellant who was driving the car at the relevant time. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The principal complaint urged on behalf of the appellant was that after dealing with the ingredients of the three counts her Honour added the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “I say without wishing to pre-empt what your finding will be of course, but there has been no real dispute in this trial about the fact that whoever did drive this vehicle at Sergeant Bellemore intended to get her out of the way and in the process, because of the way in which they drove the vehicle at her, intended to cause her serious injury. There has been no real dispute about that. The issue really is about whether or not it was the accused who drove the vehicle. Nonetheless, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the ingredients of those charges.” 
         
        
       
      
     14     
     The thrust of complaint is directed towards her Honour’s remark that there had been no real dispute about the intention to cause serious injury. It is argued that the jury may have formed the view that there was an attempt to frighten or intimidate without a specific intent to do really serious bodily injury. Whether there was such an intent was of course a matter for the jury but it was open to her Honour to make such comment as she thought appropriate in the context of the trial as it was conducted. She had given the jury the conventional caution about the separate roles of the judge and the jury as to fact finding. Her remark about the absence of contest was explicitly qualified by her opening remark that she did not wish to pre-empt the finding by the jury. There was no protest by counsel conducting the trial about her Honour’s remark and there is no reason why this Court should conclude that what was said did other than represent the real issues between the parties. The remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in  
     R v Asquith 
      72 A Crim R @ 253 are apt. 
      
       
      
     15     
     One can understand the tactical and practical inhibition upon the appellant, who gave evidence before the jury, asserting that he was not the driver and proposing an alternative that, if he was, he did not have the specific intention pleaded against him in the first count. The issue is however whether her Honour gave sufficient and properly comprehensive directions to the jury. She did so. And whether by her remark above quoted, the jury might have been led into error and the appellant deprived of a real chance of acquittal. That was not the case. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     17     
     Application is made for leave to appeal against sentence. The appellant was sentenced to penal servitude for a total of seven years constituted by minimum and additional terms of four years and three years respectively. Her Honour explicitly took into account one month of pre-sentence custody. She noted the prescribed maximum penalty for such offence of twenty five years penal servitude. Her Honour found as aggravating facts that the appellant knew that the victim was a police officer at the time he persuaded the driver of the vehicle to give up his place in his favour and that the course of conduct was pre- meditated in the sense that he had persuaded the previous driver to exchange his position. She expressed herself as unconvinced that the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation were “all that great” at this stage. Those findings and that conclusion are not shown to be wrong.  
      
       
      
     18     
     Latham DCJ recounted the appellant’s criminal history which led her to find as a matter of aggravation that he had a tendency to repeat patterns of (mis)behaviour and had manifested an intransigence towards members of the police force with particular regard to the commission of traffic offences. Her Honour’s recounting of the appellant’s history was accurate and the findings that she made were open to her. She found the most significant factor in the appellant’s favour was his comparative youth, being twenty three years at the time he appeared for sentence. She found that as a contributor towards a finding of special circumstances extending the additional term component of sentence during which the appellant might be at liberty on parole but under supervision.  
      
       
      
     19     
     The sentence imposed might be viewed as severe but in all the circumstances it was warranted. I perceive no error in finding or assessment by the sentencing judge and I consider that the imposition was within the range of the sound exercise of discretion. 
      
       
      
     20     
     I propose the appeal against conviction be dismissed; leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that appeal also dismissed.

     NIPPON CREDIT AUSTRALIA LIMITED & ORS 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: By Notice of Motion of 5 May 2000 Mr John Spencer Boscawen sought orders under Pt 10 r 6A of the Supreme Court Rules setting aside the Third, Fourth and Fifth Cross-claims. Other claims in the Notice of Motion were not pursued. In the Third Cross-claim the seventh defendants, partners of the law firm Clayton Utz, made claims against Messrs Duncan, Ambler, Petersen, Boscawen and Nippon Credit Australia Ltd, alleging that Clayton Utz are entitled in Equity or under s 5 of the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1946 (NSW) to contribution from them, and claimed contribution amounting to a complete indemnity against any liability of Clayton Utz to the plaintiffs. The allegations against the cross-defendants other than Mr Boscawen are largely based on allegations made earlier in the pleadings against the same persons as defendants.  
    2   I made an order on 1 March 2000 which gave each of these cross-claimants leave to file a cross-claim, and directed that Mr Boscawen be given notice in accordance with Pt 10 r 2A and Form 13A. These orders did not give leave to serve the cross-claims outside Australia; under the Rules and in the circumstances, such leave was not required, and the direction to give notice in accordance with Pt 10 r 2A did no more than repeat the requirements of that Rule. 
    3   Clayton Utz alleged against Mr Boscawen that at the material times he was a director of the plaintiff Maronis and secretary of the plaintiff Girvan Corporation (New Zealand) Ltd, and that he was the chief financial officer of GNZ and the executive responsible for the day to day running of the affairs of the New Zealand companies in the Girvan Group including the plaintiff. It is alleged that Mr Boscawen owed duties of care to the plaintiffs, in negligence and otherwise, and that he was in breach of those duties by his conduct and omissions relating to entry into the loan, the Facility Agreement, the Cross Roads mortgage and the Joint Guarantee. Extensive particulars of breaches are given. Claims in the Third Cross-claim for contribution towards liability in tort are based on alleged concurrent torts, and not on joint torts committed by Mr Boscawen jointly with the members of Clayton Utz. The allegations relate to conduct and omissions which occurred while Mr Boscawen was in New Zealand engaged in conduct of the affairs of the plaintiffs principally in their Auckland office. The claims of the plaintiffs relate to transactions which were entered into in Sydney and to land owned by Maronis situated in New South Wales.  
    4   In the Amended Fourth Cross-claim Mr Ambler and in the Fifth Cross-claim Mr Duncan also claim indemnity or contribution against Mr Boscawen. Mr Ambler and Mr Duncan were officers of companies in the Girvan Group. 
    5   Part 10 r 1A of the Supreme Court Rules authorises originating process to be served outside Australia in a number of cases which are there stated, including “(f) where the proceedings are for contribution or indemnity in respect of a liability enforceable by proceedings in the court”. These cross-claims clearly fall within case (f). Part 10 r 6A makes provision for setting aside service outside Australia in these terms: 
     
      
       
       6A(1) The Court may make an order of a kind referred to in Part 11 rule 8 (which relates to setting aside etc originating process) on application by a person on whom an originating process is served outside Australia. 
       
      
      
       
        (2) Without limiting subrule (1), the Court may make an order under this rule on the ground - 
       
      
      
       
        (a) that the service of the originating process is not 
        
        authorised by these rules; or  
        
         
          
           
           (b) that this Court is an inappropriate forum for the trial of the proceedings. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    6   It will be seen that the grounds on which the Court may act under r 6A are not limited to the two grounds mentioned in subr (2).  
     
      
    7   Part 11 r 8 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
       8(1) The Court may, on application made by a defendant to any originating process on notice of motion filed within the time fixed by subrule (2), by order - 
       
      
      
       
        (a) set aside the originating process; 
        
        (b) set aside the service of the originating process on the 
        
         
          defendant; 
         
        
        (c) declare that the originating process has not been duly 
        
        served on the defendant; 
        
        (d) discharge any order giving leave to serve the originating 
        
        process outside the State or confirming service of the originating 
        
        process outside the State; 
        
        (e) discharge any order extending the validity for service of the 
        
        originating process; 
        
        (f) protect or release - 
       
      
      
       
        (i) property seized, or threatened with seizure, in the 
        
        proceedings; or 
        
        (ii) property subject to an order restraining its 
        
         
         disposition or disposal or in relating to which such an order 
          
         is sought. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        (g) declare that the Court has no jurisdiction over the defendant 
        
        in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings; 
       
      
      
       
        (h) decline in its discretion to exercise its jurisdiction in the 
        
        proceedings; 
       
      
      
       
        (j) grant such other relief as it thinks appropriate. 
       
      
      
       
        (2) Notice of a motion under subrule (1) - 
       
      
      
       
        (a) may be filed without entering an appearance; 
       
      
      
       
        (b) shall bear a note “The defendant’s address for service is” and 
        
        state the address; 
       
      
      
       
        (c) shall be filed within the time limited for entering an 
        
       appearance. 
       
      
      
       
        (3) The making of an application under subrule (1) shall not be treated as a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the Court. 
        
       
      
    8   Part 10 r 6A refers to Pt 11 r 8 for the purpose only of identifying kinds of orders which may be made. Provisions of Pt 11 r 8 requiring the application to be made within a limited time and enabling a conditional appearance to be entered are not adopted for an application under Pt 10 r 6A to set aside service outside Australia. Counsel for Clayton Utz contended that it was significant that the application was not made within 28 days after service and referred to the time limited by Pt 7 r 5(1)(b)(iii) applicable under Pt 11 r 8(1)(c). However, this has no application to Pt 10 r 6A. In any event it is plain that the prescription of time for application is directory, and that an application under Pt 11 r 8 will not necessarily fail if it is made out of time. 
    9   Before Mr Boscawen’s Notice of Motion was filed an appearance was entered on his behalf, on or about 4 April 2000, in each cross-claim. It was contended against him that by entering these appearances he had voluntary submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court; and for that reason he is precluded from making an application under Pt 10 r 6A to set aside service outside Australia. As Mr Boscawen has entered appearances he has submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court for the purpose of recognition of the effectiveness of any judgment by the courts of another place which has private international law like ours. If he had applied under Pt 11 r 8 that rule gave him the opportunity so to apply without entering an appearance; the effect of so doing as a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of this court is a question for the law of whatever other place may ever be asked to recognise any judgment.  
    10   Part 11 r 8 does not oblige a person applying under that rule to proceed without entering an appearance under subr 8(2), and the procedure under that rule is not applicable to this application. In my opinion the fact that a person applying under Pt 10 r 6A has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by filing an appearance is a relevant factor within the ambit of discretion under the rule, but is not conclusive and does not exclude the discretionary power. Submission to the jurisdiction of the Court is not conclusive because no provision of Pt 10 r 6A or elsewhere in Pt 10 makes it conclusive. The fact that it is not conclusive is illustrated by the terms of para (h) in Pt 11 r 8(1), which is incorporated in Pt 10 r 6A, and shows that the Court may have jurisdiction and decline in its discretion to exercise it. The fact that Mr Boscawen has filed an appearance and in that way submitted to the jurisdiction cannot in principle prevent him from asking the Court to exercise its jurisdiction, including its jurisdiction to set aside service of the originating process. There is no inconsistency between accepting that the Court has jurisdiction and asking the Court to set aside service of the process, and there cannot be any question of waiving the second by electing the first. In a previous state of the law setting aside service was a recognition that there was no jurisdiction. The discretionary element in the present rule is an indication of a far-reaching shift in the law, as there could be no discretion about giving effect to a proved lack of jurisdiction. Mr Boscawen has shown readiness to participate in the proceedings if he has to, but his readiness appears to me to be of very little weight for a decision whether the Court will set aside its own process. 
    11   Counsel for Clayton Utz referred me to much case law which exemplified the Supreme Court practice at other times and other regimes of court rules and attempted to make good the position which it was necessary for him to show, that to set aside originating process under Pt 10 r 6A is not an exercise of jurisdiction. Counsel contended that once a foreign defendant submits to the jurisdiction of the Court that is the end of jurisdictional issues. Reference was made to the judgment of Giles CJ (Comm Div) in News Corporation Ltd v. Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 40 NSWLR 250 at 254, particularly the passage “A plaintiff need not obtain prior leave before serving originating process on a defendant outside Australia. If the defendant files a notice of appearance, he waives any objection to the jurisdiction of the Court and any irregularities in the manner of the commencement of the proceedings or the service of the originating process.” 
    12   Counsel submitted that the present application to set aside service is a challenge to jurisdiction. I do not accept this submission. Mr Boscawen has not invoked Pt 11 r 8 and has not contested the Court’s jurisdiction; he has acknowledged jurisdiction and sought its exercise. His application under Pt 10 r 6A does not depend on conformity with Pt 11 r 8 or on making good a challenge to jurisdiction, and relates to a different subject, that of setting aside the Cross-claims and their service. He does not seek to do any of the things which Giles CJ said that a submitting foreign defendant waives; he does not object to the jurisdiction, he does not raise any irregularities in the manner of the commencement of the proceedings and he does not raise any irregularities in the service of the originating process. He seeks a quite different decision, a discretionary decision whether or not the Court will set aside its process. 
    13   It is part of the scheme of extending jurisdiction in Pt 10 that the Court retains discretionary control over the cases in which it is to exercise its powers; the authorisation of service in Pt 10 r 1A is not the whole of what the rules prescribe on that subject, and that rule and the particular cases set out in it must be understood with the power to set aside service under r 6A. The discretionary control of the Court is just as much a part of the circumstances in which foreign service is authorised as are the cases designated in r 1A. The argument is an argument to bar the Court’s powers to control its own process, it needs a clear basis, and in my opinion it has no basis. 
    14   The Third Cross-claim when served was endorsed with a notice conforming to Form 13A which informed the cross-defendant that the Court may on application set aside service of a cross-claim and “alternatively you may submit to the jurisdiction of the Court by following the prescribed form of unconditional notice of appearance.” The notice does not state the full terms or effect of Pt 10 r 6A. In so far as it posits applying to set aside service and submitting to the jurisdiction as alternatives it is not a complete or accurate statement of what the Rules prescribe. When the Rules and the Form are read together the Form is obviously no more than an attempt to give a brief summary of what the cross-defendant may do. The Form and the notice were not intended to qualify or colour the meaning of the rule. 
    15   No criteria are specified in Pt 10 r 6A(1) so that all the circumstances of the case must be taken into account: see Esanda Finance Corp Ltd v. Wordplex Information Systems Ltd (1990) 19 NSWLR 146 at 154 (Giles J). The discretion is not confined by the words of the Rules, and the merits of the claim are not the only matters relevant: see Hyde v. Agar (1998) 45 NSWLR 487 at 504. The approach which should be taken was recently examined detail in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal in Hyde v. Agar, and I address the exercise of the jurisdiction with that judgment as a guide. 
    16   In Hyde v. Agar, the Court of Appeal did not decide the significance of filing an appearance. I do not regard the Court as having referred to the “non-submitting defendant” with the intention to state exhaustively a limit for the operation of Pt 10 r 6A in the following passage at 506: 
     
      
       
       Where a plaintiff establishes jurisdiction under r 1A to the requisite standard, there remains a discretion whether leave should be given or, alternatively, service set aside. As stated above, the discretionary phase is separate and distinct: [ 
       Seaconsar Far East Ltd v. Bank Markazi Jonhouri Islami Iran 
        [1994] 1 AC 438]. The question is whether, the plaintiff having passed through the nexus gateway, it is appropriate to grant leave to proceed to trial against the non-resident, non-submitting defendant.  
       
      
    17   The Court of Appeal’s reference to the non-submitting defendant can be contrasted with a passage at 501E where the language used is capable of the reading that an application to set aside service is an alternative to a case where the defendant does not enter an appearance. It would be wrong to attribute to either passage an intention of expressing exhaustively a conclusion about the effect of entering an appearance, which was not under debate. By applying to set aside service Mr Boscawen has shown that for the purpose addressed by the Court of Appeal he is a non-submitting defendant. 
    18   It is relevant to consider whether the cross-claimants have a good arguable case, and to appraise that case: see Hyde v. Agar, at 507F. Mr Boscawen’s counsel made submissions on a number of matters which relate to whether there is a good arguable case. I will appraise these matters, while bearing in mind that the merits of the case do not have much role to play in the exercise of the court’s discretion if a good arguable case is shown.  
    19   The appropriateness or inappropriateness of the local forum for hearing the cross-claim may be a basis for the exercise of the discretion, but the principles of forum non conveniens stated in Voth v. Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd (1990) 171 CLR 538 should not be undermined by the use of this discretion: see Hyde v. Agar, at 510D-G. The present application was not based on a contention that this Court is an inappropriate forum to try the contribution claim. The test established by Voth requires that this Court should be a clearly inappropriate forum for the determination of the dispute, and could not have been satisfied in this case. 
    20   In relation to location, I have regard to the propositions relating to location of a tort which the Court of Appeal derived from Voth and stated at 514: 
     
      
       
       The principles are set out in  
       Voth 
        (at 566-568). From that passage we derive the propositions that: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) the search is for the place where in substance the cause of action arose, by determining in a commonsense way the place of the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff the cause of complaint (at 567); 
       
      
      
       
       (b) in relation to omissions, the inquiry is to determine the place of the act or acts of the defendant in the context of which the omission assumes significance (at 567); 
       
      
      
       
       (c) the focus of attention is some act of the defendant, and not its consequences (at 567); 
       
      
      
       
       (d) if the place of the happening of damage might have been quite fortuitous it is unlikely to be a pointer to the place of the tort (at 567-568). 
       
      
    21   In the application of these propositions, particularly (b) and (c), I am of the view that the location of the tort alleged against Mr Boscawen was at Auckland, New Zealand. The same conclusion should be reached for the location of any other breach of duty.  
    22   Mr Boscawen’s counsel contended as a discretionary consideration that there is at least a strongly arguable case that the claim by Clayton Utz for contribution to damages in tort is statute barred. The claim for contribution was pleaded under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW). To my mind it is for consideration whether a claim would lie under that legislation on the assumption that there were concurrent torts one of which was in New South Wales and the other in New Zealand. I see at least three dimensions of consideration. One is the meaning and effect of the New South Wales legislation and the question whether, on its true construction, it was intended to extend to torts outside New South Wales concurrent with torts within the State. The second is the constitutional reach of New South Wales legislative power. The third is the application of private international law as considered in McKain v. R W Miller & Co (South Australia) Pty Ltd (1991) 174 CLR 1, which would require the cross-defendant did not have a defence or exemption from liability under the law of New Zealand.  
    23   The Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) s 26(1)(b), read with s 14(1)(b), gives an effective limitation period of ten years from the accrual of the plaintiffs’ cause of action against the cross-claimants. See too subs 26(3). The analysis presented by Mr Boscawen’s counsel was to the effect that if Clayton Utz are liable to the plaintiffs in tort, damage occurred when the plaintiffs joined in giving a guarantee and Maronis gave a mortgage over its property to support borrowings by the principal borrower Girvan Australia. The documents were given and the loan was drawn down on 1 June 1989. It was contended that each plaintiff incurred damage, the gist of the action of negligence, on the happening of those events and that it was open to the plaintiffs had they wished to do so to bring an action forthwith, on the following day or at any time thereafter. It was contended that this is no less so because, as time passed, the loss increased. It was contended that there was loss to the plaintiffs to some extent from first incurring obligations under the guarantee and mortgage, illustrated by the need to bring contingent liability into account in annual accounts and the implication of doing so on each company’s financial position, and to Maronis by diminution in value of its land with registration of the mortgage. Counsel pointed to expressions in records of the plaintiffs which suggest that officers perceived the mortgage and guarantee as disadvantageous from a very early time after they were executed. They were referred to in the note to the accounts for the financial year 1988/89, and were the subject of inquiry by a secured creditor in December 1989. Counsel further pointed out that a demand (Ex AB) was made against the plaintiffs on 14 February 1990 after the appointment on 31 January 1990 by the secured creditor of a receiver of the principal debtor. These events occurred more than 10 years before the commencement of the first of these cross-claims on 4 March 2000. 
    24   In response counsel for Clayton Utz referred to the treatment of the time of accrual of a cause of action in the judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Wardley Australia Ltd v. Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 533ff. The decision in Wardley related to accrual of a cause of action under provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), not to the tort of negligence. It is a question of statutory construction what facts and events constitute the cause of action and with what facts and events the cause of action accrues, and this requires scrutiny of the provisions of the statute with respect to remedy. 
    25   Counsel for Clayton Utz contended that damage in respect of the contingent liability incurred by entering into the securities did not first accrue until the contingency was fulfilled. This proposition was based upon the holding in Wardley at 533. In that case the plaintiffs sued under s 82(1) of the Trade Practices Act for loss or damage suffered by misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52(1). Section 82 confers a right to recover the amount of loss or damage in terms which do not create a time bar but make authorisation to commence an action within the stated time part of the terms on which that right in conferred. In this respect it operates differently to the law of negligence and the Limitation Act. 
    26   In the leading judgment the passage relied on is as follows: 
     
      
       
       The conclusion which we have reached with respect to the time when the plaintiff first suffers loss in respect of contingent loss or liability accords with the comment of Gaudron J in  
       Hawkins v. Clayton 
        (1988) 164 CLR at p 601: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         [I]f the interest infringed is an interest in recouping moneys advanced it may be appropriate to fix the time of accrual of the cause of action when recoupment becomes impossible rather than at the time when the antecedent right to recoup should have come into existence, for the actual loss is sustained only when recoupment becomes impossible. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       Gaudron J went on to point out ibid, at p 602: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         It would be too simplistic to restrict analysis of economic loss merely to a consideration of reduced value or increased liability. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The conclusion which we have reached is reinforced by the general consideration to which we referred earlier. It is unjust and unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to commence proceedings before the contingency is fulfilled. If an action is commenced before that date, it will fail if the events so transpire that it becomes clear that no loss is, or will be, incurred. Moreover, the plaintiff will run the risk that damages will be estimated on a contingency basis, in which event the compensation awarded may not fully compensate consequences which would follow from an adoption of the view for which the appellants contend outweigh the strength of the argument that the principle applicable to the cases in which the plaintiff acquires property (or a chose in action) should be extended to cases where an agreement subjects the plaintiff to a contingent loss. In such cases, it is fair and sensible to say that the plaintiff does not incur loss until the contingency is fulfilled. 
       
      
    27   This passage follows discussion under the heading “The concept of loss or damage in the context of misrepresentation”, at 527-33, and should be understood within this context. In relation to the claims of the plaintiffs I am of the view that notwithstanding the authority with which their Honours spoke, the effect of relying on the Limitation Act as contended for is not established in concept or in detail by their Honours’ conclusions. In my reading their Honours did not express disapproval of the remarks of Dunn LJ in Forster v. Outred & Co [1982] 1 WLR 86 at 89 which their Honours cited at 529. They made this observation regarding the basis on which that decision was explicable, and the observation is not inconsistent with approval: “The decision in Forster v. Outred & Co is explicable by reference to the immediate effect of the execution of the mortgage on the value of the plaintiffs’ equity of redemption, an aspect of the case to which Dunn LJ attached particular importance.” Lord Justices Dunn, at 100, and Stephenson, at 98, regarded executing the mortgage as reducing the value of the mortgagor’s interest in the property. It may be that the significance of these elements depends on an actual showing of reduction in value flowing from registration of a mortgage to secure a contingent liability where the contingency has not yet happened. Their Honours’ observations, at 175 CLR 533, on the practical consequence of the alternate views of the accrual date where an agreement subjects plaintiff to a contingent loss may have been intended to refer generally to tort claims, but they were directed to the meaning and effect of s 82(1) of the Trade Practices Act. 
    28   In Kenny & Good Pty Ltd v. MGICA (1992) Ltd (1999) 73 ALJR 901 at 918, [85]-[86], Gummow J made an observation which appears to indicate openness to review of accrual dates in relation to the facts of particular cases. Of the observation in Wardley at 527 that “[t]he kind of economic loss which is sustained and the time when it is first sustained depend upon the nature of the interest infringed and, perhaps, the nature of the interference to which it is subjected”, his Honour said “[t]hese propositions apply with equal force to the tort of negligence and to this case”. Justice Gummow’s observation favours close examination of particular facts rather than generalisation.  
    29   It is also necessary to consider views expressed by the Court of Appeal in another statutory context in Christopolous v. Angelos (1996) 41 NSWLR 700 and Registrar General v. Cleaver (1996) 41 NSWLR 713 and the decisions at first instance of Wood v. Wood (1997) 149 ALR 301 (Tamberlin J) and Tanna v. Deutsche Bank (Asia AG) (unreported, SC(NSW), Hodgson J, 5 September 1996). In Tanna, at 40, Hodgson J distinguished Forster v. Outred. As the relevant mortgage in Tanna replaced previously existing mortgages I would think that it could not have had any adverse impact on value. 
    30   Counsel on both sides of these proceedings put forward a number of possible events which might satisfy the test in Wardley; Mr Boscawen’s counsel referred to registration of the mortgage, its impact on value, obtaining legal advice about it (which would have to be paid for), the impact of the contingent liability on the accounts of the plaintiffs and consequent possible adverse impacts on their affairs including their capacity to borrow, and events in January 1990 when there was a default by Girvan Australia, a Receiver was appointed and the plaintiffs were notified of this. Notice of the appointment of the Receiver was given by correspondence dated 14 February 1990 (Ex AB). There were later notices expressly calling in money dated 18 April 1990. Correspondence in Ex AC shows that possible adverse outcomes of the guarantees were the subject of concern, consideration and legal advice on the part of the plaintiffs before 4 March 1990. Clayton Utz’s counsel pointed to later events at which he said the contingency of loss was fulfilled, the latest being the sale of the security property in 1998. There was a further contention which I understood to be to the effect that no loss had accrued to Maronis if, as it claims, the mortgage was in fact held on trust for it. 
    31   The outcome of the prospective limitation question cannot be seen in a sufficiently clear way to justify its being treated as a discretionary element in favour of setting aside service of the cross-claim. 
    32   If Mr Boscawen established a defence under s 26(1)(b) of the Limitation Act he would not thereby defeat all the grounds upon which cross-claimants’ claims are prima facie supportable. There are claims on equitable principles that the cross-claimants and cross-defendant have come under a common liability as a result of breaches of fiduciary duties arising from their various relationships with the plaintiffs; there does not appear to be any statutory limitation period for those claims and in an attempt to apply the Limitation Act by analogy the time at which potential liability could be taken to have come home to a claimant by enforcement would be worthy of consideration as the accrual date. 
    33   Mr Boscawen’s counsel also put forward as a discretionary consideration that the cross-claimants when applying ex parte for leave to file cross-claims did not make full disclosure appropriate to such applications. The basis of this was that at the time of the application the potential limitation problems were not referred to. In my opinion the applicants were doing no more than seeking to overcome provisions in the Rules of Court which limit the time to file cross-claims and came under no obligation to review fully for my information what potential defences there were, whether Limitation Act defences or otherwise. The applications related only to leave to file cross-claims out of time, and if I had adverted to the possibility of a serious limitation problem that would not have deflected me from extending time, because the cross-defendant’s opportunity to rely on that defence is not affected by grant of leave: see Limitation Act s 74. 
    34   A further matter which was said to be relevant to the exercise of discretion is the effect of a release which Mr Boscawen alleges was given to him on 19 September 1990, and purportedly executed for GNZ by Mr Currie who then held office as its Executive Chairman. It was said that it is an arguable contention as a matter of construction that the release, according to its terms a general release by GNZ, was also a release by Maronis. That contention is not borne out in any way by its terms, or by any other evidence which might affect its construction, and on the evidence now before me I see no prospect that the release might protect Mr Boscawen from claims by Maronis. It could well afford him protection against claims by GNZ, but this depends on further evidence to be adduced on the actual or ostensible authority of Mr Currie to make such an arrangement and, I should add as the facts were not conceded, whether Mr Currie indeed did make the arrangement and whether the document is authentic. It also seems possible that some evidence of the circumstances in which the arrangement was made may lead to a restriction of the prima facie unlimited release granted by its terms.  
    35   Mr Boscawen’s counsel built a structure of argument on this document to the effect that under the law of New Zealand liability of a tortfeasor to make contribution is extinguished if a concurrent tortfeasor obtains a release from the plaintiff. This argument depends on accepting that the document of 19 September 1990 operates as a release, which proposition has difficulties mentioned above. Counsel referred to Brooks v. NZ Garden Trust Co [1994] 2 NZLR 134 at 138, 140 and Allison v. KPMG Peat Marwick [2000] 1 NZLR 560 at 597, 599, 604. Those decisions establish for New Zealand a rule different to that established for Australia by Thompson v. Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 574. In New Zealand the release of one joint tortfeasor releases all joint tortfeasors. However, the New Zealand rule relates to only joint tortfeasors, not concurrent tortfeasors. In Allison v. KPMG (at 597) Tipping J stated that it is “… long-established, settled and sound principle that a release of one concurrent tortfeasor does not release another concurrent tortfeasor …”. It was also contended that an effect of the release is that Mr Boscawen no longer has a co-ordinate liability and that there is no basis to activate the equity of contribution among persons subject to a co-ordinate liability; counsel referred to Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v. Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 38 NSWLR 116 at 119-24ff and to Gye v. Davies (1995) 37 NSWLR 421 at 427. Again this structure depends on the effect of the release, which cannot be clearly seen. 
    36   A further matter put forward for consideration by Mr Boscawen’s counsel relates only to the Third Cross-claim. It was contended to the effect that damages recoverable in tort by the plaintiffs against the Third Cross-claimants would be reduced having regard to contributory negligence and that the conduct of Mr Boscawen as an officer of the plaintiffs should and would be treated as contributory negligence of the plaintiffs, and would operate to reduce their recovery against the Third Cross-claimant. It was then said that it is most unlikely that an award of contribution would be made against Mr Boscawen in favour of the Third Cross-claimant because any findings made against him would be attributed to the plaintiffs and would go in reduction of the primary award, so that also to allow contribution against Mr Boscawen would give double protection. It was said that this effect was contemplated by the Court of Appeal in Daniels v. Anderson (1995) 37 NSWLR 438 at 578-80. 
    37   A decision on what contribution is just and equitable must be based on what in detail are eventually found to be contributory negligence of plaintiffs and concurrent torts of Clayton Utz and Mr Boscawen. I do not think that the outcome for which counsel contended could be regarded as certain. In my view it is unlikely, having regard to the decision of the High Court in Astley v. Austrust Ltd (1999) 73 ALJR 403, that there would be a reduction for contributory negligence if the plaintiffs were to succeed against Clayton Utz; the likely outcome would be that Clayton Utz would be found liable both in contract and in tort, and would not be entitled to a reduction for any contributory negligence. 
    38   The Amended Fourth Cross-claim brought by Mr Ambler and the Fifth Cross-claim brought by Mr Duncan are not based on the same grounds as the Third Cross-claim. They have been sued for the tort of deceit, and for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, and do not plead contributory negligence. Submissions by Clayton Utz’s counsel relating to concurrent tort liability do not arise. Mr McGrath, solicitor, representing the Fourth Cross-claimant took as his primary position the contention that Mr Boscawen cannot bring the present application after filing an appearance. He also presented an argument in detail about the effect of the release document. He referred to observations of Kitto J in Albion Insurance v. Government Insurance Office (1969) 121 CLR 342 at 350 relating to the basis in natural justice of contribution where there are co-ordinate liabilities, and contended that it would not accord with natural justice to allow a generally worded release of one co-surety to defeat contribution by others. He also made observations pointing to characteristics in which the claim against Mr Boscawen is related to New South Wales. Mr Hopkins, solicitor, representing Mr Duncan did not present a separate argument. 
    39   Mr Boscawen did not put in issue on this application any matter of detail relating to the merits of his own conduct and involvement in the transaction. However, counsel put forward considerations relating to Mr Boscawen’s personal circumstances. Mr Boscawen is now, and was at the time of the events a resident of New Zealand, and the events occurred in the course of his holding office in New Zealand companies. Counsel observed that if Pt 10 r 1A(f) is within State legislative power, it is at the tenuous end of the spectrum of power. While it was not submitted and I do not hold that r 1A(f) is beyond the legislative power of the State, I do regard its operation as, in counsel’s words, at the tenuous end of the spectrum of power when it operates with an alleged liability to make contribution under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in relation to concurrent torts, one committed within New South Wales and the other in New Zealand. The claim of jurisdiction made to support the proceedings against Mr Boscawen does appear to me to be an extreme one, although, in the amplitude of legislative power, I have not been asked to hold that it was excessive. As counsel pointed out, Mr Boscawen is brought to litigate in New South Wales ultimately because the plaintiffs which are themselves New Zealand companies have come to New South Wales and sued persons here over events and land titles which were located in New South Wales, and Mr Boscawen is alleged to have been in breach of duties to those companies by acts and omissions in New Zealand concurrent with the events in which they sue. Counsel submitted that there is no obvious connection between the transaction in which he took place which is the subject matter of the proceedings against him, and New South Wales and its territory. In my view there is a connection but it is a tenuous connection. 
    40   Mr Boscawen’s personal circumstances were narrated in his affidavit. He operates a shopping centre which is going through troubled times and requires his personal attendance to its management. Counsel contended, in my view obviously correctly, that an absence of some months for a trial in New South Wales would be highly prejudicial to his economic position. Mr Boscawen also has personal family obligations for the care of his elderly parents. If he is involved in the hearing of these proceedings, which can be expected to take in the order of 8 or 10 weeks, his attendance in Australia will be required for most if not all of the period of the trial and extensive period of preparation beforehand. He will not be concerned in much of what takes place at the hearing. This will bear very heavily on a person who lives in New Zealand, as he will find it difficult to attend to his personal affairs while in Australia, with a degree of difficulty much greater than would be experienced by litigants whose homes are here. The hearing will be very long and very expensive. Adding him as a party will give the hearing an additional dimension of complexity; it is already extremely complex, and management of the hearing with procedural justice will be difficult. Much time will be spent on issues which do not involve him, or do so indirectly, yet his attention and that of his legal representatives must always be maintained. The burden of prejudice upon him of involvement in the litigation and its extended hearing is severe. He is available in New Zealand to be sued for contribution there if any party wishes to pursue him there. The litigation here was on foot for well over five years before he was involved in it as a cross-defendant. 
    41   Mr Boscawen’s joinder came after he made affidavits in support of the plaintiffs which identified him as a witness on whom the plaintiffs rely, followed after an interval of several years by other litigants joining him as a party, on bases which had been available from the first in 1994, but were not brought forward until after he was identified as a witness and when the hearing was approaching. These events to my mind wear a very unfortunate appearance; the appearance is that he was left out of the litigation for years and he appeared to be a relatively minor figure in the litigation, a company secretary and officer of subsidiary companies, but then he was joined when he was identified as a witness, and after a period of deliberation. The sources of prejudice to Clayton Utz’s position associated with requiring that any contribution claim be brought against him in New Zealand referred to were: there would have to be separate proceedings in New Zealand; the parties would not be bound by findings in these proceedings and Clayton Utz would be faced with the need to prove that they were liable to the plaintiffs; and Clayton Utz would risk losing the benefit of the time at which the present cross-claim was filed for the purposes of limitation statutes. 
    42   The burden to be placed on Mr Boscawen as a litigant is even heavier than the heavy burden imposed on other individual litigants who reside in New South Wales, who are amenable to service within the jurisdiction as of right, and have had longer involvement. The long interval of time, over ten years, between the events and his joinder in the proceedings adds considerably to his burden of prejudice in preparing to meet and in meeting those claims. He cannot be active in two places at once or divide his attention for months at a time, and if he chooses not to be here, but to attend to his other concerns at home, he will be at a disadvantage which other litigants will not bear. None of the advantages or conveniences of deciding the case here will accrue to him. For the court to exercise over him its extended jurisdiction under Pt 10 would be quite oppressive, in my judgment, and the court should not do that. 
    43   The discretionary circumstances relating to the projected outcome of various issues have served to illustrate some few of the complexities of the litigation, but I would not act on them to grant this application. I act on the ground of the personal circumstances to which I have referred and will grant Mr Boscawen’s application. 
    44   On the Notice of Motion of John Spencer Boscawen, a Cross-defendant, filed 5 May 2000 order:(1) Pursuant to Pt 10 r 6A of the Supreme Court Rules that service of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Cross-claims on John Spencer Boscawen be set aside.(2) Order that the Third, Fourth and Fifth Cross-claimants pay John Spencer Boscawen’s costs of the Notice of Motion and of the Cross-claims.

     REGINA v Lily SAAVEDRA 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is an application for leave to appeal out of time and application for leave to appeal in relation to a sentence passed upon the applicant by his Honour Judge Graham in the District Court on 1 April 1999. 
     
      
    2    Before his Honour the applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge laid pursuant to s 233B(1)(cb) of the Customs Act (Commonwealth) 1901 alleging that she and a number of others had conspired to import into Australia a prohibited import, namely cocaine. The quantity of the proposed importation of cocaine was no less than fifty kilograms. That amount meant that the maximum penalty which could be imposed pursuant to s 235(1)(c)(i) of the Customs Act is imprisonment for life; disjunctively that section provides also for such other period as the Court thinks fit. Accordingly the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty stands high in the criminal calendar of this country. 
     
      
    3    His Honour imposed a head sentence of seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years six months, the sentence to date from 16 November 1998 the date upon which the applicant was apprehended on her return to this country from South America. 
     
      
    4    I turn then to the background facts in the matter. The conspiracy to import fifty kilograms of cocaine was originally hatched in early 1997 by two persons, namely one Ian Cox and another Michael Reardan. They agreed to import the said fifty kilograms of cocaine into this country, their intention being to smuggle it in a container of Chilean wine. Certain steps were then undertaken and two matters which already existed put the conspiracy into effect. 
     
      
    5    As time went by others joined the conspiracy including one Douglas Crombie and Crombie's wife, Cynthia, who, like the present applicant, was born in South America. Cynthia Crombie was a friend of the applicant with whom at one stage of her life she had shared a house in this country. 
     
      
    6    The conspirators by September 1997, while as I have said, having taken certain steps to put their conspiracy into effect, had a problem: they had no cocaine. Crombie approached the applicant whose husband was at the time in South America and that approach resulted in the applicant advising Crombie that she had located a supplier for the drugs in Bolivia. 
     
      
    7    I have taken that statement of fact directly from his Honour Judge Graham's remarks on sentence. In fact that was quite a kind finding because one looks at admissions made in a statement of 30 December 1998 by the applicant where she said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In September 1997, I remember Douglas Crombie arrived at my house at 10 Bellamy Street, Pennant Hills. Doug asked for Juan and stated that he wanted to talk ‘business’ with him. I knew the term ‘business’ was in reference to drugs/cocaine. 
        
       
       
        
        Juan was in Bolivia at the time and I told Doug that he was lucky at that time because I had received a call from Bolivia some time ago in relation to a supply of cocaine. Doug thought that this was good news and clapped his hands in excitement. The call that I had received from Bolivia was from Pedro who is a relation of my brother’s wife.” 
        
       
      
    8    The applicant then gave Crombie a telephone number of her brother in Bolivia. His Honour quite rightly on that information observed that there was nothing to suggest her willingness to be involved was anything other than whole hearted. 
     
      
    9    Time went by and arrangements for the fulfilment of the conspiracy continued. Crombie approached the applicant again in September 1997 and confirmed the supply of drugs. She told him she spoke to her South American contacts and confirmed the drugs were available. 
     
      
    10    Shortly thereafter, namely October 1997, the conspirators Reardan and Douglas Crombie and another conspirator Haydee Diaz met in South America. Problems apparently occurred in the contact made by the conspirators with the proposed South American suppliers. Those problems resulted in a telephone conversation taking place between Reardan, Crombie and the applicant; Reardan and Crombie ringing from South America. 
     
      
    11    As counsel for the applicant has rightly submitted today that conversation contained threatening overtones. As a consequence of that conversation the applicant left this country on 8 November 1997 to seek to continue to endeavour to obtain the supply of the subject drugs. 
     
      
    12    I should add that his Honour in his findings made it plain that he was of the view that the terms of that telephone conversation were threatening and that her continued participation in the scheme was not as whole hearted as it had been at the outset. 
     
      
    13    The long and short of the matter was that despite her efforts and those of Reardan and Crombie in South America, the conspiracy failed, Crombie returning to this country on 14 November 1997 where he was arrested shortly thereafter. 
     
      
    14    The other conspirator, Reardan, returned on 21 November 1997. All those conspirators, I might say, have been apprehended and, indeed, have been dealt with by the courts. The manner of the courts dealing with Crombie is one of the subject matters of this very application. 
     
      
    15    The applicant then remained in South America until November 1998 when she returned to this country. She was arrested at the airport on her return. Again it was rightly submitted that she must have been aware that her return would lead to her apprehension. 
     
      
    16    These facts are indicative that the applicant's participation in the conspiracy was not that of a mere courier or a person low down in the scale. Her participation was vital to the conspiracy being put into effect, she being the person who could make contact with persons in South American who were prepared to supply cocaine to the conspirators. 
     
      
    17    The fact that the conspiracy failed does not affect sentencing principles which are to be applied. 
     
      
    18    His Honour in a very careful analysis of the objective and subjective facts of the matter took fully into account the assistance which the applicant had provided to authorities following her apprehension. 
     
      
    19    His Honour also had before him, as I would understand his judgment, a copy of the remarks on sentence made by his Honour Judge Shillington QC when he sentenced the three other conspirators, namely Cynthia and Douglas Crombie and Haydee Diaz. 
     
      
    20    His Honour Judge Graham in carrying out the exercise concerning parity characterised the assistance provided by Douglas Crombie as being of a higher order while not deprecating the assistance given by the applicant. 
     
      
    21    Indeed, when one examines a table very helpfully provided by counsel for the applicant one sees that the applicant had she not provided assistance would have been sentenced to a head sentence of twelve years with a nine year non-parole period and making allowance for past assistance in accordance with s 21E that would be reduced to a head sentence of nine years and six and a half years non-parole period and then when future assistance is taken into account the sentence is further reduced to seven years with four and a half years non-parole period. 
     
      
    22    Douglas Crombie, when sentenced by Judge Shillington, would have received a head sentence of fifteen years with a twelve year non-parole period and for past assistance his Honour reduced that to twelve years with nine years non-parole period and for future assistance a further discount was made to eight years head sentence with five years non-parole period. 
     
      
    23    Similar discounts were made in the case of Cynthia Crombie whose sentence was head sentence of six years with three and a half years non-parole period. 
     
      
    24    From my reading of his Honour Judge Shillington's remarks on sentence and also those of Judge Graham in this case, I am of the view that Cynthia Crombie's participation in the conspiracy was of a lesser degree than that of the present applicant. I would also agree that Douglas Crombie's participation was at a higher level than that of the applicant. 
     
      
    25    Accordingly, on behalf of the applicant, it is put that the small disparity between the ultimate sentence passed upon Douglas Crombie and that passed upon the applicant could give rise to the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    26    In that regard reliance was placed upon Regina v Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 686 and R v Postiglione (1997) 189 CLR 295. At 301 Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based in an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated.” 
        
       
      
    27    In this Court in Regina v Doggett, unreported, 24 March 1997 Mr Justice Sully, with whom I agreed, advanced the following pithy test relating to the concept of justifiable sense of grievance where he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is, I think, important to establish at the outset some essential principles. Unless two co-offenders receive absolutely identical treatment in terms of their sentences, the one who is the more severely treated will always feel, human nature being what it is, that he has been unjustly treated, and that he is entitled to feel a sense of grievance accordingly. That, of course, is not sufficient for the establishment of a parity appeal point. What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is, not that he feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened, would see that his sense of grievance is a justified one."" 
        
       
      
    28    As I said, I agree with Justice Sully's statement on principle. 
     
      
    29    Here counsel for the applicant has relied upon four discrete differences between the circumstances of Douglas Crombie and the present applicant. 
     
      
    30    They are: 
     
      
       
      1. that Crombie had a record which was very much worse than that of the applicant. I should add that is entirely true and a matter which the Judge took into account; 
       
       
      2. it was put that Crombie had been involved in the conspiracy for a longer period of time. Again, that is true and again, his Honour dealt fully with that; 
       
       
      3. it was put that Crombie was to receive a share of five kilograms of the imported cocaine in return for his services to the conspiracy whereas there was no evidence of any benefit to the applicant for her involvement in the conspiracy. It is fair to say that counsel conceded in his written submissions that his Honour observed that he could infer that her involvement would not be without reward. 
       
       
      4. It was put that the applicant's voluntary return to Australia in November 1998 was in circumstances that she well knew she could be arrested on her return whereas Crombie was not aware. 
       
      
    31    All those four matters were fully taken into account by his Honour when he was carrying out the exercise of comparison necessary to fully consider the question of parity. 
     
      
    32    There is no identifiable error to which counsel for the applicant can point in the manner in which his Honour carried out his sentencing task. 
     
      
    33    There is, again as counsel rightly conceded, one disparate feature between the case of Douglas Crombie and the applicant which is not favourable to the applicant's case and that is the categorisation of Crombie's assistance to authorities as being at a higher level than that of the applicant. The importance of that distinction, I believe, is illustrated by the comparison between head sentence and non-parole periods to which I adverted earlier in these reasons. 
     
      
    34    Having considered the matter in terms of Lowe, Postiglione and Doggett I am of the view that when those features are viewed objectively the applicant could not be said to have a justifiable sense of grievance. Accordingly, I am of the view that the parity argument cannot succeed. 
     
      
    35    Because of the seriousness of the matter I would grant the applicant leave to appeal out of time; grant her leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    36    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
     
      
    37    ADAMS J: I also agree. 
     
      
       
      
    38    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal out of time; 
       
      2. Grant leave to appeal; 
       
      3. Appeal dismissed.

     REGINA v Reiner AUSSEM 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is an appeal brought by the Crown against the alleged inadequacy of sentence passed by Williams DCJ in the District Court on 15 December 1999 and a cross-appeal brought by the respondent on the basis that error had occurred in his Honour’s remarks on sentence particularly relating to the imposition of the head sentence. 
     
      
    2    The facts of the matter may be simply expressed in so far as the commission of the relevant offences is concerned. The respondent was apprehended at Sydney airport on 23 May 1999 and found to be carrying on his body a powdered substance which weighed some 4.666 kilograms which on analysis was revealed to contain pure cocaine in the weight of 2.96 kilograms. 
     
      
    3    The offence charged was that the respondent had offended s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) in that he had brought in a quantity of cocaine which was not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine. 
     
      
    4    The respondent, who is of German extraction, had been living in South America for a number of years and the source of the cocaine was in South America. Once he was apprehended the respondent proceeded to co-operate fully with the Customs authorities. 
     
      
    5    That co-operation included the respondent being placed at personal risk, he having conversations with one of the conspirators to the importation which were recorded by way of a recording device on his body. A matter obviously leading to great personal hazards as far as the respondent is concerned. 
     
      
    6    Suffice it for me to say that as a consequence of his co-operation the contact man in Australia for the operation, one Sergio Daniel Irusta, was apprehended. Not only apprehended but has now pleaded guilty and was sentenced on 14 April this year in the District Court to a head sentence of six years with a non parole period of four years. 
     
      
    7    The head of the operations in South America, on the evidence before Judge Williams, who is known variously as either Nunez or Varillas has been extradited from South America and this Court understands he is proposing to plead guilty before the District Court on 7 and 8 August next. 
     
      
    8    Pursuant to s 21E of the Crimes Act Cth the respondent has promised to give evidence in relation to those sentence proceedings. His promise, I might say, was more widespread, being an undertaking to give evidence against Irusta and Varillas (Nunez) even if the matter had gone to a full trial. It may be seen at once that the past assistance given by the respondent was considerable. Equally his promise of future assistance by way of giving evidence is not an inconsequential matter. 
     
      
    9    I turn then to the sentence which was imposed by Williams DCJ. His Honour, in the course of his remarks on sentence, in setting the head sentence of eight years adverted to the co-operation which has been given by the respondent to the law enforcement agencies. Not only that, he took into account the plea of guilty and the fact that the respondent has pulmonary difficulties of some moment. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that taking all these factors into account and making the appropriate deduction under s 16G and taking into account the questions of general deterrence and the like the appropriate head sentence in this matter is one of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years. 
        
       
       
      His Honour then went on to say: 
       
       
        
        “I discount the non-parole period by fifty per cent for future assistance and there will therefore be a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 23 May 1999. He will therefore be eligible for release on parole on 22 November in the year 2001.” 
        
       
      
    10    The Crown submits that his Honour in dealing with the matter, while bound to take into account under the Commonwealth legislation any future assistance which the respondent had undertaken to give to authorities, erred in dealing with the matter by making a single deduction of fifty percent from the non-parole period of five years.  
     
      
    11    It should be noted that this Court in Regina v Wong in determining the appropriate guidelines in dealing with matters of this type recommended that a head sentence of eight to twelve years was appropriate for a case involving a breach of s 233(1)(b) of the Customs Act where the quantity of cocaine being a commercial quantity was between 2 and 3.5 kilograms. 
     
      
    12    That range being eight to twelve years it seems to me that his Honour did in fact err in dealing with the question of discount for future assistance. 
     
      
    13    As I have said it is plain from s 21E that he was obliged so to do and when one examines the authorities dealing with assistance given involving the Customs Act it was appropriate for his Honour to make a discount for future assistance. 
     
      
    14    Where I believe his Honour was wrong is that his Honour made a single deduction and related that single deduction to the non-parole period which he had set and, in my view, correctly set having regard to the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence. 
     
      
    15    Further, I am of the view that a discount of fifty percent for future assistance was also a matter of error. Plainly enough the past assistance given by the respondent was assistance of a type which demanded a substantial discount. 
     
      
    16    We do not know (and there is no criticism that can be made of his Honour for not so stating) what head sentence his Honour would have imposed prior to making a discount. In view of the quantity of cocaine which was almost three kilos, it is reasonable to assume that without discounting the head sentence imposed would have been the high end of the range for offences of this type as indicated in this Court’s judgment in Wong. 
     
      
    17    What, in my view, his Honour should have done was to make a discrete discount from the head sentence for future assistance and to make a discount in the same figure from the non-parole period that otherwise would have been set. It is for these reasons that I have concluded that his Honour fell into error and this Court should interfere. 
     
      
    18    Submissions were made that if this Court were to interfere, we should take into account a number of factors including a deterioration in the health of the respondent since his incarceration and evidence has been proffered to this Court that that in fact is the case. 
     
      
    19    However, in his remarks on sentence his Honour did in my view fully, take into account the health problems suffered by the respondent and in my view there is no change in the basis upon which his health problems should be taken into account in redetermining sentence. 
     
      
    20    A submission was also made that in the light of the sentence imposed upon Irusta, the respondent would have a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the fact that it was his efforts which led to Irusta’s apprehension and if this Court were to increase his sentence in any way either by way of non-parole period or by way of head sentence thus a justifiable sense of grievance would be had by the respondent. 
     
      
    21    However, the fact is that Irusta did not in fact get his hands upon any cocaine and, indeed, may I say at the moment the sentence imposed in the District Court is the subject of appeal to this Court. 
     
      
    22    Accordingly, I do not believe this is a case, if this Court were to interfere and increase either the head sentence or non-parole period, that the respondent would feel a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    23    Looking at the matter in this light, I am of the view that this Court should interfere and I am of the view that the head sentence of eight years imposed by his Honour should be discounted by twenty-five percent that is reduced to six years. The consequential non-parole period of four years which would follow upon the imposition of such a head sentence should, in my view, be further discounted by twenty-five percent which gives rise to a sentence of three years. 
     
      
    24    In so doing I have taken into account the principles of double jeopardy. Had I not taken those principles into account, I would myself have imposed, if dealing with the matter afresh, a much more significant sentence but, having taken into account as I have said matters of double jeopardy, I am of the view that a sentence of the type which I have indicated should be imposed. 
     
      
    25    I propose the following sentencing orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal upheld. 
       
       
      2. Sentence of his Williams DCJ of 15 December 1999 be set aside and in lieu thereof a head sentence of six years be substituted for the head sentence of eight years. A non-parole period of three years be substituted in lieu of the non-parole period of two years six months. The non-parole period would commence on 23 May 1999 and expire on 22 May 2002. 
       
      
    26    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree and confirm, for the purposes of s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 that, but for the future assistance offered by the respondent to the Crown, the sentence which would have been imposed would have been a head sentence of eight years and a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
    27    ADAMS J: I agree with the orders proposed and with Newman J’s reasons for them. 
     
      
    28    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are as indicated by Newman J.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant seeks to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by her Honour Judge Backhouse QC on 5 November 1999. The Applicant pleaded not guilty to a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of prohibited imports, namely 3.5739 kilograms of pure cocaine, being a commercial quantity for purposes of the Customs Act 1901. He was found guilty after a trial by jury. Her Honour sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for a term of eleven years, with a non-parole period of six and a half years commencing on 22 December 1996, being the day on which he was taken into custody. 
     
      
    2    The thrust of the Applicant's submissions was that he had a justifiable sense of grievance in that his sentence revealed, it was alleged, a marked disparity with the sentences imposed upon other persons who were involved in the criminal enterprise. The Applicant referred to the well-known principles considered by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglioni v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. 
     
      
    3    Between 19 September 1966 and 3 January 1997, some twenty-three envelopes containing a quantity of fifty-eight plastic folders impregnated with 3.5739 kilograms of pure cocaine were sent to various addresses in Australia. This had occurred pursuant to a contact originally made between a Mr Castro-Vargas, a resident of Columbia, and a registered police informer known as ""Warren"". Over time, the Columbian end of the arrangement was taken over by a person called Morris. The envelopes had been addressed to various addresses in Australia set up by Warren at the direction of the National Crime Authority (“NCA”). All of the cocaine was intercepted by the NCA. After interception, the NCA used some of the envelopes as a controlled delivery sample in order to apprehend the participants in the scheme. The controlled delivery sample consisted of twelve plastic folders impregnated with 655.2 grams of pure cocaine. 
     
      
    4    Her Honour considered a wide range of factors in the course of coming to her decision as to the appropriate sentence. She referred both to the objective circumstances of the offence and also to a number of subjective circumstances of the Applicant to which it is unnecessary to refer again. No complaint is made as to these various facts and matters to which her Honour had regard. 
     
      
    5    The thrust of the submissions was that the result involved a manifest disparity with the other sentences. It was suggested that her Honour committed a legal error in refusing to take into account questions of parity, at least with respect to one of the co-offenders and, it was submitted, others. 
     
      
    6    It is clear that her Honour accepted the significance of the identification of the particular role which the Applicant played in the scheme. She concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was the chemist who was sent to Australia for the purpose of extracting the cocaine from the plastic folders."" 
        
       
      
    7    This was a crucial finding because the role of the chemist was a vital one in the scheme as a whole. It represented a very high order of criminality and was a fact entitled to significant weight in the sentencing process. Her Honour reached this conclusion after rejecting the evidence given to her on oath by the Applicant and also after rejecting a range of submissions directed at qualifying in various ways the clear admissions made by the Applicant in recorded conversations and also qualifying the objective facts of the steps taken by him. 
     
      
    8    Her Honour was entitled to reach the conclusion that she did. It was amply supported by the evidence, including admissions in the first conversation that occurred after the Applicant arrived in Australia in which he said, in terms, that he was the chemist and had done the conversion many times before. There was other evidence to the effect that the Applicant gave directions regarding the nature and quantity of the chemicals and other materials required for the extraction process; which chemicals and materials were supplied in a large volume, much larger than required merely for the amount in the controlled parcel. That fact was a fact known to a person described as a chemist and not necessarily known to others. There was ample evidence to justify her Honour's firm conclusion and no challenge was made to that conclusion in this Court. 
     
      
    9    The centrality of the Applicant's role in the scheme was confirmed by the frequent contact he had with the Columbian principal about the progress of the work being conducted in Australia, contact of a frequency not manifest in the case of the others. 
     
      
    10    Counsel for the Applicant focused on a particular part of her Honour's remarks on sentence when she referred to the sentence that had been imposed on a Mr Cardona, another person involved in the scheme. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I accept the submission of Mr Chappel that there is no question of parity with Mr Cardona"". 
        
       
      
    11    The submission on behalf of the Appellant was to the effect that this indicated that her Honour refused to consider the sentence imposed on Cardona and, it was submitted, also Robertson, as in any way relevant to the sentencing task before her Honour. It was submitted that this constituted a legal error in accordance with the High Court's authorities on ""parity"". 
     
      
    12    Her Honour was referring to a submission of the Crown to which she had previously made reference in her reasons on sentence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Chappel who appeared on behalf of the Crown submitted as far as Mr Cardona is concerned there is no parity question at all and that I would not take Mr Cardona as a reference point. He reminded me that the difference between these two is that in the case of Mr Romero-Cepeda the court is dealing with a commercial quantity far in excess of the amount to do with Mr Cardona's case. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ... 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He submitted that the Cardona sentence is not particularly instructive and that here we are dealing with a commercial quantity without any mitigating circumstances... ."" 
        
       
      
    13    The reference in the submissions of the Crown before her Honour, as quoted above, to quantity, is a reference to the fact that the Applicant in these proceedings was, alone, charged with being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity. The other three participants in the scheme, to whose role I will presently refer, were each charged with being involved in the importation (in one case the supply) of the smaller amount of approximately 655 grams contained in the controlled delivery. The Applicant alone was charged with respect to the entirety of the importation, a differentiation which appears to have been based in part on the centrality of the Applicant's role in the scheme and, no doubt, on decisions by the Crown as to its ability to prove the involvement of the other participants in the overall scheme, as distinct from their involvement in the events associated with the controlled delivery. 
     
      
    14    It was submitted that the differentiation was artificial as, for example, evidence of the acts of the other offenders was admitted into evidence against the Applicant on the basis that there was a joint criminal enterprise. That does not, however, mean that the Crown was in a position to prove beyond reasonable doubt all elements of the offence alleged against the other participants with respect to the larger amount. I do not accept the proposition that there was any artificiality necessarily involved in the differentiation. In my opinion there is a very material difference between the two cases to which her Honour expressly referred, and indeed any other cases that, by inference, she may have been referring to. 
     
      
    15    Pursuant to s235(2) of the Customs Act 1901, the maximum sentence for importation of a commercial quantity is life imprisonment, whereas for a first offence of involvement with a trafficable quantity, the maximum sentence is imprisonment for a period of twenty-five years. On any view, the Applicant in this case fell to be sentenced in accordance with a different regime from other persons with respect to whom questions of parity have arisen. That does not mean that the end result in the other cases is irrelevant to the sentence in this case. 
     
      
    16    However, the involvement of Cardona, to whom particular reference was made in the passage of her Honour's reasons referred to, was of a lower level, although identification of his precise role was not the subject of any finding of fact by her Honour. The evidence and the submissions on behalf of the Applicant before her Honour included the suggestion that it was Cardona who was the chemist. This was a proposition her Honour firmly rejected. She was entitled to do so. The role of the chemist was vital to the scheme in a way not manifest with respect to the other participants. 
     
      
    17    Reading her Honour's reasons as a whole, I am of the view that when her Honour accepted the Crown submission ""there is no question of parity with Mr Cardona"", she was not intending to suggest that the sentence imposed on Cardona was irrelevant to the sentencing exercise before her Honour. She was using the word ""parity"" in the sense that the sentence imposed on the Applicant should not be equivalent or comparable with that imposed on Cardona. When I say ""comparable"" I mean of the same order of magnitude. The reason for that is their roles were not comparable and, as the passage from the submissions of counsel that appeared for the Crown before her Honour indicates, emphasis was placed on the fact that in one case a commercial quantity was involved and in the other, only a trafficable quantity. 
     
      
    18    There were three other persons involved in the enterprise who can loosely be referred to as ""co-offenders"", although none of them was charged with offences relating to the entirety of the importation and in that sense were not true co-offenders. 
     
      
    19    Mr Douglas Robertson was charged with supplying the amount of 655.2 grams, being a commercial quantity for the purposes of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). His role in the affair was to provide a shed on his farm property at which the clandestine laboratory was to be located. He was also involved in acts of transportation and other preparatory acts for the extraction of the cocaine. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years. His conviction was under a different Act. Furthermore, his case is distinguished by the fact he entered a guilty plea at the earliest possible opportunity and had given some assistance to the authorities, together with consent to a forfeiture order of property. 
     
      
    20    The combination of these various factors, and in particular in my opinion, the substantially greater amount of quantity of drugs involved in the offence of which the Applicant was convicted and the central role in the scheme played by the Applicant in comparison with that of Mr Robertson, means the Applicant can have no justifiable sense of grievance if he receives a substantially higher penalty than Robertson. 
     
      
    21    In the case of Cardona-Reinoso he, like the Applicant, pleaded not guilty and was accordingly not entitled to a discount in this regard. He was sentenced on the basis of not being the organiser or having any managerial role in the scheme. His criminality was of a lower order than that of the Applicant whose role as the chemist was vital to the success of the scheme. 
     
      
    22    It may be that some sense of grievance is harboured by the Applicant in this respect because of the failure of the authorities to charge the other persons, including Cardona, for their involvement with the entire quantity of drugs. That is not a sense of grievance which is justifiable in a relevant sense. Cardona was convicted of the same offence as the Applicant with respect to a substantially lower quantity of the drug, namely, about 655 grams as against 3.5 kilograms. The quantity of the drug is a central consideration in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The particular role of Cardona does not emerge with clarity, but her Honour was entitled to act on the basis that she did act, namely, that his role was of considerably lesser significance than that of the Applicant. Again in my opinion there is no justifiable sense of grievance with respect to the sentence imposed on Cardona. 
     
      
    23    The final case is that of Toro-Martinez whose role was established as the most minor of all. Originally her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace sentenced him to a period of three years and six months, with a non-parole period of two years. This Court has, however, increased the sentence to six years with a non-parole period of three years. 
     
      
    24    Toro-Martinez was charged with respect to being knowingly concerned in a trafficable quantity, namely the controlled delivery of some 655 grams. His role in the scheme was minor in comparison with that of the Applicant. 
     
      
    25    In my opinion, the Applicant can have no justifiable sense of grievance with respect to his sentence in comparison to that imposed on the other three persons who in some respects were co-offenders. 
     
      
    26    In the case of R v Wong and Leung (1999) 108 A Crim R 531 I set out in my judgment a range of sentences for this offence in various categories, including what was there described as a low range commercial quantity of 2 to 3.5 kilograms of cocaine. The amount involved in this case was slightly above this range. The sentences in New South Wales and other States for this offence are set out in Schedules 1.4 and 2.4 of that judgment (see at 566 and 568). I concluded that the general thrust of the sentences in the cases set out in the Schedules indicated sentences falling in the range of head sentences of eight to twelve years. (See Wong and Leung at 548.) Her Honour's sentence is well within that range, particularly considering the fact that the quantity involved is at the top, indeed slightly above, the amount referable to the range. The relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period is entirely appropriate. 
     
      
    27    In my view, her Honour's sentence was well within the discretion available to her Honour. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    28    NEWMAN J: I agree. 
     
      
    29    ADAMS J: I also agree. 
     
      
    30    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I have indicated.

     REGINA -v- HJS 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    2    IRELAND J: The appellant was indicted before his Honour Judge Grogan at the Parramatta District Court on 20 May, 1998 on ten counts of sexual assault upon his four daughters to whom I shall refer as [M], [D], [S] and [J]. 
     
      
    3    Five of these counts related to charges in contravention of S 67 of the Crimes Act, 1900 (the Act) being carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of ten years, which at the time of sentence carried a maximum penalty of penal servitude for life. 
     
      
    4    Three counts related to charges in contravention of S 76 of the Act, being sexual assault of a female under the age of sixteen years, which carried a maximum sentence of penal servitude for five years. 
     
      
    5    Two counts related to charges in contravention of S 72 of the Act, being assault a female above the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen years with intent to carnally know her, which offence carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for five years. 
     
      
    6    Counts 1, 2 and 4 related to daughter [M]; 
     
      
    7    counts 7, 8, 9 and 10 related to daughter [D]; 
     
      
    8    counts 2 and 6 related to daughter [J];  
     
      
    9    count 5 related to daughter [S]. 
     
      
    10    The trial aborted and the appellant was subsequently re-arraigned on the same charges on 25 May, 1998. 
     
      
    11    On 27 May, 1998 leave was granted to amend certain dates alleged in counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10, the charges remaining the same. 
     
      
    12    On 11 June, 1998 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on each of the ten counts. 
     
      
    13    On 26 June, 1998 Grogan DCJ sentenced the appellant in respect of each of the charges. Leave is not sought to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    14    The Crown case, as summarised in Crown submissions “A” alleged the following facts. 
     
      
    15    Counts 7, 8, 9 and 10 relate to the complainant [D], who was the youngest child of the family. She was born on 8 February, 1972 and grew up in the family home at Ermington. The family was comprised of the four daughters, a son, the appellant and his wife. The appellant and his wife slept in one bedroom and the five children would alternate in bedrooms two and three. 
     
      
    16    The complainant [D] did not have a good relationship with the appellant. The first incident she complained of occurred when she was about six years old. On this occasion, she came home from school after her mother had just left the house. She was wearing her school uniform. The appellant entered the kitchen, where she was washing up. He pulled her backwards towards the dining room table and sat her on a chair. He requested her to get his penis out, but she refused. The appellant grabbed her hand and tried to get her to undo his zipper. The appellant undid his own zipper and exposed himself to her. He lifted her off the chair and sat on the chair himself. He pulled her underpants down and rubbed her vagina with his finger, he also penetrated her with his fingers and said that he wanted her to get wet. These events were the basis of count 7. 
     
      
    17    The complainant started struggling and her underpants fell off onto the floor. The appellant used both of his hands to lift her onto his legs. He used his fingers to direct his erect penis into her vagina. She tried to get away. His penis entered her vagina and she told him it was hurting. He let her off his lap, the complainant picked up her underpants and ran into her room and put them back on. She observed blood on her underpants after this. She stayed in her room until her mother came home, but she did not tell her mother what happened (count 8).  
     
      
    18    When the complainant [D] was nine years old, she was watching television and was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. The appellant came into the lounge-room and then took her into his bedroom. He put her on the bed and pulled down her shorts and underpants. She tried to pull her t-shirt down to cover herself and the appellant said, “Oh, don’t do that, I’ve seen it all before” and pulled her t-shirt away from her. She was lying on her back and he lay on top of her, forcing her legs apart with his knees. He penetrated her with his penis and then said words like “Try this” or “Want to do this”. He rolled the complainant onto her stomach and attempted to penetrate her again, without success. He rolled the complainant onto her back and penetrated her again. The complainant felt a wet sensation on her stomach, when the appellant rolled off. She retrieved her clothes, put them back on, and spent the rest of the afternoon out of the house (count 9). 
     
      
    19    When [D] was aged about eleven years, she was at her aunt’s house at Kurrajong. On a Sunday afternoon, the appellant came to collect her to return to Ermington for school on Monday. The complainant asked the appellant to unlock the back door of the car, so she could sit there, however, an argument ensued as to where she was to sit. Eventually she was allowed to sit in the back seat. As they were driving, the complainant realised they were not going home, but were on a side track. The appellant stopped the car and opened the back door. He dragged the complainant by the ankles and placed her flat on the seat. The appellant stood by the doorway of the car and undid his trousers and took out his penis. He lay on top of the complainant in the car and tried to penetrate her with his penis. He then said words to the effect “Oh shit. Just keep your head down. Don’t move”. He stood up and did up the zipper of his trousers. He resumed the position in the driver’s seat and told the complainant not to lift her head up. He then drove home. The complainant did not tell her mother about that incident (count 10). 
     
      
    20    The complainant [M] was born on 18 August, 1966 and was the second youngest daughter of the appellant. There were two older sisters, [S] and [J], and a brother who was born in between the older sisters. The brother was a slow learner who attended a special school. The complainant [M] also did not have a good relationship with the appellant. The complainant’s earliest memory of being abused was when she was about four or five years old. She was playing in the backyard with her brother, when the appellant came out of the house and called the brother into a shed at the rear of the premises. The brother went into the shed and after a while the complainant went to the door of the shed to try to get her brother to come back to play. The appellant opened the door and the complainant went in. The appellant took his penis out of his shorts and pulled her hand over to touch it. He said “It’s all right, touch it. It won’t hurt you. Go on, pat it, it’s just like a little animal”. The appellant asked the brother to show the complainant what to do. The brother declined and so the appellant took the complainant’s hand, put it on his penis, and made himself ejaculate. (These events gave rise to count1). 
     
      
    21    When [M] was five or six years old, she was at home when the appellant was painting the kitchen. The complainant’s sister [J] was also at home. When the appellant finished painting he took the girls into his bedroom and asked them to touch him, they declined. He told them to get into the bed and he then took his clothes off. He lay on top of [J] and then rolled over onto the complainant [M]. He held the complainant’s hands above her head with one hand and put his penis inside her. He was moving up and down and breathing heavily. He ejaculated and got off her. She did not report this to her mother (count 2). 
     
      
    22    There was a further incident in about 1973 when the complainant [M] was seven or eight years of age. She was sleeping on the bottom bunk of a bed with her sister [J] on the top bunk. The appellant and the mother of the girls came home from the club. They were arguing. The appellant left the bedroom and went into the kitchen. He then came into the bedroom and started calling out [J’s] name. [J] did not wake up, but the complainant [M] said to the appellant “What are you doing here?” The appellant got into [M’s] bed and told her not to make any noise. He removed her pyjama pants and held her hands above her head. He started rubbing his body against her and his penis became erect. He penetrated her vagina until he ejaculated (count 4). The complainant did not tell her mother of this incident, in the belief that her mother could not protect her and the need she felt to protect her mother. 
     
      
    23    The complainant [J] was the second eldest daughter of the appellant, having been born on 14 April, 1965. When she was between five and seven years old, she recalled being on her parents’ bed. Neither she nor the appellant had any pants on. He asked her to put her mouth on his penis. She refused. She was lying down on the bed and his penis was erect. He put his penis into her vagina. He said “Oh we’ll only put it in a little bit this time”. He pushed his penis in and out. He took a handkerchief from the dressing table and wiped himself and the complainant (these events constituted count 3). 
     
      
    24    The complainant [J] recalled another incident when she was about twelve years old. She was drying dishes in the kitchen and needed to go to the toilet. She opened the door to the toilet and the appellant was sitting there. She went to go out, but he grabbed her hand and pulled her in. He put both her hands on his penis and asked her to move her hands up and down. His penis was erect. The complainant’s sisters were calling out to her to come back and she managed to get away from the appellant (count 6). 
     
      
    25    The complainant [S] was born on 25 March, 1960 and is the eldest child of the family. When she was aged thirteen, she recalled coming into the bedroom where she thought her mother was. The appellant was there and pulled her pants down and lifted her onto the bed. The appellant removed his trousers and lay on top of the complainant. She could feel his penis pushing against her. After a while, he got up and ejaculated into a handkerchief. He said “Don’t let anybody else do this to you, because I know what I’m doing and you won’t fall pregnant” (count 5). The complainant[S]said that this was not the first time events such as that had occurred. She did not tell anyone about the incident. 
     
      
    26    MJS, the mother of the four complainants, gave evidence that she married the appellant in 1958. They had five children and lived until the early nineties at Ermington. She gave evidence that prior to the girls leaving home, she was unaware that her husband had been sexually assaulting them. When the complainant [M] was in her thirties, she inquired of her mother whether she was aware that the appellant had sex with her. Some time later the complainant [J] asked her whether she knew “Dad touched us”. In November, 1995 MJS left the appellant after her daughter [J] had said to her on the telephone “Mum if you want to see your daughters and grandchildren, you’ve got to get out”. After she left the appellant, she received a letter from him (Exhibit “F”). She received that letter on 20 December, 1995. This three page hand written letter included the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Forgive me for my bad passed (sic) … My bad passed (sic) it will not go away. I’m sorry, sorry for my daughters facing all this”. 
        
       
      
    27    Detective Senior Constable Grech gave evidence of speaking to the appellant on 11 January, 1996 after obtaining statements from the complainant [M] and the complainant [D]. At Forster Police Station the appellant was interviewed by way of ERISP on that day. The ERISPs of two interviews conducted on that day, with respect to the two complainants, were admitted as Exhibits “G” and “H” in the proceedings, their transcripts being “G1” and “H1” respectively. The appellant denied sexually assaulting [D] and [M], but when asked if any of the alleged events may have taken place when he was under the influence of alcohol, the appellant replied “Well, I suppose there’d have to be an element of doubt to that because I just don’t, I don’t know what it was like. I don’t know what I - whatever I done when I was drunk do so I, I just don’t really know if it was possible or not”. (Q.111) When asked what he meant, he said “Well naturally it could have happened if I was drunk at the time and I don’t know what I was doing, but as far as I know it definitely did not happen but there’s always an element of doubt in - when you’re drunk and that sort of thing at that particular time and I’m not going to use that as an excuse for any of these allegations”. 
     
      
    28    The appellant was again interviewed on 7 February, 1996 in relation to the complainant’s[J]and [S]. He did not respond to any allegations in this third interview relating to the offences alleged with regard to the complainants[J]and [S]. 
     
      
    29    In his defence the appellant gave evidence in which he related a long work history, including twenty seven years in continuous employment with one employer. He denied knowledge of any of the incidents described by the complainants and denied sexually assaulting any of his children, or having touched any of his daughters or having sexual intercourse with them. 
     
      
    30    The appellant described his relationship with his family as close and that with his daughter [M] as very close. He described disciplining the children if they misbehaved and described his relationship with the complainant [D] as a good relationship. He gave evidence of keeping bees in the Kurrajong area and of transporting the hives around. He recalled one dirt road that he used to drive upon and said this could be the only road the complainant [D] was referring to. He denied that he attempted to sexually assault his daughter in the back seat of his car. 
     
      
    31    In further evidence, the appellant said that prior to 1990 none of his daughters approached him about allegations of sexual abuse. After that time the complainant [J], he said, asked him had he ever had sex with her, to which he had responded in the negative. She also asked whether he had had sex with the complainant [M], which he also denied. 
     
      
    32    The appellant in evidence sought to explain the implications in the letter, Exhibit “F”, in particular the words “Forgive me for my bad passed (sic)” as being a reference to his problem with alcohol saying that he may even have been an alcoholic at that time. His statement “and I need health care now” was, he said, a reference to the fact that he had already had a heart attack. His further reference to a “bad passed (sic)” could also have meant his gambling problem. The sentence in the letter “My bad passed (sic), it will not go away, I am sorry for my daughters facing all this” he described as being a reference to his problem with alcohol saying that any person caring for their family would be sorry. 
     
      
    33    The appellant gave evidence that as late as December 1995 he still had a problem with alcohol. The thrust of his letter, he said, was that he wanted his wife back. It had taken a number of days to write it and he finished it after he had spoken to police. He was unable to recall what he meant by the expression “responsibility for my actions and/or consequences wrong doing”. 
     
      
    34    With reference to the answer given by him on 11 January, 1996 in response to the question “Q. Did you ever sexually interfere with [M]?”, his answer being “A. To the best of my knowledge, no, I definitely did not”, he stated that the words “To the best of my knowledge” would have been a slip of the tongue and to him it was the same as saying simply “no”. 
     
      
    35    In a short case in reply, the complainant [M] gave evidence that she had gone to the police as a result of a conversation with her aunt. She felt it was her duty to the authorities and said that to her knowledge it was Constable Grech who contacted her three sisters. 
     
      
    36    She also gave evidence that she did not go to police with a view to claiming compensation, she did not know that she could claim compensation when she went to the police and that she did not want the house at Kurrajong. 
     
      
    37    The appellant raises fifteen grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - His Honour erred in declining to hear an application for separate trials with respect to the allegations of the four complainants 
       
      
    38    On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that separate trials with regard to each complainant should have been held due to a “significant possibility of concoction as between the complainants”, they being sisters, two having made statements in December 1995 and the other two in January 1996 after the appellant had been charged in relation to the allegations of two complainants. It was submitted that the risk of collusion was such that separate trials should have been ordered. 
     
      
    39    The history of the proceedings include an earlier application for separate trials which resulted in the severance of proceedings concerning a complainant who is a niece of the appellant. This procedure was adopted by a judge other than the trial judge. At that time a determination was made that the trial with respect to the four complainants who were sisters should be a joint trial. 
     
      
    40    It is not submitted that in considering the issue of separate trials, the judge hearing that application did not take into account the relevant considerations appropriate for such a determination. 
     
      
    41    Certainly one consideration was anticipated evidence that two of the sisters, [M] and [J], would give evidence of an incident involving sexual assault when both were present. As it happened, [J] did not recall the incident in question. Nevertheless, the judge in considering the application was mindful of the tendency aspect of the evidence to be called from each of the four complainants recognising that “it was capable of persuading a jury that the appellant had a sexually abusive relationship with each of his four daughters” being a tendency to treat all of his female children in a sexually abusive manner. In my opinion, the evidence of the four complainants was admissible on that basis, however, this aspect was not pressed and the jury was instructed to treat the evidence with regard to each complainant separately. 
     
      
    42    In addition, the commonality of the evidence included the letter, Exhibit “F”, which referred to the daughters, and, as pointed out by counsel for the respondent in his submissions, the appellant made admissions in the presence of the complainants [M] and [D] and other admissions in the presence of complainants [J] and [M]. 
     
      
    43    No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated by virtue of the fact that a joint trial was held with regard to the four complainants. Ground 1 is accordingly not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - The admission of evidence of complaint led to a miscarriage of justice; and 
       
      Ground 9 - His Honour erred in his directions as to evidence of complaint 
       
      
    44    I have had the benefit of reading in draft, the judgment of Simpson J with which I respectfully agree. For the reasons given by Simpson J, these grounds of appeal are rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - His Honour erred in admitting into evidence in an unedited form, a letter written by the appellant to his former wife (Exhibit “F”) 
       
      
    45    The letter, Exhibit “F”, was tendered during the course of evidence given by the appellant’s former wife, MJS. It had been received by her on 20 December, 1995. 
     
      
    46    A general objection was taken to the tender on the ground of prejudice. 
     
      
    47    Counsel for the appellant concedes that the letter acknowledged that the appellant had a “bad passed (sic)” and that he was sorry his daughters were having to face something which apparently related to his bad past. Hence the letter was of probative value and, it is conceded, ought to have been admitted. 
     
      
    48    On the third page of the letter, appears the sentence “Policeman just call about any wrongdoing”. The appellant contends that this sentence should have been edited out. 
     
      
    49    It is common ground that the sentence in question referred to an unrelated matter. In the context of the letter, the meaning of the words in question was obscure. 
     
      
    50    In cross-examination of the appellant, the Crown Prosecutor pursued the question of whether, at the time he wrote the letter, Exhibit “F”, the appellant was aware that any of his daughters had contacted police. This was a perfectly proper line of enquiry. 
     
      
    51    The appellant mistakenly said that he had been informed of the relevant allegations about a fortnight before he was spoken to by the investigating police officer, Detective Grech, on 11 January, 1996. It seems plain that this response prompted a question from the jury in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The members of the jury are not clear about the claim by Mr [S] that he did not know anything about the sexual abuse charges against him prior to writing the letter, yet there is a reference to a policeman approaching him about wrong-doings on page 3 of the letter. Could some clarification be given on this point, please? 
         
        Thankyou.” 
        
       
      
    52    In the absence of the jury, the answer which the court should give to this question was fully ventilated in discussion between counsel and the trial judge. During the course of this discussion, it was established that the appellant was mistaken in his recollection as to timing, that is to say when he first learned of the allegations by his daughters in relation to the time of writing the letter. 
     
      
    53    On return of the jury, the trial judge apologised for the delay and then read to the members of the jury their question and said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, the position is this, it is common ground between the parties that at the time he wrote the letter Mr [S] was not aware that statements had been made to police by [D] and [M]. And there was some evidence given this morning which might’ve tended to confuse that position, but it is common ground between the parties that what I have just said is the position. So far as the reference made to the top two, and perhaps three lines on page 3 of the letter, what I direct you to do is to ignore that entirely, and not to speculate about what that may relate to. It is not relevant to these proceedings. You should not speculate, as I say, about it, and it is not a matter that is relevant to these proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    54    It is to be noted that when the letter, Exhibit “F”, was tendered and the general objection taken to it, the trial judge gave reasons for its admissibility. At that time no request was made to edit out of the letter the sentence about which complaint is presently made. 
     
      
    55    In the circumstances, the direction given by the trial judge in answer to the question asked by the jury, was adequate and no miscarriage of justice resulted from the inclusion of the sentence in question, as qualified by the judge’s direction, remaining in the letter. Ground 3 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - The admission before the jury of evidence as to motives of the appellant’s former wife for leaving him gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    56    On behalf of the appellant, it is submitted that the motives for the appellant’s former wife leaving him were not relevant and this evidence should not have been led, being prejudicial in nature. It is further submitted that this evidence tended to place the appellant in a poor light, indicating the determination of the complainants to have nothing to do with him, the evidence suggesting, so the submission runs, that the appellant’s former wife accepted the complaints as being well founded. 
     
      
    57    No objection was taken to the leading of this evidence and no direction was sought by trial counsel for the appellant with regard to it. 
     
      
    58    In her evidence, the appellant’s wife gave as her reason for leaving the appellant “Because my daughter [J] spoke to me on the phone, saying ‘Mum if you want to see your daughters and grand children, you’ve got to get out’ and that’s what I done.” (T.172.50) This evidence did not necessarily involve acceptance of the complaints made by the daughters. The antipathy between the complainants and their father was patently obvious at the trial. MJS had made no complaint to police about her husband’s conduct with regard to their daughters and in fact her evidence was to effect that she was hurt (when told by the daughter M) and dumbfounded when asked by the daughter [J] if she knew that “… dad touched us”. 
     
      
    59    The evidence complained of did not necessarily involve acceptance of the complaints made by the daughters and could not be said to have brought about a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    60    Ground 4 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 - His Honour erred in refusing to discharge the jury following the disclosure by Detective Grech of the fact of the making of a complaint of sexual assault against the appellant by Christine Purins 
       
      
    61    In his evidence in chief, the police officer, Detective Grech, said that in January 1996 he caused statements to be obtained from [J], Christine Leslie Purins and [S]. He said further that on Wednesday, 7 February of 1996, accompanied by another police officer he spoke to the appellant in the driveway of his home and said to him, inter alia, “Harold, I need to talk to you further about further allegations of sexual assault made by [J], [S] and Christine Purins. I believe you know these people”. He said, “Yes, I know them”. I said, “Mr [S], you’re under arrest for the sexual assault upon these females.” 
     
      
    62    Shortly after this passage of evidence, the Crown Prosecutor drew to the court’s attention the mention of the name of Christine Purins, who was not a complainant in the proceedings on foot. The Crown Prosecutor took responsibility for failing to warn the police officer to tailor his evidence to the indictment. 
     
      
    63    Counsel for the appellant sought the discharge of the jury. His Honour refused that application, holding that “… the name will have no significance whatever to the jury”. 
     
      
    64    It is submitted, on behalf of the appellant, that the matter was one of significance and that the jury would not have forgotten the mention of Ms Purins’ name and that this was reinforced by the blank spaces which the editing of Exhibit “J1”, the transcript of the record of interview between police officers and the appellant on 7 February, 1996 disclosed by virtue of the blank spaces where Christine Purins’ name had been removed. 
     
      
    65    The error in the police officer’s evidence, for which the Crown Prosecutor accepted responsibility, was unfortunate. It was not, however, in my opinion, an error incapable of rectification by directions from the trial judge to the jury to ignore and put out of their consideration the name of the person inadvertently mentioned. 
     
      
    66    In the present case, when offered the alternative of either having an appropriate direction given or the matter allowed to rest, counsel for the appellant, not surprisingly, elected the latter course. 
     
      
    67    Upon resumption of evidence before the jury, the police officer confined his evidence to the two complainants [J] and [S], the appellant’s daughters. 
     
      
    68    The question is whether the failure to discharge the jury resulted in a miscarriage of justice - Maric -v- The Queen (1978) 52 ALJR 631. 
     
      
    69    In R -v- Marsland (NSWCCA - unreported - 17.7.91) a significantly more serious error occurred than in the present case. An exhibit was tendered on which the heading made reference to alleged sexual misconduct on the part of the appellant, not only against the complainant but also against another lady. 
     
      
    70    The trial judge directed the jury to “cross it out of your minds”, it being an error which had nothing to do with the case Gleeson CJ, with whom Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J agreed, categorised the inclusion of the irrelevant reference as an irregularity. In rejecting the ground of appeal Gleeson CJ noted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is to be borne in mind that there was nothing else of any kind before (the jury) that would have given them any indication of, or even a hint as to who (the second lady) might have been”.  
        
       
      
    71    The decision is apposite in the present case. 
     
      
    72    In R -v- Oliviera (NSW CCA - 26.11.93 - unreported), a case involving inadvertent introduction of inadmissible evidence of bad character, Abadee J, with whom Clarke JA and Grove J agreed, at p 8 adverted to the advantages enjoyed by the trial judge in assessing the jury’s capacity to accept directions of law. Whilst not directly on point in the present case, where no directions were given, the reasons given by Abadee J do emphasise the advantageous position the trial judge enjoys in assessing the impact of the erroneous, albeit inadvertent disclosure. Some support for the respondent’s submissions on the question of the impact of the evidence is to be found in the election of trial counsel for the appellant not to have his Honour give directions to the jury and to let the matter lie. 
     
      
    73    There was, in my view, no miscarriage of justice resulting from refusal of the application to discharge the jury. Ground 5 is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 - The admission into evidence of the record of interview between the appellant and police dated 7 February 1996 gave rise to a miscarriage of justice (Exhibits “J” and “J1” 
       
      
    74    On behalf of the appellant, the submission is made that the interview between Detective Grech and the appellant on 7 February 1996 elicited no admissible evidence. This exhibit, which included the transcript of the ERISP, was admitted by consent. Counsel later sought a voir dire in support of an application to have Exhibit “J”, the ERISP and its transcript, Exhibit “J1”, withdrawn from the jury. 
     
      
    75    Following the tender of Exhibit “J” and the provision of the transcript of that ERISP, that is to say Exhibit “J1”, the ERISP video, Exhibit “J”, was played to the court. Accordingly, the jury had before them the transcript, Exhibit “J1”, and had heard and seen the video-taped record of interview of 7 February, 1996, Exhibit “J”, played to them in court. When the video tape was three quarters of the way through, the court, on 27 May, 1998 was adjourned until 10 o’clock next day. 
     
      
    76    It would appear from the transcript that the next day, Thursday, 28 May, 1998 the commencement of proceedings was delayed while defence counsel made an application to have the balance of the video tape and its transcript withdrawn from the jury. It would seem that throughout this period of delay, the jury had with them in the jury room the transcript being Exhibit “J1”. 
     
      
    77    The transcript does not make it clear precisely when the jury was released, being requested to return at 1 o’clock, however, it would seem that the voir dire of the police officer, Detective Grech, commenced at 10.47 am on Thursday, 28 May. 
     
      
    78    The application made by trial counsel for the appellant to have the ERISP, Exhibit “J”, and the transcript, Exhibit “J1”, which had been admitted by consent, withdrawn, when the video-tape was three quarters through playing, and the transcript had been, for a considerable time, in the hands of the jury, was a most unusual application which, if granted, could only have resulted in confusion on the part of the jury. 
     
      
    79    The trial judge acted appropriately in his endeavours to avoid the jury becoming confused in this fashion. The issue is whether the ERISP, Exhibit “J”, and the transcript, Exhibit “J1”, by remaining as exhibits before the jury, unfairly prejudiced the appellant’s trial. For my part, I am far from persuaded that this was so. 
     
      
    80    The appellant consistently maintained throughout the interview his innocence and took the opportunity to record his criticism of police tactics as to the manner of his overall questioning. 
     
      
    81    The appellant’s right to silence was the subject of unexceptional directions to the jury by the trial judge in this regard and there was no breach of S 89 of the Evidence Act, 1985. Ground 6 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 - A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the cross-examination by the Crown of the appellant concerning the credibility of Crown witnesses 
       
      
    82    The submission in support of this ground of appeal relates to the cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor, the contention being that a line of cross-examination whereby one witness is invited to express an opinion about the truthfulness of another, ought not to be pursued, a fortiori, where the witness is the accused. 
     
      
    83    The evidence complained of commences at transcript 306 where the question was asked, concerning the complainant [J], whether the appellant had admitted to her that he had had sex with her but denied having sex with the other girls. The appellant denied this. It was further put to him the question:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And I suggest to you that she [J] said to you ‘I know that you did it to [M] now’?” 
         
        A. No that did not come up in any conversation with us at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest to you that you denied having sex with [M] and she said --  
         
        A. I definitely denied having sex with [M] and I still do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. ‘But I know you did it to [M]’? 
         
        A. Well that was never ever brought up. All these things they’ve - I’ll you what, they’ve definitely got together, very much so and put this all down and it proves itself one way and another.” 
        
       
      
    84    The appellant then was asked about what he meant by the words “they’ve definitely got together” and gave evidence of collusion between his daughters to “pin this on me”. He was then asked the question:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr [S], just listen to the question, why do you think your daughters got together and made this up? 
         
        A. This is exactly what I’m saying, I do not know, I’ve not been able to work this out myself at all. I can’t figure it out, one bit of it. I can’t understand any of it’s about. It just seems so stupid to me the way that they’ve done it.” 
        
       
      
    85    The appellant was then asked questions about his knowledge of the reason why his family had fallen apart at the time when he wrote the letter, Exhibit “F”. 
     
      
    86    He was asked the question:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you knew at the time when you were writing this letter that the family had fallen apart because of the sexual abuse you’d perpetrated upon your daughters? 
         
        A. I referred to it in this letter that I expected the family to fall apart, not had fallen apart, but would fall apart because of the wife had gone and left me. Yes, I referred to that --  
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you realised your wife had, in fact, left you  
         
        --? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- What did you understand was the reason for her going?” 
        
       
      
    87    The appellant then gave an answer in which said that he did not know why she had left, intimating that it had been a good marriage without arguments or disagreements and expressing his belief that they were a loving family.  
     
      
    88    At T. 352 the appellant was cross-examined about the statements made by his daughter [J] in her evidence, with which he had taken issue. He was asked the question:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr [S] do you say that what [J] said in the witness box about that conversation with you was a lie on [J’s] part? 
         
        A. No, I didn’t say that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well what do you say about her evidence? 
         
        A. I just told you exactly what happened, and that was it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You do not agree -- 
         
        A. There was no further -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You do not agree that [J] confronted you about your sexually abusing her -- 
         
        A. I did -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – and asking you why? 
         
        A. I did agree that she did confront me in that respect and about [M], and I told you that was all that was said. And then I, we had a little bit of a talk with each other and not about that, that whatever was going on, just an ordinary conversation, and then we were called over to the bar-b-que next door and we went over there to a bar-b-que. There -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Let me ask you -- 
         
        A. – Was no conversation. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – again. Why do you think [J] asked you that question? 
         
        A. I don’t really know, to be honest. I don’t really know.” 
        
       
      
    89    At transcript 375 the appellant was asked in cross-examination if the evidence given by the four complainants was fabrication and he said in each case that it was. He was also asked whether some evidence given by his wife was a fabrication to which he also responded in the affirmative. He was then asked the question (T.376):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you are the only person in this court telling the truth, is that what you believe? 
         
        A. Well it seems that way to me.” 
        
       
      
    90    For the appellant, reliance is placed upon the decision of this court in  R -v- Rich (1998) 102 A Crim R 165. In that case the cross-examination of the appellant focused on the conflict between the appellant’s evidence and that of Crown witnesses. He was questioned as to whether he was suggesting that those witnesses were lying. Hidden J expressed the view that this was analogous to cross examination of an accused in a case of alleged sexual misconduct as to whether he could attribute any motive to the complainant to fabricate evidence against him, which he identified as a practice condemned in a number of decisions of this court and more recently by the High Court in Palmer -v- The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 1. 
     
      
    91    The authorities relevant to this issue were comprehensively considered at some length by Adams J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreed, in  R -v- Baker (1999) NSW CCA 277 - unreported). The Court there considered the decision in R -v- Rich (supra). At para. 32 of his judgment, Adams J said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The mere fact that counsel for the accused puts to a witness that he or she is lying will not justify a cross-examination of the accused by the Crown Prosecutor calculated to deflect the jury from an objection consideration of the two issues in the case by attempting to elicit from the accused the opinion that the witness is lying. As was said in  
        R -v- Leak 
         (1969) SASR 172 the opinion of the accused is irrelevant. I am of the view that the questioning of each of the accused by the Crown Prosecutor which I’ve quoted was improper and impermissible as was conceded in this court by Mr Birman for the Crown. It was, in reality, commentary directed to the jury rather than cross-examination designed to test the witness’s evidence. Even so, I think it may fairly be seen as having been instigated by the attacks (quite properly) made on the Crown witnesses by counsel for the accused and fairly represented their cases. The question remains, however, whether in pressing for the irrelevant opinions the appellant was unfairly prejudiced. In the circumstances of this case, this question could be recast into the form: Did the impermissible questioning have a real or perceptible tendency to deflect the jury from properly considering the issues in the trial, having due regard to the onus and standard of proof and, in particular, fairly evaluating the evidence of and the case made by the appellant?” 
        
       
      
    92    The question as recast by Adams J in the above quotation is in my respectful opinion apposite to the present case. 
     
      
    93    With the exception of the last series of questions, it is necessary to consider the passages of evidence in the context in which the various issues arose. The subject of cross-examination was the letter, Exhibit “F”. The questioning was important and appropriate. It was not the subject of objection. 
     
      
    94    The series of questions in which the Crown Prosecutor asked the appellant as to whether the four complainants and their mother were fabricating their evidence, leading to the question “Q. And you are the only person in this court telling the truth is that what you believe?” was an impermissible approach on the part of the Crown Prosecutor, which invited opinion evidence from the accused. It was irrelevant and the questions should not have been asked. Nevertheless, this evidence, in my opinion, did not have a real or perceptible tendency to deflect the jury from properly considering the issues in the trial, having regard to the onus and standards of proof and upon a fair evaluation of the evidence and of the case made by the appellant. I would reject this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 - His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to lead evidence in reply. 
       
      
    95    In unresponsive answers to questions in cross-examination, the appellant made allegations variously described as concoction and collusion between the complainants [M] and [J]. He also suggested that the complainants may have been motivated by a desire to claim compensation. 
     
      
    96    In giving judgment on the separate trial application, Karpin DCJ held that collusion had not been raised as a real possibility. In cross-examination of the complainants, neither concoction nor collusion was raised. 
     
      
    97    An application was made by counsel for the appellant to recall the complainants to put collusion to them. The trial judge acceded to this request, limiting further cross-examination to that issue, however, on instructions, the application was withdrawn. 
     
      
    98    The short case in reply was confined to the complainant [M], who gave evidence of going to the police after speaking to her aunt and of the police contacting her sisters. She said further that she had no thought of compensation and was unaware of its availability. 
     
      
    99    In the case of Tillick -v- The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 565, upon which the appellant relies, evidence countervailing the accused’s alibi evidence was held to have been improperly admitted in reply in circumstances where the accused, in two prior proceedings had given evidence of his alibi. That case is clearly distinguishable on the facts in the present case. The need to call evidence in reply arose purely from the unresponsive answers of the appellant in cross-examination. The evidence in reply was not improperly admitted. Ground 8 is rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10 - His Honour erred in his directions as to the treatment by the jury of delay in the making of complaints and the prosecution of the alleged offences. 
       
       
      Ground 11 - His Honour erred in his directions concerning matters alleged by the Crown to “confirm or tend to confirm” the allegations of the complainants. 
       
      
    100    It is argued, on behalf of the appellant, that his Honour having invited the jury to look for independent evidence, not coming from the complainants, which tends to confirm the appellant’s commission of the offences, that he then directed the jury to consider a series of matters which would not assist in that regard, being more in the nature of ordinary parental expressions of affection and domestic activity. 
     
      
    101    The matters which were the subject of this ground of appeal are set out in the trial judge’s summing up between pages 13 and 22.  
     
      
    102    In this part of the summing up, his Honour was identifying matters, which in the Crown submission, the jury could look to to confirm or tend to confirm the alleged offences. His Honour was at pains to point out that it was a matter for the jury to decide whether the Crown’s argument was to be accepted in this regard (S/U 13.5). 
     
      
    103    Reference was then made to the letter, Exhibit “F”, and certain sections of the appellant’s record of interview, Exhibit “G1”, being the transcript of the recorded interview. 
     
      
    104    Section 164 of the Evidence Act, 1995 abolishes the requirement for corroboration. Accordingly, a direction in this regard was not necessary. In any event, no complaint is made of the direction on corroboration given by the trial judge. 
     
      
    105    With regard to the evidence concerning the actions of the appellant towards his daughters, the trial judge said at S/U 21:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now members of the jury, it is a matter for you to assess what weight you give to that evidence. You may think that it is neutral, that it could be the act of a loving father who is merely relating to his children in the way that is described. And in the course of that, in relation to every specific sexual assault that is alleged he denies that he committed it.” 
        
       
      
    106    No complaint was made by trial counsel as to this aspect of the summing up. Strictly speaking, the appellant needs leave to raise this ground. However, in any event, in my opinion, there has been no miscarriage of justice and these grounds should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 12 - His Honour erred in his directions concerning an alleged admission by the appellant. 
       
      
    107    The basis for this ground of appeal is not clear. The evidence of the complainant [D] at transcript 25/26 related to a conversation which the complainant [D] gave evidence of having with the appellant. The Crown relied upon this conversation as constituting admissions on the part of the appellant. 
     
      
    108    At transcript 118-119 the complainant [M] gave evidence of a conversation she had engaged in with the appellant, in which it was alleged he had said, inter alia, “Oh no, no, I don’t think that’s right, you girls wanted that as much as I did, you girls wanted the cuddles it wasn’t just me”. This was a conversation in which [M] was saying to the appellant that he should transfer the Housing Commission home, which the parents were not occupying, to the complainant [D] in which the appellant is alleged to have said “Well what are you girls going to do for me if I do that?” to which [M] gave evidence that she had replied “I think we have already paid for that, I think you should do it, I think you should owe us a lot more than this. Anyway, you should do it because of the things you’ve done to us as children”. 
     
      
    109    In his directions, the trial judge made it plain that the weight the jury members were to place upon this evidence was a matter for them. No complaint was made about this aspect of the summing up by trial counsel, leave is accordingly required. However, in any event, no miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated and this ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 13 - His Honour erred in his directions in relation to the jury’s treatment of the issue of consumption of alcohol by the appellant 
       
      
    110    This ground is without merit. In his record of interview of 11 January, 1996 the appellant was asked at:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q.115 All right. Mr [S], are you able to tell me if - if you are - were at any time an alcoholic? 
         
        A. Yes, I was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.116 Any are you able to tell me -  
         
        A. I was a real bad alcoholic at one stage.” 
        
       
      
    111    He later said that following a drunken driving charge he had given up drinking and that was probably in about 1986 or 1987. This evidence was before the jury and there was in addition a significant amount of evidence on the issue of whether or not the appellant had been under the influence of alcohol and been unaware of his conduct towards the complainants. 
     
      
    112    The appellant did not rely on a defence based upon his consumption of alcohol or the effect it had upon him. 
     
      
    113    The trial judge felt constrained to give directions to the jury on the question of intoxication. 
     
      
    114    In summing up at p 23/D2 his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Normally it is obvious from the nature of the allegations that if the acts were done by the accused they must have been done voluntarily and intentionally. It was not suggested by counsel for the accused that the question of alcohol in fact or intoxication was a matter which he addressed to you. It is not suggested that that was an explanation for any misconduct. But because of the evidence, part of which I have already referred to, about alcohol and intoxication and what the accused said in his evidence was the effect on him of alcohol, it is necessary for me to give you this direction.” 
        
       
      
    115    His Honour proceeded to give an unexceptional direction on alcoholic intoxication to which no objection was raised. In R -v- Stokes and Difford 51 A Crim R 25 it was held that the trial judge must leave the issue (of intoxication) with the jury when it arises on the evidence as one which must be considered by the jury. This is so even if defence counsel, for reasons of strategy, does not wish to raise it. His Honour was right to follow the course which he did. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 14 - His Honour erred in his directions in relation to the jury’s treatment of lies allegedly told by the appellant 
       
      
    116    The appellant contends that the directions given by his Honour on the issue of a lie relied upon by the Crown as showing consciousness of guilt, were confusing to the jury. 
     
      
    117    The lie alleged turned upon whether the appellant had an alcohol problem in 1995 when he wrote the letter, Exhibit “F”, the implication being that at that time, he had not had any such problem for many years but was seeking to embrace such a problem to explain away his “bad passed” (sic) and “wrong doing” referred to by him in Exhibit “F” the letter to his wife. 
     
      
    118    The appellant had given evidence in chief in which he sought to explain his wrong doing and loss of the love of his daughters and his bad past in terms of alcohol and gambling problems. He claimed to still have an alcohol problem, albeit reduced, at the time of writing the letter, Exhibit “F”, in December, 1995. This was in direct conflict with his statement in his ERISP of having overcome that problem in 1986. 
     
      
    119    The directions on lies given by his Honour were in what might be said to be conventional form. They could perhaps have been better tailored to the facts of the case, but they certainly embodied the caveats upon which the jury were required to be directed. No objection was taken to the directions at the trial.  
     
      
    120    There was no miscarriage of justice. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 15 - the convictions of the appellant constitute miscarriages of justice 
       
      
    121    The appellant contends that by reason of individual errors, as well as a concatenation of errors, the appellant’s convictions constitute miscarriages of justice in the sense discussed in R -v- Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 @ 407-8. Further support is sought from what is said to be unnecessary directions as to the relationship evidence concerning other offences not charged; the existence of guilty passion and his Honour’s cross-examination of the appellant at transcript 376-7. 
     
      
    122    The Crown led evidence of the relationship between the appellant and the complainants in the nature of background to the offences charged. No objection was taken to this evidence being led. The directions given by the trial judge were consistent with incidents of a sexual nature, which were not the subject of specific charges, being no more than background evidence to the events which were the subject of charges. The directions were not the subject of objection and no redirection was sought. In the circumstances, the directions given by his Honour were not inappropriate. 
     
      
    123    The questions asked of the appellant by the trial judge were confined to what the appellant intended to convey by what was written (and unwritten) in the letter, Exhibit “F”. The questions asked did not amount to the entry into the arena by the trial judge and no miscarriage of justice resulted. 
     
      
    124    The hearing of the trial extended over sixteen days, of which nine were hearing days. The four complainants gave evidence and were cross-examined at length. The evidence of the accused occupied over one hundred and fifty pages of transcript. The summing up to the jury was one hundred pages or so in length. The appellant in giving evidence was given to making non-responsive speeches. He had to be brought back to the question time and time again. I mention these statistics to illustrate that it was not an easy trial to manage. 
     
      
    125    It is a rare trial indeed which, when subjected to scrutiny, can withstand every criticism. The standard is not one of perfection, the test must always remain whether justice miscarried. 
     
      
    126    In my opinion, the grounds of appeal raised in this case, neither in isolation nor concatenation demonstrate a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    127    I would dismiss the appeal.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
      SIMPSON J :  
       
      
    128    I have read, and agree with the judgment of Ireland J in relation to those grounds of appeal his Honour considers. In relation to the grounds of appeal concerned with the issues raised by the evidence of complaint, I have reached the following conclusions. 
     
      
       
      Complaint 
       
      
    129    Two grounds of appeal concern the evidence of complaint. By ground 2 it is asserted that the admission of evidence of complaint led to a miscarriage of justice. By ground 9 it is asserted that the trial judge erred in the directions he gave to the jury in relation to that evidence. 
     
      
    130    Considering the number and breadth of the allegations, the period of time over which the offences were alleged to have been committed, the number of alleged victims, and their relationship to one another and to the appellant, the evidence of complaint was very limited indeed. What follows is an account of the evidence that was admitted as evidence of complaint although it is probably more accurate to describe it as the evidence of assertions made at any time prior to the trial, by any of the complainants, of sexually improper behaviour by the appellant. I shall, however, continue to use the term “complaint”. In each case, the complaint is framed in the most general of terms. In three cases, the complaint was directed to the appellant himself. The evidence amounted to the following: 
     
      
       
      Complaint by D 
       
       
      (i) D said that she spoke to her older sister, M, when M was about sixteen and D was about ten. She said she used to scream and misbehave when M went out. On one occasion when M was going out with friends and D behaved in this way M asked her why she did so and whether it was because of their father. M asked D if their father had touched her, if he had hurt D, and if he made her feel uncomfortable. To this D said that she replied that the appellant “hurts me and he has penetrated me and such”. 
       
       
      It is not possible from this evidence to discern even an approximate time of the alleged events to which D was referring.  
       
       
      The evidence given by M about the conversation was different. She said: 
       
       
        
        “I remember asking [D] if my father was hurting her and [D] answering her with a puzzled look and no knowing, [D] looking with a puzzled look and then me asking her, pressuring her more, ‘tell me, what are you trying to say?’ and then I asked her ‘What, has he touched you, has he done something like that?’ And then she said ‘No, not that’ and I asked her whether he penetrated her and she said no.” (T115) 
        
       
       
       
      (ii) Years later, when D was seventeen or eighteen, the appellant was about to surrender his Department of Housing accommodation. M and D approached him with a view to persuading him, rather than surrendering it, to make it available to D. D could not, at the time of giving evidence, recall what had been said, but said that, whatever it was, it prompted a reply from the appellant to which she deposed in the following terms: 
       
       
        
        “He said that because we went and sat on his lap, he took that that we wanted to be sexually abused, that we wanted to be touched and fondled.” (T26) 
        
       
       
      The jury was invited to infer that whatever D had said to provoke this response amounted to an assertion of previous sexual misbehaviour. 
       
       
      Complaint by M 
       
       
      (iii) M gave evidence about what is probably the same occasion. She said that during the discussion about the transfer of the house, the appellant asked what the complainants would do for him in return if he complied with their request. M said:  
       
       
        
        “I think we have already paid for that, I think you should do it, I think you owe us a lot more than this. Anyway you should do it because of the things you’ve done to us as children.” (T119) 
        
       
       
      (iv) M, who was born in 1966, gave evidence that “during [her] teenage years” she told her particular friend, Vanessa Sherwood, something of the events the subject of the charges. M said that she did this after an occasion in which she was confronted by her parents and Vanessa’s mother with evidence that she had been using marijuana. She subsequently wrote Vanessa a letter. M was not very specific about the contents of the letter. The extent of her evidence on its content was: 
       
       
        
        “…I wrote it in a letter to Vanessa then that afternoon before I left I put a letter under her clothes which were stacked on the end of her bed and in that letter it said that my father had molested me and that was some of the reasons why I acted the way I did.” (T118) 
        
       
       
      (v) Vanessa, who gave evidence under her married name, Forsack, confined herself to agreeing that the letter had been written and that the word “molesting” had been used, but was no more explicit about the specific terms of the letter.  
       
       
      (vi) When she was aged about twenty-five M was making arrangements to live away from her parents’ home. She suggested to her mother that she and the other children might all move out together, but her mother declined. M became annoyed and asked if her mother knew why she was moving out and her mother replied that she had “a pretty good idea”. M told her mother that it was because the appellant had been molesting her.  
       
       
      Complaint by J 
       
       
      (vii) J said that the first person she had spoken to was a friend with whom she had recently (at the time of giving evidence in May 1998) been travelling overseas. J did not give any detail of what she had said to her friend, and nor did she identify the friend, who was not called as a witness.  
       
       
      (viii) J was asked if she had told anybody about the incident in the toilet, the subject of count 6. She said: 
       
       
        
        “No, I remember probably mentioning it to someone, I don’t remember who I ever mentioned it to at any stage though, no.” (T136) 
        
       
       
      (ix) J gave evidence (which was admitted both as evidence of complaint and of admission by the appellant) of confronting the appellant at his home, then at Pacific Palms. This occurred in 1995, when she had travelled to Pacific Palms with M. J said that she demanded to be told why the appellant had behaved as he had. The words she attributed to herself in recounting the confrontation were: 
       
       
        
        “Why did you do it?” (T137) 
        
       
      
    131    There was no evidence that S had made any complaint prior to making her statement to police. 
     
      
    132    When the times (so far as they can be approximated on the evidence) of the various complaints are related to the time or dates of the counts alleged in the indictment, it can be seen that there was nothing like immediate or prompt reporting of the events in question to anybody. The complaint by D to S was made when she was about ten. D was born on 8 February 1972. The offences relating to her were alleged to have been committed between February 1978 and 1979 when she was six (counts 7 and 8), between February 1980 and February 1982 when she was between 8 and 10 (count 9), and between February 1983 and February 1984 when she was eleven (count 10). At best, therefore, her complaint to M related to events she alleged had occurred a year earlier. Her subsequent complaint, to the appellant himself, was made when she was seventeen or eighteen, the most recent events allegedly, having been committed when she was eleven, six or seven years earlier. 
     
      
    133    M was born on 18 August 1966. The three offences charged in relation to her were alleged to have been committed between January 1970 and August 1974, when she was between four and eight. Her complaint in writing to Vanessa was made “in [her] teenage years”; probably (on Vanessa’s evidence) when she was about sixteen. It therefore related to allegations of events said to have occurred ten years earlier. The conversation with her mother was another nine or ten years later.  
     
      
    134    J’s complaint to her travelling companion was made sometime “recently” as at 1998. The events giving rise to the two counts that related to her were alleged to have occurred between April 1970 and April 1973, and between April 1977 and April 1978 respectively. It is impossible to know precisely what complaint she made to her friend, and whether what she said referred specifically to either or both of these allegations. In any case, the time that had elapsed since the events of which she spoke was anything from about twenty to almost twenty-eight years.  
     
      
    135    The complaint made to the appellant by J was made in 1995, anything from about twenty to twenty-five years after the events the subject of the allegation.  
     
      
       
      Evidence Act 1995, s66 
       
      
    136    In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that, in the light of the decision in the High Court in Graham v R [1998] HCA 61; 195 CLR 606 (delivery of which post dated the appellant’s trial), the Crown concedes that the evidence was probably not admissible under s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995. The evidence was tendered and admitted (without objection) in accordance with the prevailing pre-Graham orthodoxy in relation to evidence of complaint. Since the Crown does not press the admissibility of the evidence the reasons for its inadmissibility can be shortly stated. It was sought to be admitted under s 66 of the Evidence Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        66 Exception : criminal proceedings if maker available 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (a) that person, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) If a representation was made for the purpose of indicating the evidence that the person who made it would be able to give in an Australian or overseas proceedings, sub section (2) does not apply to evidence adduced by the prosecutor of the representation unless the representation concerns the identity of a person, place or thing. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) A document containing a representation to which sub s (2) applies must not be tendered before the conclusion of the examination in chief of the person who made the representation, unless the court gives leave. 
          
         
        
       
      
    137    It is the test imposed by the phrase “fresh in the memory” that the complaint evidence in this case cannot meet. Until the High Court’s reasons in Graham were published, the view of the phrase most commonly taken was that it connoted a qualitative, as well as temporal, test. An event of sufficient significance might remain “fresh in the memory” for many years, even a lifetime. That view is no longer orthodox. In Graham the majority said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The word ‘fresh’, in its context in s 66, means ‘recent’ or ‘immediate’. It may also carry with it a connotation that describes the quality of the memory (as being ‘not deteriorated or changed by lapse of time’) but the core of the meaning intended, is to describe the temporal relationship between ‘the occurrence of the asserted facts’ and the time of making the representation. Although questions of fact and degree may arise, the temporal relationship required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not, as was the case here, in years.” (para 4; internal reference omitted.) 
        
       
       
      Their Honours proceeded to give a number of reasons for adopting that construction. 
       
      
    138    Callinan J, in a judgment in which Gleeson CJ concurred, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst it cannot be doubted that the quality or vividness of a recollection will generally be relevant in an assessment of its freshness, its contemporaneity or near contemporaneity, or otherwise will almost always be the most important consideration in any assessment of its freshness. The Court of Criminal Appeal took the view that the section laid emphasis on the ‘quality’ of the memory and in consequence, the regard that should have been paid to the delay in making the complaint was not paid. There may be cases in which evidence of an event relatively remote in time will be admissible pursuant to s 66, but such cases will necessarily be rare and requiring of some special circumstance or feature. It is desirable that s 66 be given such a construction not only for certainty but also to avoid as much as possible the delay and expense of voir dire hearings to explore questions of vividness and the like, with their attendant opportunities for the rehearsal of cross-examination and evidence.” (para 34) 
        
       
      
    139    Having regard to the dates and times of the complaints (so far as they can be ascertained) and the dates and times of the events the subject of the charges, the decision in Graham renders inevitable a conclusion that the evidence was wrongly admitted under s 66. It does not, however, necessarily follow that the evidence was not admissible in an alternative way: see paras 142 to 160 below. 
     
      
    140    I would add that it is, in my view, no longer necessary and may even be misleading to treat evidence of complaint in sexual cases as a discrete entity, or separate species of evidence. Subject to meeting the test of freshness (and subject also to any discretionary exclusion or limitation pursuant to ss 135, 136 or 137) the evidence is (where the maker has been or is to be called to give evidence) admissible under s 66 as an exception to the hearsay rule and as evidence of the truth of the fact or facts asserted: R v H (1997) 92 A Crim R 168; R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131. 
     
      
    141    No objection having been taken at the trial the appellant needs leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to argue the point. Such leave should be given. 
     
      
       
      Evidence Act s 108(3) 
       
      
    142    There is an alternative basis on which the evidence of the accounts given by three of the complainants to others may have been admitted. S 108 is directed towards re-establishing the credibility of a witness in the circumstances set out in the section. Sub s (3) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) evidence of prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.” 
        
       
       
      (“The credibility rule” to which reference is made, is the rule contained is s 102, which provides simply that evidence that is relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not admissible. S 108(3) is one of a number of express exceptions to that general rule.) 
       
      
    143    Two things are to be noted about s 108(3). The first is that it creates a threshold test of admissibility - the evidence is not admissible unless it has been, or is to be, suggested that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed or is the result of suggestion. Such a suggestion may be made in cross-examination of the witness, or in evidence given by an accused or by a witness called in the defence case. The second thing to note is that even when the threshold test has been met, the evidence remains inadmissible unless leave to adduce it has been given by the court. 
     
      
    144    The first question is therefore whether the cross-examination of any of the complainants should be construed as having suggested that her evidence was fabricated or reconstructed or was the result of suggestion. Counsel for the appellant argued that it should not. 
     
      
    145    It may in passing be observed that there were clear suggestions to the complainants that, if the behaviour of which they complained had occurred at all, it was at the hands of somebody other than the appellant. Those questions could be interpreted as suggesting mistaken identity, as distinct from fabrication, reconstruction, or suggestion (however unlikely mistaken identity may seem in the circumstances).  
     
      
    146    But there were, in addition, quite explicit suggestions of fabrication and collusion in cross-examination of each of the complainants. For example, D was asked a number of questions about the reason for her delay in reporting the matters to police. In particular she was asked these questions: 
     
      
       
        
        “I suggest to you the reason for the delay in reporting to the police, is that the incidents didn’t take place the way you have described?” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “… I would suggest to you that if the incidents took place in the way that you have described, that you would have told, firstly, your three sisters about them, during the time of the incidents or shortly after, do you agree with that?” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “I suggest to you that did not happen, do you agree with that?” 
        
       
      
    147    There were other questions in the same vein. Counsel’s intention was made perfectly plain in a discussion that took place in the absence of the jury during the course of D’s cross-examination. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I’m intending to, … ask or put to the complainant that she had a bad relationship with her father in her early teenage years as a result of her drug usage and his dislike for that usage. I’d also be suggesting it involved white powder and green vegetable substance. I’d be suggesting that in various locations in the house and the yard she had it growing and I understand it to be the green vegetable matter. There was a lot of antagonism between her and her father and of course - I’d also be suggesting that her boy friend at the time and I understand through the years between twelve and, possibly sixteen, was also a drug addict, as it were, and that she developed a strong dislike for her father because he opposed her on these areas…” (T34) 
        
       
      
    148    The questions that were asked following this statement were somewhat less robust than the statement would have suggested. Counsel did, however, suggest that to the extent that the relationship between D and the appellant was bad, that was as a result of the appellant’s disciplinary methods.  
     
      
    149    In cross-examination of M it was suggested that her annoyance with the appellant stemmed from the issue about whether he would make the Housing Commission house available to D or not, and that M was in the habit of protecting D. She also was asked a number of questions about the delay in making any report to police and it was categorically put to her that there never had been any sexual abuse either of her or her sisters. Specifically it was also put to her that she was angry with the appellant as a result of friction between the appellant and her boyfriend, and, again, of the appellant’s disciplinary methods. 
     
      
    150    It was put to J that the allegations she had made were untrue, and that she, too, disliked the appellant because he was a disciplinarian. Questions of the same kind were put to S. 
     
      
    151    All of these questions contained, in my view, clear suggestions of, at least, reconstruction, and, at most, fabrication. They alone opened the gateway for leave to be given to the Crown to adduce evidence of the complainants’ prior consistent statements. 
     
      
    152    In his own evidence the appellant was even more specific. He said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “… All these things, they’ve - I tell you what, they’ve definitely got together, very very much so and put this all down and it proves itself one way and another. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Well I reckon they’ve definitely got together to try and pin this on me, whether they think they can get a compensation or what from it, I don’t know, I don’t know where they’ve come with the idea from, I - whether they think that they can finish up being paid for that house that I built up at Kurrajong or what they’ve come up with an idea for there. I mean I worked for twelve years for the brother in law up there and he was going to pay me for that and I also built a house there so - and that’s all I’ve got left in life. So whether they think they’re going to get that, they can have it. As far as I’m concerned they - if that’s all they want they can have it, I’ll give it to them willingly. For God’s sake, to come up with stupid things like this against me.” (T307) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    153    As I have observed above, the suggestions put to the complainants in cross-examination were sufficient to open the door provided by s 108(3)(b). It would thus have been open to the judge to grant leave to the prosecution to adduce the evidence of complaint in re-examination of the individual complaints. The position became much clearer when the appellant gave his evidence and made the assertions extracted above. Had there been no such suggestion during the cross-examination of the complainants, that evidence would have been sufficient to have enabled the judge to grant leave to the prosecution to adduce the evidence of complaint in a case in reply. This is so, even having regard to the well-known restrictions on a Crown case in reply in criminal trials: R v Shaw (1952) 85 CLR 365, R v Lawrence, (1981) 38 ALR 1; R v Killick (1981) 147 CLR 565; R v Chin (1985) 157 CLR 671; R v Chaney (1991) 99 ALR 360. 
     
      
    154    Although it would have been open to the judge to grant leave to the Crown to adduce the evidence, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that leave would have been granted either to adduce the evidence in re-examination of the complainants or in a case in reply. There are many considerations that affect the exercise of the discretion under s 108(3). As the majority in the High Court in Graham pointed out, the exercise of that discretion depends upon the effect of the evidence upon the witness’s credibility - here (as there), the effect of the suggestion of fabrication or reconstruction. The High Court went on to say that (on the facts in Graham) it was by no means clear that the making of a complaint six years after the event would assist in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her evidence. Here, of course, the complaints were, in almost all cases, made much more than six years after the alleged events to which they related. 
     
      
    155    The grant of leave under s 108(3) is dependent upon the establishment of a proper basis. A proper basis is the restoration of the witness’s credit following the suggestion of fabrication, reconstruction or suggestion. Many factors will be relevant to the exercise of the discretion, including, in some cases, an assessment of the degree of ferocity of the attack on the witness’s credibility and even its efficacy. Factors that are required to be taken into account (without excluding others) are set out in s 192.  
     
      
    156    While conceding that the admission of the evidence under s 66 was dubious, the Crown argued that its admissibility under s 108(3) cured any defect that its admission caused. This cannot be accepted. The argument confuses the separate concepts of admissibility and admission of evidence. While the evidence became admissible under s 108(3), that did not necessarily entail the conclusion that it would be admitted, for the reasons already given. Under s 108(3), admissibility does not finally determine admission. Further, even if the evidence were admitted, it would call for a different approach by the trial judge as to the use that could properly be made of it. S 60 suggests that, once admitted under s 108(3), the evidence could be used by the jury as evidence of the truth of what was said by the complainant whose evidence was in question. It would have been appropriate for the judge to give consideration to whether, pursuant to s 136, some limitation should have been placed upon the use that the jury could make of the evidence, for example, as going only to credibility, and not going to the truth of what was stated. That consideration would have been of particular importance in the present case. When regard is had to the lack of specificity and absence of concrete detail in the complaint evidence it cannot be concluded with any degree of confidence that leave would have been granted. 
     
      
    157    In my opinion the admissibility and potential admission of the evidence under s 108(3) provide no answer to the irregular admission of the evidence under s 66. It will be necessary to consider the consequences of that conclusion below. 
     
      
    158    There is, however, yet another basis on which the complaint evidence referred to in paragraph 2(ii), (iii) and (ix) was admissible. These were the complaints made directly to the appellant. His response to the first is set out in paragraph 2(ii). M’s evidence of his response to the complaint set out in paragraph 2(iii) was: 
     
      
       
        
        “…and then he said things like ‘Oh no, no, I don’t think that’s right, you girls wanted that as much as I did, you girls wanted the cuddles, it wasn’t just me’ and then I told him that I think he’s sick because we didn’t want the cuddles, any children should just be able to cuddle their dad and not expect that sort of thing to happen. And we argued about that sort of thing for a little while and then he said that he would see what he could do, and we left.” (T119) 
        
       
      
    159    J’s evidence of the appellant’s response to her complaint, set out in paragraph 2(ix), was: 
     
      
       
        
        “…because I loved you so much - Oh, you were such beautiful kids. And that was what his answer was. I remember him saying, I remember - I asked him, you know, ‘Did you do it to anyone else, did you do it to anyone else?’ because it was news to me that it even happened to [M]. He said, ‘No, no, I wouldn’t have done it to anyone else, no I didn’t do it to anyone else. You were the one who wanted it.’ “ (T137) 
        
       
      
    160    In each case the appellant’s response was admitted as evidence of an admission, and properly admitted for that purpose. The accusation made to him by the complainant in each case was admissible to make his response comprehensible. The accusations, while not properly admissible under s 66, were properly admissible in this way.  
     
      
       
      The directions to the jury 
       
      
    161    It is convenient now to turn to the second of the grounds of appeal that concern the complaint evidence. That is the ground that attacks the directions given to the jury in this respect. A number of criticisms were made. His Honour undertook an extensive and comprehensive review of the evidence of complaint and the arguments put to the jury by counsel in their addresses. Included in the review were repeated references to the delay in making complaint (where complaint was ultimately made) and the absence of complaint (where there was none) and the explanations given for the delay in or absence of complaint. 
     
      
    162    It is convenient here to set out some extracts from the summing up, although these should be treated as representative rather than comprehensive. The directions in relation to complaint cover many pages in the transcript of the summing-up. They commenced with a reference to the obvious delay in the making of complaint, and a brief summary of the evidence of complaint. His Honour then told the jury that there may be good reason for the victim of a sexual assault to hesitate before making a complaint or to refrain from making any complaint and that the jury should look at the circumstances against the background of the relationship between the parties. After making some other remarks his Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, you may think, natural for a young girl to have difficulty in fully understanding what is happening to her when a sexual assault takes place and then in explaining later, perhaps years later, to anyone, what exactly happened to her or to give evidence about it in the strange and no doubt unfriendly atmosphere of the court room. It is by no means easy, you may think, for a complainant to describe the initiation and progress of sexual gratification with her by an adult male and especially her father if in fact it occurred, which began when she was a child of tender years and regularly persisted, according to her account, for a number of years.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    163    His Honour then again referred in detail to the evidence of complaint, summarising what was said by each of the complainants. After some other directions, he then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you accept the evidence that the complaints were made by the complainants, they can be used as evidence of the fact that the accused sexually assaulted the daughter who made the complaint. But with respect to each charge in the indictment you have to accept the evidence of each complainant with respect to that specific charge or charges relating to the complaint. You cannot say well I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted each of his daughters during their growing up years, therefore he is guilty of each charge. You must look at, for example, [D’s] evidence and ask yourself with respect to each separate charge, am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did to [D] what she alleges she did and likewise with [M], [J] and [S].” 
        
       
      
    164    It is unnecessary to consider whether these directions were or were not appropriate for the pre-Graham era. Two particular criticisms are now made. The first is that the direction that the jury could use the evidence of complaint as evidence of the fact that the appellant had sexually assaulted the complainant amounted to an invitation to the jury to engage in an impermissible reasoning process in relation to specific counts. Although the point is of general application, it can be illustrated by reference to the complaint evidence relating to J. That was the evidence that, on a “recent” (as at the time of giving evidence) overseas trip, she had said something, not otherwise elucidated, to her travelling companion. The submission was made that in this direction his Honour was inviting the jury to reason that because J had told her companion that the appellant had abused her, that could be used by the jury to establish that that the appellant had in fact committed the specific offences charged in the third and sixth counts.  
     
      
    165    It is true (as set out above) that evidence of complaint, when properly admissible under s 66, can be received as evidence of the fact that an accused person did the act described in the complaint. Where the act described in the complaint can be seen by the terms of the complaint and the allegation before the jury to be the act the subject of the charge then a direction in the terms here given would be unexceptional. But that is not the case here. In not one of the complaints was any specific act described. Each was a complaint of sexual abuse or molestation in the most general terms. The generality of the terms in which each complaint was framed undermined the degree to which it could be said to give support to any specific allegation. Because of the generality of the terms in which each complaint was framed, the only practical use that the jury could have made of the evidence was to reason that if the appellant had behaved as alleged in the complaint, it was more likely that he had committed the specific acts the subject of the charges. The point may perhaps more clearly be stated by an illustration with reference to another of the complaints. Take, for example, the evidence of the complaint by D to M that the appellant had “penetrated me and such”. D was about ten years of age at the time of the conversation. The specific counts relating to D were counts 7, 8, 9 and 10. Count 7 was an allegation of assault with an act of indecency, falling short of penetration. The complaint, therefore, could not be used to support that allegation. Count 10 was an allegation of assault with intent carnally to know C, again, falling short of an act of penetration, and also was alleged to have occurred when D was eleven, and therefore after the conversation in question. The complaint could, therefore, not support that count. It could best support either the allegation contained in count 8 or that contained in count 9, each of which was an allegation of carnal knowledge that pre dated the conversation. The statement made by D to M (assuming, of course, that the jury accepted the evidence) was capable of supporting either of those charges, or indeed both, but, obviously care needed to be taken to avoid the substitution of that evidence for specific evidence of a specific occurrence. The directions given by the trial judge at the end of the paragraph quoted were sufficient to draw to the jury’s attention the need for care of that kind. 
     
      
    166    The second criticism that was made of the directions relates to the passage extracted above at paragraph 162. The criticism was simply that, as none of the complainants had given evidence about the difficulty she experienced in describing the conduct she alleged, the directions left the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “with an inaccurate and highly prejudicial impression which had no foundation in the evidence led in the case”. 
        
       
      
    167    I would reject this criticism. It is, as his Honour suggested to the jury, a matter of common sense and common experience that young children the subject of sexual abuse might find it difficult to describe that sexual abuse and that might well explain the delay in reporting the conduct to anybody in authority. In my view the direction was valid and correct. 
     
      
    168    The overall difficulty with the directions given, and the subject of the third, and major criticism, is that they were given on the basis that the evidence had been admissible and admitted under s 66. No directions were given that were appropriate to the admission of the evidence under s 108 (3). As I have observed above, it is by no means certain that the evidence would have been admitted under that subsection had the correct position in relation to s 66 been appreciated. The question which now arises is whether any miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. This calls for an evaluation of the importance the complaint evidence assumed in the trial. Certainly, in mathematical terms, it occupied a substantial portion of the summing up, but the answer to this question depends upon a proper appreciation of all of the evidence in the trial. It can be seen, from the evidence outlined above, that the evidence of complaint was vague and unspecific and invariably unrelated to any of the specific charges. Despite the attention paid to it in the summing up, it is not evidence that could be taken to have affected the jury to any substantial degree. Taken in conjunction with the other evidence, it was of relatively minor import. What may be taken to have been more compelling were the direct accounts of repeated sexual abuse given by each of the appellant’s four daughters, the accounts of three of them of accusation made directly to the appellant, and his subsequent incriminating responses.  
     
      
    169    In the circumstances, although I am satisfied that the evidence was wrongly admitted under s 66, and may not, had the proper tests been applied, have been admitted under s 108(3), and even if it had been, would have called for directions different to those which were given, no miscarriage of justice has occurred. I would reject the grounds of appeal concerned with the evidence of complaint.

    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was found guilty of murder. His defence at trial and in this Court was that of diminished responsibility pursuant to s23A of the Crimes Act 1900. The only ground of appeal is that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the medical evidence which, it is submitted, clearly establishes the defence of diminished responsibility. 
     
      
    2    On 21 March 1996 the Appellant shot his wife outside the Family Court in Parramatta a number of times, with the last shot at close range to her head.  
     
      
    3    The submissions of both the Appellant and the Crown accepted that three conditions must be made out, namely, the jury must be satisfied that at the time of the killing the Appellant was:  
     
      
       
      (i) suffering from an abnormality of mind; 
       
       
      (ii) that the abnormality arose from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or from some inherent cause or was induced by disease or injury;  
       
       
      (iii) that the abnormality substantially impaired the accused's mental responsibility for the act. 
       
      
    4    The Crown accepted that conditions (i) and (ii) had been made out. Issue is joined on condition (iii) namely whether the abnormality of mind substantially impaired the Appellant’s mental responsibility for the killing. 
     
      
    5    With respect to this third element the issue for this Court is whether it was open to the jury to reject the defence of diminished responsibility on the evidence before it. 
     
      
    6    Two psychiatrists were called in the defence case, both with varying qualifications to which I will presently refer, who gave evidence in support of the defence. 
     
      
    7    The Appellant accepted the statement of principle in this respect of Badgery-Parker J in R v Tumanako (1992) 64 A Crim R 149 at 160 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Because the existence of the first and the third elements are matters for determination by the jury being matters of degree not capable of scientific measurement, and the jury is entitled to approach them in a broad commonsense way and not necessarily in accordance with the medical evidence, on neither issue is the jury, bound to accept the medical evidence if there is other material before it which in the judgment of the jury, conflicts with it and outweighs it."" 
        
       
      
    8    The Appellant, accordingly, had to submit, and did submit, that there was no other material before the jury which conflicted with the medical evidence and outweighed it. 
     
      
    9    In his written submissions the Appellant did not focus on the fact that the existence of such material was a matter for ""the judgment of the jury"", as Badgery-Parker J put it. The Appellant did accept the conclusion of Badgery-Parker J at 160-161: 
     
      
       
        
        ""On any of the three issues in the case, it is open to the jury to reach a conclusion different from that expressed by the medical experts, but only where there is other evidence displacing or throwing doubt upon it, or where the medical evidence is not unanimous."" 
        
       
      
    10    The third element in the defence of diminished responsibility was considered by Hunt CJ at CL, in R v Trotter (1993) 68 A Crim R 536. His Honour said at 537-538: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the tribunal of fact is not bound to accept the medical evidence where there is other material before it which, in its judgment, conflicts with it and outweighs it [ 
        Byrne  
        [1960] 2 QB 396 at 403]. Such material includes the nature of the killing, the conduct of the accused before, at the time and after the killing and any history of mental abnormality:  
        Walton  
        [1978] AC 788 at 793. The tribunal is in any event entitled to consider the quality and the weight of the expert medical evidence (at 793). 
        
       
       
        
        The 'crucial' question in the defence of diminished responsibility is, however, whether the impairment of the accused's mental responsibility for his act was substantial:  
        Byrne 
         (at 403). Some impairment is not sufficient; if the abnormality of mind did not really make any great difference, even though it may have made it harder for the accused to control himself, the impairment is not substantial ... . 
        
       
       
        
        It was held in  
        Byrne 
         (at 404) that medical evidence is relevant to this question as well, but not decisive of it. The Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out (at 403-404) that the question involved matters of degree, and that it is one which is essentially for the jury. And, as the question is not merely a medical one of whether there was an impairment but also whether that impairment can 'properly' be called substantial, it was pointed out (at 404) that this is a matter upon which juries make quite legitimately differ from the medical experts. See also  
        Lloyd 
         [[1967] 1 QB 175 at 179]. It is often put to juries that an impairment is substantial if it is such as warrants the reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter:  
        Ignjatic  
        (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 346-347. 
        
       
       
        
        Those criteria demonstrate why expert medical evidence is not really of great assistance in determining this crucial question of whether the impairment is substantial. The doctors are obviously qualified to say whether the extent of the particular impairment to the accused's perceptions, judgment and self-control is slight, moderate or extensive, or somewhere in between, but whether that impairment to the accused's mental responsibility for his actions may 'properly' be called substantial (in the sense of being such as to warrant the reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter) is  
        not 
         a matter within the expertise of the medical profession. That is a task for the tribunal of fact, which must approach that task in a broad commonsense way:  
        Byrne 
         (at 404);  
        Walton  
        (at 793). It involves a value judgment by the jury representing the community (or by a judge where there is no jury), not a finding of medical fact."" 
        
       
      
    11    This passage was substantially reproduced by Hunt CJ at CL with whom Grove and Allen JJ agreed in R v Ryan (1995) 90 A Crim R 191 at 195-196.  
     
      
    12    The Crown also referred to the judgment of this Court in Regina v Gieselmann (Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 November 1996, unreported). In that case there was a substantial unanimity of professional opinion. Nevertheless, this Court held that the jury was entitled to rely on other evidence with respect to the third element of substantial impairment. (See for example at 34-36 per Sully J.) 
     
      
    13    The Appellant relied on the evidence given at the trial by two psychiatrists, Dr Canaris and Dr Shand. Dr Canaris was, in fact, engaged by the Crown to examine the Appellant although he was ultimately called in the defence case. As is often the case in such matters the opinions of the psychiatrists were based on a version of the events given to them by the Appellant. As is the case with all forms of expert opinion evidence, the extent to which reliance can be placed by the tribunal of fact on an expression of opinion depends on whether the factual assumptions upon which the opinion has been based are otherwise made out in the evidence. In this case in a number of respects that proved not to be so. 
     
      
    14    The weight which the jury was entitled to give to the opinion of Dr Canaris was affected further by two factors. First, at the commencement of his cross-examination, Dr Canaris accepted the proposition that whenever he was asked to give an opinion on matters of this character, he began with the proposition that he would want to make a finding of diminished responsibility ""If I can"". Secondly, in his evidence-in-chief Dr Canaris introduced his conclusion with the words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… the reality is this is a very difficult case - or it is not straight forward."" 
        
       
      
    15    He gave evidence of the following character by way of conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… Mr Hoss is anything but a well adjusted man. There is evidence of substantial disturbance in his functioning going as far back as his early childhood his experience of rape at a young age with a decidedly unhelpful if not grossly destructive response from his mother seems to have set the tone for his life. From what he told me he seems to have suffered from a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD is the common way that that is abbreviated, [arising] from the rape perpetrated on him at the age of 9 years. There had been periodic exacerbations of his disorders in which he has become overtly anxious, depressed, sleepless and suicidal with increasingly intrusive recollections of the rape. His depression has at time been of moderate to severe intensity and there is strong evidence that he has been strongly suicidal in the past. He claims no recollection whatsoever of the actual shooting of his wife saying that he had purchased the gun solely with the intention of killing himself if he were not allowed access to his children ... . 
        
       
       
        
        Taking his account entirely at face value Mr Hoss would be a serious contender for a defence of diminished responsibility. This would be on the basis of a chronic pre-existing and substantial disorder of mood with features of anxiety and depression arising in the context of a diagnosis of PTSD. ... His personality development was in all likelihood substantially flawed because of the combined impact of the sexual abuse and the chronic PTSD giving rise to a reasonable probability that his judgment at the time of the shooting was significantly impaired. We would still have a problem in defining the precise connection between his mood state and the shooting because of his claim to have no recollection whatever of his actions."" 
        
       
      
    16    At trial the thrust of the Crown's cross-examination of Dr Canaris was the identification of a number of factual matters which Dr Canaris had accepted from the Appellant and which were disputed. On this appeal the Crown directed attention to two specific matters: 
     
      
       
      (i) The Appellant had originally denied to Dr Canaris that there was any violence in the marital relationship, contrary to a considerable body of evidence. 
       
       
      (ii) The Appellant had told Dr Canaris that immediately after shooting his wife he had put the gun up to his own head in an attempt to commit suicide. A number of eye witnesses indicated that nothing of that character had occurred and, indeed, the Appellant agreed in cross-examination that it had not occurred. 
       
      
    17    During the course of his cross-examination Dr Canaris accepted that he had earlier indicated that on the basis of these two matters, namely the denial, contrary to the fact, of a history of violence towards his wife and the assertion, also contrary to the fact, that the Appellant had put the gun to his head, that in the absence of those circumstances it was ""very difficult to support a defence of diminished responsibility"". 
     
      
    18    The jury was entitled to give weight to the fact that there was no attempt at suicide on this occasion. The circumstances were that the accused had bought a gun which he claimed he had acquired for the purposes of committing suicide, carried it with him on his person to the Family Court and, on no occasion, made any attempt to commit suicide, including in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, as attested to by a number of independent eye witnesses. They testified that the shots, and particularly the last shot at close range, was delivered quite calmly, after which the Appellant smiled and walked away slowly. These are aspects of the specific conduct of the accused which are inconsistent with the factual assumptions on which Dr Canaris based his expert opinion and themselves are matters entitled to be taken into account and given weight by the jury in assessing the third element of the defence of diminished responsibility, namely the issue of substantial impairment. 
     
      
    19    The other expert psychiatrist called was Dr Shand who gave evidence to the effect that the Appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... suffers from substantial personality disorder in association with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder with depressed and anxious moods if one accepts the accuracy of the history."" 
        
       
      
    20    In the course of his evidence Dr Shand said, as had Dr Canaris, that additional material had become available to him which indicated that some of the aspects of the history reported to him by the Appellant may not be accurate. Furthermore, during the course of his cross-examination, counsel for the Crown put six factual matters to Dr Shand with a view to expressing an opinion as to what, if any, effect these factual matters may have on the opinion he had previously expressed. These were: 
     
      
       
      (i) The Appellant had previously threatened to kill his wife. 
       
       
      (ii) On the day of the killing no words were spoken by the wife apart from shooing him away. 
       
       
      (iii) After having shot her four times, when she was lying on the ground, the Appellant walked up and fired the final shot point blank into her head. 
       
       
      (iv) He made no gesture of holding the gun up to his own head in an attempt to commit suicide. 
       
       
      (v) He was seen to be smiling after he shot his wife while walking into the court and then afterwards inside the court. 
       
       
      (vi) The reason why he took the gun out of the car on that day was not because of safety concerns about the gun in a car with a door that did not lock. 
       
      
    21    Dr Shand said that his opinion could vary as a result of two of the six factors and possibly a third. The two factors were that he did not hold the gun to the head and that the reason for taking the gun was not for security reasons. The one factor about which it was not ""possible to arrive at a firm conclusion"" was the reference to smiling. 
     
      
    22    There was a body of evidence which supported each of the factual propositions put by the Crown to Dr Shand. In the event Dr Shand accepted that in the light of these factors: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It would detract from ... my confidence in the diagnosis to some extent."" 
        
       
      
    23    Dr Shand maintained that the accused was entitled to claim diminished responsibility and added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I think it is a reasonable claim in the psychiatric sense under the circumstances. But ... if one assumes the facts that you have given me."" 
        
       
      
    24    Dr Shand accepted that whilst he continued to support the claim, he did so ""less confidently"".  
     
      
    25    This aspect of the degree of confidence with which psychiatrists express an opinion after cross-examination by the Crown - the opinions expressed by both of the psychiatrists being so qualified - is a matter of significance for the jury in attributing weight to those opinions and in determining the issue of ""substantial impairment"" which, as I have indicated above, is very much a matter of judgment for the jury. 
     
      
    26    In this case other evidence was also available to the jury which entitled it to come to the view that it did on the issue of substantial impairment. I refer in particular to the evidence of a psychologist and another psychiatrist who had seen the Appellant prior to the shooting.  
     
      
    27    Dr David Fox was consulted by the Appellant and his wife on three occasions. He also saw the Appellant on a number of occasions alone. He gave evidence of the pattern of violence in the relationship and also of the deceased's assertion of homicidal threats against her by her husband. It was to Dr Fox that the Appellant had originally revealed the fact that he had been raped as a nine year old. 
     
      
    28    Dr Fox gave the following evidence in the course of cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I did not regard him in need of psychiatric treatment or assessment ... 
        
       
       
        
        I did not regard him as needing it. I did not see him as being different from normal people."" 
        
       
      
    29    Dr Fox elaborated on this evidence in re-examination:  
     
      
       
        
        ""He did not present as different from normal people. He was agitated, he was anxious, he didn’t understand what had been the basis of his abusive relationship with his wife. He was short of information. He gained that information in the sessions with me. I left him with the option to recontact me which he did not make use of because he was in Sydney, I assumed and I didn’t see it necessary to refer him on for any psychiatric assessment because at that point he was not showing any evidence of psychiatric problem. I have worked in psychiatric hospitals and a psychiatric assessment centre in Canberra. I know very well what the symptoms are which would mean I would refer someone off to see a psychiatrist. He didn’t show any symptoms of psychosis and he didn’t have any of the symptoms that normally make me send him off to somebody else, so I did not do so."" 
        
       
      
    30    Dr Juozas Ziukelis was a qualified medical practitioner and psychiatrist. He saw the Appellant alone in August 1995 and saw him together with his wife in September 1995. He had been told by the Appellant, when interviewed alone, that the Appellant had attempted suicide before. He had conducted a mental-state examination of the Appellant. He noted that his conclusion was that he could not find any features that would be in keeping with a mental illness. He did not see evidence of abnormality or of a depressed mood or of psychotic features.  
     
      
    31    Of further significance for the jury was the fact that it had before it a record of interview conducted with the Appellant on the very day of the shooting. It was able to observe the Appellant and his conduct as well as observe the answers to specific questions. It consisted of admissions that he had shot his wife, but also of a long period of questioning about his relationship with his wife and the cause of their dispute. The jury had an opportunity to observe the Appellant. It was also during the course of this record of interview that he gave evidence to the effect that he had put the gun to his head and it did not click. This, as I have indicated above, was contradicted by the eye witnesses. 
     
      
    32    In my view the jury did have before it a body of evidence about the killing including the conduct of the Appellant before, at the time of and after the killing, of a character which enabled them to assess for themselves the question of whether or not the mental abnormality of the Appellant substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the act. 
     
      
    33    In the light of these factors, together with the qualifications of the expert evidence upon which the Appellant primarily relies, and which the experts themselves gave in the course of their evidence, it was open to the jury to reject the claim of diminished responsibility. 
     
      
    34    I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    35    NEWMAN J: I agree. 
     
      
    36    ADAMS J: I agree. It is important to note that the value judgment by the jury representing the community to which his Honour the Chief Judge at Common Law adverted in Regina v Ryan is a decision about culpability. Hence it is not a medical question. This point has now been made clear by the provisions of the present s23A. I agree with the order proposed. 
     
      
    37    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is appeal dismissed.

     SENTENCE 
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR: The prisoner has pleaded guilty to manslaughter which plea of guilty was accepted by the Crown in discharge of indictment for murder on the ground that the prisoner has available to him the partial defence of diminished responsibility.  
      
       
      
     2     
     The victim was the prisoner’s wife, Sophie. The courts are not unfamiliar with crimes involving the killing of a spouse. The culpability of the killer can range between extremes of gravity. In this instance there is an unusual degree of tragedy and I have concluded that the prisoner should have his culpability assessed towards the lower end of the possible range. I will relate some facts and circumstances which have led me to that conclusion. 
      
       
      
     3     
     In the early afternoon of 12 March 1999 the prisoner telephoned the 000 emergency service and reported that his deceased wife could be found at their home. Unsurprisingly, communication was garbled but the thrust of it was that he did not want his school student sons to come home and find their mother. He also made reference to the location of his car and some papers within it near Sydney University. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Police went to the house and found the deceased. A black handled knife protruded from the chest area. The knife was of the conventional kitchen utensil type. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The prisoner was employed on the maintenance staff of Sydney University. Police located his vehicle in accordance with the information provided in the emergency call. While they were inspecting it the prisoner was noticed on the roof of the twelve storey Fisher Library in the University grounds. His behaviour was assessed as manifesting considerable distress and it is obvious that fears were held that he might jump from the roof. He was, however, coaxed away and arrested. 
      
       
      
     6     
     He was interviewed by detectives at some length. He did not deny his perpetration of the stabbing and was able to give some description of the surrounding events but there were gaps in his memory. The content of the interview does not suggest that the prisoner was deliberately withholding information from the questioners and I accept his claims as to deficiency of recall. As Dr Westmore commented, the prisoner has some incomplete memory of the stabbing and no memory of getting the knife. He described himself as being in a trance-like state.  
      
       
      
     7     
     It appears that the trigger, or at least one of the immediate triggers, for the events which developed into the homicide was an assertion by the wife that the prisoner’s sister was feigning serious illness. In fact his sister who resides in Germany is ailing but this dispute was but one incident in a culmination of matters which are of significance in the construct which led to the death. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The evidence of Dr Collins, which I accept, shows that it is highly likely that at the time of Sophie Jans’ death she was suffering from Huntington’s Chorea. This disease manifests itself in bizarre body movements but more importantly it involves dementia. The disease is genetic in origin and it is reported that it is associated with a single autosomal dominant gene with virtually 100 percent rate of manifestation. Therefore approximately half of the offspring of an affected person can be expected to develop the disorder. There is anecdotal evidence that Sophie Jans’ father had the disease and clinical evidence that her mother suffered a significant psychiatric condition. 
      
       
      
     9     
     Until about five or six years ago the prisoner and his wife enjoyed a satisfactory married life of apparently mutual devotion. They had reared and cared for three sons. Sophie Jans commenced to make unsubstantiated allegations against the prisoner. There is no present need to detail all of them. Prominent among them was an assertion that the prisoner was engaged in homosexual activity including molestation of children. Concurrently he was accused of infidelity in the marriage. Sophie became more and more aggressive and hostile and her berating of her husband came to be accompanied by occasional beating and pummelling. The prisoner sought some advice at one time and was told that he might apply for an apprehended violence order but he was unwilling to do this against his wife. She announced that she intended to seek a divorce. There is no evidence of any conduct by the prisoner which would have provoked this behaviour on the part of his wife nor indeed provoked a wish on any reasonable ground to terminate the marriage. His general response was passivity although, as might be expected, others including the children interpreted some exchanges as arguments between the couple. I am sure there were on occasions as the prisoner’s capacity for restraint was eroded by constant harassment and assailment.

     I am satisfied that Sophie Jans’ behaviour was symptomatic of the onset of disease. Complaints by her to others of the prisoner’s conduct are likely to be insubstantial products of developing dementia.  
      
       
      
     11     
     It contributes to the tragedy that no diagnosis of the disease was made. With hindsight, reasons for this can be discerned. Super added to this illness Sophie Jans developed physical ailment in the form of cancer, the treatment for which included mastectomy and chemo therapy. Understandably her family thought that her odd behaviour and rantings may have been associated with her sufferings from this condition and the radical aspects of its treatment. The eldest son is a professional nurse and he spoke to a number of people, informally I would gather, and suggestions were made of the development of paranoid schizophrenic tendencies. Huntington’s Chorea was not identified.  
      
       
      
     12     
     I have been presented with a large volume of evidence of observation over this period, very valuable amongst which are the statements by the prisoner and Sophie’s three sons. I am satisfied that the prisoner was the focus of repetitive false accusation by his wife and the victim of long standing and sustained violence on her part. No fault attaches to her for this. It can now be judged that her conduct was a result of her illness but as Dr Canaris commented, the prisoner appears to have sought to deal with what was directed at him in a quiet and unassuming way trying to pacify her or making no response. Dr Canaris thought that the prisoner’s distress over his wife’s demise seemed very genuine and he thought that his account showed that he loved her dearly. It is plain that at the time neither he nor anybody else recognized her descent into dementia. Indeed, in early 1999 Sophie Jans was seeing a counsellor at a community welfare service whose notes suggest that her allegations against the prisoner of bisexuality, sexual abuse, trauma and manipulation were taken at face value. I am satisfied that these allegations were not factual and were the products of mental illness. The counsellor did recognize however that Sophie Jans appeared agitated and secretive at times. 
      
       
      
     13     
     All of this information about the affliction of Sophie Jans is essentially relevant only as background to assessing the effect upon the prisoner. Her mental state was a contributing factor in the development of depression in the prisoner. At the time of the killing he was undergoing a major depressive episode. During a period when he was under considerable emotional stress he became in part dissociated and as Dr Neilssen opined, the dissociation resulted in a substantial impairment of the prisoner’s awareness and self control at the time of the offence. Dr Neilssen added by way of elaboration that an abnormality of mind of this kind would explain how a dutiful and previously law abiding person might have come to kill his wife. 
      
       
      
     14     
     About the event itself, Dr Westmore commented that he thought the prisoner (in the light of the history only a small portion of which I have sketched) experienced a sudden, acute decompensation which overwhelmed his defence mechanisms and which occurred in the face of extreme and for him, intolerable pressure. 
      
       
      
     15     
     Psychiatric opinion is unanimous that the prisoner poses no future threat to the community. Dr Canaris wrote that this was a killing which occurred in utterly unusual circumstances and was an event exceedingly unlikely to occur again. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The prisoner is fifty five years of age. He has no other convictions. I regard the expressed attitude of the prisoner’s sons who have, of course, lost their mother as of prime significance. I would quote from some statements that they have made recently. The eldest stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “I know what he did was wrong. I am not questioning that but at the same time I know the limit that he was pushed to. He would come home from work for a full day and then do cooking, washing and getting ready for school the next day and try to do everything you can do to please wife and then you get hit upon or verbally abused such as molesting children. It eventually wears you thin. At the same time you go to community supports such as counsellors, doctors, police and you go through all those courses and they do not help. He has always got our support.” 
         
        
       
      
     17     
     The middle son described his relationship with his father as “dropped off a lot since this happened” but he concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “I understand a bit what happened but I am not 100 percent sure. I think Dad started losing it after Mum starting saying those things and couldn’t handle it any more.” 
         
        
       
      
     18     
     The youngest, aged fifteen and a school student wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “I know what happened was wrong what Dad did but I understand how Dad ‘clicked it’. That does happen to some people. I forgive him for that, what he done. He lives with us now. Our relationship is quite good.” 
         
        
       
      
     19     
     The prisoner was in custody for close to six months prior to being granted bail and I take that imprisonment into account.  
      
       
      
     20     
     I am satisfied that there is no need in any practical sense to construct a sentence directed to the rehabilitation of the prisoner. The prospect of further offence of any kind is predictably remote. As were the medical examiners, I am persuaded that the prisoner is truly remorseful and, as Dr Westmore in particular noted, he has good insight and understanding about the impact of what he has done on his children. 
      
       
      
     21     
     All the foregoing having been said, it must not be overlooked that the felonious taking of human life is intrinsically serious. I have given consideration to whether the objective seriousness of so doing and the needs of denunciation and retribution produce an imperative for the imposition of imprisonment, whether to be served full time or in periodic detention. 
      
       
      
     22     
     It will never be known exactly what led to the outburst of violence which resulted in fatality nor all of the motivational contributors to it. I am satisfied that the prisoner does not know. There are, apart from the psychiatric opinion which I accept, a number of indicators of the extreme seriousness of the state into which the prisoner had descended. No one who observed the events at the Fisher Library suggested that there was any apparent element of pretence in the prisoner’s conduct. His appearance during the police interview would impress any observer as viewing a man in an abnormal state. There are descriptions of tender treatment of the prisoner in custody by those charged with his confinement. The relevance of this is conveniently summarized by Dr Canaris: 
      
       
        
         
         “The fact that his dissociation was pathological in nature has further emphasised that it appears to have continued for a good couple of weeks or so after the stabbing - witness his account of being in a ‘daze’ whilst at Silverwater Jail. I was somewhat bemused by his characterisation of the prison officers as ‘nice’ and ‘very helpful’. While I do not wish to demonise prison officers, it is the first time I have heard them described in this fashion over any length of time. It highlights, I suspect, the air of helpless dependence he must have emanated during that time.” 
         
        
       
      
     23     
     In general terms, I would be reluctant to conclude that a resort to violence with fatal result could be accompanied by subjective features which could outweigh the objective seriousness so as to avoid sentence of full time custody. In the present case, I am persuaded that the abnormality of mind which reduced the culpability of the prisoner so that what would have been murder became manslaughter was of such scale and extent as also to markedly reduce the level of his culpability for that lesser offence. Although Sophie Jans’ illness has the consequence that her conduct was not deliberately provocative, it should not be overlooked that what was directed at the prisoner was an attrition extending for years and eventually he succumbed into a pathological dissociation. 
      
       
      
     24     
     I have come to the conclusion that in, to quote Dr Canaris again, the utterly unusual circumstances of this case, the needs of justice will be fulfilled by a conditional release of the prisoner. 
      
       
      
     25     
     Gunter Detlef Jans for the manslaughter of Sophie Jans, in lieu of imposing a sentence of imprisonment you are to enter a good behaviour bond for a period of four years from this date upon the following conditions: 
      
       
        
       (1) That you will appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during that term; 
        
        
       (2) That you will be of good behaviour; and 
        
        
       (3) You will inform the Registrar of the Supreme Court of any change in your residential address during the term of the bond.

       JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      
    1    MASON P: I agree with Heydon JA. 
     
      
    2    HEYDON JA: The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of being knowingly concerned in the importation of prohibited imports contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The prohibited imports were of the drug commonly known as “Ecstasy”. The maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment. He was sentenced by Judge Davidson QC to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years and six months. He was also sentenced to a fixed term of nine months in respect of a charge of supplying cannabis contrary to the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) ss 25 and 29. He does not appeal against that sentence. He asked that there be taken into consideration offences of possessing a flick knife and a knuckle duster contrary to the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989 (NSW), s 5(1)(a).  
     
      
    3    The background facts were described thus by the sentencing judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 11 November 1997 at Melbourne two packages, one addressed to a person at 4 Opal Place and another at 44 Daisy Street were intercepted in Melbourne. The preliminary investigations revealed a quantity of Ecstasy tablets, and there was a controlled delivery in respect of each of these packages arranged. One of them contained a gross quantity of 286 grams of the substance Ecstasy and the other 286.3 grams, making a total of 572.3 grams. The quantity of pure Ecstasy on analysis was determined at 146.5 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        Officers of the Australian Federal Police observed the delivery of the package to each of the two addresses. The package delivered to 4 Opal Place was delivered to one Stacey Carter, who I am told has not been charged, and that at 44 Daisy Street to one Rosa Aravina, who was charged but together with another person, Cecil Solomons, was acquitted. 
        
       
       
        
        The packages were delivered into your possession by a route which is unnecessary for me to trace in the statement of facts and your movements were further observed to take you to a place called Rent-a-Space Storage at Girraween. Subsequently, search warrants were obtained and executed in respect of those storage premises and also, as I understand it, at your own premises in Parramatta. At the Rent-a-Space Storage units there was found the controlled delivery of which I have spoken relating to Opal Place in one unit and in another there was found the controlled delivery to the other address. There was also found in a storage unit, number 258, to which you had access and which was registered in your name, $115,000 in cash, shopping bags containing cannabis, which is the subject matter of course of the State charge to which you have pleaded guilty, a flick knife and a knuckle duster, which are of course the subject matter of the matters which you have asked that I take into consideration, and there were also of course the material linked to the controlled delivery. 
        
       
       
        
        The search at your premises in Hurley Street, Parramatta, revealed a number of magazines relating to the cultivation of cannabis, a set of electronic scales, a Vac Seal heat-sealing machine, hydroponic equipment, including lamps, lights and fertiliser and other materials. The total quantity of cannabis located in the storage unit was 3,209 grams in the form of cannabis leaf. The evidence discloses that the quantity of Ecstasy recovered, if sold for $50 per tablet, would have brought $95,350 on the market and the quantity of cannabis if sold at $40 per gram $128,360.” 
        
       
      
    4    The quantity involved, 146.5 grams of pure Ecstasy, was well in excess of a trafficable quantity (0.5 gram).  
     
      
       
      The applicant’s arguments 
      
    5    The applicant contends that the sentence for Ecstasy importation is excessive on three grounds. 
     
      
    6    The first ground related to the following passage in the remarks of the sentencing judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that your role was that of a principal in the sense that you were engaged in the ultimate supply to members of the public, if this matter had progressed that far, for profit.”  
        
       
       
      The complaint was that the sentencing judge erred in describing the applicant as a principal engaged in the ultimate supply of Ecstasy to the public for profit. It was argued that there was no, or inadequate, material in the agreed facts to establish that beyond reasonable doubt. The applicant submitted: 
       
       
        
        “The finding by the learned judge that the applicant was a principal and further that he was engaged in the supply of Ecstasy to the public for profit seems to run counter to the observations made in the joint judgment of the majority of the High Court in  
        Olbrich 
         regarding the extent to which it is permissible to take into account other conduct of an offender which may follow an act of importation but which may represent criminality of a different kind which, if it is to be taken into account for the purpose of sentence, should be the subject of separate and different charges.” 
        
       
       
      That is a reference to  
      R v Olbrich 
       (1999) 73 ALJR 1550 at 1553 para [18] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ. That case was argued and decided well after the sentence hearing in this case. Those majority justices said: 
       
       
        
        “inquiring about what was done or intended by a person who imported drugs into Australia (apart, that is, from the acts which constitute the importation) will not always be relevant to sentencing that offender for the crime of importation. The offender may have conspired with others to import the drugs; the offender may very well have intended to deal with the drugs in Australia in ways that amount to the commission of other offences in this country. But it would be quite wrong to sentence an offender for crimes with which that offender is not charged.” 
        
       
       
      It is to be noted that the justices said the inquiry will not  
      always 
       be relevant. The question is whether the sentence was a sentence for the crime charged or a sentence for other crimes not charged. 
       
      
    7    The majority justices also said at 1554, para [19], that while distinguishing between couriers and principals may in some cases be a useful shorthand description of the different kinds of participation in a single enterprise, it will not always be so; and characterising the offender as a “courier” or as a “principal” must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did.  
     
      
    8    In R v Olbrich at 1554 para [22] the majority justices said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would have been wrong for the primary judge to sentence the respondent on the basis that he was the mastermind (or even an important member) of some larger criminal enterprise. But the primary judge did not do so. He sentenced the respondent as if the respondent had told the police and the court nothing about the circumstances of the event at all.” 
        
       
      
    9    In oral argument counsel for the applicant submitted that the period for which the applicant was under observation was slightly less than twelve hours - from 2.23pm on 14 November 1997 to 1.45am on 15 November 1997. He submitted that nothing was done by the applicant to indicate that he was a “principal”. He submitted that the evidence was equally consistent with him being a “minder of the drug” or “warehouseman” - someone in charge of keeping the drugs in a safe place.  
     
      
    10    It was contended that the sentencing judge’s characterisation of the appellant as a principal stemmed from a Crown submission recorded thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the prisoner should be viewed as a principal dealing in both substances not a mere courier.” 
        
       
      
    11    The applicant also referred to para [57] of Kirby J’s reasons for judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the failure of the respondent to prove that he was a ‘courier’ or ‘mere courier’ did not warrant the conclusion by the sentencing judge that he was therefore a ‘principal’. To so treat the appellant would be to treat, as proved, circumstances of serious aggravation of his offence. The onus of proving such circumstances of aggravation rested on the Crown. The standard of proof which it bore was proof beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
       
      He then referred to parts of paras [60] and [61]: 
       
       
        
        “In the context of the authorities in which the legal dichotomy of ‘courier’ and ‘principal’ are used, the latter classification has a definite connotation as a matter of aggravation in sentencing drug importers. It means a person involved in an organisation of drug importation and distribution with significant responsibilities within a drug supplying or importing chain. A courier, on the other hand, is one ‘involved in a one-off operation’ who falls to be treated within a ‘recognised pattern’ and punished accordingly. … 
        
       
       
        
        [If] the Crown wishes to have an accused person sentenced for circumstances of aggravation which constitute another and different offence, it is obliged to charge and prove that separate offence. Similarly, for a single offence, where the Crown asserts that the case constitutes an aggravated example, it must prove beyond reasonable doubt the facts that demand that conclusion.” 
        
       
      
    12    Counsel for the applicant concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “The finding here that this applicant was a principal and then the description of that finding meaning he was engaged in the ultimate supply to members of the public for profit effectively amounted [not to] a finding he was the mastermind but at least an important member and that is the way in which the term ‘principal’ has been traditionally used in cases of this kind and that is why the Crown sought the finding.” 
        
       
      
    13    The second ground advanced by the applicant merged into the first. The applicant submitted that by reason of the sentencing judge having dealt with the applicant as a principal, he had aggravated the penalty beyond what was appropriate. He referred to the cases collected in an Appendix to the reasons for judgment of Hulme J in R v Bourel (unreported, NSWCCA, 11 December 1998). Of eight of those cases he submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “In all of those cases and in the case of … Bourel himself, the quantity of ecstasy involved is greater than that involved in the applicant’s case. However, in each one of those cases the sentence imposed on the offender is less than that imposed on the applicant.” 
        
       
       
      He referred to two other cases involving sentences slightly higher than those imposed on the applicant, but where the quantity was much greater. He also referred to  
      R v Bigic 
       [2000] NSWCCA 9. He submitted: 
       
       
        
        “That case involved a person who was actively engaged in the organisation of couriers to bring large quantities of ecstasy into Australia. There were two separate acts of importation involving a quantity of drugs said to have a street value estimated between $500,000 and slightly more than $1,000,000. The case therefore involved an offender who was actively engaged in the corruption of others. He received a sentence of 9 years. It is submitted that when the relevant facts for the purpose of sentence of the two cases are compared, then the sentence imposed on this applicant appears excessive compared to that imposed in  
        Bigic 
        .” 
        
       
       
      He also submitted that an eight year sentence was excessive having regard to the guideline judgment in  
      R v Wong and Leung 
       [1999] NSWCCA 420, “in a case where the quantity of drugs involved is in the lower trafficable range and the drug in question is ecstasy”. 
       
      
    14    Finally, counsel for the applicant drew attention to various items of evidence which: 
     
      
       
        
        “established that the applicant was a person who, notwithstanding the seriousness of his offences, had personal qualities which were likely to enhance his prospects of ultimate rehabilitation. He had also expressed significant contrition for his conduct.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      The applicant’s first argument considered 
       
      
    15    I would reject the applicant’s first argument. Even if the applicant could not be described as a “principal” his conduct was such that the sentence imposed was not too severe. But it does not seem erroneous to describe him in the manner the sentencing judge did.  
     
      
    16    So far as the sentencing judge was responding to the Crown Prosecutor’s submission, that submission only drew a distinction between a “mere courier” and the prisoner: the submission evidently characterised a person engaged in any level of activity above that of “mere courier” as a “principal”.  
     
      
    17    The sentencing judge used the word “principal” in a somewhat different sense. He described the applicant not as “the” principal”, but as “a” principal. He used that expression in a particular sense - a person “engaged in the ultimate supply to members of the public … for profit”. It seems that the sentencing judge, in describing the applicant as “a” principal, intended to treat him as more than “a middleman” which, as the sentencing judge pointed out, was how the accused was described in R v Dinic (1997) 149 ALR 488 at 490. In that case Dinic accepted the drugs from the addressee of the parcel, conceded he had had dealings with the forwarder of the parcel and was heard to complain of the low quantity of drugs in the parcel, but there was apparently no evidence comparable to that which the police found in the storage unit, cash box and residence of the applicant.  
     
      
        
       
      
    18    It cannot be said here that the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant on the basis that he was the mastermind, or an important member, of a larger criminal enterprise. But equally it cannot be said that the evidence showed the applicant to be only a “courier” in the sense of being a messenger or minion or runner, and indeed this was conceded. R v Olbrich warns of the need to assess what the accused has done and who the accused was and of the need to ensure that this assessment is not obscured by characterisation of the offender as “courier” or “principal”. In my opinion, the sentencing judge did not, by referring to the applicant as a principal, obscure his assessment of the circumstances. The key circumstances revealed by Exhibit A are the driving by the applicant of his vehicle to 4 Opal Place, Greystanes; his unexplained access to the next door premises at 6 Opal Place (which was not his residence); the placing of the package obtained from 4 Opal Place into his car; his driving to a rendezvous with the recipient of the second package addressed to 44 Daisy Street, Greystanes; his taking possession of a package from that person; placement by him of the substitute tablets from both consignments and the packaging from Opal Place and its legitimate contents into a storage unit to which he held the key; his nexus with the prohibited weapons (the flick knife and knuckle duster) in the storage unit rented in his own name, it having been rented to him for nearly four months; his nexus with the address 6 Opal Place; the large quantity of cash - $115,000 - in a cash box in the storage unit to which he had the key; his possession at his residence of a substantial quantity of cannabis deemed to be for the purpose of supply, together with numerous items relating to the cultivation and supply of that drug and a butterfly knife; and the location in his storage unit of a package containing a child’s toy previously received and addressed in the same name to 4 Opal Place, Greystanes. These circumstances, unexplained, point to the conclusion that the applicant was occupying a relatively senior role in the operation which had brought the Ecstasy from overseas on its journey to the Australian consuming public (the applicant’s counsel accepted that the Ecstasy was not for consumption by the applicant himself). Counsel for the applicant did not submit that any of these circumstances were irrelevant or that the sentencing judge ought not to have regard to them. They were characteristic of a person who was not only more than a mere courier, but also more than a mere minder or warehouseman. A mere minder or warehouseman, for example, would not possess weapons which would be useful to a dealer in drugs. See R v Sultana (1994) 74 A Crim R 27 at 29-30 and 37. The applicant did not offer either to the police or the court any material which might explain and render innocent, or relatively innocent, any of these circumstances. The sentencing judge’s characterisation of the applicant’s conduct and position was not unsound. The fact that the material which he relied on in seeking to identify the role played by the applicant also tended to indicate that the applicant had committed or intended to commit other crimes did not mean that the sentencing judge was punishing the applicant for those crimes.  
     
      
    19    The applicant submitted that there was no evidence that the cash ($115,000) was owned by the applicant, and that the applicant could equally well be minding it for some other person. That and the other circumstances, however, point against the applicant being a mere runner or courier or minder or warehouseman and point towards him being involved for financial gain significantly greater than that which might apply to a runner or courier or minder or warehouseman.  
     
      
    20    The applicant’s reliance on Kirby J’s distinction between “couriers” (persons involved in a one-off operation) and “principals” (persons involved in an organisation of drug importation and distribution with significant responsibilities within a drug supplying or importing chain) does not assist the applicant. The materials and documents with which he was connected pointed to his having “significant responsibilities within a drug supplying or importing chain”, even if they did not point to him being a mastermind.  
     
      
    21    It could be inferred from all the circumstances that the applicant was engaged in professional activity involving a distancing of himself from persons who first received the drugs from abroad, and that if he was not at the most senior level of the enterprise in which he was working, he was not merely an agent acting on behalf of another as a minder or warehouseman.  
     
      
    22    Accordingly, the applicant’s first argument fails.  
     
      
       
      The applicant’s second argument considered 
      
    23    There are difficulties in applying R v Wong and Leung in the present case. One is that that case deals with heroin and cocaine, not Ecstasy. The sentence indicated for dealing in 146.5 grams of heroin or cocaine is 5-7 years. Further, the indicated sentence “is intended to apply to couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation”: para [142]. In oral argument counsel for the applicant accepted that “the evidence is surely consistent with the conclusion that he was something more than a courier”. The evidence also pointed against him being low in the hierarchy: he was above Stacey Carter and Rose Aravina. As to the difference between Ecstasy and heroin/cocaine, the Crown submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is noted that MDMA (ecstasy) has a defined ‘ 
        trafficable quantity 
        ’ pursuant to Schedule 6 to the Customs Act 1901 of .5 of a gram. The requisite quantity of heroin classified as a ‘trafficable’ quantity is 2 grams.  
        
       
       
        
        The commercial quantity of MDMA (ecstasy), being the level at which the maximum sentence is increased from 25 years to life imprisonment, is 500 grams. … 
        
       
       
        
        As observed above, the trafficable quantity for [Ecstasy] is .5 grams, or one-quarter of the amount of heroin required to invoke a maximum penalty of 25 years. In relation to the quantity of drug at which the legislature has increased the available maximum penalty from 25 years to life imprisonment (i.e. the ‘ 
        commercial 
        ’ quantity), the amount of ecstasy required is one-third of the amount of heroin specified as ‘ 
        commercial 
        ’ (500 grams for ecstasy; 1.5 kilograms for heroin).” 
        
       
      
    24    In R v Bimahendali [1999] NSWCCA 409 at para [17], Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ultimately, the best guide is that given by the legislature as to the available penalty, dependent upon whether the drug in question is more or less than the trafficable or commercial quantity proscribed, and not upon an impression or judgment as to its perniciousness when compared with other substances, as to which expert opinion may well differ.” 
        
       
      
    25    The potential sentence structures created by the definitions of trafficable quantity and commercial quantity for Ecstasy and heroin point strongly against treating R v Wong and Leung as being directly applicable so as to lead to the conclusion that because 8 years for Ecstasy was greater than a range of 5-7 years for heroin/cocaine, the 8 year sentence was wrong. Indeed, the applicant submitted no more than that the table set out in R v Wong and Leung was something to be borne in mind in assessing the correctness of an 8 year sentence. In my judgment it has little useful role to play in this case. 
     
      
    26    So far as the applicant relied on R v Bigic, though it is true that the accused in that case was involved in the recruitment of others, he was treated as “a mid level participant”. In my judgment the present facts establish that the applicant was at least that. 
     
      
    27    The primary reliance of the applicant was on the contrast between the sentences in the cases analysed in R v Bourel and the present sentence. What counsel said about those cases appears to be correct, but one case listed in Hulme J’s Appendix not mentioned by him is R v Dizel (unreported, NSWCCA, 23 August 1996). The Court of Criminal Appeal there declined to interfere with a 10 year sentence on an applicant notwithstanding that the quantity of Ecstasy was only 40.9 grams and notwithstanding that the applicant was only a courier; he had been sentenced in 1989 to 6 years imprisonment for importing over a kilogram of cocaine in Japan. Of Bourel himself, Hulme J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Also relevant to any judgment of the applicant’s criminality is his role in the importation … Judge Solomon found that the applicant was a financier, in part or in whole, of the importation of the drugs and that he was to meet a courier, one Stuyck, once Stuyck safely arrived in Australia with the drugs. Thus in terms of its objective features, the quantity involved and the applicant’s role, his offence fell no lower than about the middle of the range. There is a deal to be said for the view the applicant could have been described as a principal but I am content to proceed on the basis of the finding his Honour made.” 
        
       
      
    28    Though the present applicant is not shown to have been a financier, in other respects his role was similar. The Court of Criminal Appeal found that a 7 year sentence was not outside the proper range of Solomon DCJ’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    29    The Crown drew attention to R v Osborne (unreported, NSWCCA, 6 November 1997). In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal did not interfere with an 8 year sentence for importing 240 grams of Ecstasy. The accused carried the drugs into Australia but the sentencing judge said he was not “simply a bare courier” and “his position in the scale would run somewhere close to halfway”. Though the factual circumstances were different, the status of Osborne and the present applicant were not dissimilar. The sentencing judge relied on R v Osborne and it was not inappropriate to do so.  
     
      
    30    There are limits to the utility of minute comparative analysis. The analysis which the applicant has offered - of cases which inevitably display considerable factual variations - does not demonstrate that the 8 year sentence on him was beyond a proper sentencing range. In short, even if the sentencing judge erred in employing a distinction between principals and others, and even if the applicant is thought in no sense to be a principal, an 8 year sentence does not suggest, in the present circumstances, any sentencing error.  
     
      
       
      The applicant’s third argument considered 
      
    31    There is no reason to suppose that the favourable aspects of the applicant’s conduct referred to in his character evidence were not properly taken into account by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
      
    32    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
       
       
      2. Dismiss the appeal. 
       
      
    33    SMART AJ: I agree with Heydon JA.

     1     
     GROVE J : 
       
      This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 23 July 1999. On that occasion that applicant pleaded guilty to three counts charging breaking, entering and stealing, possessing an implement capable of being used to enter a conveyance and taking and driving a conveyance. In addition some matters were taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act. 
      
       
      
     2     
     His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of two years and six months with an additional term of ten months in respect of the first count and to concurrent fixed terms of twelve months on the other two counts, those sentences being completely subsumed within the enveloping sentence on the first count. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The applicant has a record of considerable length and he has submitted to the Court that his problems have been derived from drug-taking and his inability to cope with stresses in his life. He is but twenty-four years of age. He has indicated that he has not previously had an opportunity for rehabilitation and he has produced to the Court today a certificate showing that he has attended a stress management course and also a letter from Mr Noonan, a drug and alcohol counsellor attached to the Department of Corrective Services. It should be said at the outset that Mr Noonan misunderstands the function of this Court in that it appears from his letter that he assumes that the applicant is before this Court for sentencing. That is not so. 
      
       
      
     4     
     It should be explained to the applicant that this is what is described as a court of error and our jurisdiction to intervene and quash and substitute sentences is dependent upon the demonstration of something in the Court below which could be described as such. The jurisdiction of this Court is not to engage in sentencing as a fresh exercise. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The applicant has pointed out that the learned sentencing judge when dealing with him expressed some pessimism about the likely outcome of the rehabilitation of the applicant and he said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The only way he can impress people is by showing them that he is making genuine efforts to do something concerning the problem that he has. When he does that people will be able to assist him. When I say 'people' I mean including the Courts but until such time as something is put before the Court that is indicative of the fact that he really is trying to help himself, there is not much the Court can do other than impose a custodial sentence on him."" 
         
        
       
       
      
     6     
     The applicant has apparently taken his Honour's words to heart and it is encouraging to see that he is focused upon the prospect of some rehabilitative training. He specifically made a submission to the Court that the additional term component of his sentence being but ten months, he estimates that this is rather too short a period and he asked that this Court readjust his sentence so that he could be at liberty for a further ten months. 
      
       
      
     7     
     As I have said, the intervention of this Court is dependent upon there being shown some error in the Court below. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The applicant has pointed out that since being committed to custody he has been the victim of an assault and that as a result he is being kept on protection. No doubt the circumstances of his incarceration are thereby rendered the more onerous. The situation is simply that this and other events to which he refers which are subsequent to his sentencing do not in themselves either individually or in combination provoke intervention by this Court. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The sentence imposed in the District Court was well within the range of sound exercise of discretion and there is no factual error manifest in his Honour's remarks nor in any of the matters put to the Court by the applicant. 
      
       
      
     10     
     As I have said it is encouraging that the applicant states that he perceives a need for rehabilitation but in the whole of the circumstances I am unable to conclude that there is any proper basis upon which this Court should intervene. 
      
       
      
     11     
     Accordingly whilst I would grant him leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
      
     12     
     NEWMAN J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     13     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I have proposed.

     REGINA v Darren Alan EMERSON 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence passed on the applicant by his Honour Freeman DCJ in the Albury District Court on 7 May 1999. 
     
      
    2    Before his Honour the applicant had pleaded guilty to the offences of aggravated break, enter and commit felony contrary to the provisions of s112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. That sub-section of the Crimes Act carries a maximum sentence of twenty years penal servitude. 
     
      
    3    Not only did the applicant plead guilty to that offence, but he also asked that his Honour take into account no less than seven matters on a Form 1, which his Honour did. It should be stated that certain of the matters which appeared on the Form 1 were related to the actual offences, others were not. They included larceny, assault, behaving in an offensive manner, cultivate prohibited drug, possess prohibited drug, possession of implements to self-administer prohibited drug, and yet again break, enter and steal. In the event his Honour passed a head sentence of ten years constructed of a minimum term of seven years penal servitude commencing on 4 March 1999 expiring on 30 March 2006 and an additional term of three years. 
     
      
    4    At the same time, the applicant's brother appeared before his Honour and was charged with the same offence. He also had a number of offences on a Form 1 to be taken into account, which they were. His Honour sentenced the applicant's brother to a head sentence of six years consisting of a minimum term of four years and an additional term of two years. 
     
      
    5    The objective facts of the crime in question may be quite simply stated. 
     
      
    6    The applicant and his brother entered a nursing home in which an elderly man, who suffered from crippling disability and was aged seventy-eight years, was a resident. A knife was used to assist in the carrying out of the theft which the applicant and his brother ultimately did carry out. 
     
      
    7    The amount of terror which the elderly victim suffered is clearly set out in the statement that was tendered before his Honour and it was a matter which his Honour took into account. 
     
      
    8    It might be said, as indeed has been submitted, that at one stage the elderly man told one of the assailants that he was a veteran which put that man to be less aggressive. For the purposes of the appeal one can safely assume that it was the present applicant. 
     
      
    9    The applicant, it is true, pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, namely, before the Magistrate, and he adhered to his plea ultimately before his Honour Judge Freeman. 
     
      
    10    Rightly, Mr Hamill of counsel, both in his written submissions and in his oral submissions before this Court, did not attempt to cavil with the proposition that this was a serious offence. Again, correctly, he submitted that it did not fall within the category of the worst type of case and instanced, in support of this submission, the absence of planning in the perpetration of the offence. He emphasised that his Honour Judge Freeman made an observation that the commission of this crime had a fortuitous aspect to it. But the fact remains that this is a crime which stands high in the criminal calendar carrying, as it does, a maximum penalty of twenty years penal servitude. 
     
      
    11    His Honour, when reviewing the subjective features in relation to the applicant, was confronted with an extensive criminal record dating back to the time when the applicant was but fourteen years. He was twenty-nine at the time he appeared before his Honour. That record is very extensive and contains numerous convictions for break, enter and steal, a few convictions of violence, but, as Mr Hamill submitted, it contained no crime of this type, or of a similar type, by that he referred to crimes such as armed robbery. Be that as it may, it is a criminal record which is not favourable to the applicant in terms of mitigation. 
     
      
    12    Mr Hamill's submission that his Honour erred, fell into two parts. First, it was Mr Hamill's submission that the sentence, looked at alone, was manifestly excessive. He relied upon the statistics which have been prepared by the Judicial Commission which indicate that the sentence imposed by his Honour was condign; second, he submitted that, when one looked at the features of the crime, bad as it might have been, when one took into account the absence of planning and the subjective feature that the applicant pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, that the head sentence and, indeed, the minimum sentence were beyond the range. He suggested that eight years head sentence may be the top of the range for this offence committed in the circumstances in which it was committed. 
     
      
    13    For myself, I am of view that, while the sentence, looked at alone, would stand at the top of the range, when one takes into account the fact that the crime which was committed involved the terrorizing of a seventy-eight-year-old man in a nursing home, the very type of person whom those who entered the premises with the intention of theft armed with knives might well expect to encounter, and might well expect to find terror being the result of their visitation in that form, that it is a very serious breach of the subject section. Secondly, in the applicant's case, he has, as I have said, a very extensive criminal record. 
     
      
    14    In relation to the offence itself it is an offence where general deterrence must play a principal part in the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion. 
     
      
    15    In the case of this applicant, having regard to his past history, specific deterrence also is a matter which would have to play a significant part. 
     
      
    16    While the sentence is a severe one, I do not believe that, having regard to the objective and subjective features of the matter, that his Honour erred, in that he sentenced beyond the range. The minimum term in fact was adjusted slightly, albeit, in the applicant's favour. Therefore, as far as the submission that the sentence itself, standing alone being manifestly excessive is concerned, I am of the view that no error has been demonstrated on his Honour's part. 
     
      
    17    The second leg of Mr Hamill's argument was one based on parity. The co-offender, the applicant's younger brother was sentenced, as I have said, to a head sentence of six years with a minimum term of four years and an additional term of two years. Very properly, Mr Hamill conceded in his written submissions and indeed confirmed those submissions orally before the court this morning that there would have to be a difference between these sentences, having regard to the age of the pair. At the time of sentence the applicant was twenty-nine, his brother had just turned eighteen. However, Mr Hamill submits that because the objective criminality was identical, and indeed the matters to be taken into account on the Form 1 in both cases were similar, that the disparity between the sentence passed on the applicant and that passed on his younger brother is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant and that in accordance with what has fallen from the High Court in R v Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606 and R v Postiglione (1997) 189 CLR 295 this Court should interfere. 
     
      
    18    In Postiglione at 301 the High Court summarised the concepts of parity sentencing which had been dealt with by the court in the earlier case of Lowe: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen, recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to a ‘justifiable sense of grievance’. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options. 
        
       
       
        
        Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.” 
        
       
      
    19    In this Court, subsequently, in the case of R v Doggett, unreported Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 March 1997, Sully J, with whom I agreed, observed as to the concept of parity on page 4 of his judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        ""What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the ground of parity is not that he feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that his sense of grievance is a justified one."" 
        
       
      
    20    I agreed with Sully J in that judgment at the time and I do not now resile from my agreement. 
     
      
    21    In dealing with the younger brother, his Honour adverted to the fact that that person had recently turned eighteen and had passed from the ambit of the Children's Court into the cold world of the administration of adult criminal justice. It is trite law that in dealing with young offenders that a sentencing judge must bear in mind questions of rehabilitation more strongly than in dealing with offenders who are older. 
     
      
    22    On my reading of his Honour's reasons for sentence in relation to the younger brother, Bradley, his Honour applied the appropriate sentencing principles in dealing with a young person who had committed a very serious crime. 
     
      
    23    It was, of course, for this reason that Mr Hamill conceded that there would necessarily have to be a disparity between the sentences passed on the two brothers. 
     
      
    24    However, for myself, having regard to the disparity of ages and the vast disparity of the criminal records adopting the test as adumbrated by the High Court in Lowe and explained in Postiglione and applied by Sully J in Doggett, I am of the view that this is a case where disparity does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant. 
     
      
    25    Accordingly, I am of view that the parity argument, as did the first argument, should fail. 
     
      
    26    Because this is a matter of some seriousness and involving a question of principle, it is a matter in which I would propose that this Court should grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    27    GROVE J: I agree. The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as proposed by Newman J.

      RE-DETERMINATION OF LIFE SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: Following his conviction in the Supreme Court at Orange of the murder of Darren Andrew Haywood, the applicant, Noel Andrew Wright was on 1 March 1990 sentenced by Maxwell J, to penal servitude for life, and on 21 January 1998, he applied pursuant to s 13A Sentencing Act 1989 for an order determining a minimum term and an additional term in respect of such a sentence. On 3 April 2000 the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 replaced the Sentencing Act 1989 and cl 21 of Schedule 2 of the latter Act requires that the application having been made but not determined before the commencement of that Act is to be determined in accordance with Schedule 1 of that Act. Schedule 1 substantially reproduces the provisions of the former s 13A, the only difference which is material for the present application being that whereas under s 13A, s 5(2) of the former Act, which provided that the additional term should not exceed one third of the minimum term unless the Court decided there were special circumstances, did not apply, the effect of cl 5(3) of Schedule 1 is that s 44(2) of the 1999 Act does apply, and the non-parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term of the re-determined sentence unless the Court decides there are special circumstances for it being less. The Crown neither supports nor opposes the application. 
    2    The applicant and the victim both lived in the Coonamble area and were well known to each other, although not close friends. On Friday, 25 November 1988, the applicant spoke with the victim at the Coonamble Golf Club and told him that he could get ""twenty pound of head"", i.e. marijuana, at $600 a pound, and arrangements were made for the two men to meet the following Friday, 2 December.  
    3    When they met on that day the victim showed the applicant $12,000 and the applicant told him that he would get back to him that night. They met again that evening when the applicant said that he had obtained the drugs, but would have to go out to the Pilliga scrub to pick them up. They set off in the victim's car about 20 minutes later, but during the journey the victim told the applicant that he suspected a set up, and preferred not to go out to the Pilliga scrub as previously agreed, and so arrangements were made between the two men for the applicant to take Haywood's car to pick up the drugs and then call him on his CB radio from a pre-arranged spot near the Walgett stock route about three kilometres north of Coonamble with an agreed message. When Haywood left his vehicle he took with him his .22 rifle leaving his 12 gauge shotgun behind in the vehicle. 
    4    On arrival at the Walgett stock route, the applicant called Haywood on the CB radio and gave him the pre-arranged message; and while waiting for Haywood to arrive he loaded two cartridges into Haywood's shotgun and cocked the weapon. Haywood travelled to the Walgett stock route in his father's utility which he pulled up behind his own car, and after alighting enquired of the applicant as to whether he had the marijuana. The applicant told him it was in his car, so Haywood walked towards it and when he was near the boot, the applicant shot him in the back. He fell to the ground and the applicant came up to where he was lying and from a distance of about half a metre discharged a second round of shot into his head. He then went over to the victim's father's utility, removed the bundle of cash from the lower compartment of a green box in the vehicle, as well as taking the victim's two wallets, picked up the victim's .22 rifle from the floor of the utility, walked back to where he was lying and shot him in the chest. He then threw both weapons into trees near the river bank after wiping them with a t-shirt in an endeavour to remove his fingerprints, and before leaving the scene he threw his victim's two wallets into the scrub. 
    5    After arriving home he counted the cash confirming that the amount was $12,000 and during the morning of that day, Saturday 3 December, 1988, accompanied at various stages by his wife, and on one occasion by his mother-in-law, he purchased clothing and a lounge suite for cash, and paid a deposit on a lay-by of various Christmas presents at local stores, while that afternoon he paid $3,000 in cash for the utility of a local acquaintance, Vincent Craig, informing Mr Craig that he had received $12,000 by selling ""20 pounds of head"" from a drug deal. 
    6    Prior to the murder, namely at about 2.15 pm on Friday, 2 December, the applicant attended Coonamble Police Station and informed Detective Sergeant Kennedy that he had information that Darren Haywood was in town and wanted to buy 20 pounds of marijuana at $600 a pound and he had seen a roll of money but did not think it was $12,000. He was told to keep his eyes open and notify the police with any further information.  
    7    When spoken to by police on 5 December, the applicant said that he had been spoken to by Haywood about 11.30 am on Friday, 2 December, when the latter asked whether he knew anyone who had drugs for sale, that he wanted to buy 20 pounds and had $12,000, that Haywood had showed him a 12 gauge shotgun which was under a blanket on the back seat of his vehicle and which he had ""just for protection"", and that at about 10.30 pm on the Friday evening Haywood asked him would he take a run with him out of town to see a few fellows for ""some stuff"", meaning drugs, but he declined.  
    8    He was questioned again on 8 December, and after initially denying any knowledge of the incident, he went on to say that he was present with Haywood at the murder scene when two men in a red Commodore drove up, asked where the ""stuff"" was and one of them had then shot the victim in the back. When asked about his and his wife's purchase of items on the following day he broke down and made admissions of having shot the victim three times at the murder scene, and subsequently he took part in a 9 page signed Record of Interview in which he made full admissions of the offence. The Record of Interview included the following questions and answers: 
     
      
       
       Q. 36 When you got the gun out of Darren's car and loaded it what was your intention? 
        
        
       A. That's when I made up my mind and [sic] shoot him and take the money . . . 
        
        
       Q. 70 During the time that you discussed selling drugs to Hayward [sic] did you actually ever have any marijuana in your possession? 
        
        
       A. No . . . 
        
        
       Q. 73 Did you ever have any intention of selling Darren Hayward [sic] a large quantity of marijuana? 
        
        
       A. No. 
        
        
       Q. 74 What was your intention when you told Hayward [sic] that you have the drugs and for him to meet you out at the Walgett Stock Route? 
        
        
       A. To shoot him and rob him. 
       
      
      
     At the conclusion of the record of interview, the applicant was charged with the murder.  
      
    9    At about 8 am the next day he accompanied detectives to the murder scene where he indicated various locations where incidents concerning the subject offence had taken place and during the course of the walk around, the victim's two wallets were located. Subsequently, on 10 December, in the presence of his solicitor, the applicant took part in a further Record of Interview, in which he repudiated his previous admissions of having shot the victim three times and nominated Wayne Murray as the shooter, stating that although he was present at the murder scene, he had no involvement in the offence, although he did acknowledge receiving some of the cash proceeds of the offence from Murray. 
    10    At his trial, the applicant made an unsworn statement to the jury, substantially in accordance with his later Record of Interview of 10 December. He now accepts that he killed the deceased, and that the versions offered by him in the later Record of Interview and at his trial were untrue.  
    11    It is not easy on the evidence to determine when it was that the applicant determined to kill the victim. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he never had any marijuana, and probably from the time of the conversation on 25 November, but certainly from midday on 2 December, he intended to rob the victim of the $12,000, or whatever money he had; but at what time he determined to kill him is not so clear, although he must have anticipated that the victim would not give up $12,000 without a struggle and there was a real prospect of violence. His visit to the the police station on the afternoon of 2 December does not make a lot of sense if he was only trying to put the police off the scent in respect of an anticipated robbery because one would hardly expect Haywood, if he was merely robbed, to go and tell the police of such robbery without a very good explanation as to how he came to have $12,000 in cash on him at the time.  
    12    On the other hand, I am satisfied that the applicant was not a very sophisticated person and he did not have a gun with him until the victim declined to go out to the Pilliga scrub with him, and lent him his vehicle with the 12 gauge shot gun in it. Whilst I have considerable suspicion that the intention to kill was formulated and planned much earlier, I am only satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was determined on when he called the victim on the CB radio and asked him to meet him on the Walgett stock route (see Record of Interview Q & A 74). 
    13    Whenever the plan to kill the deceased was formulated, this was an unprovoked, cold-blooded killing for financial gain, without any extenuating circumstances. I accept that at the time, the applicant had been living in extreme poverty, unable to provide adequately for his wife and family, particularly as his wife was expecting their third child and he no doubt felt desperate in many ways; but even such desperation cannot excuse, minimise or even explain a cold-blooded killing such as this. 
    14    The applicant was born on 29 November 1961 and is now aged 38 years. He was one of seven children, with an Irish or Scottish father and his mother was part Aboriginal. He was raised at Baradine about forty miles from Coonamble but his father, who died in 1981, was abusive towards his wife, the applicant was picked on by his older siblings and told he was useless, and he appears to have been a loner from the beginning. Both parents drank to excess several times a week.  
    15    The applicant attended primary school in Coonamble, but hated it and claims he was ostracised and bullied by other students because he was poor and could never afford new clothes. At the time of the offence his literacy and numeracy skills were very low. The family moved to Coonamble when he was about 12 and when he was in high school he began truanting and committing offences, such as break and enters with other young males. Accordingly he was sent to a juvenile institution at Kurri Kurri when about 15 years.  
    16    On his release he commenced a relationship with a young girl who had been also released from such an institution, but the relationship ended when the girlfriend was sent away as a result of becoming pregnant to him. He was heavily abusing alcohol by the time he was 16 years old, but shortly afterwards commenced another relationship with another girlfriend. Two years later, when the girlfriend was 16, they had a son and they later married. When he married, the applicant ceased drinking alcohol and claims not to have drunk alcohol since. He described his relationship with his wife as tumultuous; like his parents they lived in poverty and he admitted being violent towards her.  
    17    He was in receipt of unemployment benefits from the age of 16 until the time of the murder but subsidised his pension by shooting kangaroos. The marriage produced two more children, both girls, the youngest after he committed the murder. He and his wife were divorced after he was incarcerated. Apart from the offences committed whilst a juvenile and convictions for stealing in 1983 and malicious damage to property in 1986, his only other convictions related to motor traffic offences and are irrelevant for the purposes of this application. 
    18    Following his conviction, the applicant was classified A2 and placed at Parklea Correctional Centre, being moved to Lithgow Correctional Centre on 15 January 1991 where he remained until 4 March 1996 when he was reclassified B and transferred to Bathurst. There have been no serious offences of violence recorded against him whilst he has been in custody, the only matters being damage to property in 1990 (when a riot took place at Parklea Gaol), some minor failures to comply with routine or directions in 1991, 1993 and 1995 and four offences of drugs (apparently cannabis) in urine in 1995 and 1996. All his reports whilst in gaol have been good and he is generally referred to as ""not a problem"". He appears to have mainly kept to himself and busied himself in acquiring literacy, numeracy and trade skills. He has completed a number of courses of this nature and has at times attended D&A and psychological counselling.  
    19    Dr Hugh Jolly, independent psychiatrist, and Fiona Innis, Correctional Centre psychologist, agree that he has a history of tending to avoid problems, a problem with self respect, being uncomfortable in social situations and experiencing problems in inter personal relationships, that he experiences suicidal ideation approximately twice a week, but that he appears genuinely remorseful for his crime and particularly guilty regarding the victim's family members. They agree that he appears to be taking responsibility for his actions and his responses to therapeutic intervention have been positive, reflecting a willingness to seek help. He has from time to time suffered from depression, but Dr Jolly considered this was by way of a personality disorder rather than a major mental illness. At one stage he attempted to justify the murder to himself and/or others by claiming that the victim was threatening his son sexually, but he has since disclosed that he did in fact kill the victim for the money and accepts responsibility for the offence.  
    20    His poor literacy skills at the time of the offence as well as his poverty led to his situation of social isolation with resultant depression. His efforts in securing trade, literacy and life coping skills have been very good and commendable, but both Dr Jolly and Ms Innis agree that in all the circumstances he will need considerable time, both on work release programs and after his release under supervision, to enable him to cope in the outside world. He remains in contact with his children and with one brother, but his mother has since died.  
    21    In view of his genuine remorse and acceptance of responsibility for his actions and his feelings of guilt and the fact that his prior record was free of crimes of violence, I consider it most unlikely that he would commit a similar offence in the future, although Dr Jolly does acknowledge that possibility. I am therefore satisfied that he should be given a fixed term sentence and a non-parole period fixed, but because of the need for an extended period of supervision after his release, which I am satisfied constitutes special circumstances I will fix a non-parole period which is less than three quarters of the full term. The applicant was first remanded in custody for the offence on 9 December 1988 and it is agreed that this should be the commencement date of the sentence (cl 5(1)) and that no adjustment should be made on account of his release on bail from 11 December 1988 to 28 February 1990. 
     
      
      
    22    Noel Andrew Wright, for the murder of Darren Andrew Haywood, I re-sentence you to imprisonment for 22 years, which sentence will be deemed to have commenced on 9 December 1988 and I fix a non parole period of 15 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 8 December 2003.

      REGINA v. BRETT REA 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The accused stands charged that on a day between 5 July 1999 and 8 July 1999 at Point Clare in the State of New South Wales he murdered his father, Allen Kevin Rea. To that charge he has pleaded not guilty. In his plea he indicated a basis for his lack of guilt, that is, he asserted he was not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
    2   An election for trial by judge alone signed by the accused and witnessed, attesting to advice by his solicitor, accepted by the Director of Public Prosecutions as confirmed by the learned Crown Prosecutor before me, has been filed in accordance with the provisions of s.32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
    3   There has been tendered to me and admitted by consent and without any factual challenge two psychiatric reports, they being, firstly, the report of Dr. William Lucas of 1 March 2000; secondly, the report of Dr. Olav Nielssen of 24 May 2000.  
    4   Upon a reading of those reports it is clear that no question arises as to the fitness of this accused to make that election, or as to his competence or fitness to plead and to take his trial. 
    5   Both parties have sought that the trial proceed before me as a judge only trial. 
    6   Prior to the trial coming on for hearing and by consent, the parties have provided to me material which included a copy of the proposed indictment and the reports of the psychiatrists, to which I have referred. In addition, referred to in those reports and provided as part of the committal papers, was the ERISP between police and the accused shortly following his apprehension some time after the death. I have had an opportunity to read all of that material and have done so. I have done so having been informed that no issues of fact or controversy over the facts arises in respect of this matter and it would be the common submission of both the Crown and the defence that, at the time of the commission of the acts causing the death charged, the accused was suffering from mental illness such that the relevant provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 should apply. 
    7   In that regard, I have also informed myself of the findings which may be made at trial and the legal and practical consequences of those findings as required by Part 4 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 and in particular s.37. I will include in my remarks on sentence the explanation required by s.37 by reference to the existence and composition of the Mental Health Tribunal constituted under the Mental Health Act 1990 and the relevant functions of that Tribunal, in accordance with the Act, including a reference to the requirements of that Act and that the Tribunal may make a recommendation for the release of a person detained in accordance with s.39 only if the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release. 
    8   The material with which I have been provided by way of the short statement of admitted facts and the psychiatric reports confirm that what occurred on the occasion on which this accused killed his father was a most appalling tragedy which arose because at that time the accused, who had suffered for many years from paranoid schizophrenia and who had been diagnosed by many psychiatrists as suffering from that illness, underwent a florid bout of the disease and, whilst under the influence of the beliefs induced in him by the disease, committed the acts which would otherwise have given rise to criminal responsibility for the offence charged. 
    9   He has, on a number of occasions, because of the disease, been admitted to psychiatric hospitals. He was discharged from a psychiatric hospital only a short while prior to his father's death.  
    10   The whole of the material establishes that the accused was suffering from a serious mental illness such that he should not be held responsible for his actions. There is nothing to indicate that his actions were in any way provoked or occasioned by any inappropriate behaviour of his father or, indeed, of any of his family. 
    11   The short facts read as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""Fay Rea, the mother of the accused Brett Rea, states that he had suffered from schizophrenia and paranoia for some years, but that by December 1998 he had become 'very paranoid'. 
       
      
      
       
       On 5 July 1999, Brett Rea was seen by neighbours in and about the house at 5 Camden Place, Point Clare, near Gosford. That morning Elise Taylor observed him acting strangely in Coles at West Gosford. During the day Brett talked by phone to nurse Julie Stevenson of Pambula Community Health Centre and, amongst other things, told her that he had not taken medication for three days, that he was an alien and that 'bad Brett' was taking over. Ms. Stevenson formed the view that Brett was thought disordered and in need of immediate psychiatric assistance, which she endeavoured to arrange. 
       
      
      
       
       On the evening of 8 July 1999 a next door neighbour, a Graham Dimmock, was concerned about the welfare of the persons in the house at number 5 and called the police. Sergeant Joseph Turski and Constable Brooke Anderson attended and located Brett on the floor of the house. He was dressed in a pair of heavily bloodstained jeans and was suffering from multiple lacerations to the throat, wrist and abdomen. Ambulance personnel attended and rendered him medical attention before removing him to hospital. He indicated to police that he did not know what had occurred and, when asked how his injuries were sustained, responded 'the claw thing, you know, the claw'. 
       
      
      
       
       Police located the body of the deceased, Allen Kevin Rea, in one of the bedrooms, lying across the bed surrounded by a large quantity of blood."" 
       
      
    12   I summarise what appears in the short statement of facts thereafter. On autopsy it was found the deceased had sustained some 36 injuries, mostly being stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. Death had occurred some two days prior to examination by the forensic pathologist. The carcass of the accused's much loved dog was also located in the bathroom covered in a considerable quantity of blood, having been stabbed to death. Psychotropic medication was found. 
    13   The accused was interviewed by police and although he had trouble remembering the incident, was obviously deluded at times and thought disordered. 
    14   The short statement of facts continues:- 
     
      
       
       ""Many of his answers to questions were incoherent. He recalled that his father had come up to visit him. He said that he was 'supposed to be picked up by a space ship'. He 'assumed' that he had stabbed his dog, Gypsy, who had turned into a human (Q.73-76) and 'assumed' that he stabbed his father (Q.254-256). At Q.362 he said, 'I just thought I killed the dog and dad 'cos I, I, I, must have, right and I do remember holding the knife'.""  
       
      
    15   The psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Lucas discloses that the accused is a 39 year old man and the youngest of two children who, after his parents' separation, remained with his mother and sister. He had been a Telecom linesman. His psychiatric illness apparently began in 1993 when he was admitted to hospital in Gosford in that year. Since then he has received treatment for the illness. He worked apparently some 17 years with Telecom, living on a pension in 1997 and moved to Gosford from Pambula. 
    16   His family medical history supports the diagnosis of mental illness. Dr. Lucas chronicles in detail the account given by the accused to him, which is redolent of delusional behaviour. Dr. Lucas extracted portion of that account to indicate the severity of the illness. He also referred to the anti-psychotic medication which had been prescribed for the accused. He referred to feelings of despair and emptiness and the accused's sense of feeling terrible. He refers to the loss the accused refers to arising from the death of the dog, his faithful companion. 
    17   Dr. Lucas obtained from the accused also the history of the events of the day of the father's death. He referred to the accused's belief at the time that his water was poisoned, that the nursing home across the road had some involvement with a space ship being shot down and the home being the centre of a secret society. He referred to the attempts by the accused to kill himself and the complicated and bizarre conduct of the accused in attempting suicide. He describes the accused's belief that he was an alien experiencing an electric current across his head and being involved with bug-eyed aliens and flying saucers. He refers to the accused's discussion with his father in respect of his dog and the memory of the accused having a knife in his hand crying out for help. 
    18   Although the accused did not remember the actual killing, as recorded in the record of interview, he accepted that he must have been the person who killed his father. 
    19   It is unnecessary to detail the precise analysis embarked upon by Dr. Lucas in his report of the accused's mental dynamics in and around the time of the killing. Dr. Lucas concluded that the accused had a chronic treatment-resistant mental illness, as described by Dr. David Westcomb of Canberra, who had attended him at the Eden Community Health Centre, coupled with secondary depression. Dr. Lucas pointed out that the diagnosis is well-supported by all the records, including a lengthy statement by the accused's mother to police, the medical records from the Chisholm Ross Centre in Goulburn, and other records. 
    20   Dr. Lucas concluded that the accused suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia with prominent persecutory and paranoid delusions which has had a direct effect on his conduct in a number of incidents over the years. He later expressed the view that although the accused could not give an account of the killing or his mental state at the precise time of the infliction of the death-dealing wounds, there is abundant information allowing a conclusion to be drawn that he was severely mentally ill and acting on delusional beliefs into which in some way he almost certainly incorporated his father.  
    21   Dr. Lucas concluded also that the accused's behaviour around this time was controlled by his delusional beliefs, that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind, paranoid schizophrenia, and, although it is probable he knew the quality and nature of his acts at the time, that in his opinion the offender was not able to reason about the wrongness of those acts with a moderate degree of sense and composure. The doctor made recommendations for the treatment of the accused whilst he remains in custody. 
    22   Dr. Nielssen similarly concluded that the accused's condition should be diagnosed as chronic schizophrenia. He said that Mr. Rea was experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia at the time of the offence. 
     
      
       
       ""In any case, it has been established that Mr. Rea was acutely disturbed in the period immediately before the offence occurred and his state of mind at the time of the offence can be inferred with reasonable confidence from the observations before and afterwards.  
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Rea reported the recurrence of symptoms of schizophrenia, a disease of the mind, in the form of bizarre delusional beliefs which, he said, arose from his misinterpretation of events rather than auditory hallucinations. He had a defect of reason in the form of a persecutory delusional belief that his father was attempting to trick him into some form of danger. The beliefs regarding his father were linked to the wider delusional belief that he was an alien, awaiting contact with spacecraft. His beliefs were so alarming and bizarre and his thinking so disorganised that at the time the offence occurred he could not have understood that his actions were wrong in a moral sense."" 
       
      
    23   In reaching that conclusion, Dr. Nielssen had regard to similar material to that provided to Dr. Lucas, but the material provided by Dr. Nielssen was even more extensive. Dr. Nielssen also had regard to the conclusions of Dr. Lucas. Although there are some dissimilarities in expression between the two doctors, their conclusions as to the appropriate diagnosis of the accused and as to the condition of his mind at the time of the killing is the same. 
    24   There could be, on the material, no other conclusion that I could reach on the matter but that at the time of the commission of the acts comprising the offence for which the accused was charged he was suffering from a defect of reason caused by a disease of the mind such that he did not know the nature and quality of his act or did not know that what he was doing was wrong. He thus was not mentally responsible at law for the crime of which he is charged. 
    25   Although the parties have concentrated on the issue of mental illness, I must remember that this is not the only issue before me. Since this is a trial by judge alone, I direct myself as to the elements of the crime with which he is charged, that is, murder, and note I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the acts which caused the death of his father and did so with intent to kill or intent to cause grievous bodily harm or adverting to but not caring about the probability that his father might die as a result of his acts.  
    26   I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he stabbed his father to death on the admissions contained in the short facts and as made both to the police and to the two psychiatrists. Although he himself does not have a memory of the precise matter, that conclusion inevitably follows from all the circumstances. There is no other rational hypothesis inconsistent with it.  
    27   I am satisfied also that when he stabbed his father he intended to kill or at least to cause grievous bodily harm or was recklessly indifferent to whether his father should live or die.  
    28   It has not been suggested by either counsel that there are any other directions that should properly be given by me to myself to comply with the requirements of the Criminal Procedure Act (1986) in these my reasons for judgment. 
    29   I remind myself as to the matter of mental illness, that it is the accused who bears the responsibility of proving it, but only on the lesser standard of proof, that is, on the balance of probabilities. I remind myself that it is not open to an accused to avoid an inference of intent arising from his actions with regard to matters that would only go to the proof of the existence of mental illness. I remind myself it is mandatory for me to bring in the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness in the event that, on the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied, as I am here, of the matters that constitute that defence. 
    30   I remind myself that in those circumstances it is incumbent upon me to have regard to the professional expert evidence of the psychiatrists and in this case to have regard to the fact that the evidence is unchallenged; indeed, both parties accept that all opinion is unanimously of the view that the accused, at the time of the commission of the relevant act, was not mentally responsible. 
    31   I am obliged also to explain to myself the legal and practical consequences of the findings which are open in this trial. Under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990 which apply if I find the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, it is my duty to order the accused to be detained in strict custody in such a place and in such a manner as to me seems fit until released by due process of the law. He would not return automatically to the community; he would be detained in strict custody under the Mental Health Act 1990. 
    32   Whilst detained in strict custody in that way, the accused would come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which comprises a president, or deputy president, with legal qualifications and two other members, one of whom must be a psychiatrist and the other with appropriate qualifications to serve on that body. Within 14 days after verdict the Tribunal would commence review of the accused's case, at the conclusion of which it would make a recommendation to the Minister for Health, which may be unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. 
    33   If the Tribunal is satisfied, but only if it was satisfied, that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release, it could make a recommendation as to his release. If it makes such a recommendation, then that would be considered by the Department of Health which, in turn, would advise the Governor. The Governor would then, in accordance with the recommendation and advice of the Tribunal, either make an order for the detention of the accused or for his release. That order could be conditional or unconditional. The Governor could only make an order for release where the Tribunal itself had recommended release. 
    34   After that first hearing of the Mental Health Tribunal it can, at any later time and must at least once ever six months, review the case of the accused. At such a later review it should make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued care, detention or treatment of the accused or as to his release, conditionally or unconditionally.  
    35   Again, it would not be free at any stage of review to make a recommendation for release until it was satisfied that the safety of the accused or any other member of the public would not be seriously endangered. Again, the matter would go to the Department of Health, the Minister and the Governor and any recommendation could only be carried into effect by the order of the company.  
    36   If the accused were, at any time, released into the public on conditions and it appeared a breach of those conditions took place, then the Governor may order the apprehension of the accused. Such an order would follow by reason of a practical consideration that if a person is released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over his case, with the assistance of the Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist, or one of the other public facilities available.  
    37   The conditions which could be applied include conditions going to such matters as living in a particular place, taking particular medication and so on, to ensure that the patient or the accused is properly cared for.  
    38   Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain in strict custody in one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patient. The only manner which a person ceased to continue to be a patient is when he is released by the Governor, or is released on conditions after the expiration of a particular period of time, or in particular circumstances the release should become unconditional. But that recommendation could only be made if the Tribunal were satisfied, as I have said. 
    39   Having reminded myself, as I am required by the Act, of these matters, I find that it is, on the evidence in this case, perfectly clear that the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions at the time when the act of killing was done. Therefore, I return the special verdict that he is not guilty by reason of mental illness referred to by s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. I have been guided in reaching that verdict by the legal directions I have referred to and those decisions cited by me in my judgment in Regina v Fiori [2000] NSWSC 73. In those circumstances and with the benefit of the submissions of counsel, I make an order in accordance with s.39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, that is that Mr. Rea be detained in strict custody at A Ward at Long Bay Detention Centre until such time as is determined according to law, or until released by the processes of law.********

     70219/98  
     R v Hoang Minh NGUYEN 
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: This is an application by Hoang Minh Nguyen to withdraw the plea of guilty entered by him on 18 October 1999 to the murder of Van Hung Tran at Silverwater Correctional Centre on 28 April 1998. 
    2    The principles relevant to such applications have recently been summarised by Simpson J in R v Marchando [2000] NSWCCA 8 at [4] as follows: 
     
      
       
       The relevant legal principles are neither complicated nor controversial. The court has a discretion to permit a change of plea at any time prior to sentence: R v Griffiths (1977) l37 CLR 293 at 335; Chow v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 599. Leave, while a discretionary matter, should readily be granted where the plea has been entered pursuant to some material mistake, or in circumstances where its integrity is otherwise questionable; R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73. Circumstances that warrant the exercise of discretion in favour of permitting the change of plea include lack of appreciation on the part of the defendant of the nature of the charge; absence of evidence sufficient to convict the defendant; fraud or threats or other impropriety inducing the plea: R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35; or, more generally, a miscarriage of justice for other reasons: R v Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218 at 235. The last mentioned case establishes that a miscarriage of justice justifying the grant of leave to withdraw a plea of guilty may be established, inter alia, where the decision to enter the plea resulted from an erroneous ruling on the admissibility of evidence. The central question in all cases is whether it has been shown - the onus lying on the applicant - that the plea was not really attributable to a consciousness of guilt: R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481. 
       
      
     See also  
     R v Boag  
     (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36-37. 
      
    3    The grounds of the application are that the applicant is not guilty, that the killing of Tran was done in self defence and the defence of two other prisoners, Dinh and Lu, that the plea of guilty was not entered because of a consciousness of guilt but because the applicant at the time was depressed and under pressure, that other inmates and the warders told him that he would be convicted, that he did not believe the court would believe him and he believed that if he pleaded guilty he would receive a lesser sentence than if he pleaded not guilty and was ultimately found guilty. 
    4    The applicant is 21 years old and was born in Vietnam. He came to Australia when he was 13 years old and has mainly mixed in the Vietnamese community since his arrival. His English is poor, he has had almost no formal education in Vietnam or Australia, left school when he was 14 years old and gave his evidence before me through an interpreter. 
    5    According to the Outline of the Crown Case tendered by consent on this application (Ex. A), Nguyen, his co-accused Thanh Hoang Lu and Hoang Huy Dinh, and the victim, Tran, were all inmates at the Silverwater Metropolitan Reception and Remand Correctional Centre, the applicant being on remand for two murders. At about 8.10 am on Tuesday 28 April 1998 the victim, and the three accused were inside the Industrial Centre section of the Correctional Centre in the clothing manufacturing section. Nguyen, Lu and Dinh, who were all armed with scissors that were used in the Industrial Centre, approached the victim and commenced to stab him repeatedly. The stab wounds penetrated the heart, lung, liver, spleen, skull and stomach. There were also cuts on the right hand and forearm consistent with ""defence"" injuries. Approximately 50 stab wounds were inflicted to the body of the victim. During the course of the attack various Correctional Officers were present and they endeavoured to restrain the men from stabbing the victim. Some of the officers were aware of the identity of each accused. The attack upon the victim only ceased when additional Correctional Officers, including the Governor, arrived and were able to restrain the accused. The three men were spoken to by police and exercised their right to silence. 
    6    Subsequently, on 19 October 1998 the applicant pleaded guilty to the murder of one Li and was sentenced to penal servitude for a minimum term of 16 years with an additional term of 6 years. In relation to those proceedings he was represented by Mr M Hobart, barrister-at-law, who was assisted by an instructing solicitor. Those persons spoke to him a number of times before he entered his plea. Then on 4 November 1998 he pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter in respect of the killing of one Truong, and again Mr Hobart appeared for him. He was sentenced to penal servitude for a fixed term of 4 years to be served concurrently with the earlier sentence. 
    7    In relation to the current matter he was represented by Mr Justin O'Loughlin, an experienced member of the Criminal Bar instructed by Mr Hill, solicitor, and he agreed that those persons visited him in gaol three times prior to him entering the plea. The matter was first mentioned in this Court on 9 April 1999 when it was stood over to 14 May, on which occasion the applicant, Dinh and Lu all pleaded not guilty and their joint trial was fixed on 18 October. On that day, the applicant (having been visited in gaol by Messrs O'Loughlin and Hill on the previous Saturday) entered his plea of guilty and was remanded for sentence. Apparently due to some administrative bungle Dinh and Lu were not at court on that day and their joint trial started on 20 October when they both pleaded ""not guilty"". They claimed they acted in self defence and were found not guilty by the jury on 4 November. 
    8    When this matter was mentioned before Barr J on 19 November to fix a date for the sentence hearing, Mr O'Loughlin indicated that his instructions and those of Mr Hill had been withdrawn, and the applicant indicated that Dr Gumbert (who had appeared for Dinh in his trial) would be his new counsel. Dr Gumbert appeared on 4 February this year and indicated that he had instructions from the applicant to seek leave to withdraw his plea. In cross-examination on this application, the applicant said that Messrs O'Loughlin and Hill told him that if he wanted to change his plea, he would have to obtain other legal representation. 
    9    The only witness called on the application was the applicant himself. Making full allowance for his lack of education and the necessity to give his evidence through an interpreter, I found him an unsatisfactory and unconvincing witness. Some of his answers were inconsistent and some questions were not answered at all. Moreover, there was no evidence from Mr O'Loughlin or Mr Hill, and through his counsel he maintained his right to client privilege as to communications with them, with the result that there was no evidence from him or them as to what instructions he had given them concerning the killing, nor of what advice they had given him in relation to the plea. The applicant was entitled to take such course, but it resulted in there being no evidence on two crucial issues, namely whether the applicant had disclosed to them that he was acting in self defence or defence of others, and what advice they gave him in relation to the plea. In situations such as this, it will normally be necessary for the applicant to ""lift the veil"": cf R v Batiste (1994) 35 NSWLR 437 at 444-445; and it is frequently done, e.g. R v Marchando supra at [10], R v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320 at [12], or even if the lawyers do not give evidence, there is often evidence from the applicant himself of what passed between them: e.g. R v Cincotta (CCA - 1 November 1995) at p 4. 
    10    Dr Gumbert suggested that I should infer that certain advice would have been given (e.g. that a lesser sentence would be imposed following a plea of guilty than following a verdict of guilty after a plea of not guilty), but that does not answer what I see as the major issue on this application, namely whether at the time he entered the plea, the applicant believed he was guilty of the offence and entered the plea in recognition of that fact. 
    11    The applicant was asked when he first became aware of the defence relied on by the co-accused and he said it was a few weeks after they were acquitted. But if the three of them were in fact acting in self defence at the time that Tran was killed, he must at all times have known what their and his defence was or would be; and the reply that he only found out what their defence was after they were acquitted strongly suggests to me that none of them were acting in self defence and this was a story thought up at a later stage, particularly as the applicant maintains his claim to client privilege and there is no evidence of him telling his legal advisors or anyone else before entering his plea, that he was acting in self defence or in defence of Lu and Dinh. Although Tran was described as a large man, the evidence is he was stabbed about 50 times by the assailants between them in a 3 to 1 contest, and I find the proposition that they were acting in self defence not really credible. 
    12    Dr Gumbert said from the Bar Table (again without evidence) that other serious matters emerged in the trial of Dinh and Lu suggesting that Tran was a standover man, rapist and heroin supplier in the gaol who was being protected by the warders; but the relevance of this (even if it were proved) escapes me, as the applicant does not claim that is why Tran was killed; and once again there is no evidence that these matters were communicated to his legal advisors at the time he was receiving advice on how to plead to the charge. 
    13    The applicant says that although he knew he was not guilty because he was acting in self defence, he did not think that he would be believed by an Australian court, but in the light of the verdict in the Dinh and Lu trial, he now believes that he may be. He also says he was under pressure from inmates and warders who told him he would be found guilty, and he was depressed in the sense of feeling sad, unhappy and tired of life. 
    14    But as I have said, I found him an unconvincing and unsatisfactory witness; and in the absence of some supporting evidence from his former barrister and/or solicitor, I am not satisfied that self defence ever occurred to him prior to the acquittal of the other two, and this application appears to be a cynical attempt to take another chance. 
    15    I have no doubt that if he had been acting in self defence, it would have been the first thing mentioned to his legal advisors; notwithstanding his lack of formal education it would be the first thing to occur to any one as a defence to a charge of murder, and he was not at the time unfamiliar with the criminal law, and the offence of murder in particular. 
    16    I am not satisfied, the onus being on him, that at the time he entered the plea he was not acting voluntarily with full appreciation of the issues involved, having received proper and competent legal advice; and I am not satisfied that his plea of guilty was occasioned by anything other than a realisation that he knew he was guilty of the offence. In particular, I am not satisfied the plea was entered pursuant to any material mistake or lack of understanding on the part of the applicant or was induced by any fraud, threat or other impropriety. 
    17    This matter was listed for judgment on 26 June 2000 but on that day Dr Gumbert sought an adjournment so that he could have the opportunity of obtaining further instructions and possibly putting on further evidence. That application was acceded to and the matter adjourned to today (see my judgment of 26 June 2000). No further evidence has been adduced and I am informed that none will be. 
    18    For these reasons the application is dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 7 July 200070065/99 - REGINA v James Francis O’HALLORANJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: This is a motion to quash an indictment. The applicant, James Francis O’Halloran, is charged under s 998 Corporations Law with having done something that was intended to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of securities of Jeffries Industries Limited in that he instructed Clive Powell to sell 170,000 shares held by Fame Decorator Agencies Pty Limited in Jeffries Industries Limited down to a price of thirteen cents. 
     
      
    2   The Crown intends to put its case this way. Jeffries Industries Limited (Jeffries) was a public company listed on the stock exchange. Part of its issued share capital comprised converting preference shares (the shares). The rights of holders of the shares included the right in certain circumstances to have them converted into fully paid ordinary shares. There were times at which those rights could be exercised, but the Articles of Association provided for the acceleration of the conversion date if Jeffries did not pay certain dividends within certain times. On 28 April 1995 the directors of Jeffries announced that dividends payable for the period ended 30 April 1995 would not be paid, and that announcement precipitated the rights of holders of the shares to convert them and take up ordinary shares. The Articles prescribed a formula by which a shareholder’s entitlement to ordinary shares should be calculated. One of the factors was or was calculated from the weighted average sale price of all fully paid ordinary shares in Jeffries sold on the Exchange during the twenty trading days immediately before the conversion date. One effect of the application of the formula would be that the lower the weighted average sale price was, the more fully paid ordinary shares a given number of preference shares would produce. The last of the twenty trading days over which the weighted average sales price was to be calculated was Friday, 28 April 1995. 
     
      
    3   The applicant, a former chairman of Jeffries, controlled Fame Decorator Agencies Pty Limited (Fame). Fame was the trustee of a family superannuation trust of which the applicant was a beneficiary. Fame owned some of the shares. On 28 April the applicant instructed a broker, Mr Clive Powell, to sell 170,000 of Fame’s shares down to a price of thirteen cents. 
     
      
    4   Sales of ordinary shares in Jeffries were not heavily traded. In March 1995 about 755,000 ordinary shares had sold at prices ranging from twenty-five cents to thirty-five cents each. In April, up to and including 27 April, about 40,000 shares were sold at prices ranging from thirty-five cents to fifty cents. During the morning of 28 April there was a sale of 5,000 shares at forty-five cents each. Following the applicant’s instructions to Mr Powell these sales took place during the last five minutes of trading on 28 April. 
     
      
       
        
        28,000 shares were sold at thirty-five cents, 
         
        5,000 at thirty cents, 
         
        16,000 at twenty-eight cents, 
         
        20,000 at twenty-six cents, 
         
        6,000 at twenty-five cents, 
         
        20,000 at fourteen cents, 
         
        74,000 at thirteen cents and 
         
        1,000 at twenty-six cents. 
        
       
      
    5   The false or misleading appearance the Crown asserts that the applicant intended was in an artificially low sale price of the ordinary shares in Jeffries on 28 April and an artificially low average weighted sale price for the twenty days of the calculation period, resulting in an artificially high rate of conversation from preference shares to ordinary shares. 
     
      
    6   These issues are raised by the application to quash the indictment. 
     
      
       
      1. Whether the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has power to bring this prosecution; 
       
       
      2. Whether the indictment is bad for duplicity; and 
       
       
      3. Whether s 998 applies to any instruction given by the applicant to Mr Powell. 
       
      
    7   The parties have also asked the Court to deal with a submission that it would be an abuse of process for the Director of Public Prosecutions to proceed in respect of any sale other than those made at thirteen cents and fourteen cents. 
     
      
       
      The power of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions 
       
      
    8   The offence charged is a creation of the Corporations Law, which is contained in s 82 Corporations Act 1989 (Commonwealth) (the Commonwealth Act). By s 7 Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990 (the New South Wales Act) the Corporations Law so contained applies as a law of New South Wales. This proceedings is brought by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the question is whether the DPP has power to prosecute for an asserted breach of a law of New South Wales. 
     
      
    9   The sources and scope of the DPP’s authority were discussed by the High Court of Australia in The Queen v Hughes [2000] HCA 22. The DPP has ministerially derived functions and powers under laws corresponding to the Commonwealth Act. The Court held that the Corporations Act of Western Australia was such a corresponding law. There is no significant difference between the New South Wales Act and the Act there under consideration. 
     
      
    10   One effect of Pt 8 of the New South Wales Act is to substitute the Commonwealth prosecuting regime for the New South Wales regime. See particularly ss 28(1)(a), 29, 30(1), 31(1), 33. These functions include the institution and carrying on of prosecutions on indictment for indictable offences under relevant laws of the Commonwealth including s 998. 
     
      
    11   However, where provision is enacted affording the consent of the Federal Parliament to the conferral of State functions and powers upon an officer or authority of the Commonwealth it must be possible to demonstrate the constitutional validity of the provision. It is insufficient to point simply to the co-operative legislative scheme for corporations. The existence of constitutional authority must be demonstrated to exist in any particular case. The Queen v Hughes paras 30-36; 110-112. 
     
      
       
      Trade and commerce among the States 
       
      
    12   Three heads of power were put forward as empowering the DPP to prosecute. The first was trade and commerce among the States: Constitution s 51(i). This requires an examination of the system of trading securities on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). 
     
      
    13   In April 1995 the system by which securities listed on ASX were bought and sold was called the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). All securities trading on ASX was effected through SEATS in the following manner. The SEATS mainframe computer was installed at ASX premises in Sydney. It was connected through the telecommunications system to on-line terminals installed in stockbrokers’ offices in all States of Australia. Such terminals could be operated only by SEATS operators approved by ASX to operate in that capacity. Access to the system could be gained only through a SEATS operator in a stockbroker’s office, so anyone wishing to buy or sell securities listed on ASX could do so only through such a stockbroker. 
     
      
    14   When a client instructed a stockbroker to make an offer to sell or buy securities, a person in the stockbroker’s office would direct the SEATS operator to enter a bid to sell or buy the requisite number of shares at the appropriate price. Such bids were transmitted from the stockbroker’s terminal to the ASX computer and were there recorded. Having become recorded, those bids became known to all stockbrokers throughout Australia. 
     
      
    15   Offers to sell and buy securities were grouped and listed in order of price, with higher offers listed first and lower offers last, and then in order of times of entry into the system of offers, with the earliest offers listed first and the latest last. Whenever a buying bid matched a selling bid the computer programme generated a transaction of sale, and that fact was recorded in the system and particulars transmitted to all terminals. 
     
      
    16   Matches were made and contracts thereby concluded according to the order in which bids were recorded. So, if a bid were entered to buy, say, 100,000 shares at fifty cents and SEATS already had on record bids to sell, say, 10,000 shares at forty cents and, say, 200,000 shares at thirty cents, the programme would generate transactions of sale of 10,000 shares at forty cents and 90,000 at thirty cents. 
     
      
    17   In this way a stockbroker could observe the whole Australian market in securities, enter, amend and withdraw offers to sell or buy and know when other brokers throughout Australia were doing the same. So anyone anywhere in Australia wishing to trade in ASX listed securities could do so with others anywhere else in Australia. 
     
      
    18   Sales concluded in this manner were made on credit. When informed in the manner I have indicated of the conclusion of a sale, the selling broker would send the share certificate and document of transfer to the buying broker by post. On receipt of those documents the buying broker would draw a cheque in favour of ASX and have it delivered to the branch of ASX in the State of the buying broker. That State office would draw a cheque in favour of the selling broker and send it to that broker. 
     
      
    19   The evidence establishes that the broker who sold shares on behalf of Fame was in New South Wales and that of the seven buying brokers three were in Melbourne and four in Sydney. 
     
      
    20   In Bank of New South Wales v The Commonwealth (1948) 76 CLR 1 (the Bank Nationalisation case) Dixon J said this about commerce at 381-382: 
     
      
       
        
        I cannot think that the essential content of the expression “trade commerce and intercourse” in s. 92 is any less than is included in the conception of commerce in the modern American view of the commerce power. I am not speaking of the spread of that power over an immense field of activities that are incident to commerce. It is the central conception expressed in the word to which I refer. It covers intangibles as well as the movement of goods and persons. The supply of gas and the transmission of electric current may be considered only an obvious extension of the movement of physical goods. But it covers communication. The telegraph, the telephone, the wireless may be the means employed. It includes broadcasting and, no doubt, it will take in television. In principle there is no reason to exclude visual signals. The conception covers, in the Untied States, the business of press agencies and the transmission of all intelligence, whether for gain or not. Transportation, traffic, movement, transfer, interchange, communication, are words which perhaps together embrace an idea which is dominant in the conception of what the commerce clause requires. But to confine the subject matter to physical things and persons would be quite out of keeping with all modern developments. The essential attributes which belong to the conception should determine the field of human activities to which it applies. To place among the essential attributes the requirement that there should be goods for sale or delivery or a man upon a journey, is to mistake the particular for the general, the concrete example for the abstract definition, and to yield to habits of thought inherited from a more primitive organization of society. 
        
       
      
    21   In a paper written almost thirty years ago - The Constitutional Power of the Commonwealth to Regulate the Securities Market (1971) 45 ALJ 388 - Professor Howard observed that a concept of trade and commerce of that character and scope would include such a characteristically modern concept as dealing in shares. Bearing in mind the manner in which ASX-listed securities were traded in 1995, I think that observation apt. The contrary was not submitted by the applicant. However, whether that trade and commerce was among the States is a separate question. 
     
      
    22   Speaking of the banking industry, Dixon J concluded in the Bank Nationalisation case that relevantly the business of the private banks necessarily included -  
     
      
       
      (a) the constant interstate transmission of funds and transfer of credit; 
       
       
      (b) constant business communication and intercourse among the States; 
       
       
      (c) the regular use for the purposes of interstate transactions of instruments of credit and of title to goods and their interstate transmission; 
       
       
      (d) the integration of interstate banking transactions with the entire business of the bank to form a system spreading over the Commonwealth without regard to State lines; and 
       
       
      (e) the furtherance of commercial dealings by interstate traders in goods by performing an indispensable part in such transactions. 
       
      
    23   This reasoning was adopted in the Privy Council: The Commonwealth v Bank of New South Wales (1949) 79 CLR 497 at 632-633. 
     
      
    24   In the paper to which I have referred, Professor Howard expressed the view that, given appropriate changes of terminology, the five conditions enumerated by Dixon J applied as much to stock exchanges as to banks and considered that there was a reasonably close analogy between the two fields of endeavour. Professor Howard pointed to the operation of the securities market even then as an interdependent nationwide phenomenon, observing that it relied heavily on credit and that much interstate communication and commerce took place. He referred to the then current move for a national secretariat. Such observations may in my view be more confidently made in view of the interstate character of ASX dealing under SEATS, which could not operate without constant interstate communication and commerce and heavy reliance on credit between institutions in one State and another. 
     
      
    25   See also A I Tonking, Federal Competence to Legislate for the Control of the Securities Market (1973) 47 ALJ 231 at 238. 
     
      
    26   Two submissions were made on behalf of the applicant. The first was that the comparison between the securities trading business and the banking business was inappropriate and that any interstate feature of the formation or performance of a contract for trade in securities, for example the delivery interstate of scrip or the payment interstate of a purchase price, was no more than an incident of the contract and did not make it an interstate contract. Reliance was placed on Hospital Provident Fund Pty Limited v State of Victoria (1952-1953) 87 CLR 1. The two plaintiffs in that case were insurers, incorporated in and carrying on a hospital benefits business in Victoria. They had branches in other States and carried on certain interstate activities in the course of that business, for example paying money from an office in one State to contributors in other States by way of hospital benefits, receiving in one State contributions sent from another State, maintaining offices, staffs, equipment and funds in other States transmitting funds, documents and communications from one State to another and having servants and agents travelling frequently from one State to another on the business of the company. 
     
      
    27   In comparing the banking and insurance businesses, the Court referred to the last of Dixon J’s five conclusions in the Bank Nationalisation case and observed that there was a close analogy between the business of banking and the business of interstate carriage of goods. A person who performs such activities, it was said, is not only himself engaged in commerce but plays an indispensable part in the commerce of others: Fullagar J at 37-39. See also the judgments of Dixon CJ at 17-18 and Taylor J at 44-45. 
     
      
    28   It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the input and distribution of information through SEATS was not itself trade and commerce and that delivery of a share certificate or a cheque across a State border was no more than an incident of a contract, such as the delivery of a policy or the payment of a premium as in Hospital Provident Fund v State of Victoria, which did not lead to the conclusion that the commercial activity was among the States. 
     
      
    29   It seems to me that there is a more fundamental quality of “interstateness” about SEATS than about, for example, an insurance office making contracts the performance of which might entail interstate activities. ASX is headquartered in one State not because the manner in which it trades requires it to have any special association with that State, but because the mainframe computer essential to SEATS must be situated somewhere. But SEATS is a national system, and the mainframe computer is no less essential than the terminals situated in a ASX-licensed stockbrokers’ offices in all States of Australia. I think that SEATS is a national system and that the trade in securities to which it gives affect is national. 
     
      
    30   In my opinion it is possible to identify features of SEATS analogous to the five features of the banking system identified by Dixon J. They are the constant interstate transmission of funds and transfer of credit, constant business communication and intercourse between brokers among the States, the regular use for the purposes of interstate transactions of instruments of credit and of title to securities and their interstate transmission, the integration of interstate transactions for the sale and purchase of securities with the entire business of ASX to form a system spreading over the Commonwealth without regard to State lines, and the furtherance of commercial dealings by interstate traders in securities by performing an indispensable part in such transactions. 
     
      
    31   I think that the buying and selling of securities by means of SEATS is trade and commerce among the States. 
     
      
    32   The applicant’s second submission was that even if SEATS transactions between brokers in different States were within the power of the Commonwealth to control by legislation, those wholly within any State were not. This is a matter of some significance because the sales of the shares at thirteen cents and fourteen cents were made within the confines of New South Wales and, as will appear, the applicant asserts that it would be an abuse of process for the DPP to rely on any other sale as involving a breach of s 998. 
     
      
    33   It would be unreasonable in my view to regard as excluded from the regulating power of the Commonwealth Parliament some transactions made in a national system of marketing solely because the buyer and seller happened to be in the same State. No such restriction would apply to intrastate banking transactions carried out as part of the national system. I do not think that such transactions can effectively be segregated. It is necessary for a significant part of a national system like banking or trade in securities to be regulated in the interests of the regulation of the whole. Redfern v Dunlop Rubber (1964) 110 CLR 194; Western Union Telegraph Co v Foster 247 US 105 (1918); Howard The Constitutional Power of the Commonwealth to Regulate Securities Market at 391. 
     
      
       
      Communications 
       
      
    34   In that it transmits information between the ASX computer and brokers’ terminals and requires the posting of documents and cheques, SEATS involves the transmission of information by postal, telegraphic, telephonic or other like services: Constitution s 51(v). It was submitted by the DPP that if under s 51(v) the Commonwealth can prohibit the transmission of any information it wishes then it can prescribe such relaxations as it wishes, that is, it can prescribe what information may not be so transmitted and whether those transmitting it should be punished. 
     
      
    35   Reference was made to and Herald and Weekly Times v The Commonwealth (1966) 115 CLR 418. There was a statutory prohibition of transmission of messages by wireless telegraphy except as authorised by or under the statute. Wireless telegraphy included television broadcasts. The Commonwealth Parliament enacted the Broadcasting and Television Act 1965, which introduced a system of licensing in relaxation of the prohibition. Under attack were provisions creating offences by persons not the holders of television licences who engaged in certain conduct, for example, holding shares in a licensee whilst having no legal or beneficial interest in the shares and no degree of control over the licensee and holding certain directorships which would ordinarily give little say in the actual control of the affairs of a licensee. 
     
      
    36   Such provisions were held to be within the communications power because together they were a means to an end which was within power, namely that of ensuring freedom of competition between television stations. Kitto J said at 433-434 - 
     
      
       
        
        … any provision which operates to create or delimit a power in given circumstances to relax in favour of a television station the general prohibition upon television transmission has, of necessity, by reason of the very fact that it has that operation, the character of a law with respect to television services. It is not necessary, in order that a provision so operating shall be within the constitutional power, that the persons, things, situations or events referred to in it shall themselves possess characteristics which supply a further link with the subject of television services. … A law which qualifies an existing statutory power to relax a prohibition is necessarily a law with respect to the subject of the prohibition. Even if the qualification gives it the additional character of a law upon some other topic - even, indeed, if that other topic be not a subject of federal legislative power - it is still a law with respect to the subject of the prohibition, and is valid if that subject lie within federal power … 
        
       
       
        
         The main attack … must succeed unless the conduct which is thus made unlawful is so relevant to the subject of television services that a law forbidding it is a law with respect to that subject. 
        
       
      
    37   S 998 is not directly about communications by the relevant media, but it may concern them indirectly because, given the nature of SEATS, it is possible that anything done in contravention of the section may be done by means of any of the relevant communications media. (In fact, the act alleged against the applicant was giving instructions by telephone.) But I think that such use of the media would be no more than a mere incident of the prohibited conduct. 
     
      
    38   I do not think, using the terminology of Kitto J, that the conduct made unlawful by s 998 is so relevant to the subject of postal, telephonic, telegraphic or other like services as to be a law with respect to those services. 
     
      
       
      Corporations 
       
      
    39   The final head of power contended for was that with respect to trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth: Constitution s 51(xx). The Commonwealth has power to legislate with respect to all acts of trade and all acts done for the purposes of trade by trading and financial corporations. Actors & Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films (1982) 150 CLR 169; Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 158 CLR 1. 
     
      
    40   According to the evidence of Mr Phillip John Cave and to the annual report of Jeffries and its subsidiaries of 30 June 1995 the group of companies comprising Jeffries and its subsidiaries was in the business of abrasive blasting, cleaning and application of protective coatings to steel and metal, including rubber to metal lining and industrial painting. Such work was undertaken under contract for private enterprises and government bodies throughout Australia and in Thailand. Contracts included work on a pipeline project, a shopping centre, a bridge and dockyard installations. The majority of the work of the subsidiary companies was described in the annual report as essentially factory-based. 
     
      
    41   It was not contended on behalf of the applicant that in carrying out work of that kind the subsidiary companies were not trading corporations. It is therefore unnecessary for the Court to enter upon such an inquiry. The DPP, on the other hand, did not submit that Jeffries was a trading corporation by virtue of the fact alone that it was a holding company of each of the subsidiaries. The inquiry was thereby confined to the question whether Jeffries had acquired the character of a trading or a financial corporation by the manner in which it had involved itself in the business affairs of its subsidiary companies. 
     
      
    42   Even if it is also a holding company, a corporation will be a trading corporation when its trading activities form a sufficiently significant portion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation. R v Federal Court of Australia; ex parte WA National Football League (Adamson) (1979) 143 CLR 170. Similarly, if a substantial and not insignificant part of a corporation’s activities are financial, it is properly characterised as a financial corporation. Re Ku-Ring-Gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Limited (1978) 22 ALR 621. The term “financial” is not a term of art and has no special meaning: State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 150 CLR 282 per Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ at 305. 
     
      
    43   Mr Cave involved himself in “corporate turnaround projects”. He identified under-performing companies, judged whether their performance could be satisfactorily improved and, if so, invested money in them and assumed executive power. In October 1994, having inquired into the financial position and prospects of Jeffries, he provided financial assistance to it by means of a bank guarantee in the sum $600,000. On 10 October 1994 he was appointed managing director and chief executive officer. At the same time an associate of Mr Cave, Mr Daniel Wong, became a director and company secretary. Both also became directors of all the subsidiary companies of Jeffries. At 30 June 1994 there were sixteen such subsidiary companies. At 30 June 1995 there were seventeen. Jeffries beneficially held all the shares in each of those subsidiary companies. 
     
      
    44   Mr Cave and Mr Wong regarded Jeffries and all the subsidiary companies as a single corporate entity and managed it accordingly. They intended it to prosper as an entity and in order to achieve that end they exercised through Jeffries a strong financial control over the affairs of all the subsidiary companies. 
     
      
    45   Each of the subsidiaries traded on its own behalf. Gaining contracts, sending out invoices, incurring debts and receiving payment. However, no subsidiary controlled its own finances. When a subsidiary company needed to raise working capital it was obliged to go to Jeffries. Mr Cave and Mr Wong devised a manner of financing all the companies in the group through borrowings made only by Jeffries. Jeffries had a $2.15 million loan facility with a financial institution and it exacted from each of the subsidiary companies a guarantee to the lender and a pledge not to charge its assets or borrow money other than from Jeffries. In this way, whenever a subsidiary needed working capital it could, if Jeffries considered it appropriate, obtain it through Jeffries’ loan facility. Having borrowed the money, Jeffries on-lent it to the subsidiary but did not charge interest. 
     
      
    46   Jeffries lent such money, at least in part, by directly discharging debts incurred by the subsidiaries. When a subsidiary received an invoice either the subsidiary itself would pay or Jeffries would pay. It was Jeffries, under the control of Mr Cave and Mr Wong, who decided which manner of payment would be employed on any occasion. 
     
      
    47   When a subsidiary received money in payment of an invoice it had rendered, that money was more often than not paid directly into the bank account of Jeffries. It was Jeffries who decided into which account the money would be deposited on any occasion. 
     
      
    48   This control of monies coming in and going out on account of the subsidiary companies was maintained by Jeffries for the benefit not only of the subsidiary companies involved but for that of Jeffries and of every other member of the group. 
     
      
    49   The principal subsidiary companies in the Sydney metropolitan area were called BGC Marine Services (NSW) Pty Limited, BGC Marine Services (Aust) Pty Limited and BGC Marine Service Pty Limited. The name of BGC Marine Services (Aust) Pty Limited was displayed on the works. So was the name of Jeffries. 
     
      
    50   In this way Jeffries performed a function far greater than that of a holding company. It does not state the position too highly to say that the survival of the subsidiaries and each of them depended upon the preparedness of Jeffries to continue to finance it by raising sufficient working capital. Having assessed the profitability and prospects of each subsidiary company, Mr Cave and Mr Wong decided whether they would continue to support it by raising loan capital through Jeffries. If they decided not to support any subsidiary company they simply withheld funds. During Mr Cave’s stewardship such a thing happened on two occasions and each subsidiary or collection of subsidiary companies were obliged to go into voluntary liquidation. 
     
      
    51   It seems to me that although Jeffries never directly traded with the clients of its subsidiaries, it did involve itself so closely and directly in the trading activities of each of them that it can properly be said that it carried on trading activities and that they formed a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation. 
     
      
    52   The facts lead me to the conclusion that the activities of Jeffries in raising capital and in directly involving itself in the payment and receipt of monies properly payable and receivable by the subsidiaries, Jeffries made a substantial and significant part of its activities financial so that it might properly be said that it was a financial corporation. 
     
      
       
      Duplicity 
       
      
    53   It was submitted by the applicant that the indictment was bad because it charged him with having done something that was intended to create a false or misleading appearance. Reference was made to Murphy v Farmer (1988) 165 CLR 19, where it was held that the word “false”, when qualifying something done or said, may mean either purposely or deliberately untrue or merely wrong in fact. It was submitted that the word “false” might therefore have a different meaning from “misleading”, giving the indictment an aptitude to produce a verdict the meaning of which was uncertain, with consequent embarrassment for the applicant. 
     
      
    54   It was further submitted that the fact that s 998 deals with market rigging transactions required a distinction between “false” and “misleading”. A comparison was drawn with s 995, which is directed at persons who relevantly engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. 
     
      
    55   Even if the two words do bear the different meanings contended for in the present case, however, that fact alone does not lead to the conclusion that the indictment is duplicitous. The real question, it seems to me, is whether s 998 creates one offence, an element of which is the creation of a false or misleading appearance, or whether it creates two offences, one of which requires the intention to create a false appearance and the other the intention to create a misleading appearance. In Romeyko v Samuels (1972) 2 SASR 529 Bray CJ said at 552 - 
     
      
       
        
        The true distinction, broadly speaking, it seems to me, is between a statute which penalises one or more acts, in which case two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several of such characteristics. Of course, there will always be borderline cases and if it is clear that Parliament intended several offences to be committed if the act in question possesses more than one of the forbidden characteristics, that result will follow. 
        
       
      
    56   See also the summary of cases set forth in DPP (Vic) v Williams [1993] 1 VLR 238 in the judgment of Hedigan J at 242-245. 
     
      
    57   In my opinion s 998 creates not two offences but one. The intent the Crown must prove is to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market or price of securities. Only one appearance is required to be proved, and that may be variously or compendiously described as false or misleading in much the same way as that expression was used by Mason J in North v Marra Developments Limited (1981) 148 CLR 42 at 58-59. 
     
      
    58   In my opinion the indictment as framed is not duplicitous. 
     
      
       
      Whether the instruction said to have been given to Mr Powell is capable of being brought within s 998 
       
      
    59   It was submitted that s 998 did not contemplate a mere instruction to a broker such as that alleged by the DPP. S 998, which is headed “False trading and market rigging transactions”, is in the following terms so far as is relevant to this application - 
     
      
       
        
        998 (1) [Persons not to create misleading appearances] 
         A person shall not create, or do anything that is intended or likely to create, a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any securities on a stock market or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for, or the price of, any securities. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        998 (5) [Circumstances which amount to false or misleading appearances] 
         Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a person who: 
         
         (a) enters into, or carries out, either directly or indirectly, any transaction of sale or purchase of any securities, being a transaction that does not involve any change in the beneficial ownership of the securities;  
         
         (b) offers to sell any securities at a specified price where the person has made or proposes to make, or knows that an associate of the person has made or proposes to make, an offer to buy the same number, or substantially the same number, of securities at a price that is substantially the same as the first-mentioned price; or  
         
         (c) offers to buy any securities at a specified price where the person has made or proposes to make, or knows that an associate of the person has made or proposes to make, an offer to sell the same number, or substantially the same number, of securities at a price that is substantially the same as the first-mentioned price; 
         
        shall be deemed to have created a false or misleading appearance of active trading in those securities on a stock market 
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        998 (9) [Reference to transactions includes offers and invitations] 
         The reference in paragraph (5)(a) to a transaction of sale or purchase of securities includes:  
         
         (a) a reference to the making of an offer to sell or buy securities; and  
         
         (b) a reference to the making of an invitation, however expressed, that expressly or impliedly invites a person to offer to sell or buy securities. 
        
       
      
    60   S 1311, which is headed “General penalty provisions”, is in the following terms so far as is relevant - 
     
      
       
        
        1311 (1) [Offence] 
         A person who: 
         
         (a) does an act or thing that the person is forbidden to do by or under a provision of this Law; 
         
         (b) does not do an act or thing that the person is required or directed to do by or under a provision of this Law; or  
         
         (c) otherwise contravenes a provision of this Law;  
         
        is guilty of an offence by virtue of this subsection, unless that or another provision of this Law provides that the person: 
         
         (d) is guilty of an offence; or 
         
         (e) is not guilty of an offence.  
         
         
        … 
        
       
      
    61   It was submitted by the applicant that an instruction to a broker could not constitute conduct for the purposes of subs (1) because only transactions contemplated by subss (5) and (9) were contemplated by subs (1). So there must be, by a combination of subss (5) and (9), at least an offer to sell or buy securities or an invitation for an offer to sell or buy securities. 
     
      
    62   No authority was offered to support such a construction. Subs (5) in terms does not limit the generality of subs (1). The submission is contrary to the plain meaning of the section and is without substance. It is not necessary to consider whether, in any case, this submission might be met with a submission that Mr Powell carried out as agent of the applicant any of the acts contemplated by subss (5) and (9). 
     
      
       
       
      Whether the DPP may rely on sales of shares other than at thirteen cents and fourteen cents 
       
      
    63   The question arises whether, because of the decision of this Court in related civil proceedings, it would be an abuse of process for the DPP to rely as prohibited acts on any instruction given by the applicant to Mr Powell to sell Fame’s ordinary shares other than at thirteen cents and fourteen cents. When Mr Cave heard about the sales of Fame’s shares on 28 April 1995 he became concerned, among other things, about the rights of ordinary shareholders in Jeffries, because the lower weighted average price resulting from those sales would give converting preference shareholders proportionately more ordinary shares. After obtaining legal advice, the directors decided to exclude sales made on 28 April 1995 from the calculation of the average weighted sale price. A summons was brought in the Equity Division of this Court by a holder of converting preference shares who was not connected with Fame or the applicant, seeking a declaration that the calculations for conversion should include the sales of 28 April: Fenwick v Jeffries Industries Ltd, Cohen J 18 August 1995. Jeffries, Mr Cave, Mr Wong and the other directors of Jeffries were made defendants. They cross-claimed against Fame, seeking declarations that it had engaged in misleading conduct in breach of s 995(2) Corporations Law and that by virtue of the sales of 28 April 1995 it had created and intended to create a false and misleading appearance with respect to the price of the ordinary shares in Jeffries in breach of s 998. 
     
      
    64   The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) intervened. ASC supported the case for the declarations sought in the cross-claim, including the declaration that Fame was in breach of s 998 in transacting each of the sales of its shares made on 28 April 1995. 
     
      
    65   The applicant was not a party and neither was the DPP. 
     
      
    66   Cohen J made declarations in due course including a declaration that Fame, by virtue of the sales at thirteen cents and fourteen cents, created and intended to create a false and misleading appearance with respect to the price of the ordinary shares of Jeffries in breach of s 998. His Honour was not so satisfied with respect to any sale of Fame’s shares at prices ranging from thirty-five cents to twenty-five cents. 
     
      
    67   Fame appealed to the Court of Appeal and ASC cross-appealed. They were the only parties before the Court of Appeal. Fame challenged Cohen J’s findings and declarations, including those as to the breach of s 998 by the sales at thirteen cents and fourteen cents. ASC contended that his Honour’s findings and declarations did not go far enough and that the other sales on 28 April 1995 had been made in breach of s 998. However, ASC did not pursue the cross-appeal because the legal issues of concern to it were sufficiently covered by Fame’s appeal. So the Court of Appeal concerned itself only with the sales at thirteen cents and fourteen cents. By a majority, the Court dismissed Fame’s appeal. Special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused. 
     
      
    68   The applicant referred to statements of the members of the majority of the High Court in Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251. The Court in that case held by a majority that issue estoppel has no application in criminal proceedings but that proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive because they seek to litigate anew a case which has been already disposed of by earlier proceedings. See the judgment of Mason CJ at 255-256 and of Deane and Gaudron JJ at 272-278. It was submitted that an assertion by the DPP that the applicant’s instructions to Mr Powell to sell at prices other than thirteen cents and fourteen cents were in breach of s 998 would constitute an abuse of process because it would seek to litigate again issues decided by Cohen J and would be a direct challenge to his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    69   The central purpose of the proceedings before Cohen J was to determine the correctness of the decision by the directors of Jeffries to exclude from the conversion calculation the sales of its shares on 28 April 1995 and so determine the competing claims of converting preference shareholders and ordinary shareholders. Although ASC was an intervening party, called evidence and no doubt made submissions, it sought no orders. Although it was the only respondent to Fame’s appeal, it did not press its cross-appeal. In no way did it represent the Commonwealth in the right of a prosecutor. The proceedings were not criminal and there was no intention that any criminal sanction should follow. 
     
      
    70   It often happens that disputes arise between shareholders or officials of corporations, and that those disputes have to be dealt with urgently by the courts in order to enable the companies concerned to fulfil their proper functions. Fenwick v Jeffries Industries Limited was such a case. It was heard in July and the reserved judgment of Cohen J was delivered in August 1995. Like Fenwick v Jeffries Industries Limited, such cases may require the trial judge to make determinations which express or imply findings that there have been breaches of the Corporations Law. It would be a matter of concern to the proper administration of the criminal law if every such determination in favour of a party could be put forward to bar or to justify a stay of criminal proceedings subsequently commenced and arising out of the same facts or to limit the issues properly arising therein. It would threaten public confidence in the administration of justice because serious issues of a criminal kind might thereby be effectively determined in whole or in part in inappropriate fora and by inappropriate means. The need to ensure that wrongdoers were brought to trial would give rise to the need to defer urgent and important civil proceedings until related criminal proceedings could be concluded. The administration of justice would fall into disrepute. 
     
      
    71   The Crown case is that when the applicant gave Mr Powell his instructions they had discussed the state of the market for Jeffries’ shares and the applicant knew that there were outstanding bids to buy them at prices ranging between thirty-five cents and twenty-five cents as well as those at fourteen cents and thirteen cents. He knew that the entry of a selling bid at thirteen cents would first match and exhaust all selling offers at higher prices, provided he had enough shares to sell. That is why, notwithstanding his desire to sell at the lowest possible price so as to produce the desired effect on the average weighted sale price of the shares, the applicant arranged for Fame to sell at prices between thirty-five cents and twenty- five cents as well as at fourteen cents and thirteen cents. So the instructions for those sales are capable of being seen as having been given with the same intent as that which accompanied the instructions to sell at thirteen cents and fourteen cents. 
     
      
    72   I do not think in all the circumstances that the reliance of the DPP on the applicant’s instructions to Mr Powell to sell at prices between thirty-five cents and twenty-five cents would constitute an abuse of process or that a trial conducted on that basis would seek to litigate again issues decided by his Honour or directly challenge his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    73   The motion is dismissed. I certify that this order is a proper one for determination on appeal.

      REGINA v HAYDEN ROBERT ROBERTSON 
      
      
       
        
       
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
       
      
     1     
     MEAGHER JA: The Court is in a position is to give judgment. I ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
      
       
      
     2     
     GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting inadequacy of sentence imposed on the respondent for an offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited import. That prohibited import was the drug Methyldioxin Methylamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy. The learned sentencing judge imposed upon the respondent a sentence which effectively required him to serve three years periodic detention, suspended after one year. The expression of the sentence was in the somewhat awkward language required by the Commonwealth Crimes Act but, that said, this was the practical effect. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The respondent was a young man aged 22 years. He has no previous convictions. The facts of the matter were relatively unremarkable. The respondent was in the habit of partaking of marijuana from time to time. He apparently began to do this as a result of contact with that drug whilst in a boarding school in Western Australia. He was attending that school as his parents were overseas in connection with his father's employment. He had left home and was residing in a flat with his fiancee Holly Ferguson, to whom later reference will be made. In order to obtain his supplies of marijuana he came into contact with a man called Capper. It appears Capper is a man whose interests in drugs are well known in the northern beaches area of Sydney. Apparently whilst the respondent was under the influence of marijuana, Capper put to him a proposition he would in effect act as a post box for material to arrive from overseas. The respondent later admitted that he knew drugs were involved although it is plain that he did not know precisely what drugs or the quantities involved. What happened was that mail addressed to a fictitious name was collected by the respondent and his fiancee, Holly Ferguson. Upon its receipt they placed it in a vehicle and were on their way to deliver it to Capper. There has been some submission to the court as to whether as a matter of categorisation that activity should be described as that of a courier. It does not seem to me necessary for present purposes to resolve any such debate. On the way to Capper's house, the pair (the respondent and Miss Ferguson) were stopped by Federal Police. The respondent admitted to police what he had done. 
      
       
      
     4     
     It is perhaps of some significance to record the motives which were obviously operating upon the respondent at that time. His fiancee, Holly Ferguson, was a few years older than him. They had apparently met at a place of employment. Miss Ferguson was ill and had been treated from time to time for psychotic episodes. They had both become unemployed. The respondent's father had, during this unemployment, supported the pair of them by weekly cash contributions. However, a few days before the respondent was recruited by Capper the respondent's father had withdrawn his support. It appears that the father had, understandably, come to the conclusion that the pair were living what was called, at one point, a rock and roll lifestyle, and sincerely, no doubt, he thought that it might be for their benefit for him to withdrew support. He gave evidence before the sentencing judge that had he known that the situation was that his son, the respondent, was seeking to support his ill fiancee he would have taken a different view. At the time rent was due and the respondent was desperate to obtain funds in order to pay that rent. Capper had offered him $1,000 for acting as a post box, as I have called it. In fact he received $100 which, it might be mentioned in passing, was seized by police upon his arrest. 
      
       
      
     5     
     It is relevant to make some reference to the discount upon sentence to which the respondent would be entitled by reason of his assistance to authorities. I have already mentioned that he acknowledged his part in the offence. When stopped by Police he went further and agreed to be fitted with a listening device in order to assist obtaining evidence against the drug dealer, Capper. As a result of his preparedness to do this and his actual undertaking of it, evidence was collected against Capper. Both he and Miss Ferguson made witness statements. 
      
       
      
     6     
     It might be observed that at that stage the federal police did not charge either of the respondent or Miss Ferguson. However, in due course, what might be described as a water tight case having been assembled against Capper, charges were brought against them. I say ""them"" because there is a potential matter of parity that should not be overlooked. 
      
       
      
     7     
     Holly Ferguson was also charged with her participation in the offence. She was dealt with later than the respondent by a different judge. That charge resulted in Miss Ferguson being given a sentence involving no custody at all and she was released upon an order made in terms of Federal Statute which amounts to release upon recognisance. It should also be observed that Miss Ferguson was convicted after a trial at which she pleaded not guilty, whereas the respondent Hayden Robertson pleaded guilty before a Magistrate and was committed for sentence. As I have said, there is a potential matter of parity that should not be overlooked. 
      
       
      
     8     
     In this case I should make some observations about the rehabilitation of the respondent as was manifest before the sentencing judge. The respondent had resumed employment although this changed once or twice. He was an apprentice chef. The evidence before his Honour was that he was back on track towards with his career. It also appears that he did give up his use of marijuana. It might be observed that he did initially express some views as are often publicised about the relative harmlessness of that drug. I would comment those views are at odds with the evidence given over and over in courts by medical practitioners concerning the ravages upon persons who regularly use that drug. It is to the respondent's undoubted credit that the evidence before his Honour was that he had given up the use of that drug. 
      
       
      
     9     
     I should also mention that there was evidence before his Honour concerning the potential emotional stress that may derive out of the recent contact, for the first time, with the respondent by his birth mother. He was adopted by his parents when he was about a month old. It is not necessary to detail this matter and I mention it only to observe that, were I coming to the conclusion that the sentence imposed was inadequate, that circumstance would be relevant to the residual discretion in this court to dismiss a Crown appeal.  
      
       
      
     10     
     There are an accumulation of matters which should be taken into account. Viney DCJ was clearly conscious that other than in the case which can be categorized as exceptional, offences such as this call for full-time in jail. He came to the conclusion that the appropriate sentence in this case was as I have indicated. 
      
       
      
     11     
     There have been advanced before the court interesting arguments concerning the procedural requirements of the Crimes Act as to whether the primary selection of periodic detention was an option and as to the application of s 19 AC of the Commonwealth Crimes Act when dealing with a sentence of less than 3 years which is to be served by way of periodic detention in relation to the suspension of part of the period selected. It does not seem to me to be necessary to elaborate upon the arguments advanced to the court. In my view the sentence imposed by Viney DCJ was well within the boundaries of his discretion. In this case I would dismiss the Crown appeal. 
      
       
      
     12     
     MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
      
       
      
     13     
     BERGIN J: I also agree. 
      
       
      
     14     
     MEAGHER JA: The order of the Court, therefore, is that the appeal is dismissed.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL60383/99STEIN JADUNFORD JSPERLING J Friday, 14 JULY 2000 
     
     R v Michael MAHONEY 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    STEIN JA: I agree with Dunford J.  
    2    DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Michael Mahoney against his conviction on two counts of receiving and one of larceny, following his trial before her Honour Judge Ainslee-Wallace in the District Court at Sydney, and an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by her Honour following such convictions.  
    3    The charges arose out of what was alleged by the Crown to be the ""re-birthing"" of motor vehicles and they related to three separate vehicles, which may conveniently be referred to as the Honda, the Rodeo and the Lancer.  
    4    In respect of both the Honda and the Rodeo, the appellant was charged with larceny of the vehicles, and in the alternative with receiving. The case for the Crown was that he purchased at auction two cars which had been extensively damaged and which had been written off by the insurer. Within a few weeks of his purchasing the cars, a car identical in make, model and colour was stolen and the appellant sometime later offered for sale a car registered in his name which was ostensibly the wrecked vehicle purchased by him and repaired, but when the vehicles were impounded by police, inspection revealed them to be the stolen cars on which the engine identification numbers from the wrecked vehicles had been substituted. In respect of these two vehicles, the jury found the appellant not guilty of larceny but guilty of receiving.  
    5    In respect of the third motor vehicle, the Lancer, the Crown case was that the appellant sold a car which he asserted had been a wreck purchased by him and repaired. After the sale, the appellant contacted the purchaser (Mr Mason), apparently in relation to a speeding fine which had been incurred by the purchaser, but because he had not effected a transfer of the registration, the notice had been sent to the appellant. The appellant attended at the purchaser's place of work but did not bring the speeding ticket. Whilst there he told the purchaser that the car may be impounded by police as there was a question about repairs, and some of the parts used in the repairs were questionable; and he asked him whether he had been spoken to by police and whether he had insurance.  
    6    Later he visited the purchaser on two further occasions and asked him whether he had been contacted by police. Eventually the purchaser attended the police station to make a statement that he was the driver at the relevant time, and whilst he was there, the car was stolen from his driveway. On that day, the appellant was seen on five occasions driving a van owned by him into the street on which the purchaser of the car lived prior to the car being driven away by a person whom a witness did not recognise, but who was not the purchaser of the car. On the last occasion on which the appellant drove onto the street, the witness (Mrs Cacciola) said there were two persons in the car, the appellant and another person, and it was alleged that the appellant either drove the van and had an accomplice steal the car, or had an accomplice drive the van while he stole the car. That car has not subsequently been recovered.  
    7    On the charge of receiving the Honda, the appellant was sentenced to penal servitude for a minimum term of 18 months with an additional term of 18 months; on the charge of receiving the Rodeo, he was sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months penal servitude and on the charge of stealing the Lancer, to a fixed term of 9 months, all the sentences to commence the 2nd of June 1999 and the appellant to be released on parole on 1 December 2000. 
    8    A number of grounds of appeal were relied on. Ground 1 was that the trial miscarried but nothing was relied on under this ground which was not also relied on in relation to the other grounds, ground 2 was that the verdict for larceny of the Lancer was ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"", ground 3 related to alleged deficiencies in the summing up, and ground 4 to the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
    9    The thrust of the submission that the verdict on the count for larceny of the Lancer was ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"", or to use the words of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1) ""unreasonable having regard to the evidence"":  Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250, R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53, 104 A Crim R 416, seemed to be directed firstly to the evidence concerning another Lancer which had been stolen from a Mr Finsten on 11 August 1994. This car was alleged to be similar to that sold to and subsequently stolen from Mr Mason on 1 November 1995, and the Crown did lead some evidence which tended to suggest that parts of Mr Finsten's vehicle had been incorporated into a stolen vehicle before it was re-registered in the name of the appellant and subsequently sold to Mr Mason; but there was no evidence that the appellant was involved in stealing Mr Finsten's vehicle and the evidence did not establish that it was Mr Finsten's vehicle that had been reconstituted and subsequently re-registered and sold to Mr Mason. In any event, the appellant was never charged with stealing or receiving Mr Finsten's vehicle.  
    10    The case in relation to Mr Mason's Lancer was much more simple. Irrespective of the origins of the vehicle, a vehicle had been registered by the appellant in his name with registration plates ACJ 49T, and this had been sold to Mr Mason on 29 August 1995. This vehicle was subsequently stolen from Mr Mason's premises on 1 November 1995 and the only issue was who stole it. It did not matter to the Crown case, nor to the appellant's case, whether the vehicle stolen from Mr Mason was the vehicle stolen from Mr Finsten on 11 August 1994 or any part of it, and so the uncertainties of Mr Finsten's identification of Mr Mason's vehicle, particularly with respect to colour difference, did not matter. Ultimately I have come to the conclusion that the evidence about the stealing and the identity of Mr Finsten's vehicle was totally irrelevant in the context of this case, and it appears that no one, neither the Crown Prosecutor, the appellant's counsel nor her Honour directed their minds to what, if any, significance this evidence had, whether it was relevant and whether it was admissible. The evidence was led without objection at the trial, and no application was made for it to be withdrawn from the jury.  
    11    It was also submitted that it was not open to the jury to make a finding that it was the appellant who took the vehicle from Mr Mason's premises on 1 November 1995. Mrs Cacciola did assert that she had seen two people in a van, one of whom fitted the description of the appellant, and the appellant conceded in his evidence that he had been in Mr Mason's street a number of times that day. No questions of the appellant being assisted by others as part of a common criminal enterprise were raised or argued. Although it was common ground that the appellant was an occupant of the vehicle sighted by Mrs Cacciola on the day of the theft of the Lancer, the appellant said that he was alone in the van at all times, but Mrs Cacciola said that on her final sighting of the appellant's vehicle it had two occupants. 
    12    Mr Mason agreed to make a statutory declaration that he had the vehicle at the relevant time, but the appellant apparently never produced the speeding ticket and asked the appellant a number of times whether the police had been asking questions or had been around to check on his vehicle. The appellant also, according to his own evidence, told Mr Mason that in this context a number of cars previously owned by him had been impounded by the police and that there might be some problem with the parts used to repair the vehicle. Those circumstances, and the fact that he was in Mr Mason's street five times on the day that the vehicle was taken, together with the evidence of Mrs Cacciola, was in my view evidence of such circumstances that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant or someone acting jointly with him who took the car. 
    13    It was further submitted that the verdict on this count was inevitably compromised or tainted by being heard with the other counts and the way in which all the counts were dealt with in summing up the evidence. I will refer to this in more detail when dealing with ground 3, but I am satisfied that her Honour gave adequate directions as to separate consideration of the different counts and she summarised the evidence relating to this count quite separately. This ground fails.  
    14    Ground 3 makes a number of complaints about the summing up and is as follows: 
     
      
       
       The learned judge erred in: 
        
       (a) failing to direct the jury in her summing up that it was essential that they consider the evidence separately in respect of each count in the indictment; 
        
       (b) failing in her summing up to distinguish or sufficiently distinguish the evidence admissible on each separate count; 
        
       (c) permitting the evidence not tendered as coincidence evidence to be used and addressed as such evidence; 
        
       (d) the learned trial judge erred in directing the jury ""if you think the facts known to him would have put a reasonable man on inquiry that would be a relevant matter for you when you are considering whether the accused did or did not know it""; 
        
       (e) the learned judge erred in her directions to the jury in respect of recent possession.  
       
      
    15    This is a classic example of what has been described as an ""armchair appeal"", where after the trial, counsel not involved in the trial has sat down and gone through the whole of the transcript and summing up looking for error, without reference to the manner in which the trial was conducted: R v Fordham (CCA - 2 December 1997) noted 72 ALJ 284, and as none of the grounds sought to be relied on were the subject of objection at the trial, they all require leave because of the operation of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
    16    In this regard it is timely to repeat what was said by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536: 
     
      
       
       ""The requirements of r 4 of the  
       Criminal Appeal Rules 
        do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge's attention had been drawn to it, and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error operates fails to comply with his or her duty to draw the judge's attention to that error ( 
       R v Knight 
        (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 December 1990, unreported at 46), any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown, which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community. The  
       Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
        does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial. 
        
       There are, of course, cases in which the error made is of such a nature that, notwithstanding the failure of counsel for the accused to comply with that duty, leave will be granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice."" 
       
      
      
     and in  
     R v Sanderson  
     (CCA - 18 July 1994) at pp 7-8 Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
       ""This case provides a striking and clear illustration of the reason for the presence in the Criminal Appeal Rules of rule 4. If trial counsel had apprehended that there was any significant risk that the jury might have misunderstood the true nature of their function in relation to this matter of corroboration, then the point was available to be taken by trial counsel. If the point had been taken, and if there really had been a problem, it was a problem that was capable of simple correction. It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.""

      R v Tripodina 
      (1988) 35 A Crim R 183,  
     R v PAH  
     (CCA - 18 December 1989),  
     R v Cook  
     (CCA - 24 August 1998). 
      
    17    As appears from the transcript, there was discussion at the close of the evidence concerning what her Honour should say in her summing up, but the terms of the discussion are not recorded. After the summing up, no objection was taken by either counsel, and this Court may therefore infer that the summing up was in accordance with the conclusions reached at the end of the discussion. That does not necessarily mean that those pre-summing up conclusions were all to the satisfaction of defence counsel, but if they were not, it was the duty of defence counsel to have them noted either before or after the summing up. As this was not done, this Court should infer that in the context of this particular trial defence counsel was satisfied with the terms of the summing up. We were informed from the bar table that counsel who appeared at the trial, who was not counsel who appeared on the appeal, is now unable to recall what matters were discussed prior to the summing up. 
    18    As appears from the passages cited above, Rule 4 will not be strictly applied and leave will be given if the points raised were fundamental to a fair trial according to law or there has been a miscarriage of justice. None of the errors or omissions alleged in the present case are of that nature, but are all matters of clarification or detail, or matters which could have been expressed more fully. If further directions in conformity with the grounds of appeal had been sought at the end of the summing up, they could easily have been given by the trial judge, and almost certainly would have been. Accordingly I would refuse leave to raise the grounds in the face of Rule 4, but to demonstrate that the complaints being merely matters of detail, clarification or matters which could have been expressed more fully, it is desirable that I refer to them briefly.  
    19    The first complaint is that her Honour failed to direct the jury in her summing up that it was essential that they consider the evidence separately in respect of each count in the indictment. But after first giving the jury general directions relating to such matters as the separate functions of judge and jury, assessment of witnesses, the desirability of all members of the jury taking part in the deliberation and the onus of proof, her Honour came to the particular charges and said (at p 6): 
     
      
       
       ""When you are considering the charges against the accused you must consider them  
       individually 
        and decide whether he is guilty or not guilty of the charges  
       individually 
       . It is not a matter of one in all in or one out all out. Your role is to consider the charges  
       separately 
       . You must not be prejudiced against the accused because he is charged with a number of offences."" (my italics) 
       
      
      
       
      
    20    She then (at pp 9-11) gave directions as to the essential ingredients of the offence of larceny and, after a general direction on circumstantial evidence, then dealt with the evidence relating to the Honda the subject of the first and second counts, prefacing such remarks as follows (p 12): 
     
      
       
       ""Now I will just deal briefly with the circumstantial evidence that the Crown relies on to ask you to draw the conclusion that it was the accused who stole the Honda Civic belonging to Persephane Rougellis."" 
       
      
      
     She then went through the evidence relating to that vehicle, and said (p 15): 
      
       
       ""Now it is from this evidence that the Crown asks you to conclude that it was the accused who stole the Honda Civic from Miss Rougellis. You will remember that you must only draw this conclusion if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is the only rational conclusion available on the evidence 
       . 
        If at the end of the day you have before you two or more competing inferences which reasonable (sic) arise from that evidence then you cannot convict the accused."" 
       
      
      
    21    Her Honour then dealt with the elements of the offence of receiving and said that on this charge the Crown relied on the same evidence as it did for the charge of stealing, and she did not propose to repeat it. She then summarised the appellant's case relating to the Honda. 
    22    Then at p 19 of the summing up, her Honour turned to the evidence relating to the Rodeo, the subject of the third and fourth counts, and after doing so, said at p 23: 
     
      
       
       ""It is from  
       this evidence 
        that the Crown asks you to conclude or infer that it was the accused that stole the Holden Rodeo."" (my italics) 
       
      
      
       
      
    23    And after dealing with other evidence, including the evidence for the appellant relating to the Rodeo, her Honour referred to the process of reasoning, commonly known as ""recent possession"" to which I shall return, and at p 28, said: 
     
      
       
       ""I am coming now to the third charge which related to the Lancer owned by Mr Mason . . . The evidence on which the Crown relies to ask you to draw the conclusion is . . ."" 
       
      
      
     and she then dealt with the evidence relating to the Lancer.  
      
    24    Whilst it might have been preferable to tell the jury that the evidence in respect of one vehicle could not be used to support charges in respect of either of the other vehicles: R v Thomas (1956) 77 WN (NSW) 77, they were told a number of times to consider the charges separately and the evidence in respect of each charge was summarised separately with a comment that such evidence was the evidence relied on in respect of the relevant counts. In particular, the evidence of Constable Young, who gave evidence of the comparison of compliance plates and engine numbers was not summarised as a whole, but was summarised in three separate parts dealing with the different vehicles when the other evidence relating to those particular vehicles was summarised. In my view the jury could have been left in no doubt that in considering the evidence relating to each of the cars (in relation to the Honda and the Rodeo the alternative counts, and in relation to the Lancer, the single larceny count) they were to have regard only to the evidence relating to those vehicles as compartmentalised by her Honour. 
    25    This also disposes of the second complaint, namely that her Honour failed to distinguish or sufficiently distinguish for the jury the evidence admissible on each separate count. As I have indicated her Honour summed up the facts separately in respect of each of the vehicles. There was a specific complaint that in dealing with recent possession, her Honour referred to the timing of the stealing of both the Honda and the Rodeo as part of the circumstantial case the Crown relied on in relation to the two receiving counts; but in the context of the whole of the summing up and in particular having regard to its structure where the rest of the evidence in relation to each car was dealt with separately, I do not see that the jury could have been misled in any way.  
    26    The further complaint is that her Honour erred in permitting evidence not tendered as coincidence evidence to be used and addressed on as such. There is nothing in the summing up that suggests to me that any of the evidence could be used as coincidence evidence, and there is certainly no evidence that it was in fact addressed on as such because the addresses have not been transcribed and are not before us. 
    27    The next complaint is that when dealing with the requirement that the accused knew at the time he received the goods that such goods were stolen, her Honour erred in directing the jury: 
     
      
       
       ""If you think the facts known to him would have put a reasonable man on inquiry it would be a relevant matter for you when you are considering whether the accused did or did not know it"", 
       
      
      
     and the objection is taken that in that passage her Honour failed to specify that the relevant time to put the accused on inquiry was at the time he came into possession of the goods; but immediately before the passage complained of, her Honour had said: 
      
       
       ""But if a person believed the goods to be stolen  
       at the time when he received them 
       , that is sufficient to constitute the requisite guilty knowledge . . . In order to prove requisite knowledge of the accused it is sufficient if you, as judges of the facts, think that the circumstances  
       accompanying the receipt of the Holden Civic 
        by the accused was such as to make the accused believe the car was stolen."" (my italics) 
       
      
      
     These earlier references to the time that the accused received the goods made it clear that that was the relevant time and it was quite unnecessary to make the point again.  
      
    28    Similarly I do not consider that in the context of this case it was necessary for the judge to go into another discussion as to the separate facts of each case relating to the matters alleged to be within the appellant's knowledge or perception at the time of the receipt of each of the goods. In particular, her Honour drew attention to the fact that the issue for them to determine and for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt was what did the accused believe and not what would an ordinary person believe.  
    29    Reference was made in the written submissions to R v Zorad (1993) 29 NSWLR 672 about the failure to relate the direction to the relevant facts, but that dealt with the necessity to relate facts to an ingredient of a charge in the context of a complicated drug matter. In this case where the evidence in relation to each charge had been summed up separately, the jury could have been in no doubt as to the facts they were to take into account in determining whether the accused had the relevant knowledge at the time he came into possession of the relevant vehicles. 
    30    The other complaint is in relation to the directions given to the jury on ""recent possession"". The direction given was as follows (p 26): 
     
      
       
       ""If an accused person is found with property in his possession which has recently been stolen and the accused gives an explanation which you are satisfied could not reasonably be true, then you are entitled to, but you need not, draw against him an inference either that he stole it or that he received it knowing that it was stolen. You do not have to draw these inferences and whether you do is a matter for you to determine. 
        
       Now I refer to an explanation by the accused for his possession of the stolen property. The explanation includes everything which the accused said about his connection with the property, and you look at the whole of his explanation or explanations. Before you embark on this approach to the evidence you must first be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of the property and that it had been  
       recently stolen 
       ."" (my italics) 
       
      
      
     Her Honour referred to the evidence in relation to whether the accused had been in possession of each of the vehicles and went on: 
      
       
       ""Now if you are satisfied of these two issues you should then proceed to ask yourselves whether the circumstances called for some explanation from the accused as a matter of common sense.  
        
       If you consider that no explanation was called for you can forget about all this issue of having recent possession as stolen property. If however you consider that the circumstances did call for an explanation then you proceed to consider his explanation. If you consider that his explanation could be true then that would bring an end to the matter as far as recent possession is concerned. You do not have to believe his explanation before rejecting the Crown's argument based on his possession of these stolen cars if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the Rodeo . . ."" 
       
      
      
    31    It is said that no direction should have been given because the Crown could not establish sufficient proximity between the dates the vehicles, were stolen and possession by the accused to satisfy ""recent possession"". However, the notion of recency in this context is not one which has any absolute connotation so far as time relationship is concerned, but is an elastic concept depending on the nature of the property. In cases, such as motor vehicles, where the property is of such a nature that an accused would be expected to be able to account for his possession, the degree of recency need not be nearly as close to the theft as in the case of more common items such as bank notes, and it does not necessarily mean ""very recently"" except where the nature of the property requires it: R v Smale (CCA - 15 August 1986).  
    32    On the Crown case, the Honda was stolen on 29 June 1993 and advertised for sale by the appellant on 17 August 1993, whilst the Rodeo was stolen on 27 March 1994 and advertised for sale by the appellant on 24 June 1994, and it was open to the jury to find in respect of each vehicle that it had, at the relevant time, recently been stolen; and her Honour expressly told the jury that one of the matters on which they had to be satisfied was ""that it had been recently stolen"". We do not know whether the recency of the possession was ever an issue in the trial, and for all we know it may have been accepted on both sides that the possession was recent. The jury were told that it was a matter of which they had to be satisfied, they had the assistance of a flow chart in respect of each vehicle, they sought no help, and no further directions were asked for. 
    33    It was also objected that her Honour failed to direct the jury that if they thought that the accused's explanation might reasonably be true it was not open to them to convict merely on the basis of possession of stolen property and R v Bellamy (1981) 3 A Crim R 432 at 437 was referred to. As I read the summing up, that is effectively what her Honour told the jury.  
    34    Finally by ground 4 the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. In this regard it was submitted that a full time custodial sentence was not necessary having regard to the appellant's prior good record, his only previous convictions being for fraudulent use of number plates, drink driving and other traffic offences. The fraudulent use of number plates was a matter of some concern, although an explanation as to what was said to be the minor nature of the offence was given from the bar table. But in any event, the stealing of motor vehicles or receiving of them for the purposes of fraudulently reconstituting those cars using false compliance plates and false engine numbers is a serious offence and considerations of retribution, general and personal deterrence are important in imposing sentences for such matters.  
    35    A strong message needs to be clearly sent to anyone else who may be tempted to indulge in such activities that if they do so and are convicted, they will receive a significant sentence of full time custody. It is true the appellant had a rather clear record and nothing of this nature, that he had a stable domestic relationship and a good work record and that his former employer and others thought highly of him.  
    36    In particular, it was submitted that the sentence imposed on the larceny count was affected by the sentences imposed on the receiving counts, that the sentences were affected by the judge wrongly finding that the offences were part of a continuous course of criminal conduct that the appellant was involved in the receiving of stolen cars and rebirthing them to be later sold, that she failed to mitigate the penalty on account of the delay in sentencing since the commission of the offences and that she confused the issue of rehabilitation with lack of contrition and that insufficient weight was given to subjective features concerning the appellant. 
    37    I consider these criticisms unfounded. The sentences were all made concurrent and, in my view, correctly reflect the overall criminality involved. Her Honour was justified in finding that the offences were part of a continuous course of criminal conduct having regard to the fact that the relevant activities extended from about mid 1993 until November 1995 and were correctly described by her Honour as ""sophisticated"". Her Honour noted the delay between offending and sentencing in the context of subjective features favourable to the applicant, and made express reference to the prospects of rehabilitation based on the letter which had been written by the appellant, although he had not given evidence in the sentencing process. 
    38    Her Honour took into account all relevant objective and subjective features and, although the sentences might at first glance appear severe, I consider that in all the circumstances, and particularly having regard to the serious nature of the offences, they were within the range of a proper sentencing discretion. I would therefore grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal.  
    39    I propose the following orders:- 
     
     (a) Appeal against convictions dismissed; 
      
     (b) Grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal. 
      
      
    40    SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Dunford J and with his reasons.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by his Honour Judge McGuire in the Sydney District Court. The applicant stood trial on a count charging that he conspired with others to take part in the bringing to Australia of non-citizens contrary to a section of the Migration Act. He was convicted after trial and his Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for fifteen months. He ordered that the applicant be released on recognisance after twelve months, that recognisance conditioned that he be of good behaviour for a further three years after release. 
      
       
      
     2     
     His Honour also ordered the forfeiture of a vessel named the “Gruesome"" which was valued at between $35,000 and $40,000. As I will later observe, it could not be suggested that the “Gruesome"" was purchased with funds belonging to the applicant. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The particular offence at the time carried a maximum prescribed penalty of imprisonment for two years together with, or alternatively, a fine of $13,200. 
      
       
      
     4     
     It can be observed in passing that that maximum sentence has been considerably increased by the legislature of recent times but for my part I would accede to the submission on behalf of the applicant that the matter ought be looked at in the context of the maximum prescribed penalty as at the time that the offence occurred and was dealt with. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The circumstances of the offence were serious indeed. On 3 April 1990 a vessel, the ""Ka Yuen"", some 18 metres in length and registered in Panama, set sail from Hong Kong with a crew of fourteen. It carried no legitimate cargo but had sixty-nine human beings secreted within living quarters between the steel hull of the ship and internal bulwarks. It made its way towards the eastern seaboard of Australia. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The applicant is a migrant to Australia who had originally come here in January 1990. He became a citizen in about 1992. He came from Fujian Province in China which was the origin of the sixty-nine men secreted within the vessel. 
      
       
      
     7     
     The applicant had married in China, having returned there after taking out citizenship here. He has two children, one born in China and one here in Australia. 
      
       
      
     8     
     A number of other persons were involved in the attempt to bring the sixty-nine men into Australia and it is not necessary to detail all their activity. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The applicant was either sufficiently high in the organisation or sufficiently trusted by it to be the recipient of a large transfer of cash, part of which was used for the purchase of the vessel the “Gruesome” to which I have made earlier reference. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The attention of authorities was directed towards what was going on when six Chinese nationals arrived at Sydney Airport on a flight from Hong Kong. There were personal identity documents held by these men far beyond the numbers of the actual group. There were also a number of maritime navigation maps. I need not again detail all the circumstances but it has to be said that there were references to a position off the coast of New South Wales which is where the ""Ka Yuen"" was ultimately intercepted. 
      
       
      
     11     
     It is obvious that the purpose of the purchase of the ""Gruesome"" was to act as a tender for the purpose of moving persons from the ship which had come from Hong Kong onto land in Australia. 
      
       
      
     12     
     As events turned out, this was frustrated apparently by an error made by the applicant who damaged the vessel so that it could not be navigated for its intended purpose. Be that as it may, there was obviously in train a serious assault upon the migration arrangements which are and were current in this country. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The attack upon the sentence imposed by his Honour has been focused upon two principal submissions. The first relates to the maximum penalty of imprisonment (excluding from consideration for the moment the potential for a cumulation of fine) and the requirement of s16G of the  
     Commonwealth Crimes Act 
      that there be taken into account the absence of remissions in the state where the sentence is to be served. New South Wales is a state where there is a relevant absence of remissions. 
      
       
      
     14     
     Counsel has referred to cases commonly adverted to in this area:  
      El Karhani, Beeforth, Bradley, Spiteri 
      and others. He has submitted that as his Honour gave no reason for departure from the approximate reduction for the absence of remissions of about one third that this Court should conclude that there was error in his approach. 
      
       
      
     15     
     His Honour expressly said that he paid attention to the requirements of s16G and, for my part, I do not harbour any doubt about his Honour's statement that he did so. 
      
       
      
     16     
     It has been often said that the approximation of one third is no more than that, an approximation, and insofar as arithmetical exercises suggest that his Honour may have departed from that exercise, my view is, given the whole context of this matter, that the departure should not be regarded as substantial. 
      
       
      
     17     
     I perceive no error in his Honour's approach in this regard. 
      
       
      
     18     
     The second focus of the attack upon the sentence imposed by his Honour was an observation that, as against the sentence of fifteen months, the operation of the recognisance release order after twelve months being served amounts to the setting of a non-parole period which is some eighty percent of the overall sentence. 
      
       
      
     19     
     It is noted that it has been said in such cases that the usual proportion to be applied is somewhere in the region of between sixty to sixty-six and two-thirds percent. His Honour was vested with an appropriate discretion in relation to this matter. It was for his Honour to assess the seriousness of the involvement of this applicant in the offence. 
      
       
      
     20     
     What his Honour concluded was within the range of his exercise of discretion in the particular case. His Honour took into account the absence of remissions pursuant to s 16G. He took into account the period of pre-sentence custody. 
      
       
      
     21     
     In my view, no ground is sustained before this Court for intervention in relation to what his Honour did. 
      
       
      
     22     
     I propose that the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     23     
     MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
      
       
      
     24     
     BERGIN J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     25     
     MEAGHER JA: The orders of the Court are, therefore, the orders proposed by Grove J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      (On application to change plea of guilty) 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The offender, Dean Richard Lulham, appeared before me for trial on one count that on 12 November 1998 at Beechwood in the State of New South Wales he did murder Robert Christopher Spradbrow. An arraignment was held on 2 September 1999 at Sydney in this court. At that time a plea of not guilty was indicated. 
    2   The offender had been committed for trial with DT, and at that time another person had also been charged. 
    3   Subsequently to the committal for trial, DT, who had earlier given a record of interview to the police, on the advice of his solicitors furnished another record of interview in which he inculpated this offender. 
    4   The present offender had on 13 November 1998 given to the police a record of interview. In that interview it is now said that he sought to protect DT. In any event it was that interview which put the police on the scent of arresting DT. He had the following day himself been arrested and given the police a second interview. In that interview he had referred to the earlier interview with police and lies that he had told the police earlier. 
    5   This offender told the police on the second interview, about how he and DT had considerable animosity to the deceased and that when they had been at the riverside, having been drinking too much, this offender went out to the farm at which he was employed and got a gun, allegedly to shoot mullet; that the gun was with him when he went to the island even before the deceased had gone there, and that he had used it for shooting mullet. 
    6   He confirmed that as he had told the police earlier, he had spoken to the deceased and had ""put a treaty on"". He told the police he had made good friends with the deceased and wanted ""peace between them"". 
    7   However, after he had spoken to the deceased he and DT, who had been back at the car, went home, had a few beers, spoke to other persons and then went back out to the island. 
    8   The following appears in that recorded interview:- 
     
      
       
       ""Q.107. And what did you go back out there for? A. [DT] went to shoot the fucking dark cunt. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.108. And what, how did this come about, tell, like, you're there -? A. [DT] wanted to shoot him, I was fucking lost it mate, I just started the car, I didn't know he was gunna shoot him or fucking what he was gunna do. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.109. Well --- A. I thought he was just going over to bloody give him a good talking to. I didn't even know he had the fucking rifle or otherwise I would have took it off him. And that's the God honest bloody truth. I don't want to be charged with anything, Jesus.  
       
      
      
       
       Q.110. Well -- A. I try me best in life. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.111. Alright. I'm not saying you don't, but what I need to know from you is the truth. A. Yeah, that is the truth. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.112. Alright. You've said just a moment ago that [DT], we went back there cause [DT] was gunna shoot him. Now that to me indicates that he said something to you at the house for you to go back there. A. No, [DT] didn't say he was gunna shoot him, right, he said he was going out to talk to him. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.113. Righto. So --- A. Give it to him. I don't know what ---  
       
      
      
       
       Q.114. Alright. So what happened then, the three of you get back into the Range Rover which belongs to your boss? A. Mm. Me and the other bloke were drinking. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.115. Who was driving? A. --- we were, I was. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.116. Alright. And what happened? A. I don't know what happened. I don't know who took the gun out of the car or bloody what happened. I didn't, I would have stopped trouble, I went over and stopped the trouble before, I made a treaty with him. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.117. Yeah. A. Made friends with him, I didn't want anybody shot or harmed. --- I didn't want to see anybody dead and I didn't want to see anybody harmed."" 
       
      
    9   On 19 August 1999, DT pleaded guilty before me. The statement of facts tendered on that plea was incorporated to a substantial extent in a summary of facts that appears at paragraphs 19 to 28 of my remarks on sentence in relation to DT. 
    10   It was common ground in these proceedings that I might have regard to what I had said in that judgment. In that judgment I have set out how that offender came forward to give evidence against this offender and his production to the authorities of a signed confession sent to him whilst he was in gaol by this offender. I had noted in those remarks on sentence the plea by this offender to murder on the basis of being an accessory before the fact to a killing by DT at the time at which I delivered those remarks on sentence. 
    11   That plea was entered before me on 24 August 1999, at the Newcastle Supreme Court. By that time the offender's mother and the third person who had been referred to in the statement of facts and the record of interview, had also pleaded guilty to offences involved in the activities of the various parties surrounding the death of the deceased. It was subsequent to the plea by this offender and the ordering of a pre-sentence report that the remarks on sentence were delivered. 
    12   On 7 December 1999 proceedings commenced on the plea by this offender. On that day the offender was convicted. The arresting police officer and DT gave evidence. 
    13   On 25 February 2000, the counsel who had appeared to that point for the offender, sought leave to withdraw. That leave was granted. The application was made in contemplation that there might be an application to withdraw the plea of guilty. 
    14   On 3 March 2000, another legal practitioner appeared on behalf of the accused and sought, successfully, an adjournment, to consider the question of whether the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty might be made. 
    15   On 17 March 2000, the defence indicated that it was sought to vacate the plea and legal professional privilege was waived in order to enable the proceedings on that application to proceed. Directions were given for affidavits to be prepared and filed. Those affidavits were in due course forthcoming. When on 16 June the affidavits had been provided, a further adjournment was granted to enable the applicant to receive advice and consider what evidentiary course he might wish to take. 
    16   In these proceedings it was agreed that I was to have regard to the affidavits of the applicant sworn 28 April 2000 and two affidavits sworn 14 July 2000. The applicant gave additional oral evidence in chief which without objection merely comprised his assertion that he was not guilty. He was cross-examined and particularly cross-examined on the issue of whether or not he had instructed his counsel of the course he wished to take in the light of the evidence of the elements of the offence. He was questioned on the consistency of his instructions concerning threats he claimed he had heard of to his mother by persons connected to a third person. A statutory declaration concerning the involvement of the third person, or more correctly, that person's non-involvement in the events was presented. 
    17   Evidence was given by affidavit by both the original instructing solicitor and original counsel. Counsel was cross-examined. At no time was any issue raised to suggest any lack of credibility in counsel; nor was any assertion adverse in any way made in respect of that counsel's performance by his client, other than as put, almost by implication, that he failed to obtain instructions with sufficient clarity of analysis as to the legal elements and factual elements so as to record precisely the basis on which the plea was entered. 
    18   In evidence reference was made to written instructions provided by the applicant to his lawyers. Those written instructions have not been tendered before me. The oral evidence of the applicant's counsel and the affidavit evidence of that counsel and the solicitor clearly establish that the applicant was advised of the serious nature of entering a plea of guilty to murder, and that the applicant was advised of the relevant elements, even if not advised of those with the utmost clarity and precision. 
    19   But more importantly, that evidence discloses clearly that at a time subsequent to the providing of those answers to those questions in the record of interview, which I have already set out, and at a time at which I raised with counsel in the presence of the applicant particular concerns that it be understood that the plea was an admission of the relevant circumstances such as would found the offence, it became clear that the applicant was continuing to assert that he was guilty of the offence. 
    20   The Crown had provided a statement of nine points, under the heading of ""Crown assertions of fact"". As to those points, on 7 December 1999 there was a dialogue between defence counsel and myself and the issue of whether or not those points were contested was examined. It was accepted by those parties that a concrete purpose to kill the deceased had crystallised after the offender and DT had been at their home and returned to the island. It was accepted that the first record of interview provided to the police by DT was correct, that the gun was provided by this applicant to DT, who exited the car, went down to the riverbank, shot the deceased and came back. 
    21   It was accepted that the Crown assertions were factually correct except that it was put that this offender would say he was reckless as to what DT was going to do, although he accepted that there was a real possibility that if the deceased was there DT would kill him. It was denied that the offender agreed with the purpose of killing as opposed to being reckless as to whether it might occur. 
    22   At that point I raised with counsel the necessity for there to be a clear understanding of the legal basis of accessoryship upon which the plea was entered, and counsel said, ""there was an understanding the man would be killed if he was there"". I said, ""that is not reckless (sic). Your client was present and entered into that agreement or arrangement that the deceased would be killed?"". Counsel, ""yes"". 
    23   Counsel informed me that his client had entered into that agreement when he drove DT out to the island, that DT's first record of interview was a correct version of what had occurred and counsel drew my attention to questions 107 and thereafter in that record of interview. I was told that the answer to question 108 was correct. This raised the same issue of ambiguity again. 
    24   I said, ""That is plainly in the teeth of the plea of guilty."". Counsel said, ""That is what he said to the police. What he says to me is he accepts if there was a real possibility that he was there he was going to kill him."". 
    25   In further discussion counsel posed the relevant test to be whether his client had agreed by his behaviour to kill the deceased and accepted that he should be sentenced on the basis that he agreed the deceased would be killed, and reached that agreement when DT left the car with the gun. 
    26   At that point I put to counsel that it follows that I could not accept the proposition that the offender did not know at that point that the killing was going to happen and the discussion concluded that I could sentence the accused upon the basis that it was accepted that an agreement was reached that the deceased would be killed at the time at which the offenders returned to the island. During all of this, the offender was present and had the opportunity to give instructions. 
    27   The evidence of Detective Lysaught, the arresting officer, was then given. There was some further discussion which explored the defence contention that I would not accept the Crown evidence that it was this offender who encouraged DT to kill or who first proposed that the killing should occur. At that point it was made perfectly clear that there were only two accounts available of what had happened at the island, and only one account available which would provide direct evidence of what was in this offender's mind, that is his own account. 
    28   Thereafter DT gave evidence and was cross-examined extensively. During that cross-examination I was informed by counsel for the offender that it was accepted that this offender had provided the gun, provided the ammunition and consented to the purpose, and said some things which might have been taken by DT as encouragement, but which were not intended by this applicant to be encouragement. 
    29   Again it was put that it was accepted that in providing him with the gun, provided for the purpose of killing, that must of its very nature have been an encouragement of him to kill. A factual dispute as to whether the deceased was killed following DT going down initially to examine the site at which the deceased lay asleep and returning to the vehicle to get the gun and going down again, was outlined. 
    30   But that is a matter which would really only need to be resolved in the context of a dispute of facts on a plea of guilty. It is not a matter which relates to the issue of whether or not this offender's plea might be set aside. 
    31   It was in the context of that debate, as I have set it out, that the application was made to withdraw the plea. The basis on which that application was made was set out in a written document provided to me. The application was on the basis that there was undue influence or pressure put on the accused to change his plea from not guilty to guilty, and it was because he was under undue influence and pressure that the accused's will was not independent and voluntary because it was overborne; he was unable to make a worthwhile judgment as to what was in his best interests and there was an arguable issue in that the brother's evidence might not be accepted by the jury. 
    32   In the debate before me, however, today, the issues have been put somewhat differently. It has been put that in the questions and answers to which I have referred in the record of interview a real issue arises as to the mental state of the accused at the time, that is to say whether he possessed the relevant intentional state at the relevant time for him to be guilty of murder. 
    33   I have been referred to those passages of the transcript in which it is said counsel has telegraphed the ambiguity, vagueness or inadequacy of instructions to support the plea of guilty to murder which his client had entered. I have also been referred to the cross-examination of DT and in particular certain questions put in cross-examination which seem to indicate an inability to appreciate what should be put on instructions if the instructions were such as to have shown a relevant mental state such as to constitute guilt. 
    34   I have for the moment refrained from referring to this offender's confession, which was provided by DT in his evidence on his plea, since that confession, it appears, adds little on this application, it being the contention of both the Crown and the defence that the accused has on a number of occasions in that confession, and in the first record of interview, lied substantially. 
    35   I have put aside the detail contained in Exhibit A, which was provided on the plea, and which includes the statement of facts of 7 December 1999, since at the time at which the accused sought to withdraw the plea it had not come to any further challenge than the cross-examination of Detective Lysaught and DT, to which I have referred. 
    36   The affidavits of counsel and the instructing solicitor in detail refer to the conferences and advice on the plea. Counsel gives evidence that on 20 August 1999, which was a date the Friday before the plea was entered on the Tuesday, there were discussions as to the possibility of a plea of guilty and a lesser sentence. Counsel gives evidence that he advised the accused to the effect that a plea of guilty accepted all the elements of the offence and that the accused should think it over, but that if there were to be a plea, written instructions were necessary. 
    37   Counsel denies the lack of proper advice and is supported in that regard by the affidavit of the instructing solicitor, which it was not sought to challenge in cross-examination. He says, ""On many occasions he was told by me that he should not plead guilty out of confusion or a sense of hopelessness or out of some misplaced loyalty to [DT]"". 
    38   Advice, he says, was given to his client and on his instructions that if he knew that if the deceased was at the island when he drove DT out there and made the gun available and that DT would kill the deceased, he would be regarded in law as an accessory before the fact to murder. Counsel also gave evidence of advice on the strength of the Crown case including the fact that DT, the offender's mother and friend, as well as certain other persons who were present at critical moments during the night, would give evidence against him. He referred to the deferral of the proceedings to enable his client to discuss the matter with the solicitor and his advice that if he were in any doubt, to plead not guilty. 
    39   In his affidavit he refers to a conversation of 24 February 2000 in which the offender said:- 
     
      
       
       ""I think he wanted me to do it when I'm drunk. I'm capable of anything when I'm drunk. I'm responsible for giving him the gun in the first place. The only reason I feel responsible is because I gave him the gun. I shouldn't be beaten for someone else's fucking mistake. I've told you the truth before and it's working against me."" 
       
      
    40   He continues that he was told by his client, after discussing the previous instructions:- 
     
      
       
       ""Yeah, well I've thought about it. I want to see [DT] on the stand. I want to plead not guilty."" 
       
      
    41   Both counsel and the solicitor deny that they had placed any inappropriate pressure on the offender to plead guilty. Both agreed, however, that in the offender's mind quite clearly was the prospect of a reduced sentence in the context of an overwhelming Crown case against him. In his own affidavits the applicant accepts that neither counsel nor solicitor exerted direct pressure on him to plead guilty, but he felt a great deal of pressure from the prospect of losing a discount on sentence. 
    42   It is difficult in the light of that material in the affidavits of 14 July to know quite how one can regard what he said in his affidavit of 28 April 2000 concerning counsel reducing him to tears, and for the next hour or so putting enormous pressure on him to change his plea from not guilty to guilty. It is noted that in that affidavit only limited issue is taken with the accounts given by DT to the police. 
    43   Before me it has been submitted that I should have regard on such an application as this to the cautionary words referred to by Kirby, P. in Regina v. Liberti (1991) 55 ALR 120 at 122, as to the circumspection with which a trial court should approach an application to withdraw a plea, and as to the reluctance with which an appellate court would disturb a plea. 
    44   I have been referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Davies (unreported 16 December 1993). I have drawn counsel's attention to the decision in Regina v. Ganderton (CCA, unreported 17 September 1998), reviewing many of the authorities in respect of appeals against conviction where there has been a plea of guilty below and subsequent withdrawal of a plea. 
    45   Whilst it is the case that the position is not entirely the same in respect of an appeal from a conviction entered after plea, nonetheless there are very similar issues raised when a trial judge comes to consider the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. Plainly if the maintenance of the plea was such as might work a miscarriage, it could not be allowed to stand. The court will go behind a guilty plea and hear an appeal against conviction where a miscarriage may have occurred, and similarly a trial judge would be astute not to maintain a conviction on a plea of guilty where any arguable question of the accused's guilt remains. 
    46   In that regard, if the plea itself is impugned by some circumstance showing that the accused's will has been overborne, so that he was not admitting his guilt and an arguable question remains of that guilt, I have no doubt that a court would overturn the plea: Davies (supra) per Badgery-Parker at pp.11-16. If the accused was admitting something he did not know or had not done for the sake of some benefit having been improperly extended to him, that would clearly be a sufficient circumstance in my view to found an application for the plea to be overturned. 
    47   But on an application of this kind the applicant bears the onus of showing that the plea should be withdrawn. In that regard, he must show such matter as I have referred to. If he did not know the nature of the charge or failed to appreciate whether the circumstances might or might not make out his guilt, where the plea has been induced by threats or certain kinds of mistake, or a deficiency of evidence such that it would not have been open to the jury to convict him, all of these and more would constitute adequate bases for overturning the plea, and reversing the conviction. 
    48   But more is necessary, as the authorities show, than a mere change of mind to overturn an admission of this, the most formal kind, to such a serious offence, particularly where that admission has been provided to the court after advice from counsel whose competence and independence are unchallenged, and who has proffered that advice in the light of all parties being aware of those matters debated in court and those questions and answers to which I have referred in the record of interview: Regina v. Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218. That plea is an admission that at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offence this accused had the relevant state of mind sufficient to make out that element of the offence. In the event that it was to be contended that this accused did not have the relevant state of mind, one would have expected some evidence with some degree of particularity on that issue. 
    49   These proceedings have been adjourned time and again to permit the accused to take advice and to give evidence and to take issue with the relevant portions of the Crown case. He simply has again chosen not to. 
    50   There may have been some degree of vagueness in disposition and inconsistencies in his attitude from time to time, but it is not the law that because a person who has pleaded guilty seeks to assert matters later to minimise his culpability, which are asserted then to be inconsistent with the plea, that thereby the plea must be vacated. Nor is it the law that because an accused person contemplates he might obtain some benefit which the law confers, such as a discount for a plea of guilty on sentence, that they can refer to that matter as creating an unacceptable pressure and thereby impugning the plea. 
    51   The authorities clearly establish that there must be something that vitiates the effect of the plea as an admission of the relevant circumstances, there must be something which taints the proceedings. It may well be that if there were evidence that the accused did not have the relevant or a relevant intention, other questions might have arisen, but there is nothing in the material before me coming from the source from which one would expect there to be evidence if the accused were not guilty, that he did not have the relevant mental state such as to propound an arguable question. 
    52   That means, of course, in the context of this matter there is no such matter as goes to show that the plea did not represent, when it was made a genuine expression of consciousness of guilt of the offence charged. All the material from counsel and the solicitor indicates that the plea was such an expression and that the accused had possession of the relevant facts and the relevant awareness, if not precise awareness, of the nature of the charge. 
    53   It is not necessary in order for the plea to stand that the precise moment of awareness of the fact that killing would occur be established, provided that moment coincides with this offender offering assistance or encouragement to the killer. 
    54   What appears to be in issue is when that assistance or encouragement occurred. What appears to be in issue is whether this accused was the prime mover or DT, the principal in the first degree. Notwithstanding the care and skill with which his present counsel and solicitor have approached this application, notwithstanding the various adjournments in which opportunity has been afforded to put forward any bases upon which the plea might not stand, in my view nothing has been put forward such as to impugn the integrity of the plea, taint the proceedings, raise an arguable issue for trial or call into doubt that the plea should not be maintained. 
    55   I therefore dismiss the application.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      (On discharge of jury - see p.260 of transcript) 
      
     
    1   HIS HONOUR: At what was almost the end of the Crown case, application was made by the Crown to call evidence of the use on the preceding night to the alleged day of the killing by the accused of a mobile telephone. That evidence was led to establish he was the user of the mobile phone which rang through to directory assistance seeking the Botany Police telephone number at the time at which the eye witness to the killing said he saw the assailant apparently using a mobile phone. 
    2   There had been evidence in the proceedings of the various times during which that phone had been used on that evening and on the day of the killing. There was evidence from which it was sought to prove that the accused exclusively used the phone. That evidence had reached the point at which I had expressed the view that the evidence could be accepted by a jury as proving that the accused habitually, if not exclusively, used the mobile phone himself. 
    3   The evidence that it is now sought to elicit was provided to the defence at or before committal and since, including at and prior to trial. It is evidence that the accused used the mobile phone and a voice answering system in the process of trading in marijuana, at least with one couple. 
    4   No notice had been given by the Crown to the defence of the use of that material as tendency evidence within s.97 of the Evidence Act 1995. Until now, its use was apparently contemplated to show calls with the accused proximate to the relevant time, not for the purpose of those calls. It is submitted that the purpose is relevant to whether the accused would permit others access to the phone. 
    5   In a sense, it is not tendency evidence but is evidence of the use of a tool of crime such as to enable the identification of the accused with the person using the mobile phone at the scene of the killing and thus to prove him to be the assailant. 
    6   I have thought better to consider it as tendency evidence for the purpose of dealing with the Crown's application. 
    7   Since the fate of that application has already been communicated by me to counsel following argument in the absence of the jury, I am concerned with, in these reasons, summarising what has occurred. Although neither counsel requires the reasons in extenso, they do require the summary for what background it affords for the possible enforceability of the undertaking that I am advised will be given in consequence of the Crown's attitude to a discharge application by the defence, recognising the rulings I would make as to the admissibility of the evidence. 
    8   This is a circumstantial evidence case which critically turns on identifying the assailant. The evidence now under consideration, when taken in conjunction with the other evidence in the case including:- 
     
      
     (a) the discussion by the accused with his employer of confronting and chasing away a person who had been seen entering or prowling around his home;  
      
      
     (b) the call to directory assistance indicating content referable to the circumstances of the assault; 
      
      
     (c) the eye witness identified the assailant as being a person similar in description to the accused using a mobile phone and referring to the assailant claiming the deceased had been attempting to break in or steal from his premises; and 
      
      
     (d) the accused's mobile phone was used at or about that time - indeed was the only mobile phone used at that time by that service provider; 
      
      
     is such that even having regard to the possible content of the inferences that might be drawn from those matters being cut down by other matters given in evidence, that is:- 
      
      
     (a) that many Polynesian people, including some that might fit the description, lived in the area; 
      
      
     (b) that the accused has asserted an alibi and that alibi asserts a locus for him at the relevant time, at a place which, equally with the location of the killing, fits the telephone service provider information tendered in evidence; and 
      
      
     (c) that the likelihood or possibility that the assailant's call might have been supplied from another service provider cannot be entirely ruled out (the records of those service providers were destroyed before the sinister nature of the death became apparent some four to six weeks after the finding of the body), 
      
      
     as to identify the accused with the personal use of the phone at the relevant time and hence to materially assist to establish he was the assailant. 
      
    9   Putting those matters all together, it still seems to me that this evidence could have a critical effect upon the trial and if that is so, then it answers the tests for admissibility posed by the requirements of both ss.97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995, even if it is to be treated as tendency evidence. 
    10   It is clearly enough evidence that is capable of showing such a degree of association between the accused and the telephone hand set and answering system as to have probative value of significance. That it is evidence of dealing in marijuana but not indicating a particularly violent disposition does not seem to me to create any real risk of prejudicial effect, once a proper direction is conceded as available for the jury to discount the probability of them being minded to convict the accused on the basis that he was a drug dealer. 
    11   In any event if the mobile phone is simply a tool of crime such as to link him with what has occurred so that I am not dealing with it as tendency evidence, then, in my view, the exercise of discretion under ss.137 and 135 would not fall in favour of the accused, having regard to what I accept as high probative value of the evidence. 
    12   That left me then considering the effects on this trial of the Crown not having given notice in a reasonable time that the evidence was to be used in this way. 
    13   As it happened, with frankness, counsel for the accused conceded that it had been intended to elicit evidence that the accused had not previously been convicted and the evidence would have been available for the Crown to rebut the good character the defence asserted. If that was the only use to which it would have been put, then the question of whether the defence would have, in those circumstances, continued to assert good character in that way, or whether or not I would have permitted the Crown to call it if this was to be its only use, considering the accused was not convicted of any offence, raised very interesting questions which need not now be dealt with. It is clear that if the evidence is admitted in chief, it remains open for the defence to utilise good character in that way and that way or perhaps otherwise to diminish the value, including any prejudicial value, it might have and to pray that in aid in addition to the direction I would give. 
    14   However, the most important matter I must consider is that the Crown did not give notice this evidence would be used in this way in adequate much less reasonable time. The Act is quite clear the evidence is not to be used for a tendency purpose unless either notice is given or the necessity for that notice is dispensed with under s.100. 
    15   It is therefore necessary I consider the application of s.100. 
    16   Critical as I have held the evidence is, in my view, and answering the test which would make it admissible I am disposed in favour of it being admitted for that purpose, provided the defence is protected from any untoward disadvantage. 
    17   Given those circumstances, I enquired of the Crown what the Crown's attitude would be to affording the defence an opportunity to test it, or to recast its case to take some such step as might ameliorate its decision to run the case in the way which it has to date. The Crown at that point conceded if the evidence was to go in, then it was open to the defence to claim an adjournment or, as it has, a discharge and that the Crown could not oppose that discharge. 
    18   It still did not seem to me that would entirely meet the exigencies of the case since the accused had conducted the case and met the costs of his defence in the way in which he had to this point so that if there were a discharge those costs would be thrown away. 
    19   The Crown however has proffered an undertaking to enable the disadvantage to the defence position to be as far as possible rectified, which undertaking is designed to overcome such impediments as might have existed for the dispensing with the reasonable notice requirements on terms under s.100(6). 
    20   It is accepted by the defence that the undertaking, if properly covering such disadvantages as would be caused to the defence if the evidence was to be used in this case, goes as far to cure the procedural prejudice in this regard as one is able to. Of course, the enforceability of that undertaking will have to abide by what occurs in the interim between ceasing today in consequence of a discharge and the hearing coming on again in the future. 
    21   The defence has sought that I remain in the trial. The Crown does not oppose that course. The suggestion is that it would be expeditious and cost saving in that the existing rulings could well stand, subject to there being any change in evidence. Both parties have indicated that they need time to investigate. Each has indicated that the matter would not be ready to proceed until following the Christmas vacation. Those decisions are no doubt made in the context of that period of time during which both court proceedings and proper investigation will be impossible, thanks to the Olympics. 
    22   This matter has been outstanding for a considerable period of time and I am informed that the accused, who is now on bail, was in custody for a period of 12 months. That is not something about which one can do anything in retrospect. For the future, at least, and given there had been during this trial many matters which indicate late preparation on the Crown's part, whilst I am prepared to accede to the proposition the parties put to me, it should be very very clear that any additional matter of evidence will have to be notified so that the defence can meet it and the matter be ready to proceed in all respects on the next occasion. 
    23   It will be a matter for the List Judge as to whether I am the trial judge or not and a matter for the exigencies of the list, but I note counsel's submissions in that regard. It is a matter of considerable regret that in these circumstances this trial must at this time, if justice is to be done to the Crown and the defence, notwithstanding the Prosecution's lassitude to date, be aborted, but this court sits to make sure that the case that might lawfully be put forward and that a party wishes to put forward may be heard. Even though evidence in support of that case should not be notified in a timely way if the prejudice can be cured, then a party should not be denied an opportunity to put forward what may be crucial to a just determination of the matter. 
    24   I will therefore order, noting the undertaking given by the Crown which has been set out in the transcript, that the jury be discharged, that the trial be adjourned and that the matter be placed back in the callover list on the next callover occasion. I make those orders. The exhibits may be returned.

      70018/96 - REGINA v John SERRATORE 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On Wednesday 21 June 2000, Mr John Serratore was found guilty of the murder of Frances Tizzone. It remains for me to determine the facts (in a manner consistent with the verdict), and to pass sentence. 
     
      
    2   The facts which must be determined are those relevant to the sentencing discretion (Savvas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1), and must satisfy the criminal standard, that is, must be established beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    3   At the time of her death, Frances Tizzone was 21 years old. Mr Serratore was one year older. They had met at school. Soon after leaving school, they began seeing each other again. There was, at this time, affection and commitment between them. They planned to become engaged in 1995. Their romance was attended by a certain formality. In accordance with cultural traditions, the Tizzone family met with the Serratore family. 
     
      
    4   However, in the latter part of 1994, the relationship began to sour. Mr Serratore became jealous and obsessive. More than that, he mistreated Frances Tizzone, physically slapping her on a number of occasions. I have no doubt that the episodes of violence were more frequent that the two occasions that Mr Serratore acknowledged in his evidence. 
     
      
    5   In late October 1994, Mr Serratore noticed that Frances was behaving coolly towards him. He did not see her behaviour as a reaction to his own behaviour, and violence. Rather, he became convinced that she was showing interest in another man. 
     
      
    6   Mr Serratore decided to confront her. He went to the Tizzone house on Saturday 5 November 1994. They argued, and in the course of the argument, Mr Serratore slapped Frances’ face. Mrs Patricia Tizzone, Frances’ mother, witnessed this action. She called upon her husband to intervene. An ugly scene developed. Both families ultimately became embroiled. 
     
      
    7   After the incident, such was Mr Serratore’s fury with Frances Tizzone, that he sought to persuade a friend, a person already facing criminal charges, to harm her. 
     
      
    8   On 18 November 1994, an Apprehended Violence Order was made against Mr Serratore, forbidding contact with Frances Tizzone. 
     
      
    9   Frances Tizzone, however, plainly felt an attraction to Mr Serratore, and some love for him. Without her family’s knowledge, she renewed contact with him. And so the romance began once more. I have no doubt that they saw each other from December 1994. Their relationship included sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    10   However, I accept the evidence of Mrs Patricia Tizzone that her daughter disclosed, in March 1995, that she could not put out of her mind the events, and the abuse, of late 1994. I accept that Frances Tizzone determined that she would finish her relationship, and that she communicated that determination to Mr Serratore. 
     
      
    11   Frances Tizzone’s sister, Antonella, then aged 15 years, gave evidence that she overheard a telephone conversation in a bedroom they shared. In the course of the conversation, Frances made arrangements to meet someone the next day, 29 March 1995, being the day that Frances disappeared. Antonella remembered the conversation as including the following: 
     
      
       
       (Frances): “I don’t want to meet you.” 
       
      
    12   Frances Tizzone went on to say: 
     
      
       
       “Or else what? Why are you talking to me like this?” 
       
      
    13   Later she heard Frances say something along the following lines: 
     
      
       
        
        “OK, I will meet you tomorrow afternoon after Uni. I will meet you at the station. I will bring the card, but make sure you bring the bag.” 
        
       
      
    14   It was the Crown case that Mr Serratore made that call. I have no doubt that Antonella heard the conversation which she repeated in evidence. I am left in some doubt as to when she realised that the person to whom Frances had been speaking was Mr Serratore. However, I am satisfied that it was Mr Serratore, and that the inference Antonella ultimately drew, was the correct one. 
     
      
    15   I believe there can be no doubt that Frances Tizzone made arrangements to meet Mr Serratore. A number of matters point clearly to an arranged meeting. First, on the day she disappeared, Wednesday 29 March 1995, Frances told her mother that she would not be needing the car. Secondly, when offered a lift home by her friend, Ms Rima Abou-Raad, Frances declined. She offered an excuse, which was plainly false. Thirdly, Frances asked her friend to phone her home, so that her family could tape the TV news. She wanted to see an item, and knew she would not be home by the usual time. 
     
      
    16   It may be said, and was said by Mr Serratore at the trial, that such evidence simply points to an arrangement to meet someone. It does not point specifically to Mr Serratore. However, quite apart from the circumstantial case which the Crown sought to make against Mr Serratore, pointing to Mr Serratore as the likely person with whom the arrangement had been made, there was expert evidence that provided a compelling link to Mr Serratore. 
     
      
    17   When Frances Tizzone’s body was discovered in bushland, adjacent to the Wakehurst Parkway, there were fibres adhering to her boots. The fibres were the subject of much evidence. There is no question that they came from the car carpet of Mr Serratore’s Honda CRX motor vehicle. They pointed to Frances having recently been in his car. And, having been in that car, she almost certainly never walked again. I accept the evidence that the fibres would not have remained upon the shoes had she walked as little as five or ten paces. The suggestion that they may have adhered longer, because of a sticky substance on the fibres, was unconvincing. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Frances Tizzone was in Mr Serratore’s vehicle shortly before her death. 
     
      
    18   The Crown, when putting its case, was not able to say whether Mr Serratore was the assassin, or whether he had help. If he had help, it may simply have been in disposing of the body. The jury was given written directions which identified the elements of the charge in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. that Frances Tizzone died; 
        
       
       
       AND 
       
       
        
        2. that her death was cause by a deliberate act done with intent to kill or cause really serious injury; 
        
       
       
       AND  
       
       
        
        3. that the act causing death, was an act for which Mr Serratore was responsible, in that either: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) he carried out the act causing death himself, having that intent; 
          
         
        
       
       
       OR 
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) he was present, aiding or encouraging another, whom he knew had that intent, to commit the act causing death; 
          
         
        
       
       
       OR 
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) he procured another to kill Frances Tizzone, which that other duly did.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19   The directions included a note, which was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Serratore performed one or other of roles (a) or (b) or (c), and yet are undecided as to which role he performed, your verdict would be guilty of murder.” 
        
       
      
    20   I do not believe, for the purposes of sentencing, that I am obliged to chose between these alternatives. To my mind, the moral culpability attaching to one role is as great as that attaching to another. It may be otherwise, were there room for the view that the slaying of Frances Tizzone was a spontaneous, or explosive, act. I reject that view. The arrangements to meet, and the efficiency with which Frances Tizzone was despatched, point to premeditation, and planning. Although Mr Serratore’s act was, on one view, a crime of passion, it was smouldering, vindictive passion, which had more to do with revenge than love. 
     
      
    21   This has been a retrial. I have had the advantage of reading the remarks on sentence of Newman J after the previous trial. I should, therefore, approach my task bearing in mind the words of Street CJ in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416: (at 419) 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a sound principle of sentencing that, on a new trial consequent upon the quashing of a conviction by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the accused should ordinarily not receive a longer sentence or non-parole period than those following upon the first trial.” 
        
       
      
    22   Street CJ returned to that principle in R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711 where he said this: (at 713) 
     
      
       
        
        “It might have been preferable to have expressed this as a prima facie approach rather than elevating it to principle. Where the judge of the new trial considers that the circumstances of the case do call for a longer sentence he will not be absolutely fettered by the approach prima facie to be adopted. … It could be expected, however, that, if he did take the view that a longer sentence were called for than that passed at the first trial, then there would be a specific indication of the reasons leading him to this view.” 
        
       
      
    23   This was a brutal and awful crime. A young woman, of considerable promise, was lured into a trap and slain. Her family sat in the gallery throughout the trial. One can only imagine their agony. However, the sorrow of those who remain behind is not a matter which I should take into account, and I do not do so (R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85). 
     
      
    24   Newman J imposed a sentence of 20 years penal servitude. He found special circumstances. He fixed a minimum term of 14 years. He adjusted the minimum term by one year (to 13 years) to reflect 243 days in custody awaiting trial, and a further 122 days for what he described as “onerous bail conditions”. 
     
      
    25   I have been urged by both the Crown and Counsel for Mr Serratore to adopt the same approach. Counsel for Mr Serratore also urges that I further adjust the minimum term (the non parole period) to reflect a number of matters that have occurred since the first trial. 
     
      
    26   Mr Serratore was born on 30 January 1973. He is 27 years old. He came from a good family. His family has stood by him since he was charged. That augers well for his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    27   Mr Serratore completed his Higher School Certificate in 1991. He had a number of jobs, and was regarded as a good worker. He has no criminal convictions. 
     
      
    28   Mr Serratore has shown no contrition. He continues to maintain his innocence. For the reasons which commended themselves to Newman J, I believe that there are special circumstances. 
     
      
    29   I am, therefore, content to adopt and reaffirm the sentence imposed by Newman J, subject to any adjustment that should be made for the period since that sentence began (6 November 1998), which I will now consider. 
     
      
    30   Is there a basis for further adjusting the non-parole period (which was, on 6 November 1998, 13 years, and due to expire on 5 November 2011). Three arguments were advanced by Mr Toner SC, Counsel for Mr Serratore: 
     
      
    · First, a further discount should be given to reflect onerous bail conditions during the period 9 December 1999 to 19 June 2000. 
     
      
    · Secondly, through no fault of Mr Serratore’s, a retrial was necessary. Five years have elapsed between his arrest and the second conviction. That is a prolonged hardship which should be taken into account. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, Mr Serratore during that five years, has undertaken his sentence by instalments. That, it is suggested, is an additional hardship, warranting recognition in the form of some further discount. 
     
      
    31   Dealing with each of these arguments, Newman J, in his remarks on sentence, referred to the following passage from R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, where Hunt and Badgery-Parker J said this: (at 258/9) 
     
      
       
        
        “In our view, this period of quasi-custody should have been taken into account in the circumstances - by giving credit for a substantial proportion but not the whole of that period. We assess that a fair allowance in this case for that additional period of eight months is a reduction of six months in the minimum period.” 
        
       
      
    32   Mr Serratore was on bail for broken periods between 2 May 1996 and 6 November 1998. Newman J, as I have mentioned, described the bail conditions as “onerous”. He allowed 122 days discount from the sentence (rounding off the year) to reflect that fact. 
     
      
    33   Here, Mr Serratore was given bail on 8 December 1999. He was on bail, therefore, for approximately 6 months. He was subject to the same conditions as had previously been imposed. He was obliged to live at home. He was not permitted to enter licensed premises, or take illegal drugs. He was obliged to observe a curfew from 8.00 pm until 5.00 am, unless in the company of his parents, or their nominee. 
     
      
    34   The circumstances which attracted a discount in Cartwright’s case were significantly different from those affecting Mr Serratore. Mr Cartwright was described by Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ as “only nominally on bail” (at 258). He resided in Sydney, but was obliged to live in Canberra. The obligation arose from the need to provide the police with further assistance. One of the bail conditions required that he obey the reasonable directions of the police, and submit to their supervision. The period during which he was on bail was therefore accurately described as a period of “quasi-custody”. 
     
      
    35   The same cannot be said for Mr Serratore. I do not regard the bail conditions as particularly onerous, nor detracting significantly from his freedom. I therefore decline to discount the minimum term upon that basis. Having said that I, nonetheless, will not disturb the characterisation by Newman J, when he previously passed sentence, which I adopt. I do, however, regard that discount as having been very generous. 
     
      
    36   Moving to the second aspect, I accept that a prolonged period of uncertainty is a hardship. I accept, of course, that the need for a retrial came about through no fault on the part of Mr Serratore. However, again I believe that no discount is warranted. Some delay between arrest and trial is inevitable. Part of the delay has been spent in custody. Mr Serratore will be given credit for every day he has served. The period during which he had conditional freedom had advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand he had to suffer prolonged uncertainty. On the other hand, during important years, he had that freedom. 
     
      
    37   I come finally to the suggestion that Mr Serratore is disadvantaged in having to serve his sentence “by instalments”. He has served the following periods: 
     
      
       
        
        17 May 1995 to 29 June 1995 
        
       
       
        
        20 September 1995 to 23 February 1996 
        
       
       
        
        6 November 1998 to 8 December 1999 
        
       
      
    38   I revoked bail during the course of my summing up (on 19 June 2000), and Mr Serratore has, of course, remained in custody since that time. 
     
      
    39   My attention has been drawn to the following passage in Todd v R [1982] 2 NSWLR 517: (at 519/20) 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be wrong, in my opinion, to disregard the practical situation that the appellant had already served a substantial period of imprisonment in Queensland for offences so closely related in time and character to the Sydney offences… 
        
       
       
        
        …where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach -- passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner.” 
        
       
      
    40   See also Mill v The Queen [1988] 166 CLR 59 at 64 ff. 
     
      
    41   It is suggested that, by analogy, the deferment of sentence in this case calls for some adjustment to the non parole period. I disagree. Again, the circumstances in Todd were quite different. Because of the jurisdictional limits of each State, and because the accused committed a number of crimes in different states, the prisoner was dealt with by one State at one time, and another State at a later point in time, even though the offences occurred at much the same time. That is not this case. 
     
      
    42   I believe, therefore, that the appropriate adjustment to Mr Serratore’s non parole period, which was fixed by Newman J at 13 years as at 6 November 1998, is by reference to the periods served after that date, before being released to bail. Mr Serratore was in custody after the first trial until 8 December 1999, a period of 1 year and 34 days. I add this to the 1 year discount Newman J gave when he sentenced the prisoner in December 1998. Hence, the non parole period of 14 years is to be adjusted by subtracting a total of 2 years and 34 days, leaving a period of 11 years 331 days to serve before Mr Serratore becomes eligible for parole. The commencement date will be the date that Mr Serratore went into custody, namely 19 June 2000. The head sentence will be 6 years from the time that Mr Serratore becomes eligible for parole. 
     
      
    43   John SERRATORE, I sentence you to imprisonment for 20 years with a non parole period of 14 years. Giving credit for time served, and other appropriate discounts (namely 2 years and 34 days), and calculating from the day you went into custody, namely, 19 June 2000, you will be eligible for release on parole on 17 May 2012. Your sentence will expire on 17 May 2018.

      REGINA v Antony ZANZE 
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     NEWMAN J: I will ask Sperling J to deliver the first judgment in this matter. 
      
       
      
     2     
     SPERLING J: The applicant pleaded guilty to four charges of receiving and asked that five matters of goods in custody be taken into account. The receiving offences were committed during a period from October 1998 to February 1999. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The goods the subject of the receiving charges included a watch, a mobile phone, some power tools, cameras and a radio cassette player. All had been stolen from property broken into. 
      
       
      
     4     
     On 10 September 1999 Job DCJ sentenced the applicant to two years and eight months penal servitude, including a minimum term of two years commencing on 29 March 1999. 
      
       
      
     5     
     At the time of sentencing the applicant was thirty-three years of age. He had a criminal record extending over a period of ten years or thereabouts, which included several convictions for property offences of a similar kind, the most recent of which resulted in a sentence of three years imprisonment with a minimum term of one year. The applicant had been released on parole in August 1998 on completion of the minimum term. The present offences were committed during the currency of the additional term. Parole was subsequently revoked due to further offences. The applicant returned to gaol in March 1999. It was during that period of approximately seven months out of prison on bail that the applicant committed the subject offences. 
      
       
      
     6     
     There are three grounds of appeal. Ground 1 is that his Honour erred in not taking into account in the exercise of his sentencing discretion the fact that the charges could have been dealt with in the Local Court. It is said that his Honour must have overlooked the consideration that these charges could have been dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority elected otherwise. The maximum penalty in relation to any one count would then have been twelve months. 
      
       
      
     7     
     This consideration could not feasibly have affected the result. The prosecuting authority had elected to proceed in the District Court in this case and properly so in my view. 
      
       
      
     8     
     Ground 2 is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In my view it was not, particularly when one has regard to the fact that part of the sentence was to be served concurrently with the balance of the additional term under the earlier sentence for which parole was revoked. 
      
       
      
     9     
     Ground 3 is that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances. It is suggested that because his Honour failed to mention special circumstances it could be inferred that he omitted to give consideration to this topic. Whether an inference of that kind is to be drawn varies from case to case. This is an appeal from a very experienced District Court judge. There is no prospect that he may have overlooked the topic and given no thought to whether special circumstances should be found. Nor is this a case in which a failure to find special circumstances was erroneous. 
      
       
      
     10     
     This is plainly a case in which the appeal should not succeed. I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
         1. Grant leave to appeal. 
          
         2. Appeal dismissed. 
         
        
       
      
     11     
     NEWMAN J: I agree with the reasons and the orders proposed by my brother Sperling J. The order of the Court will be as he proposes.

     REGINA v WATSON 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   FITZGERALD JA: Early on Saturday 7 October 1995, the appellant was driving his motor vehicle along Henry Parry Drive, Gosford, on his way to work when the vehicle struck and killed Mr Adam Hiller. The weather was fine, the road surface was dry and visibility was good. Warning signs clearly indicated the presence of workers carrying out road maintenance, and traffic cones protected their working space. Before he was struck, Mr Hiller was standing between white marked lines on the road wearing a reflective vest and holding a traffic control sign. The appellant’s vehicle veered to the right shortly before it struck Mr Hiller. Mr Hiller’s body was carried along on the appellant’s vehicle until it fell off when the vehicle veered to the left. The vehicle hit a gutter and guard rail, moved to the centre of the road, continued for a short distance, stopped briefly, and then moved forward and turned into Shortland Street. 
    2   Police located the appellant’s damaged vehicle at the President’s Hill lookout later that day. There were blood marks on the vehicle and blood stains on clothing in the vehicle. The route followed by the appellant after he drove into Shortland Street following the accident was not fully established. At one point, he drove into Mann Street, close to the kerb, and his vehicle “… went over the flower bed and then hit a post and tossed up the rail which was across the entrance to the park, … hit some other posts… kept going and went over the path for about 15 to 20 metres before going back onto the road…. continued in a northerly direction, past the Police Station, and turned left, into Georgina Street.” The only other sighting of the appellant’s vehicle after the accident, before it was located at President’s Hill, was in Rennick Street where it was seen to turn onto the Pacific Highway. There is only one road from the bottom of President’s Hill to the lookout. The appellant drove the final 500 metres with one of the tyres on his vehicle deflated. 
    3   The appellant was charged with dangerous driving occasioning Mr Hiller’s death contrary to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900. He pleaded not guilty. 
    4   There have been three trials, each taking about 10 to 12 days. The jury at the first trial could not agree on the appellant’s guilt or innocence, and the second trial had to be aborted because of an improper approach to a jury member towards the end of the trial by a person unconnected with the appellant or the prosecution. The third trial took place before a District Court judge and a jury at Gosford on 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16,17, 18, 19 and 20 August 1999. After 3 days deliberation during which the trial judge was informed of a “stalemate”, the jury convicted the appellant at 3.46 on a Friday afternoon, shortly after his Honour had referred to the possibility of an adjournment to the following Monday. The appellant was sentenced on 24 September 1999, and has served part of his sentence of periodic detention. 
    5   The appellant appealed to this Court, and the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed pursuant to s 5 D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the appellant’s sentence. The appellant also applied for an extension of time within which to raise additional grounds of appeal. 
    6   It was unnecessary for the Court to consider the appellant’s additional grounds of appeal or the prosecution appeal against the appellant’s sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing in relation to the appellant’s original grounds of appeal, the Court allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict, quashed the appellant’s conviction, and entered a verdict of acquittal.  
    7   It was not in dispute that the appellant was driving his motor vehicle dangerously when it struck Mr Hiller causing his death. It was also common ground that the prosecution was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant’s dangerous driving occasioning Mr Hiller’s death was voluntary. In the circumstances, that required it to establish that a sudden loss of consciousness or awareness by the appellant prior to his vehicle striking Mr Hiller was not a rational possibility. The prosecution theory is unclear, but might have been that the accident was caused by the appellant’s inattention, perhaps because he was tired. 
    8   The appellant, who was aged about 19 years at the time of the accident, had been admitted to Gosford Hospital on 29 July 1995 suffering meningococcal meningitis, a serious illness which is sometimes fatal. For survivors, the risk of epilepsy in the first 5 years following infection is between 2.4 and 10 per cent. In September that year, the appellant was advised by his medical practitioner that he could return to work and he did so. He also took a second job, delivering pizzas at night. He was not informed that he might experience epilepsy or that he should not drive a motor vehicle. 
    9   The appellant’s parents, employer and friends observed that the appellant’s personality and behaviour had altered since his illness and that his physical and mental functioning had deteriorated. He was very tired, forgetful, very vague and, spoke and responded slowly. Whereas he had previously been his employer’s leading apprentice with the ability to operate complex equipment and work to very small tolerances, he could not do so after his illness and had to be given less skilled work. The appellant’s employer and some of his friends recalled the appellant telling them prior to the accident that he had experienced a blackout on 4 October 1995 while driving a pizza delivery vehicle. 
    10   On Friday, 6 October 1995, the appellant worked at the carpentry and joinery firm where he was apprenticed, returned home and slept for a period, then worked at his second job delivering pizzas, and later went out with friends.  
    11   The appellant’s mother went to wake him at about 6.20 a.m. on the day of the accident. She saw that he was not in his room but was sitting in his car in the driveway. She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder but he did not respond. She said his name, and he said “work” and drove off. She went inside and said to her husband “There’s something awfully wrong with Robert. We’ve got to go and see if he’s alright”.  
    12   The appellant’s parents set off in their car, with his father driving. They came to the scene of the accident, which was not far from their home. They stopped and asked what had happened. They were told that there had been an accident caused by a white car which had continued in the direction of Shortland Street. The appellant’s mother sent her husband to see if the appellant had arrived at work and went along Shortland Street looking for the appellant. When she was unsuccessful, she went home. Her husband had returned and told her that the appellant had not arrived at work and they went out looking for him again. It was about 7.20a.m. when they next arrived home and the appellant was there, in the shower. They questioned him but did not get any sensible answers. Some of his clothes were on the floor with dirt and other material on them and a blood stain on one item. When the appellant came out of the shower, he appeared sleepy and looked into space. The appellant’s mother went to the home of the solicitor who represented the appellant in these proceedings, Mr Ross Derham, who conducts his practice in East Gosford. Mr Derham attended at their home and joined in questioning the appellant, who was very lethargic and “sort of staring” and fell asleep at about 11.00a.m. 
    13   The appellant’s father and Mr Derham gave evidence to similar effect. The appellant’s father also stated that his search for the appellant’s vehicle was unsuccessful, and that the appellant denied having been in an accident and said that he was going to work. The appellant kept falling asleep and waking until he fell asleep at about 11a.m.  
    14   Mr Derham said that, when he arrived at the appellant’s parents’ home, the appellant’s father was asking the appellant where his car was, where his car keys were and whether he had been involved in an accident. Mr Derham said that the appellant was very tired and was having difficulty keeping his eyes open. He said that his car was in a club carpark and, when told that it was not there, he said that one of his friends must have it. When Mr Derham questioned the appellant, he received similar answers. Mr Derham asked the appellant whether he remembered his mother coming down to wake him in the car and he said that he did not. He said that he knew nothing about an accident and asked whether anybody had been hurt. He said that he could not remember anything about that morning except running through bushes. The appellant appeared exhausted, dozed off from time to time and fell asleep on the couch.  
    15   The appellant was arrested and charged later that day. Dr Young, a medical practitioner who attended the Gosford Police Station at Mr Derham’s request, considered the appellant fit to be interviewed although he noted that he “looked tired, if not exhausted”.  
    16   The prosecution did not challenge the veracity of the evidence given by the appellant’s parents, Mr Derham, Dr Young, or the appellant’s employer and friends.  
    17   The appellant gave evidence that, when he was discharged from hospital, he was very weak, his memory was poor, his coordination and reflexes had worsened and his skill at work had deteriorated. He did not drive after he was discharged from hospital until he recommenced his work at the carpentry and joinery firm in September. On 4 October 1995, he delivered a pizza to a house in Avoca Drive, Green Point, where he helped a woman move a refrigerator. He returned to his car and drove away. He had travelled less than a kilometre when he heard the sound of his car horn and found that his car had veered toward the side of the road. He thought that his head or some part of his body must have hit the horn. He stayed where he was for about 10 minutes to clear his head and then drove back to the pizza outlet. He said that his loss of awareness was only momentary, that he had not felt tired at all beforehand, but that he felt disoriented for a time afterwards. He had not previously had a similar incident. 
    18   The appellant also said that, after he finished his work delivering pizzas on the night of Friday 6 October 1995, he returned home, showered, ate some food and then drove around with friends. Subsequently, he went to two clubs where he consumed a moderate quantity of beer. There was no evidence that he was adversely affected by alcohol. Later, he walked to the home of a friend who had taken his car at his suggestion, and, for a time, slept in the car, which was a station-wagon in which the seating could be adjusted so that a person could lie down. He then walked to his girlfriend’s home where he was sent away by her father. He returned to his friend’s home where his car was parked, found the keys to his car, drove it to his parent’s home where he parked it in the driveway, and again slept in the car. He remembered waking to go to work early on the morning of the accident. He did not remember sitting in his car in his parents’ driveway or driving out of the driveway of his parents home or anything subsequently until he was running through some bushes. He remembered being in the park across the road from his house, seeing their neighbour, and walking toward him. When he got home, he unlocked it, walked in, removed his clothes and went into the bathroom. He noticed that it was about 7.20 in the morning and entered the shower immediately thinking that he was late for work. He recalled his father knocking at the bathroom door asking him about his car and whether he knew anything about an accident. He said he did not know anything about an accident. He also did not know where his car was. He thought that his car was either at a friend’s house, at a club or at work. He remembered being questioned by his parents and Mr Derham while he was sitting on a couch. He was very tired and falling asleep on his father’s shoulder. He also remembered police later coming to his home and arresting him and subsequent events. 
    19   Two consulting neurologists and an eminent psychiatrist gave evidence that the appellant had probably suffered an epileptic event immediately prior to the accident and that the probable explanation of his subsequent behaviour was that he experienced further epileptic events and / or was in a post-ictal state. There was substantial agreement between all three medical specialists. The prosecution accepted their expertise and did not call any expert evidence.  
    20   Broadly stated, the medical experts agreed that an epileptic event involves a disruptive activity in the brain’s neurones which can produce loss of consciousness or varying degrees of lack of awareness or other behavioural changes. A post-ictal state often follows an epileptic event or sequence of epileptic events. Drowsiness, confusion and lack of judgment are common and can continue for a lengthy period. Motor skills and the ability to perform complex tasks might continue during that time. The appellant’s conduct observed by his parents, employer and friends in the period between the meningococcal meningitis he had suffered and the accident indicated an underlying brain disturbance. Alcohol and insufficient sleep were likely to have an adverse effect on a brain in that condition. 
    21   In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury that they were “not bound to accept such opinion evidence”. His Honour said: “You are entitled to assess opinion evidence having regard to the facts as you find the facts to have been. You are entitled to accept or to reject such evidence. As the judges of the facts, you give such weight, that means to attach such value, to the opinion evidence as you think that it deserves, having regard to the facts which have been proved to your satisfaction…… The doctors’ opinions are based upon what they were told and you should realise that those opinions are only as value as the facts upon which they are based, that they may have limited value only if those facts have not been proved to your satisfaction.” 
    22   Although the jury was instructed that the prosecution was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant’s “driving was a voluntary act” and that the doctors’ opinions were that “the accused’s driving was not a voluntary act”, the trial judge directed the jury that “… the accused bears an evidentiary onus, burden or obligation … to raise the probability that his driving was an involuntary act…”; “[t]he accused does not have any burden, onus or obligation to prove anything, other than to raise the probability that his act when driving the vehicle was not a voluntary act”; and “the accused … has a burden, onus or obligation to produce evidence to show a reasonable probability that the act was not a voluntary act”.  
    23   Conformably with the prosecution submissions, the trial judge discussed two broad reasons for the rejection of the expert opinions, one related to the evidence on which they were said to be based and one related to “the surrounding facts”. 
    24   The jury was directed that the medical opinions relied on by the appellant were “based upon what [they] had been told about the accused both before and after the collision” and depended upon the jury’s acceptance of the appellant’s evidence. It was necessary for the jury “to assess the accused as to whether or not he is a person who is honest, doing his best to tell you, as best his memory allows, of the facts surrounding the incident”. By way of elaboration, the jury was told “that this trial turns upon a conflict between the evidence of what the Crown says that the accused did and the evidence of what the accused said he did and what the witnesses say was his mental state”, and that the jurors would “probably ask yourselves who is to be believed”. It was for the jurors “to decide who it is that you believe. … if, upon your consideration of the evidentiary material, you decide that you prefer the evidence of the Crown’s witnesses, then you must ask yourself ... ‘Does the evidence that we accept satisfy us beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused?’"" 
    25   Various adverse comments were made by his Honour about the appellant’s evidence, which, the jury was told, “does not show a reasonable probability that his driving was an involuntary act because he claims not to have any memory of his driving.” Most of the matters referred to were of little, if any significance; for example, differences in recollection between the appellant and various of his friends concerning events on the night before the accident with neither version discreditable to the appellant. Insubstantial reasons to doubt the appellant’s account of his movements that night were mentioned. It was pointed out that there was nothing to confirm the appellant’s description of his movements after he left his friends until his encounter with his girlfriend’s father, which is not surprising since the period in question was between midnight and 5am. Despite the expert evidence concerning his mental state, the appellant “had the presence of mind … to take his key from the ignition when he left the car at the top of President’s Hill.” Notwithstanding the unchallenged expert opinion that there was no means of ascertaining the cause of the earlier episode on the night of 4 October 1995 which the appellant had described to his employer and workmates prior to the accident, the judge said that his omission to do anything “from a medical point of view” on that occasion was “unfortunate”. The expert witnesses had “used [that incident] … as part of their assessment or part of the basis of their assessment of the accused’s mental state on 7 October 1995.” The jury would need to consider “whether it was an epileptic fit or falling asleep”. 
    26   The “surrounding facts” particularly relied on as justifying rejection of the expert evidence concerned the appellant’s driving up to the lookout along a difficult road. The trial judge said: 
     
      
       
       “The learned Crown prosecutor put to you … that, when you have regard to that, you might think it unlikely in the extreme that the accused was not controlling his vehicle in the sense of doing it consciously. Whether you do or not is for you to decide. 
       
      
      
       
       ….. 
       
      
      
       
       The Crown prosecutor has put to you that when you look at all of that you will be convinced that the driving was a voluntary act, done by or a conscious mind, because to get from the bottom of President’s Hill to the top of it would require careful driving. 
        
       
      
      
       
       …. 
       
      
      
       
       If however the evidence to which the Crown prosecutor has referred your attention, concerning the accused driving the vehicle from the time when he left the driveway in the house adjacent to his parents’ home to the time when he parked it at President’s Hill, convinces you that that driving was a voluntary act,  
       if the Crown prosecutor has convinced you by the evidence to reject the evidence of the doctors that the driving was not a voluntary act, 
        then you will find that the accused’s driving was voluntary, in other words that he had control over what he was doing. …..” 
        
       
      
    27   The issue of voluntariness was directly related only to the brief episode of dangerous driving which caused Mr Hiller’s death. Further, the appellant’s subsequent driving, including his driving up President’s Hill, was not a legitimate reason for rejecting the unchallenged expert evidence. Although one of the neurologists was more equivocal than the other neurologist and the psychiatrist, their evidence was that the appellant’s driving to the President’s Hill lookout was consistent with a post-ictal state following an earlier epileptic event. 
    28   There are other objections to the summing up, some blatantly obvious. For example, there was no obligation on the appellant to prove any fact, whether as a basis for the expert opinions or for any other purpose. The appellant was entitled to an acquittal if there was a reasonable possibility that he had suffered an epileptic event prior to his vehicle striking Mr Hiller. However, it is unnecessary to discuss particular defects in the summing up because the entire approach was wrong. 
    29   Undisputed evidence from the appellant’s parents, employer and friends established what had occurred in the period which had commenced with the appellant’s illness and terminated with his driving out of the driveway of his parent’s home shortly before the accident. At the worst for the appellant, there was a possibility that he had suffered an epileptic event on 4 October 1995. Other evidence, also undisputed, from the appellant’s parents and Mr Derham described the appellant’s condition after the accident. Although it would have been better if the foundation for the medical opinions had been explored more thoroughly, the uncontested expert opinion was that there was at least a reasonable possibility that the appellant experienced an epileptic event prior to his vehicle killing Mr Hiller. That possibility was increased if the appellant had had alcohol and insufficient sleep on the night before the accident. On the appellant’s evidence of the events of the morning of the accident, it was not merely possible, but probable, that he had suffered an epileptic event prior to his vehicle killing Mr Hiller. But a rational possibility was sufficient to entitle him to an acquittal. 
    30   There was no prosecution evidence to rebut that possibility. Once the prosecution adopted the attitude which it did to the witnesses other than the appellant, the only basis upon which it could exclude the possibility that his driving was involuntary when his vehicle killed Mr Hiller was to satisfy the jury, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant was lying, conscious of his guilt, when he said that he could not remember what had happened. The summing up made no attempt to submit that case to the jury, or to explain that expert evidence based on undisputed evidence from the appellant’s parents, employer, friends and solicitor could provide support for the appellant’s evidence and was relevant to the jury’s assessment of the veracity of his evidence. 
    31   It is almost 5 years since the death of Mr Hiller. At its worst for the appellant, the prosecution case is that, perhaps because he was tired, he was momentarily inattentive, with tragic consequences. There is no suggestion of speed, alcohol or recklessness. There have been three lengthy trials, without a sustainable conviction. It is unlikely that a properly instructed jury would convict the appellant on the evidence at the most recent trial. He has already served part of a sentence of periodic detention and, if convicted at a further trial, would probably not be sentenced to full-time imprisonment in view of the history of the matter. In the circumstances, a verdict of acquittal, not an order for another trial, was appropriate.

     REGINA v John Peter GLYNN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SPERLING J: The appellant pleaded guilty to two charges. The first that on 4 November 1998 at Cremorne he maliciously wounded Andrew Keily and, secondly, at the same time and place he maliciously damaged a door and door jamb.  
    2   The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 15 months and an additional term of nine months on the first charge. On the second charge he was sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment of one month. The maximum penalties for the offences charged are respectively imprisonment for seven years and five years. 
    3   Prior to this episode the applicant and Mr Keily had never met. The applicant had been in a relationship with a Ms Stoddart at an earlier time and an acquaintanceship of some kind had continued. Ms Stoddart was in a current relationship with Mr Keily. 
    4   On 4 November 1998, Ms Stoddart and Mr Keily had gone to a barbecue together. Following a disagreement, Mr Keily went home to his own flat and Ms Stoddart was for a time as the judge found in favour of the applicant, in the applicant's company at the applicant's home. 
    5   The sentencing judge also found in favour of the applicant, that Mr Keily was giving Ms Stoddart a hard time and that what the applicant did thereafter was motivated by a misplaced duty of protectiveness towards Ms Stoddart. 
    6   The applicant was a big man. He operated his own gymnasium business with the assistance of a manager.  
    7   As the sentencing judge found the facts, the applicant went to Mr Keily’s flat, forced his way in, damaging the door jamb and the door in the process, forced Mr Keily into the bedroom and there hit him repeatedly and kicked him in the groin. Mr Keily ran naked from the flat to escape the applicant, bleeding profusely from the head. 
    8   The injury to the head consisted of a five centimetre laceration which required sutures. Mr Keily also had mild swelling around the wound and an area of bruising under the left eye.  
    9   Although not spelled out in terms, the unmistakable implication from the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence is that he found that the applicant went to Mr Keily’s flat with the intention of assaulting him. 
    10   There was a prior conviction about ten years earlier for assault of unknown degree and, therefore, as his Honour said, of little relevance. There was evidence, which the judge accepted, that the applicant was not a person prone to violence. 
    11   One cannot but agree with the sentencing judge's observations to the effect that breaking into a private home and beating up the occupant is a very serious matter. The applicant's misplaced sense of duty does not excuse or justify such conduct. The case is, however, to be distinguished from other cases where assaults are committed for baser motives and where injury is more serious. 
    12   In my view a custodial sentence was warranted in this case. However, having regard to the objective circumstances of the case and to subjective considerations relevant to the particular offender, the sentence was manifestly excessive. I would regard the time served before bail was granted pending an appeal, a period of about two and a half months, as an adequate penalty. 
    13   The orders I propose are as follows: Grant leave to appeal. Appeal allowed. Sentence quashed. Re-sentence the applicant as follows:  
     
      
     1. On the first count, malicious wounding, a fixed term of imprisonment of two months and two weeks commencing on 17 February 2000. 
      
      
     2. On the second count, malicious damage to property, a fixed term of imprisonment of seven days commencing 17 February 2000. 
      
    14   NEWMAN J: I agree. The effect of the order of the court, of course, is that the applicant has already served his sentence, so the orders of the court will be as proposed by Sperling J.

     REGINA v Tracylee D'AMICO 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SPERLING J: The applicant pleaded guilty to knowingly take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of heroin. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 3,500 penalty points. 
    2   The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for six years with a minimum term of four years. The applicant employed two runners who delivered the drugs for her to retail customers. She was a heroin user as were her runners. Over a sixty day period she bought a total of 350 grams of heroin. Of this she used 60 to 90 grams for herself and paid her runners with a further 60 grams for themselves. The balance was sold to retail customers for cash.  
    3   On that evidence, the main, if not the only function of the business was to support the applicant's habit. She had to buy in the drugs. If she used one-third of what she bought in for herself and her runners, the cash profit on the sale of the remaining two-thirds may have been fully utilised in paying for the one third that was used. The evidence does not enable one to tell precisely whether there was a profit in terms of cash flow. There might have been but it would not have been much. In this regard, the judge said: 
     
      
       
       “I've said that these offences are very serious and I have said that they are part of a systematic business which was conducted for profit. It was suggested that Mrs D'Amico was a dealer because she was a user and in part that is true but the amount that she and her assistants used during the period covered by this charge is less than a third of the amount that she had in her possession and the rest was sold for profit. If she chose to devote that profit to feeding her habit that is not a matter with which the Court can be concerned”. 
       
      
    4   Approaching the matter in that way his Honour correctly applied the decision of this Court in the guideline judgment of Henry, (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. where the Chief Justice said  At [202].that there is no warrant to assess a crime induced by a need for funds to feed a drug addiction as being lower in the scale of moral culpability than other perceived requirements for money. 
    5   Wood CJ at CL said in the same case at [257-9] that the casual relationship between a drug habit and a commission of an offence should not, as a matter of general principle, automatically lead to a lesser penalty. The way in which the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit could be relevant, although not a matter of mitigation in itself, was explained by Justice Wood at [273]. Considerations such as he mentioned there do not apply in this case. 
    6   The most that can be said for this aspect of the matter is that the motive for the activity in this case was not so base a motive as occurs in some other cases where the activity is carried on for no purpose other than to acquire money, sometimes large amounts of money, out of pure greed. 
    7   It has not been demonstrated that there was any error on the part of the trial judge in the way he assessed this aspect of the matter.  
    8   The role of the offender is of course a relevant consideration in relation to drug offences. That was established by the case of Raz. Unreported NSWCCA 17 December 1992. It is also a matter reflected in the judgment in Henry and in other cases. In this case the judge found, as he was bound to find, that the applicant was engaged in the supply of heroin in a businesslike and systematic way with two underlings involved in the operation.  
    9   There were strong subjective considerations to be brought to account. The judge reviewed them and there is nothing to suggest that he did not give them appropriate weight. 
    10   This brings me to the second matter argued on appeal. The applicant submits that inadequate weight was given to circumstances involving the applicant’s child who is now four years of age. The child is living with grandparents. Circumstances which need not be reviewed here prevent the child being brought to see his mother often.  
    11   It is unfortunately the usual case that prisoners suffer emotional distress due to separation from family members and that families suffer both material and emotional hardship as a result of the incarceration of a member of the family. It is in these circumstances that a principle has been generated that it is only in cases of exceptional hardship that consideration can be given to this factor in mitigation of sentence, Edwards. Unreported NSWCCA, 17 December 1996. This is not a sufficiently exceptional case to have required such consideration by the sentencing judge. No error is therefore demonstrated in that respect.  
    12   The sentence imposed in this case was towards the upper end of the range of sentences imposed for this offence on a plea of guilty. That, however, is not of itself demonstrative of error in failing to take account of any relevant circumstance. The statistics which have been presented cover only twelve cases and do not reveal important considerations such as the amount of drug involved and, more importantly, the role of the offender in the supply of the drug.  
    13   Mention has been made in argument of special circumstances. It appears that his Honour recognised that there were special circumstances and made some allowance in that regard. I would receive the submissions made on behalf of the applicant to be that insufficient recognition was made of the applicant's need for rehabilitation and, accordingly, that there was demonstrable error in failing to make adequate allowance for special circumstances by enlarging the additional term at the expense of the minimum term.  
    14   In regard to that point, I have to say, as this Court has said many times, that an appeal to this Court requires a demonstration of error on the part of the trial judge. It is not sufficient that this Court might be of the view that a somewhat different result would have been achieved if it had been sentencing afresh. The question is whether the judge in this and other respects failed to exercise his discretion appropriately. In relation to special circumstances, whilst a range of views might well be open to a sentencing judge, there is nothing that would persuade me that in this instance his discretion miscarried. What the judge did in this regard was in my opinion within the proper ambit of his discretion.  
    15   I come then to the question of parity or, as it is in this case, an argument that there was an absence of proportionality. The applicant’s husband who was also dependent upon heroin and was also engaged in the supply of heroin was sentenced for an offence, strictly speaking two offences, relating to the same period which was the subject of the offence for which the applicant was sentenced.  
    16   The sentence imposed on Mr D'Amico was very substantially lighter than that imposed on the present applicant. It was effectively something like half as severe, if not precisely that. Superficially one can see the basis for the argument but, on analysis, there is ample explanation for the disparity between the two sentences. 
    17   There are three principal differences between the two cases. The first is the amount of drug involved. There was not less than the commercial quantity involved in relation to the applicant’s offence. That was not an element in the charges against her husband. It is argued in her favour, in this respect, that this was a case of a married couple who were, in effect, engaged in the same business, and it was only a matter of accident that she came to be charged with an offence involving not less than the commercial quantity of the drug whereas he did not.  
    18   I have to say that that argument is not made good. The facts of the case show that she was running a business in which she bought in drugs and distributed them to her customers through her street runners. There is no evidence before this Court that the husband’s business activities were structured in that way, let alone that they involved the same business structure. It is not demonstrated that he was involved in trading in drugs to the same extent as she was. In any event, the Court in the two cases could only deal with the matters on the basis of the charges before the Court on the respective occasions and there was the important difference of quantity of drug to which I have referred. 
    19   Secondly, Mr D'Amico received a discount for assistance to the authorities. The nature of that assistance is not disclosed, and we would not expect it to be, but that allows for a possibility that the sentencing judge may well have had before him a case of assistance to the authorities which was quite extensive and warranted a substantial reduction in sentence. Indeed, I have to say that this factor alone could be sufficient to account for the whole of the difference between the two sentences, or most of it. 
    20   The third matter is that Mr D'Amico had been assaulted in prison and it was known that he would need to serve his sentence in protective custody. That is a recognised additional hardship for which the courts customarily extend some leniency by imposing a sentence less than would otherwise be the case.  
    21   For those three reasons, the difference between the two sentences is very adequately explained. I would have to reject the argument that there is any justifiable ground upon which the present applicant might feel a sense of grievance about being treated more harshly than her husband. 
    22   For those reasons, the arguments which have been advanced in support of this appeal fail. I would propose that leave be given to appeal in this case but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    23   NEWMAN J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Justice Sperling.

      ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v X  
       
      
    Proceedings were brought in the Common Law Division by the Attorney General against the respondent. The summons sought a declaration that the opponent was guilty of contempt in publishing certain material in a Sydney daily newspaper. The articles contained a number of strong statements about the drug running conduct of Duong Van Ia whose photograph appeared on the front page. The article referred to the fact that Duong had been charged with criminal offences and that he was yet to face trial for them. At the time of publication, Duong had been committed for trial in the District Court on charges of supplying and being knowingly supplied with heroin. Barr J addressed the “public interest defence” referred to by Jordan CJ in Ex parte Bread Manufacturers; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd 37 SR(NSW) 242, finding it reasonably open that the detriment to the trial was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under s101A is confined to a “question of law arising from or in connection with the proceedings.” The Attorney General raised five questions to the Court of Appeal, but having regard to the function of s101A of the Supreme Court Act 1970, the Court of Appeal needed to address only the fifth issue raised ie: Whether it was reasonably open to his Honour to find that the detriment to the administration of justice was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication of the material contained in the publication. HELD: (per Spigelman CJ and Priestley JA dismissing the appeal):1 Consideration of what constitutes a “question of law” in the statutory context. R v J (1987) 9 NSWLR 615 (referred). 2 The balancing of conflicting public interests required by the Bread Manufacturers defence is not, of itself, a question of law per s101A of the Supreme Court Act 1970. Re Queensland Electricity Commission Ex parte Electrical Trade Union of Australia (1987) 61 ALJR 393 (discussed).3 There is no predetermined balance where there is an implication or suggestion or canvassing of guilt by the defendant. Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd (applied); Hinch v Attorney-General (Victoria) (1987) 164 CLR 15 (discussed); Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees’ and Builders Labourers’ Federation (1982) 152 CLR 25 (discussed). 4 Consideration of when the result of a balancing exercise is “reasonably open”. Barr J’s finding was reasonably open as a matter of law. (Per Mason P dissenting and upholding the appeal) 5 It was unnecessary to decide whether the balancing of the competing public interests is itself a question of law. This was a case where the method in which the balancing was done and/or the outcome was such that the Court could identify a question of law capable of attracting the appellate jurisdiction invoked in this case. 6 Where a publication is proven beyond reasonable doubt to have the requisite tendency to interfere with the fair trial of a pending criminal charge where the interference consists of implication or suggestion of guilt or the canvassing of matters directly related to the central issue of guilt, the Bread Manufacturers defence is not available. Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd (discussed); Hinch v Attorney-General (Victoria) (discussed).7 It was not reasonably open to say that the detriment to Duong’s trial was outweighed by the public interest in the naming of him as a person involved in the illicit drug industry. 8 The primary judge also erred in finding that the prejudicial effect of the articles was incidental and unintended.THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL

       ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v X 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The pertinent facts and the text of s101A of the Supreme Court Act 1970, are set out in the judgment of Mason P, which I have read in draft. It is unnecessary to repeat them here. 
    2    The jurisdiction of this Court under s101A is confined to a “question of law arising from or in connection with the proceedings”. The Respondent contends that several of the questions posed for this Court’s determination in the summons of the Attorney General do not raise a “question of law”. 
    3    The five questions submitted by the Attorney for determination by the Court are: 
     
      
     (i) Whether his Honour, in finding the charge of contempt not to be made out, used the correct test in the application of the decision in  
     Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd 
      (1937) 37 SR (NSW) 242 by saying that the “ultimate practical question is whether it is reasonably open to say that the detriment to the trial is outweighed by the public interest in freedom of communication”. 
      
      
     (ii) If the decision in  
     Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd  
     requires a balancing of the prejudice to the trial of the accused and the utility of a particular discussion of public affairs, whether his Honour in fact carried out such a balancing exercise. 
      
      
     (iii) Whether the principles set out in  
     Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd 
      prevent a finding of contempt in circumstances where, as his Honour found, the articles in question stated that the accused was charged with the supply of heroin and also stated that the accused was in the business of supplying heroin. 
      
      
     (iv) Whether his Honour was correct in finding that it was necessary for the plaintiff to negate the “defence of public interest” before a finding of contempt could be made in relation to the publication in question. 
      
      
     (v) Whether it was reasonably open to his Honour to find that the detriment to the administration of justice (which his Honour held to be present) was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication of the material contained in the publication. 
      
    4    The Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General of New South Wales, did not structure his submissions in accordance with these five questions. The structure of the submissions was to identify three errors of law: 
     
      
     (1) The failure to attach “sufficient weight” to the seriousness of the prejudice flowing from the articles. It was submitted that if “proper weight” to the seriousness of the prejudice had been given then “as a matter of law … the prejudice could not be outweighed by a countervailing public interest …” 
      
      
     (2) The second error was said to “relate” to the weight given to the public interest in freedom of communication. It was submitted that any such public interest “was not capable, as a matter of law, of overriding the already identified public interest in the administration of justice”. 
      
      
     (3) The third error was his Honour’s finding that the prejudicial effect of the articles was “incidental and unintended”. 
      
    5    The Attorney submitted that each of the two matters which must be balanced - namely, prejudice to the administration of justice on the one hand and freedom of communication on the other hand - were “legal concepts”. It was submitted that the process of identification of each “concept”, together with the weight to be attached to each step in the “process”, presumably of balancing, enable the trial Court to make a finding as to whether or not a contempt has occurred. It was submitted that this process has no resemblance to the way in which a court makes findings of fact or to the way in which a court exercises a discretion. 
    6    The submissions did not address, in terms, each of the specific questions raised. However, it was submitted that the balancing exercise itself was a “legal exercise”. It was expressly submitted that the question of whether it was reasonably open to reach the conclusion that his Honour reached was a question of law. This is the fifth question posed in the amended summons in this Court. In oral submissions the learned Solicitor General made it clear that the formulation of this question was intended to raise the three alleged errors of law identified above. 
     
      
     The First Question 
      
    7    The first question before the Court is whether or not his Honour used the correct test when he applied the “Bread Manufacturers defence”, as approved by the High Court in Hinch v Attorney-General (Victoria) (1987) 164 CLR 15. The identification of the correct test does raise a question of law. However, the question as posed is confined to a particular aspect of his Honour’s reasons. 
    8    In its written submissions the Respondent did not submit that Question (i) failed to raise a question of law. It asserted that the question should be answered “Yes” on the basis that his Honour had correctly identified the test. In oral submissions, the Respondent asserted that none of the questions were questions of law, but did not make any particular submissions with respect to Question (i). 
    9    The Bread Manufacturers defence is concerned with the process of reconciliation of two conflicting public interests: the public interest in the administration of justice and the public interest in freedom of communication. The Solicitor General submitted that his Honour conducted the requisite balancing exercise without giving the former public interest the weight which, as a matter of law, it should be given. As indicated above, three alleged errors of law were identified. 
    10    Question (v) incorporates a particular statement by his Honour which is said to contain the incorrect test. The sentence in his Honour’s reasons to which this question directs is the following: 
     
      
       
       “The ultimate practical question is whether it is reasonably open to say that the detriment to the trial is outweighed by the public interest in freedom of communication.” 
       
      
    11    The context in his Honour’s judgment for the sentence referred to in the question is as follows: 
     
      
       
       “123 Freedom of speech, public discussion and information should not be qualified except in the face of public interest of equal or greater importance.  
       Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation 
        (1982) 152 CLR 25 per Mason J at 98. 
       
      
      
       
       124 The right of freedom of speech is not absolute, however, and the law curbs freedom of speech when it is necessary to do so to prevent a real and substantial prejudice to the administration of justice.  
       Hinch v Attorney-General (Vic) 
        per Wilson J at 41. 
       
      
      
       
       125 The public interest in ensuring that criminal proceedings are conducted free of prejudice will attract great weight and make it less likely that the public interest in the freedom of discussion of matters will outweigh it.  
       Hinch v Attorney-General (Vic)  
       per Wilson J at 37. 
       
      
      
       
       126 That does not mean, however, that the defence cannot succeed if criminal proceedings are affected. The whole of the circumstances of the publication and its relationship if any to the relevant trial must be considered. The ultimate practical question is whether it is reasonably open to say that the detriment to the trial is outweighed by the public interest in freedom of communication. The plaintiff must prove that it is not.  
       Hinch v Attorney-General (Vic) 
        per Deane J at 51.” 
       
      
      
    12    In par [126] of his judgment, extracted in the first question, Barr J was paraphrasing part of the following passage from the judgment of Deane J in Hinch at 50-51: 
     
      
       
       “… in criminal proceedings for punishment of an alleged past contempt, it will not suffice to found a verdict of guilty that the court, on balance, thinks that detriment was not outweighed by other public interest considerations. The question whether detriment was so outweighed is one of fact and the criminal onus of proof requires effectively that there be no room for reasonable doubt about the matter … In practical terms, that means that, in a case such as the present where the public interest factors upon which the accused rely have been identified, the issue ultimately resolves itself into a question whether the view that detriment was outweighed by countervailing public interest considerations was reasonably open. If it was, it could not properly be said that it was clear beyond reasonable doubt that detriment had not in fact been outweighed by countervailing benefit. I have framed that ultimate question in the past tense for the reason that it must be answered as at the time of the alleged offence.” 
       
      
      
    13    When the passage from Deane J upon which Barr J relied is set out, it is clear that his Honour was not, in the sentence extracted in the first question, intending to suggest that no particular weighting was involved in the process of conducting the balancing exercise.  
    14    This conclusion is confirmed by the passage from the judgment of Wilson J in Hinch to which his Honour referred in par 124 of his judgment as quoted above. Wilson J said at 41-42: 
     
      
       
       “In an appropriate case the court is empowered to entertain a defence of discussion of a matter of public interest and in doing so to engage in a balancing exercise to determine which of the competing matters of public interest should prevail. 
       
      
      
       
       But it is important to emphasis that in undertaking a balancing exercise the court does not start with the scales evenly balanced. The law has already tilted the scales. In the interest of the due administration of justice it will curb freedom of speech, but only to the extent that is necessary to prevent a real and substantial prejudice to the administration of justice.” 
       
      
      
    15    The submissions on behalf of the Attorney did not identify any particular error said to be contained in his Honour’s paraphrase of the passage from the judgment of Deane J in Hinch. It appears to be submitted that his Honour failed to apply a test in which the relevant scales had been “tilted”, in the sense identified by Wilson J. It does not appear to me that his Honour committed any such error. No other error was identified in submissions before this Court. Specifically, no attempt was made to relate the three alleged errors of law, about which submissions were made, to this question.  
    16    No submission was made that the test as stated in Question (i) was wrong. The submissions were directed to alleged errors in the application of such a test. This is reflected in the fact that the terminology of this test is relied upon in Question (v). In these circumstances it is not appropriate, in my opinion, to answer Question (i).  
    17    Mason P identifies a legal error on the part of Barr J which is capable of being characterised as ‘applying the wrong test’, albeit not in the respect identified in this question. As his Honour holds that the error is pertinent to Question (v), I will consider it in that context. 
     
      
     The Second Question 
      
    18    The second question presented to the Court for its determination is “whether his Honour in fact carried out” a balancing exercise in the circumstances of the case. 
    19    His Honour expressly identified, assessed and “balanced” the conflicting public interests. No submission to the contrary was made. The focus of the Attorney’s submissions was on the result of such a process and the alleged errors that must have occurred in order to reach that result. No submissions were made in the terminology of this question. 
    20    It is not appropriate to answer the second question. 
     
      
     The Third Question 
      
    21    This question refers to only two matters in the publication: that the accused was charged with the supply of heroin and that the accused was in the business of supplying heroin. The question suffers from two defects. First, it is too closely tied to the facts of the particular case to constitute a question of law. Second, it proceeds upon the assertion that it is possible to treat as a question of law, a process of evaluation based on something less than the full range of relevant facts (c/f DPP Reference (No 1 of 1984) [1984] VR 727 at 729). To mention only one such, obviously material, factor for determining the extent of the prejudice to the administration of justice, the question makes no reference to the length of time before the trial. 
    22    It is not appropriate to answer this question. 
     
      
     The Fourth Question 
      
    23    No submissions of the Crown were directed to this question. It is not appropriate to answer this question. 
     
      
     The Fifth Question 
      
    24    The Respondent contends that Question (v) is not a “question of law” within the meaning of s101A(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1970. If that is so, then the Court has no jurisdiction to answer the question. 
     
      
     Question of Law 
      
    25    The formulation “question of law” employs general words capable of application at different levels of generality. When Parliament uses such words it does not necessarily intend to encompass everything that is capable of falling within them. It is often necessary to read down words of general application. (See my Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture at the University of Newcastle “Statutory Interpretation: Identifying the Linguistic Register” to be published in the Newcastle University Law Review, accessible at www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/sc. See also R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at 689). 
    26    It is necessary to identify the drafter’s linguistic register. As Lord Simon of Glaidsdale said, in a case concerned with the meaning of the word “premises” in a particular statute: 
     
      
       
       “Statutory language, like all language, is capable of an almost infinite gradation of ‘register’ - i.e., it will be used at the semantic level appropriate to the subject matter and to the audience addressed (the man in the street, lawyers, merchants, etc.). It is the duty of a court of construction to tune in to such register and so to interpret the statutory language as to give to it the primary meaning which is appropriate in that register (unless it is clear that some other meaning must be given in order to carry out the statutory purpose or to avoid injustice, anomaly, absurdity or contradiction). In other words, statutory language must always be given presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances.” ( 
       Maunsell v Olins 
        [1975] AC 373 at 391). 
       
      
      
     (See also  
     Farrell v Alexander  
     [1977] AC 59 at 84;  
     Black-Clawson International Limited v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG 
      [1975] AC 591 at 675).  
      
    27    As his Lordship also said in Stock v Frank Jones (Tipton) Limited [1978] 1 WLR 231 at 236: 
     
      
       
       “Words and phrases of the English language have an extraordinary range of meaning. This has been a rich resource in English poetry (which makes fruitful use of the resonances, overtones and ambiguities), but it has a concomitant disadvantage in English law (which seeks unambiguous precision, with the aim that every citizen shall know, as exactly as possible, where he stands under the law).” 
       
      
    28    The determination of whether a particular alleged error in matters such as fact finding, the exercise of a discretion or a process of evaluation answers the description “question of law”, will depend on the scope, nature and subject matter of the statute, including the nature of the body making the relevant decision. In the present case the decision maker is a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Different consideration may apply in the case of a non-judicial decision maker. (See e.g. Craig v South Australia (1994-1995) 184 CLR 163 esp at 176-180). 
    29    It is not necessarily the case that the meaning given to the words in one statutory context should be applied in another. However, a number of matters have been identified to constitute a “question of law” in such a way that they would generally fall within those words, whenever used in a statute. The state of the case law is well described as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Looking at the devices courts have used to address the problem is like looking into the average toolbox. There is a lot of clutter that could have been cleared out long ago. There are one or two baffling gadgets with no readily identifiable function. And there are a few old, sturdy, and serviceable tools that do all the work. It would be a mistake to think that the toolbox is useless, just because it is messy.”  
       
      
      
       
       (Endicott “Questions of Law” (1998) 114  
       LQR 
        292 at 297). 
       
      
      
    30    In Australian case law, a “few, old sturdy and serviceable tools” are listed by Jordan CJ in Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer General (1940) 40 SR(NSW) 126 at 137-138. See, more recently, Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287-288. 
    31    In a joint judgment, the High Court said in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Limited (1995-1996) 186 CLR 389 at 394: 
     
      
       
       “The distinction between questions of fact and questions of law is a vital distinction in many fields of law. Notwithstanding attempts by many distinguished judges and jurists to formulate tests for finding the line between the two questions, no satisfactory test of universal application has as yet been formulated.” 
       
      
      
    32    As this passage indicates, it is often the case that analysis of whether a particular matter answers the description of “question of law” proceeds on the basis that those words are used in contra-distinction to “question of fact” and that the combination of the two formulations exhausts the whole of the relevant sphere of discourse. It is usually, but not always, useful to proceed on this basis. (See e.g. Larson v Vile [1999] NSWCA 397 at [39]). 
    33    As Wilson J said in Hinch at 43: 
     
      
       
       “… a decision which is the outcome of the balancing process is not a discretionary judgment. It is the result of an evaluation, consistently with accepted judicial principle, of competing matters of fact.” 
       
      
      
    34    Furthermore, as Toohey J said in Hinch at 77: 
     
      
       
       “There is a balance which the court is called upon to strike. It is not an exercise of discretion; it is an evaluation of competing interests against the background that contempt must be established beyond reasonable doubt.” 
       
      
      
    35    The task of balancing conflicting public interests involves the making of a judgment by a process of evaluation. It is distinguishable from the making of a finding of fact. It is also distinguishable from the exercise of a discretion, in the sense of a choice between alternative courses of action. Although distinguishable, a process of evaluation will be found, for many jurisprudential purposes, to have a close analogy with fact finding and the exercise of a discretion. 
    36    The present context has certain distinctive elements which do not often arise. Section 101A is precisely modelled on s5A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In both contexts the answer to the question is incapable of having any consequential effect upon the outcome of the proceedings, to use the formulation of s101A(1) itself, “from or in connection with” which the asserted “question of law” has arisen.  
    37    It is by no means apparent that a matter which would answer the description of “question of law” in the more common statutory context where an appeal, albeit limited in this way, is capable of having practical effect on the particular proceedings, will necessarily answer that description in a context where there is no such effect. In each case, the scope, purpose and subject matter of the statute may affect the construction of the words “question of law”. 
    38    In Mellifont v Attorney General (Queensland) (1991) 173 CLR 289 at 305, the High Court described s669A(2) of the Queensland Criminal Code - the Queensland equivalent of s5A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act (1912) (NSW) - in the following way: 
     
      
       
       “… the purpose of seeking and obtaining a review of the trial judge’s ruling was to secure a correct statement of the law so that it would be applied correctly in future cases. … The statutory procedure, which has counterparts in other Australian jurisdictions, is a standard procedure for correcting error of law in criminal proceedings without exposing the accused to double jeopardy. It is a procedure which was designed to enable the Crown to secure a reversal of a ruling by a trial judge without infringing the common law rule that the Crown cannot appeal against a verdict of acquittal, a rule which precluded a review of a trial judge’s ruling at the instance of the Crown in the case of acquittal. The fundamental point, as it seems to us, is that s669A(2) enables the Court of Criminal Appeal to correct an error of law at the trial.” 
       
      
      
    39    The provision equivalent to s5A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act in the United Kingdom is s36(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1972, which differs only in its restriction to “a point of law which has arisen in the case”, without the expansive words found in the New South Wales statute: “any question of law arising at or in connection with the trial”. Nevertheless the following observations by Lord Mustill in Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994) [1997] 3 WLR 421 at 438, (referred to with approval in Director of Public Prosecutions Reference No 2 of 1996 [1998] 3 VR 241 at 250 and Director of Public Prosecutions Reference No 1 of 1999 (1999) 149 FLR 465 at 469-470), are pertinent for both New South Wales statutes: 
     
      
       
       “The courts have always firmly resisted attempts to obtain the answer to academic questions, however useful this might appear to be. Normally, where an appeal is brought in the context of an issue between parties, the identification of questions which the court should answer can be performed by considering whether a particular answer to the question of law might affect the outcome of the dispute. The peculiarity of a reference under the Act of 1972 is that it is not a step in a dispute, so that in one sense the questions referred are invariably academic. This peculiarity might, unless limits are observed, enable the Attorney-General, for the best of motives, to use an acquittal on a point of law to set in train a judicial roving commission on a particular branch of the law, with the aim of providing clear, practical and systematic solutions for problems of current interest. This is not the function of the court …” 
       
      
      
    40    In R v Lewis, Ex parte Attorney General [1991] 2 Qd R 292 at 300, (sub nom Re Lewis (1991) 48 A Crim R 218), Macrossan CJ said: 
     
      
       
       “…s669A requires the court to express an opinion on a point of law said to be contained in a reference or at least requires the court in expressing its opinion to answer the question said to be raised, only if the point is of the character to which it can be assumed the subsection intends to refer. It is concerned with a point involving principle capable of some general application as opposed to rulings which are dependent upon the manner in which an assessment is made of particular factual situations which are not readily capable of wider application to other situations.” 
       
      
      
    41    To similar effect are the observations in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in R v J (1987) 9 NSWLR 615, where Lee J said at 616: 
     
      
       
       “At the outset it is to be said that in many cases it will be wholly inappropriate for the Attorney-General to bring before this Court, as a question of law, the question whether there was or was not evidence of a particular ingredient forming part of the charge made against the accused. The purpose of s5A(2) is to provide a procedure whereby the court can pronounce upon a question of law raised that is or may be of importance in the conduct of criminal trials in this State. The mere fact that a trial judge has made an error of law will not be sufficient. The question of law raised should be one of substance, the significance of which to the criminal law does not come to an end when the trial in which it arose concludes.” 
       
      
      
    42    Furthermore, Hunt J said at 626: 
     
      
       
       “It has been said time and time again that the procedure laid down by of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
        1912, s5A(2), whereby following an acquittal the Attorney-General may submit questions of law arising at or in connection with a trial for the determination of this Court, is not to be used simply to resolve such a question which has importance only in relation to the trial which has taking place. The decision of this Court upon such a question does not affect the acquittal obtained, and it cannot lead to a new trial of the person acquitted. 
       
      
      
       
       The purpose of the procedure is to provide a precedent by which guidance is furnished in relation to other trials in the future. There must be involved a question of sufficient substance as to justify the adoption of the procedure, and questions of transitory or minimal significance in relation to the criminal law generally or questions which do no more than establish the trial judge in the particular case made some error of law do not justify either argument before or decision by this Court pursuant to s5A(2).” 
       
      
      
     (See also  
     R v Garcia 
      (1996) 85 A Crim R 151 at 152). 
      
    43    In the case of a statute where an appeal on a question of law will not have any practical implications for the particular proceedings in which the appeal is brought, the construction of the words “question of law” may well be closer to the scope of the formulation “question of law alone”, which appears in some statutes.  
    44    In Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 287, 312 and 314 it was held that a mixed question of fact and law does not fall within the description of “question of law alone”. The Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal has held, with respect to s669A, which does not contain a reference to “question of law alone” that a mixed question of fact and law does not fall within the statutory power. As Thomas J, with whom Andrews CJ and Ryan J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
       “It is not the function of this court to review questions of fact, assessments of evidence, or to embark upon questions of law which can only be considered in conjunction with disputed assessments of fact.” (The Queen v Gill, Supreme Court of Queensland, Court of Criminal Appeal (unreported) 20 November 1986). 
       
      
      
      
     Is Balancing a Question of Law? 
      
    45    As I have indicated above, the learned Solicitor General submitted that the balancing exercise itself was a “legal exercise” and, accordingly, that the issue whether it was reasonably open to reach the conclusion that his Honour reached, was a question of law. This submission implies that Question (v) was too restrictive. If the balancing exercise is itself a question of law then it would be sufficient to say that his Honour was incorrect It was submitted that by reason of the three alleged “errors of law” outlined in the submissions this Court should find that the question of law contained in Question (v) should be answered in the negative. 
    46    Support for the submission made on behalf of the Attorney General can be derived from the judgment of Gaudron J in Hinch supra where, at 85 and 87, her Honour described the balancing exercise as a “question of law”. However, Deane J at 50 characterised the decision whether detriment to the administration of justice was outweighed by other public interests to be “one of fact”. No other judgment in that case identifies the balancing process in relevant terms.  
    47    In Re Queensland Electricity Commission; Ex parte Electrical Trades Union of Australia (1987) 61 ALJR 393, the High Court had before it an application for mandamus directed to a Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission requiring it to hear and determine an industrial dispute according to law. The case turned on s4(1)(d) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act (1904) (Cth) which enabled the Commission to refrain from further hearing or determining the dispute where it appeared: 
     
      
       
       “That further proceedings are not necessary or desirable in the public interest.” (s41(1)(d)(iii)) 
       
      
      
    48    One ground advanced in support of the application for mandamus was that the Full Bench failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely whether or not it was in the public interest to refrain from determining an industrial dispute which was, in part, incapable of being heard and determined by any State industrial authority. In support of this argument counsel for the applicant union made certain submissions to which the joint majority judgment of Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ referred in the following manner at 395: 
     
      
       
       “First, it is said that the Act makes it clear that the settlement of industrial disputes is the fundamental concern of the Act and that consequently any consideration of the public interest under s41(1)(d)(iii) must take that concern into account. … 
       
      
      
       
       The first step in this argument makes an important point. It is undoubtedly correct. At the same time, it is necessary to remember that the importance the Act places upon the settlement of industrial disputes cannot of itself dictate the exercise of the discretion given by s41(1)(d)(iii). That paragraph itself recognises that it may be in the public interest to leave an industrial dispute unresolved.  
       Ascertainment in any particular case of where the public interest lies will often depend on a balancing of interests, including competing public interests, and be very much a question of fact and degree. 
        In this case the Commission was called upon to weigh in the balance two competing public interests. One was the importance of settling in its entirety the dispute initiated by the ETU’s log of claims. The other was the importance of leaving the dispute to be resolved by the State tribunal despite the limitations on its jurisdiction if that course was likely to maintain the marked improvement in industrial relations in the industry that had occurred since the dispute arose and thereby contribute to industrial peace and an efficient power supply.” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
    49    The relevance of this passage is the identification of the process of “balancing of interests” as being “a question of fact and degree”. It is true that this comment is made in the context of the proper construction of the phrase “in the public interest” appearing in the statutory formulation that confers a discretionary power. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the approach is different to that which Gaudron J adopted in Hinch.  
    50    This conclusion is reinforced by a later passage in the joint judgment where their Honours said at 396: 
     
      
       
       “Failure by the Commission to give sufficient weight to a relevant factor in coming to its decision could not establish a constructive refusal to exercise jurisdiction. Indeed, generally speaking, such a failure does not even entitle an appellate court to overturn the discretionary decision of a primary judge: see  
       Gronow v Gronow 
        (1979) 144 CLR 513 at 519-520. A fortiori, in a case such as the present,  
       to embark on the evaluation of the weight accorded by the Commission to competing public interests necessarily involves an impermissible inquiry into the merits of the case 
       .” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
       
      
    51    Brennan J dissented but not in a respect relevant for present purposes. Indeed, his Honour said at 397: 
     
      
       
       “A decision founded on the balancing of competing public interests cannot be judicially reviewed if the Commission has not made an error of law in determining the nature of relevant competing interests and if the decision is not unreasonable in the  
       Wednesbury 
        sense:  
       Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 
        [1948] 1 KB 223.” 
       
      
      
    52    In a subsequent joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan and Gaudron JJ in Re Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance; Ex parte Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd (1993) 67 ALJR 389 at 390 their Honours referred to the Queensland Electricity Commission case as authority for the proposition that:  
     
      
       
       “Ascertainment of where the public interest lies is very much a question of fact and degree …” 
       
      
      
    53    The identification of the “public interest” in the context of a statutory power to determine matters in accordance with a test so expressed, was also considered by the Court in O’Sullivan v Farrer (1989) 168 CLR 210 where, at 216, the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said at 216: 
     
      
       
       “… the Act provides no positive indication of the considerations by reference to which a decision is to be made as to whether the grant of an application would or would not be in the public interest. Indeed, the expression ‘in the public interest’, when used in a statute, classically imports a discretionary value judgment to be made by reference to undefined factual matters, confined only ‘in so far as the subject matter and the scope and purpose of the statutory enactments may enable … given reasons to be [pronounced] definitely extraneous to any objects the legislature could have had in view’:  
       Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning 
        (1947) 74 CLR at 505 per Dixon J.” 
       
      
    54    In the present case the issues are not the same as have arisen in this line of authority. The Court is not concerned to construe the words “public interest” in the context of a discretionary statutory power. The issue in the present case is to determine whether the balancing exercise between two competing public interests itself constitutes a “question of law” within the statute under consideration. Nevertheless, the reasoning does offer assistance in the determination of the issue before the Court. It supports the conclusion that the balancing exercise required by the Bread Manufacturers defence is not, of itself, a question of law. 
    55    In my opinion, the process of balancing conflicting public interests and determining which should prevail in particular circumstance, is not of itself the determination of a question of law. The scope, range and nature of the considerations relevant to such a determination involve elements about which a wide range of legitimate opinion may exist. The formulations “matter of fact and degree”, “reasonably open” and “capable of decision either way” frequently appear in reasoning on this matter. (See e.g. Endicott supra at 301-306). There are, however, limits to the range of legitimate opinion. Question (v) requires the Court to determine whether any such limits have been exceeded in this case. It must do so in a statutory context which requires that the determination of the question should be of significance as a precedent for future cases. 
     
      
     The “Reasonably Open” Test 
      
    56    Question (v) asks whether it was “reasonably open” to find that the detriment to the administration of justice was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication.  
    57    The introduction of words such as “reasonably open” is not always helpful. As Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [40]: 
     
      
       
       “Someone who disagrees strongly with someone else’s process of reasoning on an issue of fact may express such disagreement by describing the reasoning as ‘illogical’ or ‘unreasonable’ or even ‘so unreasonable that no reasonable person could adopt it’. If these are merely emphatic ways of saying that the reasoning is wrong, then they may have no particular legal consequence.” 
       
      
      
    58    To the same effect are the observations of Mildren J in Tracy Village Sports and Social Club v Walker (1992) 111 FLR 32 at 38: 
     
      
       
       “… I think difficulty of understanding may arise by the use of pejorative words such as ‘perverse’, ‘unreasonable’, ‘illogical’ and the like expressions which by their nature indicate only that in the opinion of the user, the decision ought not to have been made, and the user holds that opinion rather strongly.” 
       
      
      
    59    There are some cases on judicial review of administrative decisions in which a suggestion appears that the finding of fact that is not “reasonably open” constitutes an error of law. (See for example Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 356; Instrumatic Ltd v Supabrase Limited [1969] 1 WLR 519 at 521). However, these statements have not generally been accepted as accurately stating the law insofar as it may be suggested that there is some difference between a finding that is “not open” and one that is “not reasonably open”. (See e.g. Madalaine Textile Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v Merrylands Bus Co Pty Ltd [1969] 2 NSWR 573 at 574-575; Craig Administrative Law (3rd ed) at 159; S v Crimes Confiscation Tribunal [1998] 1 VR 83 (sub nom Powley v Crimes Compensation Tribunal (1996) 11 VAR 146) at 90-92; Comcare Australia v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Epeabaka (1999) 84 FCR 411 at 420-422). 
    60    In S v Crimes Compensation Tribunal at 90-91 Phillips JA referred to the intrusion of the word “reasonably”, in the context of whether a finding of fact was “open”, to constitute a “distraction” (at 91 lines 1 and 31).  
    61    Phillips JA went on to say, at 91, (in a passage quoted with approval by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Epeabaka supra at 421-422): 
     
      
       
       “The word ‘reasonably’ is used in this context, I suggest, just to emphasise that when judging what was open and what was not open below, we are speaking of rational tribunals acting according to law, not irrational ones acting arbitrarily. The danger of using the word ‘reasonably’ lies in its being taken to suggest that a finding of fact may be overturned, on an appeal which is limited to a question of law, simply because that finding is regarded as ‘unreasonable’. That is not the law as I understand it, at least in Australia. A finding of fact will be overturned on appeal on a question of law only if that finding was not open.” 
       
      
      
    62    For purposes of determining whether a “question of law” arises in the context of the evaluation involved in the determination of the Bread Manufacturers defence in a case of contempt, the issue is whether or not the degree of interference with the administration of justice in the present circumstances was of such a character that no other conclusion but that the defence was not made out was open to his Honour as a matter of law. The introduction of the qualificatory word “reasonably” may lead to error. As Professor Craig has pointed out with respect to an analogous occasion: 
     
      
       
       “… Lord Denning MR cited … Lord Ratcliffe’s formulation that if a tribunal reached a conclusion which could not reasonably be drawn then it would be wrong in law, but paraphrased this to mean something rather different: if the tribunal drew the wrong conclusion from the primary facts it would be wrong in law. The gentle sleight of linguistic formulation transforms the test to be applied.” 
       
      
      
     (Craig  
     Administrative Law 
      (3rd ed) p159). 
      
    63    The word “reasonably” is a weasel word capable of such inappropriate application. Its use, as in Question (v) presently under consideration, must be carefully confined. The word “reasonably” adds little, if anything, to the formulation “not open” or “not open as a matter of law”. 
     
      
     Is There a Predetermined Balance? 
      
    64    Mason P would answer Question (v) in the negative. His Honour’s reasoning is based on the proposition that some types of interference with the administration of justice are incapable of attracting the Bread Manufacturers defence. I agree that a question of law does arise in the identification of “the boundaries of the area in which the detriment of possible prejudice to the due administration of justice can be outweighed by countervailing public interest considerations”. (Hinch supra at 52 per Deane J, emphasis added). 
    65    Mason P refers to Hinch supra at 40, 43, 52-3, 66 and 85 as authority for the proposition that the Bread Manufacturers defence cannot be made out in any case in which there is an intention to interfere with the administration of justice.  
    66    The proposition that the Bread Manufacturers defence is not available to a contemnor who subjectively intends to interfere with the administration of justice does not, as Mason P indicates, arise in the present case. It is accordingly not relevant to consider this issue. 
    67    Mason P holds that the defence is also incapable of being attracted where the relevant interference with the administration of justice can be characterised in one of the following three ways: 
     
      
     (i) An implication of guilt; 
      
      
     (ii) A suggestion of guilt; 
      
      
     (iii) Canvassing of matters directly related to the issue of guilt. 
      
    68    The proposition advanced by Mason P is, in effect, that the balancing exercise between the public interest in the administration of justice and the public interest in freedom of communication is not a free standing exercise for a judge. In each of the three cases to which his Honour refers - of progressively diminishing impact - no question of balancing arises, because the law has, in the formulation of the relevant rule, already conducted the balancing exercise. There is such a predetermined balance in the case of legal professional privilege, where the law has already undertaken the process of balancing the conflicting public interests. (See e.g. Waterford v The Commonwealth (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 64-65; Carter v Managing Partner, Northmore Hale Davy and Leake (1995) 183 CLR 121 at 128, 133, 135; Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 583). 
    69    With respect to the publication considered by Barr J, Mason P concludes: 
     
      
       
       “The impugned publication was in a form and at a time that it directly trenched upon the question of Mr Duong’s guilt.” 
       
      
      
    70    The publication is summarised in the judgment of Mason P. I accept that it does give rise to an implication of guilt of the offence charged. At the very least, it contains a suggestion of guilt. It also canvasses matters directly related to the issue of guilt. If any one of the legal propositions advanced by Mason P is correct, then Question (v) should be answered in the negative, as his Honour does. 
    71    The first thing to note about the judgments in Hinch, on which Mason P primarily relies, is that the Court delivered five separate judgments. It is not easy to extract a ratio decidendi from these judgments. They do not, in my opinion, authoritatively establish a single principle of the character identified by Mason P. 
    72    In Hinch Mason CJ identified the issue before the Court at 22: 
     
      
       
       “How does the law of contempt approach the discussion of a topic of public concern or interest when in the course of that discussion the speaker or the author makes explicit reference to proceedings in which an individual has been charged with a criminal offence and that reference bears on the guilt or innocence of the accused or is capable of prejudicing him in his trial for that offence?” 
       
      
      
    73    His Honour noted that in the earlier decision of the Court in Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees’ and Builders Labourers’ Federation (1982) 152 CLR 25 (“the BLF case”), four judgments adopted a balancing approach (namely Wilson J at 133-134, Brennan J at 177, Stephen J at 75 and Mason J at 95).  
    74    In the BLF case Gibbs CJ was of the view that the court balanced the competing interests in formulating the principle. He said at 60: 
     
      
       
       “If their Honours considered that they had a discretion to weigh one consideration against another, and to make a discretionary judgment as to whether a contempt had been committed or was likely to be committed, they were mistaken. The balancing of interests … is done by the law in formulating the principle to be applied, and not by the court in deciding a particular case. The resulting principle requires that the court be satisfied that there is a real risk that the material alleged to be a contempt will interfere with the administration of justice in pending proceedings before it can hold that a contempt has been committed or is threatened. The discretion of the court lies in dealing with the contempt, not in deciding whether a contempt is being committed.” 
       
      
      
     Gibbs CJ was alone in this respect. 
      
    75    Brennan J in the BLF case at 169 and 175-176, drew a distinction between a technical contempt and a contempt which moved a court to action. His Honour suggested that the balancing of the two public interests takes place when the court decides whether to punish a contempt. 
    76    As Mason J stated in Hinch at 24, Stephen, Wilson and Mason JJ in BLF dealt with the matter on the basis that the balancing of the two public interests takes place at the stage when the Court decided whether a contempt has been committed. Mason CJ at 24.6 left this matter open for future consideration in the High Court. There may not be a ratio which is formally binding. However, this represents the preponderance of opinion which this Court should adopt unless satisfied that it is wrong. 
    77    In Hinch Mason CJ formulated the test in terms of a “substantial risk of serious interference” with the administration of justice, which he accepted to be the equivalent of the test of “real risk” formulated by Gibbs CJ in the BLF case (at 60). His Honour said at 27: 
     
      
       
       “Where the public interest in the administration of justice does not yield to a superior public interest, the balancing approach should protect the administration of justice from any substantial risk of serious interference.” 
       
      
      
    78    Mason CJ did not formulate a rule which required contempt to be found in particular circumstances. I do not see any support in the judgment of Mason CJ for the propositions advanced by Mason P in the present case.  
    79    In Hinch Wilson J identified the issue before the Court at 41 as: 
     
      
       
       “… whether a publication which prima facie would constitute a contempt of court deserving of punishment will escape that categorization if the court concludes that the damage to the public interest in the due administration of justice that is threatened or occasioned by the publication is outweighed by the public interest in the public ventilation and discussion of a matter of public concern.” 
       
      
      
    80    His Honour referred to a “prima facie contempt deserving of punishment” in order to accommodate the various expressions of opinion in the BLF case. Specifically, it incorporates the distinct approach of Brennan J. 
    81    I repeat his Honour’s conclusion at 41-42 was: 
     
      
       
       “In an appropriate case the court is empowered to entertain a defence of discussion of a matter of public interest and in doing so to engage in a balancing exercise to determine which of the competing matters of public interest should prevail. 
       
      
      
       
       But it is important to emphasize that in undertaking a balancing exercise the court does not start with the scales evenly balanced. The law has already tilted the scales. In the interests of the due administration of justice it will curb freedom of speech, but only to the extent that it is necessary to prevent a real and substantial prejudice to the administration of justice …” 
       
      
    82    This ‘thumb on the scales’ approach does not, in my opinion, support the formulation of a rule of the character identified by Mason P in the present case. It indicates a weighted approach to the balancing exercise, rather than a conclusion that in certain circumstances no issue of balancing arises at all.  
    83    Subsequent references in the judgment of Wilson J, are also directed to matters of weight, rather than constituting the formulation of a predetermined balance, e.g. “the seriousness of the interference may outweigh any public interest in the freedom to discuss the matter” (43.4) and “bring the scales down heavily in favour of a finding of punishable contempt” (at 43.5, emphasis added) 
    84    His Honour concluded at 43: 
     
      
       
       “Generally speaking, it is for a court, in determining whether impugned conduct should be condemned and punished as a contempt of court, to engage in a balancing exercise between competing public interests. Nevertheless,  
       the law provides guidance 
        of the kind I have indicated in determining the relative weight to be accorded to the factors which in a particular case may require consideration.” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
     The “provision of guidance” is not the formulation of a rule. 
      
    85    Deane J, as quoted by Mason P in his judgment, said in Hinch at p52: 
     
      
       
       “In a case where the publication is in the mass media and is directed  
       solely 
        to the merits of the very issue to be determined in the pending proceedings (e.g. the guilt or innocence of an accused), there would be no countervailing public interest consideration which might effectively outweigh the detriment of a clear tendency to prejudice the due administration of justice. The reason for that is that it will be apparent in such a case that any abstract public benefit involved in freedom of public prejudgment of the merits of the very issues committed for resolution in pending court proceedings will be outweighed by the detriment to the due administration of justice.” 
       
      
      
    86    In my opinion, Deane J was stating that in the postulated circumstances, such would ordinarily be the result of the balancing process. His Honour was not intending to formulate a rule of law which would mean that no balancing process occurred at all.  
    87    Deane J made these observations when considering the first of two propositions, with respect to the Bread Manufacturers defence, which his Honour formulated. The observations were made for the specific purpose, which his Honour went on to further consider at pp52-53, of considering the original phrase in the Bread Manufacturers case (at 249) referring to situations in which the detriment to a fair trial is “an incidental but not intended by-product” of publication. Deane J concluded that this formulation was too narrow a statement of the circumstances in which the public interest in the due administration of justice could be outweighed by other public interest considerations. To similar effect is his Honour’s subsequent identification of circumstances in which it would be “difficult if not impossible” to justify the interference with the administration of justice (at 57.8 and 58.9). In my opinion, these observations are consistent with an outcome of the balancing process, rather than the application of a rule which prevents the Court undertaking a balancing process in certain defined circumstances. 
    88    Indeed, as his Honour said at p53: 
     
      
       
       “… it is neither practicable nor desirable to attempt to define in advance the precise limits of possible countervailing public interests which may be taken into account as being furthered by a particular publication in the circumstances of a particular case. Apart from impracticability, the main reason why it is not desirable is that, once it is accepted that a person may be guilty of contempt of court by publication notwithstanding the absence of an actual purpose or intention of prejudicing the due administration of justice, the general applicability of the requirement that detriment be not outweighed by countervailing public interest considerations and the broad possible content of those other public interest considerations combine, in the context of the criminal onus of proof, to provide some safeguard against the law of contempt being turned upon itself and converted into a source of exposure of the courts and of the law to the absurdity and distrust which are unavoidable when the administration of justice is diverted to the pursuit of the trivial and the criminalization of the essentially harmless and inevitable …” 
       
      
      
    89    The judgment of Toohey J confirms, in my opinion, that, subject only to the case where interference with the administration of justice is intended by the alleged contemnor (at 67.4), the Court must undertake a balancing process. With respect to the observation by Jordan CJ in Bread Manufacturers in relation to “an incidental but not intended by-product”, Toohey J said at 66: 
     
      
       
       “The emphasis in the judgment is on the balance to be struck between competing interests. The last sentence in the passage quoted should not be taken as in some way overriding the need to strike that balance.” 
       
      
      
    90    Gaudron J at 83-84 referred to the judgments in the BLF case and noted that Gibbs CJ was alone in proposing that the matter was determined by the identification of the rule. Her Honour observed that Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ all accepted that what was involved was a balancing process and that Brennan J found such a balancing process at the stage when the court is deciding whether to act. Her Honour also noted that neither Murphy J nor Aickin J commented on this matter.  
    91    Gaudron J identified the public interest in freedom of communication, with respect to the subject matter involved in the proceedings before the Court in Hinch, as not being an interest “which could take precedence over, or even be equated with, protecting the administration of criminal justice from the risk of interference” (at 87). Her Honour found that, on the facts of the case in Hinch, the references to a previous conviction, and an “insinuated suggestion” that the subject of the comments was guilty of other like offences, “trenched directly on the question of [his] guilt of the charges pending” (p88). Her Honour added at 89 that: 
     
      
       
       “A canvassing of guilt could only be justified on the principle in  
       Bread Manufacturers, 
        if it were referable to a public interest superior to that of ensuring the integrity of the administration of criminal justice.”  
       
      
      
    92    Her Honour held that the subject matter of the particular issue under discussion in Hinch was not of that character. As I understand her Honour’s observations, this was not a result of a legal rule that “canvassing of guilt” could not be the subject of a finding that the balance lay in favour of freedom of communication. Rather, her Honour concluded that the discussion under consideration in Hinch was not such as to establish precedence for freedom of communication over administration of justice, in the particular circumstances. This was not a denial of a balancing process. It was the application of a balancing process in the circumstances of the case.  
    93    There are also a number of decisions of this Court, including five judge benches, which are pertinent to the present issue. These include Attorney-General (NSW) v Willesee [1980] 2 NSWLR 143; Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Willesee [1985] 3 NSWLR 650; Director of Public Prosecutions v Wran [1986] 7 NSWLR 616 and Attorney-General for New South Wales v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 368, to all of which Mason P makes reference. To these can be added the decision of this Court in Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1987) 7 NSWLR 588. 
    94    In Attorney General v Willesee, supra, Moffitt P made a number of observations about the judgment in Bread Manufacturers, particularly at p149C-F and 151A-F. His Honour sought to distinguish Bread Manufacturers on the basis that it involved civil proceedings.  
    95    In the next contempt case in this Court, Registrar of Court of Appeal v Willesee supra, the members of the Court indicated that the observations of Moffitt P to the effect that the Bread Manufacturers defence may not be applicable in the case of a contempt which impinges upon a criminal trial, would not be followed. (See at 659-660 per Kirby P; 677- 679 per Hope JA, 681-683 per Priestley JA. See also Attorney-General (NSW) v John Fairfax & Sons Limited (1986) 6 NSWLR 695 at 714-715 per McHugh JA). Subsequently in Hinch, the High Court established that the Bread Manufacturers defence applied in the case of criminal proceedings. The suggestion in the reasons of Moffit P in Attorney-General v Willesee that, in some way, the law establishes a rule which predetermines the balance, cannot be regarded as authority, when a critical aspect of his Honour’s reasons must be taken to have been overruled in Hinch. 
    96    On 12 March 1987, a five judge bench of this Court comprising Street CJ and Hope, Glass, Samuels and Priestley JJA handed down decisions in DPP v Australian Broadcasting Corporation and DPP v Wran. Both these cases predate the High Court’s decision in Hinch, which was handed down on 2 December 1997. Save in those respects in which an inconsistent ruling can be discerned from the various judgments in Hinch, this Court would follow the joint judgments of the five judge benches in these cases. 
    97    Mason P refers to the passage in the Court’s reasoning in Wran concerning the observations of Jordan CJ in Bread Manufacturers where their Honours said at 629: 
     
      
       
       “The boundaries of this principle have not been and probably will never be defined with precision but it is clear at least that publications directed to the very issue to be decided in a criminal trial, the guilt or innocence of the accused person, could  
       rarely if ever 
        fall within this category:  
       Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Willesee 
       . The present is a case where the relevant part of the publication was directed exclusively to that issue and no amount of public concern with the guilt or innocence of Mr Justice Murphy would justify the publication; indeed that public concern strongly vindicates the law that prohibits any such publication.” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
    98    The publication in that case was a statement by the then Premier, Mr N K Wran, that Justice Murphy of the High Court was innocent of any wrongdoing. 
    99    Furthermore, at 637 the Court referred again to the Bread Manufacturers defence and said: 
     
      
       
       “As we have indicated earlier, this principle  
       in general 
        has no application where the publication is directed to the very issue which has to be determined in the forthcoming trial, the guilt or innocence of the accused person.” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
    100    The references in these two passages to “rarely if ever” and “in general” indicate that no application of a rule of the character identified by Mason P in his reasons for judgment is involved. Rather, their Honours were, in my opinion, referring to the almost inevitable outcome of a balancing process, when the pith and substance of the publication, is specifically directed to the very issue involved in criminal proceedings. 
    101    To similar effect is the statement in DPP v ABC at 598 where the joint judgment said: 
     
      
       
       “Where in the course of the ventilation of a question of public concern matter is published which as an incidental but not intended by-product causes some likelihood of prejudice to a person in current or expected court proceedings and, when the court proceedings are criminal, the published matter is not directed to the guilt or innocence of the accused, there is no offence of contempt. 
       
      
      
       
       When the published matter is directed to the issue of guilt or innocence of the accused in criminal proceedings and as a matter of practical reality has a tendency to interfere with the due course of justice in those proceedings, then notwithstanding that the published matter is published in the course of ventilation of a question of public concern, a contempt will  
       almost certainly 
        have been committed.” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
    102    The reference to “almost certainly” is similar to the references in the judgment in Wran to “rarely if ever” and “in general”.  
    103    The actual conclusion of the Court in DPP v ABC was expressed at 612 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “The statement that Mr Justice Murphy had made improper overtures on behalf of a Sydney solicitor, Mr Morgan Ryan, was accordingly made in circumstances where it had a tendency to prejudice the future trial. Being a statement that was directed to the issue of the guilt of the accused the fact that its publication was made in the course of a public debate does not avail the defendant. The  
       Bread Manufacturers 
        defence is not made out because the public interest in freedom of discussion is in the circumstances of the present publication subordinated to the public interest in the administration of justice:  
       Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees’ and Builders Labourers’ Federation 
        (at 98-99).” 
       
      
      
    104    The reference in this passage to the “circumstances of the present publication” indicates that this is the outcome of a balancing exercise, rather than the application of a rule of law which requires a predetermined balance in the case of a publication “directed to the issue of the guilt of the accused”. 
    105    In Hinch Wilson J referred to DPP v ABC at 43: 
     
      
       
       “If the interference is intended and would otherwise justify condemnation by the court, there can be no question of any defence based on a submission that the publication in question was made in the course of a discussion of a matter of public importance. If the interference was unintended, and occurred in the course of discussion of a matter of public importance, then a balancing exercise will be appropriate. If the pending proceedings are central to the discussion then it is unlikely that the interference can be excused as incidental or that any matter of public interest may excuse it. Even if not central, the seriousness of the interference may outweigh any public interest in the freedom to discuss the matter. For example, if the media prejudges issues to be litigated in a proceeding (eg as in  
       Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation 
        (1986) 7 NSWLR 588) or canvasses the evidence so as to engage in a trial by media, this would be likely to so embarrass the fair trial of the proceeding as to bring the scales down heavily in favour of a finding of punishable contempt. Similarly with exposure of the criminal record of a person awaiting trial of a criminal offence.” 
       
      
      
    106    His Honour’s interpretation of the decision in DPP v ABC is that the case concerned the outcome of a balancing exercise, rather than the application of a rule which renders a balancing exercise unnecessary.  
    107    Deane J at 57 refers to DPP v Wran as authority for the following: 
     
      
       
       “The area in which restriction upon the freedom of discussion is most readily justifiable in the interests of the due administration of justice is in the area of the administration of the criminal law. It is in that area that one finds the category of publication which is most difficult, if not impossible, to justify by reference to countervailing public interest considerations. That category of publication is that involving a public imputation through the mass media of guilt of a criminal offence made against a person who is awaiting his or her trial on a charge of that very offence: see per Street CJ, Hope, Glass, Samuels and Priestley JJA,  
       Director of Public Prosecutions v Wran 
        (1986) 7 NSWLR 616.” 
       
      
      
    108    The phrase “most difficult, if not impossible” affirms a balancing exercise. 
    109    To similar effect, at 67, Toohey J refers to both DPP v ABC and DPP v Wran in the context of affirming the need for a balancing exercise. His Honour made particular reference to the “rarely if ever” phrase in the latter decision. 
    110    In Attorney General for New South Wales v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited supra at 384 in a joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Priestley JA, this Court referred with approval to the observations of Wilson J in Hinch at 41-42 to the effect that in undertaking the balancing exercise the law has already tilted the scales. Nothing in this Court’s adoption of that principle, nor in its application to the facts of that case, suggest anything other than that a balancing exercise is involved. I do not understand the judgment to support a predetermined balance contained in a legal rule applicable in specific factual circumstances. 
    111    In my opinion, the authorities do not support the promulgation of a rule which prevents the conduct of a balancing exercise, in the three circumstances identified by Mason P. There is, in my opinion, no predetermined balance where there is an implication of, or suggestion of, or a canvassing of, guilt. 
    112    In the years since these decisions of this Court concerning contempt by publication, and particularly since the two judgments of five judge benches in DPP v ABC and DPP v Wran, an important relevant development has occurred. I refer to the recognition of an immunity in the Constitution of the Commonwealth with respect to freedom of communication on governmental and political matters. The law of contempt must adapt to this constitutional immunity, just as the High Court has determined that the common law of defamation (Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520) and choice of law rules (John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson [2000] HCA 36), must adapt. 
    113    In Re Colina; Ex parte Torney (1999) 73 ALJR 1576 at [61] Kirby J indicated that he regarded it as still an open question whether or not the freedom of communication required by the constitution is compatible with the law of contempt. Cases in this Court indicated that there is compatibility. (See e.g. Attorney-General (NSW) v Time Inc Magazine Co Pty Ltd (New South Wales Court of Appeal, unreported, 15 September 1994) per Gleeson CJ at p4; Civil Aviation Authority v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1995) 39 NSWLR 540 esp 558-560 per Kirby P and 570-571 per Handley JA; John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v Doe (1995) 37 NSWLR 81 at 109-111 per Kirby P; see also Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Limited (1993-1994) 182 CLR 104 at 187 per Deane J and Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v Lovell (1998) 19 WAR 316 at 324-325 per Ipp J and 343 per Anderson J).  
    114    In Hamersley Iron v Lovell, in the context of considering the implied undertaking to use discovered documents only for the purposes of the proceedings in which they were discovered, Ipp J noted that the parties, the subject of this obligation, may apply for a release from the implied undertaking. His Honour said at 325: 
     
      
       
       “This enables the court to give due consideration to competing interests between the implied freedom of speech under the Constitution and the need to protect the due administration of justice by preventing public disclosure of discovered documents”. 
       
      
      
    115    His Honour’s reasoning process confirms the significance, for purposes of compatibility with the constitutional freedom, of the Court being able to conduct a balancing process in each case. 
    116    In the absence of binding authority which clearly establishes that, in any circumstances other than subjective intention, there is a predetermined balance, this Court should be slow to develop such a principle for the first time because of the constitutional immunity. 
    117    For the above reasons, I am unable to approach the consideration of Question (v) on the basis of the legal rule which Mason P finds to be determinative. 
     
      
     Analogous Case Law 
      
    118    It is neither appropriate nor necessary to attempt to identify what aspects of a balancing exercise are capable of leading to the conclusion that a particular determination of where the balance lay was not open as a matter of law. However relevantly analogous case law - often also employing the formulation “reasonably open” - indicates that the matter must be approached by the application of a stringent test. 
    119    I have found cases on the following areas of law useful by way of analogy: 
     
      
     (i) Judicial review of administrative decisions for error in non-jurisdictional fact finding. 
      
      
     (ii) The construction of “question of law” in specific statutes. 
      
      
     (iii) Determination of whether facts answer a statutory description. 
      
      
     (iv) Review of the exercise of a discretion on appeal. 
      
    120    The first and second errors of law said to have been committed by Barr J in the submission of the Attorney are directed to issues of “weight”. It is submitted that either inadequate weight was given to the prejudice to the criminal trial, or excessive weight was given to the public interest in freedom of communication. In the context of review of administrative decisions, issues of weight are usually characterised as matters for the decision maker and, accordingly, do not give rise to errors of law, either at common law or pursuant to review for such error in a statutory formulation. There are, however, circumstances in which a matter of a weight may give rise to an error of law in the context of judicial review. 
    121    In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd (1985-1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40-41, Mason J said, in the course of a frequently cited passage: 
     
      
       
       “The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind. It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator. Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned:  
       Wednesbury Corporation 
        ([1948] 1 KB at 228). 
       
      
      
       
       It follows that, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising the statutory power … I say ‘generally’ because both principle and authority indicate that in some circumstances a court may set aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance. The preferred ground on which this is done, however, is not the failure to take into account relevant considerations, or the taking into account of irrelevant considerations but that the decision is ‘manifestly unreasonable’. This ground of review was considered by Lord Greene MR in  
       Wednesbury Corporation 
        ([1948] 1 KB at 230, 233-234), in which his Lordship said that it would only be made out if it were shown that the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have come to it.” 
       
      
    122    This passage highlights the exceptional circumstances in which a matter of weight can constitute an “error of law” for purposes of judicial review. As Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said in Eshetu supra [44]: 
     
      
       
       “In  
       Wednesbury 
        … Lord Greene MR said that what a court may consider unreasonable is a very different thing from ‘something overwhelming’ such that it means that a decision was one that no reasonable body could have come to.” 
       
      
      
    123    It has long been accepted in this State, that no “question of law” or “point of law”, within the meaning of that phrase as used in statutes such as s37(4)(a) of the Workers Compensation Act 1926, arises if a particular finding was perverse or unreasonable or, relevantly, not ‘reasonably open’. (See Azzopardi v Tasmania UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156, where Glass JA with whom Samuels JA agreed, referred to a “perverse finding” as equivalent to a finding “that no reasonable person could have made”).  
    124    In Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 189C I incorrectly referred to the decision of this Court in Azzopardi, in relation to the proper construction of a statutory formula which limited appeals to “errors of law”. As Fitzgerald JA has pointed out in Hill v Green (1999) 48 NSWLR 161 at [233], the section of the Workers Compensation Act under consideration in Azzopardi in fact used the formulation “point of law”, not “error of law”. The expression “question” or “point” of law is wider than “error of law”. 
    125    No submission was made to this Court that Azzopardi was wrong or should in any way be qualified. The Attorney submitted that Azzopardi was not relevant because the process of balancing the conflicting public interests, in the course of applying the Bread Manufacturers defence, did not involve anything in the nature of a finding of primary fact or of an inference from primary fact. That may be so. However, even if described as a process of ‘evaluation’, there is a jurisprudential analogy between that function and fact finding, so that the determination of the permissible boundary in one area may inform the same process in the other. 
    126    Similar issues arise in cases concerned with whether or not certain facts, fully found, answer a particular statutory description. In Hope v The Council of the City of Bathurst (1980) 144 CLR 1, the Court found that there was an error of law where on the facts as found “no other conclusion was reasonably open” (at p9.3) or the actual conclusion of the primary judge “cannot reasonably be supported” (at p10.7). This, however, only arises if the facts as found are necessarily within or without the statutory description. (See e.g. Australian Gas Light Co v The Valuer General supra at 138; Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries supra at 157). If reasonable minds may differ there is no error. (See NSW Associated Blue-Metal Quarries Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1956) 94 CLR 509 at 512; Hembury v Chief of General Staff (1998) 193 CLR 641 at 650. 
    127    This test has a stringency equivalent to that of Wednesbury unreasonableness in the related field. There must be “something overwhelming”. 
    128    There may always be an extreme case. As Jordan CJ said when holding that a finding that a driver had momentarily fallen asleep did not necessarily mean that the driver was negligent and no error of law was manifest: 
     
      
       
       “… the question whether negligence has occurred is essentially one of degree. From certain findings of fact it would necessarily follow, as a matter of law, that an accused person had been negligent; from others, that he had not. Between these extremes, however, there lies a broad limbo in which, upon the facts found, the question whether negligence had occurred would depend on the view taken of their relative importance and significance. In such a case, the ultimate determination becomes also one of fact, and a decision either way by a tribunal of fact cannot be said to be wrong in law, unless it appears that the case has been decided because some legal principle has been wrongly applied.” ( 
       Dennis v Watt  
       (1943) 43 SR(NSW) 32 at 32). 
       
      
      
    129    The process of evaluation involved in balancing conflicting public interests, also has similarities to the exercise of a judicial discretion, where conflicting interests must be considered. 
    130    In one case involving a discretionary decision, Macrossan CJ held that a question posed in the form of Question (v) did not raise a question of law. In R v Lewis; Ex parte Attorney General supra the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal had before it a reference from the Attorney General under s669A(2) of the Criminal Code (Qld). Such a reference had to be confined to “any point of law that has arisen at the trial upon indictment of a person”.  
    131    In Lewis the matters referred arose from the exclusion by the trial judge of evidence which he had found to be unduly prejudicial to an accused in comparison with its probative value. Macrossan CJ held at 300-301:  
     
      
       
        “… it involves the assertion that the judge could not correctly in law have ruled as he did because the considerations which he was called upon to balance did not lend themselves to being viewed in the way in which he is seen to have viewed them. This only means that his assessment of a factual situation is being challenged by attempting to describe the challenge in different terms. 
       
      
      
       
       There is no dispute that the learned judge purported to exercise a discretion to exclude certain evidence because of its disproportionate prejudicial effect as compared with its slight probative value. Also, no challenge was made to the correctness of his expression of the test under which evidence can, in a criminal trial, be properly excluded by a trial judge.” 
       
      
      
    132    The exercise of the discretion to reject evidence required the Court to balance the two countervailing factors, namely probative value on the one hand and prejudicial effect on the other hand. Macrossan CJ emphasised that the drawing of the balance was a matter for the trial judge and concluded at 301: 
     
      
       
       “… the task of considering the balance and making the relevant assessment is committed to him. It cannot be accepted that if the judge applies the right test and directs his attention to the dual tendency inherent in the evidence he will be in error in point of law in the ruling that he makes in consequence. 
       
      
      
       
       … Given that the disputed items can be regarded as having some probative value in circumstantial support of the Crown case and at the same time have independent prejudicial effect, then the exercise of the discretion is open to be considered by the trial judge to whom the function is entrusted. It is an assessment of fact which is involved in considering the relative force of these two aspects.  
       Even if the judge reaches a conclusion which it might be said could not reasonably be reached then although he has erred, his error is one of fact and not law 
       . When a jury verdict is set aside on the basis that it is perverse, the matter having been left to them because there was some evidence to support their conclusion even though the overwhelming effect of the evidence was to the contrary, it is a matter of fact, not law, which moves the appeal court to intervene: see e.g. per Lord Diplock in  
       Attorney-General for Northern Ireland’s Reference 
        [1977] AC 105 at 133F and per Dixon CJ in  
       Hocking v Bell 
        (1945) 71 CLR 430 at 497.” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
    133    His Honour’s express reference to a conclusion which “could not reasonably be reached” is the formulation of the question presently before the Court. The process of balancing the probative value of evidence against its prejudicial effect, appears to me to be of the same jurisprudential character as the balancing exercise to be undertaken with respect to the Bread Manufacturers defence. 
    134    To similar effect is the reasoning in R v Foggo, ex parte Attorney-General [1989] 2 Qd R 49, also under s669A of the Criminal Code (Qld). That case involved the exclusion of evidence at a criminal trial on the basis that it had been obtained illegally or unfairly. Thomas J with whom Andrews CJ and de Jersey J agreed said at 51: 
     
      
       
       “Whether his Honour exercised the discretion wrongly,  
       fell into error in attributing excessive weight to inappropriate factors 
       , or took an unrealistic view of the facts is not for us to determine.” (Emphasis added) 
       
      
      
    135    I do not understand these decisions to suggest that there are no cases in which the exercise of a discretion would not be legally erroneous. Again, however, there would have to be “something overwhelming”. 
    136    In my opinion, the stringency of the test revealed in these analogous bodies of case law, is entirely appropriate in a context such as s101A where the scope of the words “question of law” must be determined for purposes of precedent, with no implications for the particular case in which the question arose. If Question (v) is understood in this way, it raises a question of law. 
     
      
     Was the Finding Open? 
      
    137    In support of the submission that the conclusion of Barr J was not reasonably open as a matter of law, the Solicitor General referred to the three errors which I have summarised in par [4] above.  
    138    It is convenient to deal first with the third of the alleged errors of law, set out in par [4] above. The Claimant Attorney submits that Barr J erred in finding that the prejudicial effect of the articles was “incidental and unintended”. This is a matter which depends on findings of fact about the motivation of the publisher of the impugned material and, also, about the relationship between the specific matter said to constitute the interference with the administration of justice and the balance of the publication. These are classic matters for judgment. They give rise to what is often referred to as matters of “fact and degree”, although I acknowledge the imprecision of the words. (See Craig supra 158-159; Endicott supra at 301-302). A more appropriate formulation is that this aspect of his Honour’s reasons was capable of being decided either way, in the context of the particular publication and the specific circumstances in which the publication occurred. This is not an issue of a character which has any value as a precedent. It is not a “question of law” within the meaning of s101A. This alleged error cannot, in my opinion, be relied on. 
    139    The first and second of the alleged errors are capable of giving rise to a question of law, in the way I have explained the scope of the question, i.e., that the ultimate determination was not open as a matter of law. Is there “something overwhelming”? 
    140    Barr J did not understate or underestimate the impact, by reason of the publication, on the fair trial to which the subject of the articles was entitled. His Honour held: 
     
      
       
       “There could scarcely be more prejudicial statements than those contained in the articles about a man facing charges concerning the supply of heroin. He is described as a drug boss and a top heroin distributor, a ‘Mr Big’. And is said to be targeted by police as the country’s largest heroin distributor. He is said to have a network which has become the major outlet for heroin in western Sydney. All those statements appear on the front page of the newspaper.” 
       
      
      
    141    His Honour went on to refer to other aspects of the article to similar effect and concluded: 
     
      
       
       “The statements I have summarised are highly prejudicial. If any juror at Mr Duong’s trial remembered any of them he would not in my opinion receive a fair trial.” 
       
      
      
    142    His Honour also concluded: 
     
      
       
       “The striking and unusual way in which the articles were presented made them more memorable than ordinary leading newspaper articles. Mr Duong’s photograph on the front page was unusually large, in colour and of good quality. It was repeated on page 7 and on the same page appeared a different good quality colour photograph of Mr Duong, taken from a different angle. Both photographs were of the face only. They were likely to assist in recognition.” 
       
      
      
    143    For these and other reasons his Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
       “… I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that as a matter of practical reality the articles had the tendency to interfere with the due course of justice at Mr Duong’s trial, notwithstanding that it was not due to take place for a further five months.” 
       
      
    144    On the other side of the balance was the public interest to be served by the publication. His Honour summarised the articles, inter alia, in the following way: 
     
      
       
       “The persons controlling crime, particularly drug crime, were changing. The old controllers had passed on for various reasons. The new ones included Mr Duong and Duncan Lam. A cultural and financial revolution had taken place, resulting in that change. The Federal Police Commissioner estimated that between two and three thousand kilograms of heroin were imported annually, worth up to $3 billion and that only 220 kgs had been ceased [seized] in the last year. The Federal Police could investigate only one in six or seven major heroin trafficking syndicates, the result of the size and world wide nature of the drug trafficking industry and the inadequacy of law enforcement resources in Australia. The government had pegged or reduced the amount of money available for law enforcement. Chinatown was the seat of major heroin dealing and Cabramatta was the place were it was distributed by Vietnamese persons. Mr Duong rose to prominence after the gaoling of Salvatore Lapa in 1993.” 
       
      
      
    145    As his Honour indicated, the thrust of the articles and their overall purpose plainly dealt with matters of substantial public interest. 
    146    His Honour went on to indicate that although Mr Duong’s position and role was discussed “there was no discussion of the facts or circumstances of the charges pending against him. His guilt or innocence of those charges was not mentioned”. His Honour indicated that a statement to the effect that although a person had committed similar offences could prejudice a trial it was “a less serious thing to say than that the accused is guilty of the very offences for which he is to be tried”. His Honour concluded that that particular conclusion was not implied in the material complained of.  
    147    His Honour concluded finally that: 
     
      
       
       “The articles were part of a substantial series of articles dealing with subject matter of substantial broad public interest. The trial was likely to raise narrower issues which were only incidental to those canvassed in the articles.” 
       
      
      
     It was for this reason that his Honour found that the detriment to the trial was outweighed in the specific set of circumstances by the public interest in the freedom of communication. 
      
    148    In my opinion the content of the publications to which his Honour referred, the context of the charges and the period before the trial, was such as to permit a conclusion in all the circumstances of the character to which his Honour came. No doubt other Judges may have balanced the conflicting public interests in a different way. That is not, however, a pertinent question for the determination of a question of law such as that before this Court.  
    149    The reasons given by Barr J were appropriate and apt for the purposes of coming to the conclusion to which his Honour came. His Honour had before him a publication containing a clear and prominent implication of guilt of criminal conduct by a person of the same character as certain specific charges lain against that person. On the other hand, that person’s involvement in that conduct was pertinent to a wide ranging, serious in-depth journalistic investigation of a major social problem with significant public policy implications. It cannot, in my opinion, be said that only one answer was open. 
    150    My conclusion, accordingly, is that Questions (i) to (iv) should be answered “Decline to answer”. Question (v) should be answered “Yes”. 
    151    MASON P: Invoking s101A of the Supreme Court Act, the Attorney General has submitted five questions to the Court of Appeal. They are said to arise from and in connection with contempt proceedings in which the alleged contemnor (the opponent) was found not to have committed contempt. 
    152    Proceedings were brought in the Common Law Division by the Attorney General against the respondent. The summons sought a declaration that the opponent was guilty of contempt in publishing certain material in a Sydney daily newspaper of 27 October 1998. The articles contained a number of strong statements about the conduct of Duong Van Ia whose photograph appeared on the front page and who was variously described as “the top heroin distributor”, a “drug dealer”, “the current drug csar”, a “drug boss”, “your classic criminal” and “the country's largest heroin distributor”. He and another man were said to have “carved out a giant portion of Australia's 3 billion dollar heroin trade, building a network from Southern China to Sydney”. The article referred to the fact that Duong had been charged with criminal offences and that he was yet to face trial for them. 
    153    At the time of publication, Duong had been committed for trial in the District Court on charges of supplying 223 grams of heroin and with being knowingly concerned in the supply of 222 grams of heroin. The trial was then fixed to commence on 23 March 1998. 
    154    The summons was heard by Barr J and it was dismissed with costs on 9 April 1999 [1999] NSWSC 318. 
    155    It is hardly surprising that the learned judge concluded that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that as a matter of practical reality the articles had a tendency to interfere with the due course of justice at Duong's trial, notwithstanding that it was not due to take place for a further five months. The potential ramifications of the article were described as follows: 
     
      
       
       ... What was known was that an accused person was going to be tried on charges of supplying heroin. The material complained of asserted that that was what he was in the business of doing. There is an obvious risk of prejudice where an accused person is charged with an offence and a jury are informed that he has committed just such an offence in the past. That is why such material is rigorously excluded from the jury.  
       Hinch v Attorney General 
         
       (Vic) 
        (1987) 164 CLR 15. It is ordinarily appropriate to stop the case if such material comes to the jury's attention. 
       
      
      
    156    Barr J held that there could scarcely be more prejudicial statements than those contained in the articles. “If any juror at Mr Duong's trial remembered any of [the allegations] he would not in my opinion receive a fair trial.... [No] direction to a jury could cure the prejudice flowing from these articles.” 
    157    Barr J then addressed the “public interest defence” referred to by Jordan CJ in Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd (1937) 37 SR(NSW) 242. The defence is capable of application to potential interference with criminal proceedings (see Hinch). The articles dealt with matters of substantial public interest. Barr J concluded that “it is reasonably open to say that the detriment to the trial was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication”. The summons was dismissed because the judge was not satisfied that the plaintiff had negated the defence of public interest. 
    158    The critical reasoning is at pars 128-134 of the judgment. To this I shall return. 
     
      
       
      
      
     Questions submitted by Attorney General 
      
    159    In the summons filed in the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General presented five questions for determination: 
     
     ( i) Whether His Honour, in finding the charge of contempt not to be made out, used the correct test in the application of the decision in  
     Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd  
     (1937) 37 SR(NSW) 242 by saying that the “ultimate practical question is whether it is reasonably open to say that the detriment to the trial is outweighed by the public interest in freedom of communication.” 
      
      
     (ii) If the decision in  
     Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd  
     requires a balancing of the prejudice to the trial of the accused and the utility of a particular discussion of public affairs, whether his Honour in fact carried out such a balancing exercise. 
      
      
     (iii) Whether the principles set out in  
     Ex parte Bread Manufacturers; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd 
      prevent a finding of contempt in circumstances where, as His Honour found, the articles in question stated that the accused was charged with the supply of heroin and also stated that the accused was in the business of supplying heroin. 
      
      
     (iv) Whether his Honour was correct in finding that it was necessary for the plaintiff to negate the “defence of public interest” before a finding of contempt could be made in relation to the publication in question. 
      
      
     (v) Whether it was reasonably open to his Honour to find that the detriment to the administration of justice (which his Honour held to be present) was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication of the material contained in the publication. 
      
      
    160    The questions are drafted infelicitously having regard to the nature of the Court’s jurisdiction and the real issues thrown up in this matter. 
     
      
     The Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction  
      
    161    Section 101A provides: 
     
      
       
       101A Question of law concerning criminal contempt may be submitted to Court of Appeal 
       
      
      
       
       (1) At any time after the conclusion of contempt proceeding, in which the alleged contemnor is found not to have committed contempt, the Attorney General may submit to the Court of Appeal any question of law arising from or in connection with the proceedings. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) The Attorney General must submit with the question to be determined a statement of the circumstances out of which the question arose, and thereafter must furnish such further statement as the Court of Appeal may require. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine any question submitted to it under this section. 
       
      
      
       
       (4) The determination of the Court of Appeal of the question submitted does not in any way affect or invalidate any finding or decision given in the contempt proceedings. 
       
      
      
       
       (5) The alleged contemnor is entitled to be heard on the question submitted and, if it appears that the alleged contemnor does not propose to be represented, the Attorney General is to instruct counsel to argue the question before the Court of Appeal on behalf of the person. 
       
      
      
       
       (6) The reasonable costs of legal representation of the alleged contemnor in proceedings under this section are to be paid by the Crown. 
       
      
      
       
       (7) Proceedings under this section are to be held in camera, except that a legal practitioner may be present at the proceedings for the purpose of reporting the case for any lawful purpose of the Council of Law Reporting for New South Wales. 
       
      
      
       
       (8) A person: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) must not publish any report of any submission made under subsection (1), and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) must not publish any report of proceedings under this section so as to disclose the name or identity of the alleged contemnor. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (9) Any publication in contravention of subsection (8) is punishable as contempt of the Court. 
       
      
      
       
       (10) In this section: 
        
         
       alleged contemnor 
        means the person charged with contempt in contempt proceedings. 
        
         
       contempt  
       means contempt of the Court or of any other court. 
       
      
       
     contempt proceedings 
      means proceedings before the Court in a Division for the punishment of contempt. 
      
      
      (11) This section applies to criminal contempt only, and does not apply to civil contempt. 
      
      
    162    A challenge to the constitutional validity of s101A(7) has been considered by the Court differently constituted. 
    163    Section 101A mirrors the more general provisions of s5A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, both in language and purpose. 
    164    It is significant that the sections speak of a “question of law”, not an “error of law”. This is in keeping with their obvious function, which is to arm the appellate court with power to “determine” the question, but not to reverse the acquittal. So much is established by R v J (1987) 9 NSWLR 615. Lee J said (at 616): 
     
      
       
       The purpose of s5A(2) is to provide a procedure whereby the court can pronounce upon a question of law raised that is or may be of importance in the conduct of criminal trials in this State. The mere fact that a trial judge has made an error of law will not be sufficient. The question of law raised should be one of substance, the significance of which to the criminal law does not come to an end when the trial in which it arose concludes. 
       
      
      
    165    Hunt J said (at 626): 
     
      
       
       It has been said time and again that the procedure laid down by the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
       , s5A(2), whereby following an acquittal the Attorney-General may submit questions of law arising at or in connection with the trial for the determination of this Court, is not to be used simply to resolve such a question which has importance only in relation to the trial which has taken place. The decision of this Court upon such a question does not affect the acquittal obtained, and it cannot lead to a new trial of the person acquitted. 
       
      
      
       
       The purpose of the procedure is to provide a precedent by which guidance is furnished in relation to other trials in the future. There must be involved a question of sufficient substance as to justify the adoption of the procedure, and questions of transitory or minimal significance in relation to the criminal law generally or questions which do no more than establish that the trial judge in the particular case made some error of law do not justify either argument before or decision by this Court pursuant to s5A(2). 
       
      
      
    166    It follows that it would be inappropriate for the Attorney General to bring before the Court, as a question of law, whether there was evidence of a particular ingredient of a charge to support a conviction, unless that evidentiary point threw up some point of general principle (R v J. See also R v S (1953) 53 SR(NSW) 460). A fortiori with factual errors.  
    167    In support of a wider interpretation of s101A, the Solicitor General submitted that the Court could assume that the Attorney would not exercise the power to refer questions irresponsibly; and that the ultimate sanction was for the Court to decline in its discretion to address inappropriate questions. The former proposition may readily be accepted. The second proposition is more debatable (cf R v Brown (1989) 17 NSWLR 472 at 476) but it is unnecessary to resolve it in the present case. 
    168    The authority of R v J and the reasons which underpin it reinforce the point of construction: the Court’s jurisdiction depends upon a question of law genuinely arising from or in connection with the proceedings yet having qualities of general significance, beyond the particular case. 
     
      
     Some general principles relating to the  
     Bread Manufacturers 
      defence 
      
    169    The onus rested at all times on the prosecutor to prove the charge of contempt beyond reasonable doubt. This included negating the Bread Manufacturers defence.  
    170    The prosecutor was required to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the publication had “as a matter of practical reality, a tendency to interfere with the course of justice in a particular case” (John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd v McRae (1955) 93 CLR 351 at 370). In Hinch Mason CJ (at 27-28) thought that a test of “substantial risk of serious interference” would best reconcile the conflicting demands for a free press and for a fair trial, whilst conceding that it was synonymous or virtually synonymous with other authoritative formulations. Wilson J (at 34) spoke of a need to demonstrate a “real and definite tendency to prejudice or embarrass pending proceedings”. Deane J (at 47) suggested “clear tendency” as a suitable paraphrase. See also per Toohey J at 70. 
    171    The foundational judgment of Jordan CJ in Bread Manufacturers contains the following passage (at 249-50): 
     
      
       
       It is of extreme public interest that no conduct should be permitted which is likely to prevent a litigant in a Court of justice from having his case tried free from all matter of prejudice. But the administration of justice, important though it undoubtedly is, is not the only matter in which the public is vitally interested; and if in the course of the ventilation of a question of public concern matter is published which may prejudice a party in the conduct of a law suit, it does not follow that a contempt has been committed. The case may be one in which as between competing matters of public interest the possibility of prejudice to a litigant may be required to yield to other and superior considerations. The discussion of public affairs and the denunciation of public abuses, actual or supposed, cannot be required to be suspended merely because the discussion or the denunciation may, as an incidental but not intended by-product, cause some likelihood of prejudice to a person who happens at the time to be a litigant. 
       
      
      
       
       It is well settled that a person cannot be prevented by process of contempt from continuing to discuss publicly a matter which may fairly be regarded as one of public interest, by reason merely of the fact that the matter in question has become the subject of litigation, or that a person whose conduct is being publicly criticised has become a party to litigation either as plaintiff or as defendant, and whether in relation to the matter which is under discussion or with respect to some other matter. 
       
      
      
    172    It would appear that the defence is not open to a person proved to have intended to interfere with the administration of justice (Hinch at 40, 43 per Wilson J, at 52-3 per Deane J, at 66 per Toohey J, at 85 per Gaudron J). No such intent was suggested in the present case. 
    173    In upholding the conviction for contempt in Hinch, the High Court pointed out that the fourth sentence in the critical passage (“The discussion of public affairs and the denunciation of public abuses, actual or supposed, cannot be required to be suspended merely because the discussion or the denunciation may, as an incidental but not intended by-product, cause some likelihood of prejudice to a person who happens at the time to be a litigant”) is not a definitive statement of the defence, or even a necessary test of the defence. Thus, Mason CJ said (at 22-3): 
     
      
       
       This sentence, in the context in which it appears, is not so much a statement of principle as an example of a publication which has not crossed the borderline because, being a discussion of a matter of public concern or interest, it fortuitously causes an unintended risk of prejudice to a litigant. As later passages in the judgment indicate, the risk of prejudice will be fortuitous and unintended if the author or publisher is unaware of the particular litigation. The final sentence in the passage which I have quoted indicates that Jordan CJ was speaking with particular reference to the continuation of a public discussion which had begun before the commencement of the relevant proceedings. His Honour was concerned to make the point that in such a case the public discussion may continue, without amounting to a contempt, notwithstanding that the issue in the litigation relates to the subject-matter of the discussion, so long as the possibility of prejudice to the litigation is a fortuitous and unintended by-product. In these circumstances the fourth sentence should not be regarded as a comprehensive principle applying to the discussion of any topic of public concern or interest, initiated when the relevant litigation is pending. 
       
      
      
       
       The judgments in  
       BLF  
       [ 
       Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees’ and Builders Labourers’ Federation  
       (1982) 152 CLR 25]  
       did not treat the fourth sentence as the expression of a governing principle to be applied whenever the publication is identified as one involving the discussion of public affairs or the denunciation of public abuses. 
       
      
      
       
       Although the judgments referred to it, it was not regarded as a decisive criterion of the non-existence of contempt. 
       
      
      
      (See also per Mason CJ at 26.7. 28.4. 29.5.) 
      
      
     Wilson J said (at 42): 
      
       
       In  
       Bread Manufacturers  
       Jordan CJ was prepared to excuse a publication likely to prejudice a person who happened at the time to be a litigant if it is occasioned “as an incidental but not intended by-product” of a discussion of public affairs …. In my opinion, the qualification forms an integral and important part of the principle enunciated by the Chief Justice. I favour its characterization as one of the factors to which regard may be had in carrying out a balancing exercise rather than its adoption as a rigid criterion the presence of which would automatically lead to a conclusion. One cannot rule out the possibility that an incidental and not intended by-product of a discussion of a matter of general concern may nevertheless exhibit so strong a tendency to prejudice pending criminal proceedings as to warrant punishment for contempt. Conversely, the fact that a publication cannot be excused as an incidental and not intended by-product of such a discussion does not necessarily lead to a finding of punishable contempt. 
       
      
      
      
     Toohey J said (at 66): 
      
       
       While the judgment of Jordan CJ contains a valuable statement of the principles operating in the field of contempt, like any judgment it must be read in context and not with undue concentration on each word used. In this regard I agree with the submission on behalf of the appellants that the words in the judgment “an incidental but not intended by-product” should not be elevated to an undue importance. The emphasis in the judgment is on the balance to be struck between competing interests. The last sentence in the passage quoted should not be taken as in some way overriding the need to strike that balance. Rather the last sentence excludes from the balancing process statements which are intended to bring about the likelihood of prejudice. 
        (citations omitted) 
       
      
      
    174    These passages demonstrate that reference to mere incidentality is not determinative. Indeed it is capable of diverting attention away from the true issue. I return to this point in my discussion of the Attorney General’s third challenge to the decision below. 
    175    The Bread Manufacturers test requires evaluation of competing public interests, usually described as the interest in a fair trial and the interest of the public to be informed about vital matters. That evaluation is not the exercise of judicial discretion (Hinch at 43-44 per Wilson J, at 77 per Toohey J). Wilson J (at 43-44) spoke of the evaluation of competing matters of fact, to be decided according to the requisite standard. At first blush, these passages sit uneasily with Gaudron J’s references (at 85, 87) to the evaluation being a question of law. However, the reconciliation may lie in the common recognition that the evaluation must be undertaken “consistently with accepted judicial principle” (per Wilson J at 43) having regard to particular facts such as the nature and extent of publication and its timing. Whatever the correct label, “much more than simple fact-finding is involved” (Registrar of Court of Appeal v Willesee (1985) 3 NSWLR 650 at 683 per Priestley JA). 
    176    In my view, it is unnecessary to decide whether the balancing of the competing public interests identified in Bread Manufacturers is itself a question of law. Nor is it pertinent to exegete the words “reasonably open” in the fifth question as formulated by the claimant to see if they ever carry a question of law. That is because there may be cases where the method in which the balancing is done and/or the outcome is such that the Court can identify a question of law capable of attracting the appellate jurisdiction invoked in this case. To take an extreme example, scrupulous application of Bread Manufacturers would expose error of law if the trial judge disclosed that the balance was affected by the race or gender of the person facing trial. For reasons which I shall develop, I have concluded that an otherwise unexceptional application of Bread Manufacturers exposed two error of law through a combination of reasoning and outcome and that the questions of law involved attract the jurisdiction under s101A of the Supreme Court Act. 
    177    Each of their Honours in Hinch contemplated that there would be situations where the balance would inevitably fall one way, against the contemnor. I shall return to the key passages after a digression to examine the concept of a fair trial as developed in recent case law. This concept provides the raison d’etre for the law of contempt and (in my view) explains why Hinch does not stand for the proposition that any type of interference with a fair trial is capable of justification by reference to the Bread Manufacturers defence. It explains why some types of interference are incapable in law of such justification. 
     
      
     The right to a fair trial 
      
    178    The right to a fair trial according to law by an independent and impartial tribunal is a basic human right recognised as such in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The nature of the right to a fair trial was described in the following terms by Isaacs J in R v Macfarlane; Ex parte O'Flanagan & O'Kelly (1923) 32 CLR 518 at 541-2: 
     
      
       
       That such a right exists as a personal right seems to me so deeply rooted in our system of law and so elementary as to need no authority to support it. It is a right which inheres in every system of law that makes any pretension to civilization. It is only a variant of the maxim that every man is entitled to his personal liberty except so far as that is abridged by a due administration of the law. Every conviction set aside, every new criminal trial ordered, are mere exemplifications of this fundamental principle. And if the right be admitted, it would be an empty thing, unless the law adequately protected it. 
       
      
      
       
      
    179    In his keynote address to the Fifth International Criminal Law Congress in Sydney in 1994, Sir Anthony Mason referred to “the central precept of our criminal law ... that no person shall be convicted of a crime otherwise than after a fair trial according to law” (The Hon Sir Anthony Mason, “Fair Trial” (1995) 19 Crim LJ at 7).  
    180    It has been pointed out that the right to a fair trial is more accurately expressed in negative terms as a right not to be tried unfairly or as an immunity against conviction otherwise than after a fair trial, for no person can enforce a right to be tried by the state (Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 56-57; Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 299). This correctly emphasises that it is the obligation of the State to secure that right if it wishes to prosecute. Dietrich saw the High Court declaring this negative right to be a matter of substance, not mere form. In Gaudron J's words (at 362):  
     
      
       
       The expression 'fair trial according to law' is not a tautology. In most cases a trial is fair if conducted according to law, and unfair if not. If our legal processes were perfect that would be so in every case. But the law recognizes that sometimes, despite the best efforts of all concerned, a trial may be unfair even though conducted strictly in accordance with law. Thus, the overriding qualification and universal criterion of fairness! 
       
      
      
       
      
    181    Infringements of the right by agents of the State, such as police, prosecutors, gaolers and those asserting public interest immunity may lead to appropriate remedies. The remedies include adjournment, change of venue, stay and quashing of conviction. Many rules of evidence and procedure serve that right. So too does the overarching obligation of procedural fairness or natural justice. The law of contempt offers the remedies of injunction and criminal punishment to prevent or deter acts having the tendency to interfere with the fair conduct of trials. 
    182    The recent development of the remedy of stay for abuse of process illustrates how judges use their perception of public confidence in the administration of justice in order to mould remedies in support of the right to a fair trial. In Jago v District Court (NSW) at 29-30 Mason CJ quoted with approval the judgment of Richardson J of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Moevao v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464 at 481 where his Honour pointed out that ""due administration of justice is a continuous process, not confined to the determination of the particular case"". Richardson J went on to say: 
     
      
       
       It is contrary to the public interest to allow [public confidence in the administration of justice] to be eroded by a concern that the Court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice.  
       
      
      
     See also  
     Director of Public Prosecutions v Shirvanian 
      (1998) 44 NSWLR 129 at 133-135. 
      
    183    The content of the right is fashioned by the purpose of the criminal law and the processes it uses to achieve its ends. The criminal law has the dual functions of convicting the guilty and acquitting the innocent (including those not proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt). For better or worse it operates in a highly-charged atmosphere. Of all branches of law, it is the one in which the public has the greatest concern and participation, yet it is the one most needful of protection from hysteria or mob influence. It is the constitutional duty of the judicial arm of government to apply the criminal law with fearless independence.  
    184    A verdict of guilt and ensuing punishment must be the product of a fair trial. The rule of law can settle for nothing less. Trial by media cannot be tolerated in a civilised society. It is the antithesis of the private and public interests in fair trial. 
    185    It is irrelevant that the person who is the subject of media attention is truly guilty. In Attorney-General for New South Wales v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 368, the Court comprising Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Priestley JA said (at 382): 
     
      
       
       The publication of matter may have a real and definite tendency to prejudice or embarrass pending proceedings regardless of whether the person about whom the matter is published is guilty. Mr Mason’s right to a fair trial was none the less because the prosecution case against him was strong, and the public interest in the due observance of the processes of the criminal justice system does not wax and wane with the weakness or strength of the defence case. A notion that the rules relating to contempt of court somehow apply with less rigour to the case of a person against whom there is a very strong case would reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of those rules. 
       
      
      
       
      
     The centrality of the right to a fair trial in  
     Hinch 
      
    186    Hinch established that the Bread Manufacturers principle is capable of extending to interference with criminal proceedings. A person who has trenched upon an accused person’s right to a fair trial may avoid conviction for contempt in appropriate cases where the interests of the free dissemination of information are strong. But some types of interference are so incompatible with the right to a fair trial on a criminal charge that the defence is incapable of being attracted on the facts. 
    187    Bread Manufacturers involved a potential contempt of a civil trial in circumstances where the newspaper’s criticism of a company’s price-fixing activities started before a libel and conspiracy action was commenced against that company by a third party.  
    188    Hinch involved a criminal trial, and the contempt conviction was affirmed. In Hinch, the contemnors broadcast by radio in Melbourne. Father Glennon, an ordained priest, had been charged with serious sexual offences involving young people and he was bailed to appear at the Melbourne Magistrate’s Court. A gap of ten months was expected before any trial by jury. The theme of the broadcasts was to highlight the inappropriateness of Glennon continuing to occupy the position of governing director of a Foundation that organised children’s camps. To emphasise this perfectly good point, Mr Hinch referred to Glennon’s prior conviction and sentence of two years imprisonment for indecent assault on a young girl. The disclosure of the prior conviction was in a context strongly suggestive of guilt in the current charges (see at 29 per Mason CJ, at 45 per Wilson J, at 58 per Deane J, at 76 per Toohey J, at 88 per Gaudron J). In Toohey J’s words (at 76), the broadcasts “prejudiced [Glennon’s] chances of obtaining a fair trial by their thinly veiled assertions of guilt”. 
    189    Nothing in the reasoning in Hinch suggests that the broadcasting of information proven capable of being heard and retained by potential jurors in an imminent criminal trial known to the broadcaster would not be a contempt where the information implied or suggested the guilt of the accused. I am unaware of any reported case where a publication with the appropriate tendency has not been held to constitute a contempt if it implied or suggested the guilt of the accused. 
    190    There are indeed strong statements to the opposite effect in several of the judgments in Hinch. This appears most clearly in the following passages in the judgment of Deane J (emphasis added and citations omitted): 
     
      
       
       (at 48-9) 
       … the nature of the pending proceedings in relation to which the publication is likely to prejudice the fair and impartial administration of justice will be an important,  
       and sometimes decisive 
       , factor in the weighing of competing public interests. 
       
      
      
       
       (at 52) [Mention should be made of]  
       the boundaries of the area in which the detriment of possible prejudice to the due administration of justice can be outweighed by countervailing public interest considerations.  
       In a case where the publication is in the mass media and is directed solely to the merits of the very issue to be determined in the pending proceedings (eg the guilt or innocence of an accused), there would be no countervailing public interest consideration which might effectively outweigh the detriment of a clear tendency to prejudice the due administration of justice. 
        The reason for that is that it will be apparent in such a case that any abstract public benefit involved in freedom of public prejudgment of the merits of the very issues committed for resolution in pending court proceedings will be outweighed by the detriment to the due administration of justice. …  
       
      
      
       
       (at 57)  
       The area in which restriction upon the freedom of discussion is most readily justifiable in the interests of the due administration of justice is in the area of the administration of the criminal law. It is in that area that one finds the category of publication which is most difficult,  
       if not impossible 
       , to justify by reference to countervailing public interest considerations.  
       That category of publication is that involving a public imputation through the mass media of guilt of a criminal offence made against a person who is awaiting his or her trial on a charge of that very offence. 
       
      
      
       
       (at 58-9)  
       …  
       on no approach could countervailing public interest considerations reasonably be seen 
        as justifying the worst feature of the publications, namely, the poisoning of the stream of criminal justice by the clear inference, in the first and third broadcasts, that Glennon was guilty of the very charges involved in the pending committal proceedings. In the context of the unrestrained language, the evocative imagery and the disclosure of the past conviction and the earlier criminal proceedings, that clear inference of present guilt gave the overall broadcasts the effect of media pretrial and prejudgment.  
       
      
      
       
       The right to a fair and unprejudiced trial is an essential safeguard of the liberty of the individual under the law. The ability of a society to provide a fair and unprejudiced trial is an indispensable basis of any acceptable justification of the restraints and penalties of the criminal law. Indeed, it is a touchstone of the existence of the rule of law.  
       It is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage any situation in which countervailing public interest considerations could outweigh the detriment to the due administration of justice involved in public prejudgment by the mass media of the guilt of a person awaiting trial. 
        Certainly, it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that there were no countervailing public interest considerations which outweighed the detriment of the mass media prejudgment of guilt in the present case. 
       
      
      
    191    Mason CJ held (at 26-7) that the importance of the issue that led to the broadcasts: 
     
      
       
       … is not so fundamental and paramount as to entail a disregard of the essentials of a fair trial. No doubt Fr Glennon’s prior convictions for similar offences reinforced the case for suspending him from his office with the Foundation and made his continuation in office the more reprehensible. But the public interest in free discussion and in alerting the community to the risk inherent in that continuation does not warrant a desertion of the public interest in securing a fair trial for Fr Glennon. The public interest in free discussion and in alerting the community to the risk does not require disclosure of prior convictions with the prejudice that it is likely to cause to a fair trial. 
       
      
      
       
      
    192    Wilson J stated (at 37) that: 
     
      
       
       … in relation to the pending trial of a public officer charged with bribery, there may be a world of difference between the effect thereon of, on the one hand, a series of articles devoted to a general discussion of suspected improprieties in an area of public administration (but which articles do not name any particular officer), and, on the other hand, a publication which in the course of the same discussion names the officer and details his criminal history. 
       
      
      
       
      
     Wilson J later said (at 41-2) that: 
      
      
       
       … it is important to emphasize that in undertaking a balancing exercise the court does not start with the scale evenly balanced. The law has already tilted the scales. In the interest of the due administration of justice it will curb freedom of speech, but only to the extent that is necessary to prevent a real and substantial prejudice to the administration of justice…. 
       
      
      
     Later (at 43) he said: 
      
       
       If the pending proceedings are central to the discussion then it is unlikely that the interference can be excused as incidental or that any matter of public interest may excuse it. Even if not central, the seriousness of the interference may outweigh any public interest in the freedom to discuss the matter. For example, if the media prejudges issues to be litigated in a proceeding (eg as in  
       Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation  
        (1986) 7 NSWLR 588) or canvasses the evidence so as to engage in a trial by media, this would be likely to so embarrass the fair trial of the proceeding as to bring the scales down heavily in favour of a finding of punishable contempt. Similarly with exposure of the criminal record of a person awaiting trial of a criminal offence. 
       
      
      
    193    See also Toohey J at 67. 
    194    Gaudron J identified the due administration of justice as one of the matters of fundamental importance which the Bread Manufacturers defence was designed to protect (at 83, 85-86). She held that the evaluation of competing public interests was a question of law (see par 24, above). Later she said (at 86-7, emphasis added): 
     
      
       
       The public interest in the integrity of the criminal justice system also is a matter of fundamental importance. Notwithstanding that some offences are punishable summarily and that on some occasions an accused person may waive his or her right to trial by jury, the law regards as fundamental to the preservation of rights and freedoms necessary for the maintenance of an open and democratic society that a person should not be convicted of a serious criminal offence save by the verdict of a jury given after a fair trial upon the evidence presented at that trial. In the  
       BLF Case 
        (1982) 152 CLR 99, Mason J, commenting on the administration of criminal justice and the dangers of trial by media, said: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “In such a case the paramount public interest is that of maintaining the administration of justice free from prejudice and interference. The countervailing public interest - freedom of discussion - is exclusively related to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the issue to be determined at the trial. In this situation freedom of discussion has no independent value and is therefore readily subordinated to the public interest in the administration of justice.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       Accordingly, in my view, the public interest to which the broadcasts were referable was not an interest which  
       could take precedence over, or even by equated with, protecting the administration of criminal justice from the risk of interference 
       , encompassing as it does, the public interest in the maintenance of the right of every accused person to have a fair trial. 
       
      
      
     At 88-9 she said: 
      
      
       
       Where the impugned conduct goes directly to the question of guilt,  
       it trenches at the very heart of the public interest in ensuring that no person is convicted of a criminal offence save by verdict given after a fair trial  
       on the evidence given in that trial. In that situation a balancing process which merely weighed a lesser public interest against the “possibility of prejudice” would leave out of account a public interest which is fundamental to our rights and freedoms, and which is jeopardized by the conduct sought to be justified by reference to a lesser public interest. A canvassing of guilt could only be justified on the principle in  
       Bread Manufacturers 
       , if it were referable to a public interest superior to that of ensuring the integrity of the administration of criminal justice. As the public interest to which the broadcasts were referable does not take precedence over the public interest in protecting the administration of criminal justice from risk of interference, it is neither necessary nor relevant to consider whether it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the risk which the broadcasts created was incidental but not intended. 
       
      
      
    195    These passages show the justices to have been vitally concerned to demonstrate the limits of the Bread Manufacturers defence. In my view, they establish that the defence cannot be invoked to excuse a publication proved beyond reasonable doubt to have the requisite tendency to interfere with the fair trial of a pending criminal charge where the interference consists of implication or suggestion of guilt or the canvassing of matters directly related to the central issue of guilt. The cautious statements of a principle operating “in general” or a permission applying “rarely if ever” leave ample room for Bread Manufacturers to operate in situations where the accused person’s rights are not trenched upon in the direct manner I am addressing (cf Registrar of Court of Appeal v Willessee (1985) 3 NSWLR 650) or in circumstances such as a major constitutional crisis or imminent threat of nuclear disaster to which Mason CJ referred in Hinch (at 26). In times of peace, there can be no justification for trial by media that trenches upon an accused person’s right to a fair trial by the implication or suggestion of guilt in a manner and time that has the proven requisite tendency. Certainly this is the case where it is possible to conceive of ways in which the message of the articles under consideration could have been given without direct interference with Mr Duong’s right to a fair trial. 
    196    Nothing in earlier decisions of this Court cuts across this analysis. Indeed there are statements that clearly support it. Attorney-General (NSW) v Willesee [1980] 2 NSWLR 143 was a case in which contempt was found in relation to a publication that had suggested that Schneidas, a man shortly to be tried for murder of a prison officer, had previously assaulted two other officers. The publication had implicitly identified him and attributed earlier crimes of violence to him. The persons responsible for the broadcast were convicted of contempt, with the Bread Manufacturers defence being rejected in the particular circumstances. Moffitt P (with whose reasons Hope JA agreed) said (at 151): 
     
      
       
       There is no authority that to broadcast to the public by newspaper, radio or television that a man has prior convictions, or has committed past crimes, after he has been charged ceases to be contempt because it is published in the course of some legitimate discussion upon a matter of public interest. 
       
      
      
    197    In Registrar of Court of Appeal v Willesee, a Bread Manufacturers defence defeated a prosecution for contempt by interference in the course of justice in a criminal trial. However, the facts were far removed from the present. The publication inferred that the accused was of bad character, but it did not refer to the crime which he was alleged to have committed or otherwise discuss his guilt in that area. Kirby P described the publication in question as “unintended, accidental and justifiable publication of matter which happens to impinge upon and prejudice a trial” (at 653). Hope JA discussed Bread Manufacturers at some length and his reasons on this matter were agreed with by Kirby P (at 660) and generally by Priestley JA (at 681). Hope JA referred (at 677-8) to the earlier Willesee decision and said (at 678): 
     
      
       
       That is an entirely different case from the present one, and in my opinion what Moffitt P said about the application of the principle enunciated by Jordan CJ should be understood as directed primarily to that type of case. 
       
      
      
    198    In Director of Public Prosecutions v Wran (“Wran”) (1986) 7 NSWLR 616 at 629 the Court comprising of Street CJ, Hope, Glass, Samuels and Priestley JJA said (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
       Stemming from the well-known statement by Jordan CJ in  
       Ex parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd 
        (1937) 37 SR(NSW) 242 at 249; 54 WN 98 at 99, it has been established by a succession of decisions that in appropriate cases the public interest in the administration of justice may yield to public interest in the ventilation of questions of public concern. The boundaries of this principle have not been and probably will never be defined with precision but  
       it is clear at least that publications directed to the very issue to be decided at a criminal trial, the guilt or innocence of the accused person, could rarely if ever fall within this category: 
         
       Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Willesee 
       .  
        The present is a case where the relevant part of the publication was directed exclusively to that issue and no amount of public concern with the guilt or innocence of Mr Justice Murphy would justify the publication 
       ; indeed that public concern strongly vindicates the law that prohibits any such publication. 
       
      
      
     This decision was cited with approval in  
     Hinch 
      by Toohey J (at 67).  
      
    199    Finally, there is the decision in Attorney-General for NSW v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd, a case where a television station broadcast pictures of a man (Mason) in handcuffs pointing out places where he had “allegedly admitted” to two murders. The Bread Manufacturers defence was rejected. It was recognised that there were matters of public interest involved in the news item about an arrest that ended a widely-publicised manhunt for a dangerous killer. Nevertheless, it was held that the public interest in these matters could have been satisfied without the presence of the features which rendered the news item offensive to the law of contempt. The reference in the news item to the subject matter of the charges was central and not merely incidental to some wider topic of public discussion. The case was said to be quite unlike Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Willesee and much closer to Hinch. Applying Hinch, the Court held (at 384, emphasis added) that it was: 
     
      
       
       … impossible 
        to hold that in the circumstances the various considerations of public interest referred to on behalf of the Opponent prevent the conclusion that the publications constituted serious and punishable contempts. 
       
      
      
       
       In a case such as the present, the principles of law in question do not exist merely to protect the private interests of a person such as Mr Mason in securing a fair trial in respect of his alleged crimes. They protect the interest of the public in having persons who are accused of crime in our community dealt with by the system established for the administration of justice according to law. Trial by media has no place in that system.

     The appellant’s challenges to the judgment below 
      
    201    The five questions referred to the Court of Appeal are set out above. 
    202    The Attorney General submitted that his Honour made three errors of law in balancing prejudice to the administration of criminal justice and prejudice to the freedom of communication to discuss a matter of public interest. 
     
      
     (i) Implication of Duong’s guilt 
      
    203    First, it was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to attach sufficient weight to the seriousness of the prejudice flowing from the articles. In particular, it should have been found that Duong's guilt was implied. His characterisation as a “Mr Big” of the drug world as described in the article carried the implication that he was guilty of the pending charge of supplying heroin. The Court was referred to statements in Hinch that Glennon’s guilt of unidentified past cases of child abuse carried the implication of guilt of the offences with which he had been charged (see especially at 31, 53-54, 58, 71, 76). The seriousness of implied assertions of guilt and the difficulty of envisaging circumstances in which the interest in freedom of discussion could outweigh the detriment to the due administration of justice involved in public prejudgment by the mass media of the guilt of a person awaiting trial are emphasised throughout the judgments in Hinch (see esp at 26-27, 43, 57-59, 71, 86-88. See also Wran at 629, The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 612). It was submitted that, if Barr J had accorded proper weight to the seriousness of the prejudice involved in the publication, his Honour would have concluded, as a matter of law, that the prejudice could not be outweighed by any countervailing public interest, especially in circumstances where the subject article dealt with a relatively narrow issue of public interest, namely the identification of Duong as the nation's largest drug dealer. 
    204    Barr J made some general remarks about Bread Manufacturers. He summarised the content of the articles, holding (at pars [128] and [131]) that they dealt with matters of substantial public interest and that the naming of Duong was an integral part of that discussion.  
    205    His Honour discussed (at [128]-[130]) whether the articles implied Duong’s guilt of the pending charges. At [130] he said: 
     
      
       
       If the articles had been about the commission by Mr Duong or others of particular, named offences, there might have been substance in  
       [the Attorney General's submission that the articles implied that Duong was guilty of the charges which he was facing] 
       . But I think that the articles are really about personalities and control. Although a statement, in the context of the trial of an accused for a particular offence, that that accused has committed similar offences may prejudice the accused at his trial, that is a less serious thing to say than that the accused is guilty of the very offences for which he is to be tried. No such thing is implied in the material complained of. 
       
      
      
       
      
    206    The conclusion that the articles did not imply Duong’s guilt “of the very offences charged” is a decision in point of fact and as such outside the scope of appellate review in this application. However, the conclusion was a deceptively narrow and insecure springboard for the later discussion about the incidental and unintended references to guilty conduct which, in my view, betrays error of law. This is addressed with reference to the third of the Attorney’s challenges. 
     
      
     (ii) Interference with Duong’s right to a fair trial by suggesting guilt 
      
    207    Secondly, it was submitted that the public interest in the publication of the article was not capable, as a matter of law, of overriding the identified public interest in the administration of justice. This submission did not rise so high as to contend that the public interest in the integrity of the criminal justice system could never yield to the public interest in the open discussion of matters of fundamental importance to Australian society. Stated at that level of generality, the proposition is precluded by Hinch. The Attorney nevertheless submitted that the particular public interest advanced in the newspaper article had of necessity to yield to the particular public interest in the integrity of the criminal process then set in motion as regards Mr Duong when one had regard to the content of the article. The highly prejudicial allegations contained in the newspaper article directly interfered with Mr Duong’s right to a fair trial by suggesting his guilt through the participation in the very types of activities which would establish guilt on the pending charges. It was submitted that it was not reasonably open for his Honour to say that the detriment to Duong's trial was outweighed by the public interest in the naming of him as a person involved in the illicit drug industry. 
    208    I accept this submission.  
    209    I have stated my understanding of the general principles. These articles were proven to have interfered with Duong’s right to a fair trial with an immediacy and in a manner that made it impossible to accept the proffered justification. At the very least they suggested Duong’s guilt and they canvassed matters central to the issues in the forthcoming trial. The conclusion that they did not imply guilt “of the very offences for which he [was] to be tried” may have been technically correct, at least to the trained lawyer’s eye. But the law of contempt proceeds on the basis that some jurors may be susceptible to being diverted from their sworn duty if types of highly prejudicial information are put before them. The information about Duong in the articles was clearly of this nature. It was irrelevant that there may have been an overwhelming Crown case. And it in no way lessened the contempt that the incidents written about may not have been those which were the subject of the charges. To state that an accused is a hired hitman is so potentially damaging that it cannot be justified by suggesting that the accused may be innocent of the particular contract killing for which he stands charged, any more than publishing details of a past conviction for sexual abuse of a child can be disconnected from an upcoming fresh charge of a similar offence (cf Hinch). 
    210    It is one of the most “deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles” of the criminal law that evidence of prior convictions shall not be admissible on the trial of a person’s guilt or innocence of a criminal charge (Maxwell v Director of Public Prosecutions [1935] AC 309 at 317). Evidence of criminal propensity can be practically as damaging and this explains the extreme caution with which it is treated in the presence of juries. Assertions by the media in the confident and dogmatic tones of the articles in question in this case tend to fall somewhere in between. However, there could be no doubting of Barr J’s conclusion that there could scarcely be more prejudicial statements than those found in the newspaper articles. 
    211    It was not suggested that the importance of discussing the issue raised by the article at the time of publication of the article was such that the adjournment or staying of the criminal trial were relevant options for accommodating competing public interests. Contrast the extreme examples of a major constitutional crisis or an imminent threat of nuclear disaster mentioned by Mason CJ in Hinch (at 26). 
     
      
     (iii) Reference to “incidental and unintended” prejudicial effect 
      
    212    Thirdly, it was submitted that Barr J erred in finding that the prejudicial effect of the articles was “incidental and unintended”. The respondent was aware of the pending charges (this fact being mentioned in the article itself). It could not be said that the article continued public discussion which had already begun, since its whole thrust was to name Duong as a “Mr Big” and to expose his wickedness to public view. Since the very issue to be decided in the pending litigation, namely whether or not Duong was a person who had engaged in the supply of heroin, was canvassed extensively in the articles, it was not reasonably open to conclude that the serious prejudice to Duong's trial occasioned by the publication was an incidental by-product of a discussion of a matter of public interest. 
    213    I accept this submission. 
    214    Merely because the publication of information worthy of public interest has an incidental or unintended impact upon the fairness of a forthcoming trial will not ensure the success of a Bread Manufacturers defence. 
    215    This point is established firmly by Attorney-General (NSW) v Willesee where each member of the Court (Moffitt P, Hope JA and Mahoney JA) rejected the proposition advanced by the defendants that the contempt was excused because the references to Schneidas were “fortuitous” or because the charges against Schneidas did not provide the occasion of the publication. As Moffitt P put it (at 153): 
     
      
       
       To publish matter which has a real and definite tendency to prejudice or embarrass pending criminal proceedings is contempt. It is not to the point that the publisher is then dealing with another subject, and that the prejudicial matter published is merely incidental to the other matter and that its addition and any prejudice is fortuitous. 
       
      
      
    216    There are several passages to similar effect in Hinch some of which have already been set out (par 173, above). Merely because the harmful impact is incidental or fortuitous is not determinative, although it is relevant (see also at 26, 28 per Mason CJ, at 43, 46 per Wilson J, at 58 per Deane J, at 66-7, 75-6 per Toohey J, at 85 per Gaudron J). 
    217    At the conclusion of his judgment Barr J said this about the articles: 
     
      
       
       133. The mention of the charges, however, is a matter of concern, because one of the effects was to potentiate interference with the administration of justice at the trial insofar as it was likely to provide a link within the memories of persons forming the jury between the subject in the article and the identity of Mr Duong at the trial. It played no part in the discussion of matters which were in the public domain. It was extremely careless and ought not to have happened. However, that does not change my view that the prejudicial effect of the articles was incidental and unintended. 
       
      
      
       
       134. The articles were part of a substantial series of articles dealing with subject matter of substantial broad public interest. The trial was likely to raise narrower issues which were only incidental to those canvassed in the articles. In view of these matters and the other matters I have dealt with I think that it is reasonably open to say that the detriment to the trial was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication. 
       
      
      
    218    In my opinion, this passage disclosed error of law. The dual references to the incidental prejudicial effect of the articles suggests that his Honour considered such characterisation as determinative. Furthermore, they disclose a process of reasoning whereby the starting point was the thrust and purpose of the articles, with the impact upon the trial being examined to see if such impact was itself incidental to the articles. For the reasons set out above, incidentality is not the touchstone of the Bread Manufacturers defence. Indeed reference to incidentality is capable of misleading in a case such as the present. The public and private interests in the fair trial of an accused person require that such interests should commence and remain the focus of the court’s attention. Certain types of incidental adverse impact may attract a successful Bread Manufacturers defence. But this does not occur because the impact is adverse. Nor can it occur, in my view, when the impact involves the disclosure of prior criminal activities in circumstances such as the present. 
     
      
      
     Conclusions 
      
    219    This case raises questions of general principle that attracts the jurisdiction under s101A of the Supreme Court Act. 
    220    A surprising factual outcome could not itself attract appellate review, although it may be capable of pointing to errors of legal principle. In my view, this is such a case. The way in which the judgment below addressed the incidentality of prejudice indicates a particular approach to the defence which, in my respectful view, betokens legal error. 
    221    Of greater significance is the silence of the judgment as to the centrality of the right to a fair trial and to the essentiality that such right be protected against the type of interference involved in the present case. Protection of that right is a touchstone of the free and democratic society that the Bread Manufacturers defence is in principle designed to advance. The impugned publication was in a form and at a time that it directly trenched upon the question of Mr Duong’s guilt. The canvassing of that issue in the graphic language of the article did not and could not find justification by reference to a public interest in the general topic, important though it was. 
     
      
     Formal orders 
      
    222    For these reasons, it was not reasonably open to the judge to say that the detriment to the trial was outweighed by the public interest in the freedom of communication (par 157, above). That conclusion was vitiated by the errors I have identified. 
    223    The five questions do not formulate the true issues with the clarity of the three central submissions even though those submissions are directly related to the particular trial. 
    224    Questions (i) and (ii) are too general to merit an answer of any utility. Question (iii) is both amorphous and confusing in the use of the word “prevent”. Question (iv) is clearly to be answered in the affirmative. Since, however it attracted no submissions because the matter has never been in doubt I would decline an answer. No genuine question of law arises. Question (v) should be answered “no”. 
    225    I would answer as follows: 
     
      (i) Decline to answer. 
      
      (ii) Decline to answer. 
      
      
      (iii) Decline to answer. 
      
      
      (iv) Decline to answer. 
      
      
      (v) No. 
      
      
    226    PRIESTLEY JA:  I agree with the reasons and conclusions of the Chief Justice. 
    227    Further, adopting the Chief Justice’s discussion of the meaning of “question of law” in various contexts and in its place in s 101A(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1970, it seems to me to follow that the Attorney General’s questions (ii) and (iii) are not questions of law within the meaning of those words in s 101A(1). 
    228    I also have doubts about the remaining questions. They seem to me probably to be alien to the purpose of s 101A, which I think must be understood in the light of the High Court’s reasons for its decision in Mellifont v Attorney General for the State of Queensland (1991) 173 CLR 289. 
    229    However, as the position concerning these questions is not so clear as in regard to questions (ii) and (iii) and as, in view of my agreement with the Chief Justice’s approach, it is not necessary to reach a conclusion on the issue whether they are questions for the purposes of s 101A(1), I do no more than make it clear that I reserve my opinion on that issue. 
    230    The answers to the question should, in my opinion, be as proposed by the Chief Justice.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 4 August 200070074/98 - REGINA v Isaac James HYATTJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: The offender, Isaac James Hyatt, was convicted by a jury of the manslaughter on 23 April 1998 at Cabramatta of Meng Lim Ly. On the day of the death of the deceased, Meng Lim Ly, the offender was an employee at a business in Cabramatta which sold building materials. He had been employed there for about three weeks. The deceased was his supervisor. The offender was a young man of twenty-two years of age. He was not a violent person and had never been in trouble of any kind. He was a good worker and conscientious and wanted to get on in his job. 
     
      
    2   The premises of the business comprised an office or shop fronting the street and a store behind it containing building materials. Persons in the shop could walk through doors into the store. Vehicular access to the store could be obtained via a side lane. 
     
      
    3   The offender’s duties included dealing with customers in the shop, receiving orders and quoting prices, recording sales and assisting customers in the store. 
     
      
    4   The deceased had been employed in the business for a much longer time and was well known to the owner, having been associated with him in a previous business. 
     
      
    5   The offender was 192 centimetres tall, healthy and strong. The deceased was thirty-nine years old and 162 centimetres tall. 
     
      
    6   Until the day of the death of the deceased the two men had enjoyed quite a satisfactory working relationship and there was no report of any demonstration of ill feeling between them. Both were even-tempered men. 
     
      
    7   The business opened its doors at about 6am each working day so that it could supply builders who were on their way to work. The offender and the deceased both started work at that time. Not long after work began on 23 April 1998 something happened that caused some tension between the two of them. The offender was attending to one customer on the telephone whilst keeping another waiting at the counter. The deceased thought that approach inappropriate and remonstrated with the offender. He was also apparently irritated because the offender had not yet learned off by heart the code number of an item that the customer required and had to ask about it. Apparently it was necessary to know the code number in order to make a proper record of the sale. The deceased repeatedly spoke to the offender about the matter in the presence of other employees. That was embarrassing and humiliating for the offender and something the deceased said made him think that the deceased would report him to the owner of the business, with the result that he would lose his job. He therefore became very anxious. 
     
      
    8   For an hour or so no words at all passed between the two of them. Then the owner of the business arrived. Some words passed between the owner and the deceased, but as far as the offender could tell, the problem that was concerning him was not mentioned. 
     
      
    9   The deceased’s duties ordinarily required him to call on customers of the business and spend the greater part of the day away from the premises. His vehicle was in or adjacent to the store. The deceased walked from the shop into the store and the accused believed that he was about to leave the premises for a substantial time. It did not occur to him that the matter might not have appeared as serious to the deceased as it did to him. He wanted the matter raised in the presence of the owner so as, perhaps, to justify himself and to learn his fate. Accordingly, he followed the deceased into the store. He did not call out and there was no communication between the two of them, and there is no reason to believe that the deceased knew that the offender was following him. 
     
      
    10   From that point onwards, the finding of the facts on which the Court is obliged to sentence the offender becomes more difficult. 
     
      
    11   There are two versions of what happened after the deceased and the offender entered the store. The offender said in his evidence that as he followed the deceased into the store the deceased, with his back to the offender, picked up a billet of wood, turned and advanced on the offender, raised the wood and brought it down between the offender’s left shoulder and head. The offender caught the wood in his hands and wrested it from the deceased’s grasp. The deceased continued to advance on the offender, however, with his fists clenched and held down near his waist. He fixed the offender with a gaze and the offender thought that the deceased would not stop but would hurt him in some way. In an attempt to stop the progress of the deceased he swung the piece of timber quickly. He did not particularly aim for the head, but the wood connected with the deceased’s head and knocked him to the floor. The offender did not intend to cause the deceased really serious injury. 
     
      
    12   One of the customers of the business whom the offender was attending to, Mr Felix Nguyen, said that he was in the store loading plasterboard on his car when he heard a shout. He looked up and saw the offender walking towards the deceased and the deceased walking backwards away from the offender but facing him. The offender swung the wood in an arc, striking the deceased in the head and knocking him to the floor. 
     
      
    13   There were only three issues for the jury. The first was whether the Crown had proved that the offender did not act in self-defence. The second was whether the offender stuck the deceased with the specific intent necessary for murder and the third was, if the jury were not satisfied that the offender had that intent, whether his act was objectively dangerous. 
     
      
    14   There was no real issue about the third question and it was never submitted that a reasonable person in the position of the offender would not have realised that to swing the wood in the manner he did would not entail the risk of serious injury to the deceased. The jury’s verdict shows that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not act in self-defence but were not satisfied that he intended at least to do the deceased really serious injury. 
     
      
    15   The success of the Crown on the first issue does not necessarily mean that the jury rejected the accused’s account. They could have arrived at their verdict because, for example, they thought that the offender had come under attack but responded disproportionately or struck the deceased after the danger was over. Accordingly, counsel for the offender submitted that the Court should find, in accordance with the offender’s evidence, that the deceased first attacked him. 
     
      
    16   There are two reasons why I am unable to accept that submission. The first is what I consider the improbability that the deceased would act as the offender says he did. Having said nothing to the offender for more than an hour he left the shop and walked, alone as he must have thought, into the store. He had no reason to believe that the offender would follow him. There was no communication between the two at the time. Even if the deceased had heard or suspected that someone was behind him, I think that he would not have acted as he is said to have acted, because the person behind him could have been the owner or another customer of the business. As it was, the owner followed the two within a few seconds and saw the offender strike the deceased. Nothing about the events that took place an hour earlier makes it appear likely to me that the deceased would have struck at the offender, even if he had known that he was behind him. The circumstances suggest that since he had done nothing about the matter for an hour, had not raised it with the owner and was on his way out of the premises he was unlikely to speak to the offender about the matter again, much less attack him without warning. 
     
      
    17   The second reason is that the version contended for is inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Nguyen, which I accept. Mr Nguyen’s evidence was thoroughly tested in cross-examination and although it was shown that he had on occasions given differing accounts on peripheral matters, his evidence on the central event of the attack did not substantially change. He had no interest in the matter, and I regard his evidence as objective and reliable. Of course, he made no claim to having seen how the offender came to have hold of the billet of wood but his description of what he did see is so different from the offender’s version that it casts doubt over all of it. 
     
      
    18   I find that the offender followed the deceased into the store, intending to stop him and raise the matter further. The evidence does not enable me to say whether any further oral exchange took place between the offender and the deceased, but I am satisfied that things must then have happened very quickly. Whatever happened caused the offender to lose his temper, seize a piece of wood which was at hand and strike the deceased without further thought. I think that the offender’s actions can be explained by the intense anxiety which he had had for the past hour, his frustration and his expectation, which must have been firm by then, that he was going to lose his job. I am satisfied that he did not arm himself before he followed the deceased. Pieces of wood such as the one used lay about the store, where they were used to prop and separate sheets of plasterboard. The offender picked one up because it happened to be there. All his action was carried out in a few seconds of stress and inability to control himself. His anger cooled as quickly as it had boiled up and when he saw what he had done he was appalled. He stayed there for a few moments looking at the deceased and then ran away in a panic. 
     
      
    19   The injuries which resulted to the deceased included a comminuted fracture of the left side of the skull and resulting brain damage on that side and on the opposite side. The evidence of Dr Little shows that moderate force would have been needed to inflict such injuries. The wood used by the offender broke as it came into contact with the deceased, but that fact is of little significance since by all accounts the wood was a poor specimen of timber and likely to break if as little as ten kilograms of pressure were placed upon it. 
     
      
    20   Serious though the injuries were, they were not inconsistent with an intent on the part of the offender to do less than really serious bodily injury. I think that he swung the wood out of frustration and in the heat of the moment without intending to do any particular injury and perhaps without even thinking that the wood would strike the deceased’s head. 
     
      
    21   I accept that the offender was a man of prior good character and of gentle disposition and that this offence was entirely out of character. I accept the submission of counsel that if he had had a little more time for contemplation these events would not have happened at all. 
     
      
    22   Consistently with his horror and panic at what he had done, he presented himself to the police station on the following day. That was a measure of his concern about the matter. He has told the Court that he is deeply regretful towards the family of the deceased and is full of remorse. He has prayed for them. I accept what he says about this and I think that the chances of his re-offending are negligible. 
     
      
    23   The offender was arrested when he reported to the police station on the following day and was unable to obtain bail for five weeks. I shall take that period of custody into account. I shall also take into account the effect that the unfortunate history of the trial has had upon the offender. At his first trial the jury were unable to agree and he was put through the suspense of waiting for a second trial. On the second occasion the Court was unable to deal with his case and this has been his second trial and his third fixture for trial. 
     
      
    24   He has never taken alcohol to excess and has not taken illegal drugs. He has been separated from his parents in recent times, since they have moved to live in far north Queensland. He realises that he will have to serve a substantial period of custody and intends to apply to serve his sentence as close as possible to the place where they are living. It will be his first sentence. 
     
      
    25   All these things augur well for his rehabilitation, which I think is well in hand. I think that the young age of the offender and the fact that this is his first prison sentence make it desirable to fix a non-parole period which is less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence I intend to impose. 
     
      
    26   Isaac James Hyatt, I sentence you to imprisonment for five years. The sentence will be taken to have commenced on 2 August 2000 and will expire on 1 August 2005. I fix a non-parole period of two years which will expire on 1 August 2002 and on that day you will be eligible for release on parole.

     SENTENCE 
      
       
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR: Each of Penetito Mika and Siniue Sagato has been indicted for the manslaughter on Samani Amete and each has pleaded guilty to that indictment. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The victim was aged three years seven months at the date of his death on 17 June 1999. The circumstances were unusual, indeed bizarre, and although it will take some time to describe them, I consider it is appropriate to make some extensive reference to the background which led to the crimes. In so doing I will draw very substantially upon the very helpful statement of facts which was prepared by the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor and tendered at the beginning of the proceedings. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The offender, Penetito Mika, is a cousin of Matelina Amete, the mother of the victim. The evidence shows that it was she who caused her son to drown by an unlawful and dangerous act when she forced water into his throat. The reason that she did that was that she had become obsessed with the belief that the child had had his body entered by a demon and what she was doing was by way of exorcism. I should mention that Mrs Amete has been tried on a similar indictment, that is to say for manslaughter, but was found not guilty on the ground of mental illness and she would be dealt with in accordance with appropriate statutory requirements. 
      
       
      
     4     
     All of the persons relevant to the matter originally come from Samoa. All of them have been exposed during their lifetime to intense religious conditioning. It appears from material which has been gathered that a number of the persons involved have during their lifetimes moved from various christian sects into other sects but at the time of the death of the victim, they were members of what is described as the Samoan Assembly of God Church. This group apparently had a meeting place in the western suburbs of Sydney. 
      
       
      
     5     
     It is, I am satisfied, common to the belief of the members of the congregation that the devil exists and that either he or demons allied to him are capable of possession of human beings. I should mention, however, that the evidence shows that the exorcism which was sought to be administered to the child who died was not part of the regular belief of the Assembly of God congregation. 
      
       
      
     6     
     Odd behaviour on the part of Matelina Amete was noticed in about mid June of 1999. Mrs Amate's husband, who was the father of the victim, left at about that time to attend the funeral of his father which was being conducted in New Zealand. He was not present, or indeed even in the country, when the tragedy which led to the death of the little boy took place. In a number of conversations at about this time Mrs Amete made comments about the devil and references to the Bible. One of the recipients of these comments was Penetito Mika, her cousin, and Siniue Sagato who is his wife. 
      
       
      
     7     
     Another person whose existence should be noted is Mrs Ailaoe Lemalu who is generally known as Peka. It will be convenient to refer to her as such. She was a member of the congregation and apparently had a reputation amongst its members for having some skills in relation to spiritual problems. 
      
       
      
     8     
     I interpolate that so far as the church was concerned her official position was no higher in rank than being a Sunday school teacher. However, the growing problem which led to the tragedy began to manifest itself at a service which was being held in a girl guide hall when Mrs Amete indicated a wish for special prayers and blessing and was observed to fall to the floor salivating and vomiting and uttering words which were not able to be understood. She was engaging in strange acts, including scratching at the floor and such words as could be understood seemed to refer to someone or something exercising power over her. 
      
       
      
     9     
     From about 17 June 1999, Mrs Amete started to perform actions, the like of which ultimately led to the death. In fact, she and some of her children were at the home of her cousin and his wife, that is to say the present prisoners. One of the first things that needs to be noted is that Mrs Amete spoke of the children being covered by the blood of Jesus and ordering them to get down on the floor and pray. She rubbed the face of her daughter aged about 14 years in the carpet and forced water upon another girl aged a little younger. This caused difficulty in breathing. Peka was present at this time. Later in the evening the child Deborah was pinioned and water was poured from a bottle into her mouth with her mother repeating phrases to the like of, ""This is the blood of Jesus"" and ""Get that devil out of her"" and rebukings in the name of the founder of Christianity. The child was old enough to struggle away from her choking. She felt she was blacking out. Her mother then apparently began to apply mouth to mouth resuscitation but thereafter she again lay on the floor salivating I gather in a way not dissimilar to what had been seen in the church hall. It can be noted that at about this time the prisoner Sagato's mother, Seilal Sinafea, arrived with a gentleman called Joseph Frost. Mrs Sinafea no doubt wondered what was going on and, amongst other things, she discovered a bucket containing green liquid and chopped leaves. The leaves were ultimately identified as some form of privet. Peka informed her that this concoction was designed to drive away the devil. It appears that Peka had applied it on occasions to the face and body of Mrs Amete for this purpose. 
      
       
      
     10     
     In any event, despite the arrival of Mrs Sinafea and Mr Frost, Mrs Amete gathered everybody into the garage and told them that they should pray. She sent her second daughter, Melissa, one of those I have previously referred to as having gagged upon some water given to her, to get some more water. This was obtained in a large cordial bottle. Mrs Amete began to apply this into the mouth and ears of a child, Simon, and this seemed to restrict his breathing. The prisoners and the woman Peka involved themselves in restraining this child. I am conscious that this particular event is not part of the charge against the prisoners and I am relating it merely as a matter of history leading up to what eventually resulted in death. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The assault upon Simon was terminated when Mr Frost came in and told people to leave the boy alone. However, Mrs Amete commenced similar action upon a child, Josephine, aged two years. This activity was again stopped as a result of intervention by Mr Frost. Peka persuaded Mr Frost and Mrs Sinafea to take those children, that is to say Simon and Josephine, to their home and they left. A prayer meeting of sorts again followed. Eventually, the children of Mrs Amete who were present, and these numbered five, retired for the night into a bedroom. For reasons which are not clear, Mrs Amete then told them that they had to move to another room. The children complied although the prisoner, Mika, told his cousin that she should leave the children alone. The little boy Samani, who was the ultimate victim, then began to yell abuse at his mother in the Samoan language. Apparently this persuaded his mother that he had been possessed by a devil and she took this child into another bedroom saying that, ""He's the only one that's got the devil in him"". Initially, the prisoner Mika said that he would ring the police if she did not stop but later he apparently changed his mind and assisted his cousin in restraining the child. It is hardly difficult to infer that the child was struggling. Melissa was sent to get more water. The child continued to cry and struggle and the prisoner Mika held his mouth open whilst the prisoner Sagato and also the child Deborah held him whilst his mother stood on his chest and poured water into his throat. It was this activity that caused the death. It was observed that a yellow substance issued from the child's mouth and nose. The prisoners have later indicated that they thought that this was an indication that the devil was departing from the body. It is obvious that the child was by now deceased. Although the mother said contradictory things suggesting that the child was now or at least his soul was now with Jesus, but performing other activities such as warming the body and so forth. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The conduct of the prisoners which gives rise to their liability for the crime to which they have pleaded guilty is that which I have just described, namely their holding the child whilst the mother poured the water for the purpose of this bizarre form of exorcism. It is not necessary to describe all the detail whereby eventually police came to the premises where the child's body remained and ultimately the whole group went to Bankstown Police Station. 
      
       
      
     13     
     Each of the prisoners was interviewed and initially the prisoner, Sagato, admitted that she was present during the incidents concerning Deborah, Melissa, Simon and Josephine but did not admit any involvement in her part. She admitted holding Samani's hand whilst he was struggling. The prisoner Mika admitted that he had helped Mrs Amete pour water down the throat of Samani by holding his mouth open, although he indicated that he had first refused to help.  
      
       
      
     14     
     As I have indicated, the principal actor in this tragedy was undoubtedly the victim's mother and she has been found not guilty of manslaughter on the ground of mental illness. The person Peka, whom I consider likely to have made a significant contribution towards the notions which led to the tragedy, was not personally present when the activity which resulted in death took place. I have noted that she was ordered to perform 150 hours of community service for her part in the assaults upon the children Deborah, Simon and Josephine. 
      
       
      
     15     
     Each of the prisoners comes before the Court without any prior conviction. They are the parents of four children of their own. I have a number of reports prepared by Dr Roberts, a consultant psychiatrist. These set out some matters of history and some views of Dr Roberts which are somewhat scantily referenced by way of authority. Nevertheless, I think it is a conclusion which I would share that each of the prisoners at the time had a sincere belief in the existence of demons and although they might have had some reservations about what was being done to exorcise considered possession, they nevertheless went along with it. That they did so I think was a result of a combination of lifetimes of conditioning to a variety of beliefs, their relatively unsophisticated background and their holding over a long period of time beliefs that can only be described as relatively primitive. Apart from the current matters, as their absence of prior conviction shows, they are persons of good repute within the community. 
      
       
      
     16     
     I have the benefit of two pre-sentence reports, one in respect of each prisoner. In relation to the prisoner Mika, the officer reported that the impression he gained of Mr Mika was that he was a good hearted man of average intelligence with strong but simplistic religious beliefs, particularly about the way that evil forces penetrate and influence human beings. The officer noted that the prisoner was involved in a church which seemed to emphasise spiritual phenomena and that it also preserved Samoan culture and therefore might be adjudged fairly insular and this probably caused difficulty in enabling him to deal effectively with the stresses and tensions of modern industrialised society. Nevertheless, the officer was able to report that the death of the child has affected him profoundly and that he seems anxious to revise his views. 
      
       
      
     17     
     In relation to the prisoner Sagato, the officer reported that it appeared that Ms Sagato's actions were carried out in the absence of malice and in a genuine belief that the victim was possessed by evil spirits. The officer further reported that she had shown remorse for her actions and now realised the inappropriateness of her behaviour. She realised the damage caused by the commission of the offence and the impact this has had on the family's future. 
      
       
      
     18     
     In relation to both the prisoners, it has been noted that they are deficient to a considerable degree in parenting skills and steps have been taken to have them educated in that regard. For that reason they are presently deprived of immediate custody of their older children, although they have custody of a baby born since the events which bring them before the Court. 
      
       
      
     19     
     The prisoner Mika has been employed as a full-time casual factory operator for some 15 months. His employer reports that he has proven to be an excellent worker and as long as there is work available, his employer will make use of his services. As I understand the letter, there is no suggestion that his employment is likely to be terminated. 
      
       
      
     20     
     Thus I turn lastly to what should be done in relation to these matters. The death of a human being is always a matter of seriousness. It is an aggravating matter when the victim is a defenceless child. No civilised community can tolerate fanatical beliefs, whether based upon religion or more accurately upon misinterpretation and misapplication of religion, and the prisoners should understand that the matter cannot be dealt with other than in the context of its seriousness. 
      
       
      
     21     
     Mr Newport of Queen's Counsel, the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, in his helpful presentation of this matter before the Court has drawn my attention to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Victoria in  
     R v Vollmer & Ors 
      1996 1 VR 95. That was a case where a number of people attempted to perform an exorcism upon a victim, in this case by applying force to a chest and throat and holding the tongue down rather than the administration of liquid. A number of people were dealt with at first instance in that case for their involvement and it suffices to observe that as nearly as possible as one can draw an analogy with the responsibility of these prisoners for comparison purposes with those involved in that case, the offenders there were sentenced to imprisonment which was either wholly or substantially suspended. 
      
       
      
     22     
     It was submitted by the Crown that the seriousness of these offences, that is to say the offence on the part of each prisoner, was such that it should be reflected by nothing less than the imposition of a sentence of full-time custody but that the Crown would not oppose an order for suspension of that sentence. 
      
       
      
     23     
     I have given careful consideration to that submission which I have been able to anticipate, given the reference to the case of Vollmer, and I have reached the conclusion that in all the circumstances that is the appropriate course to take. 
      
       
      
     24     
     In accordance with the suggestion of the Probation Officer, I propose to include a condition concerning the continued education and skills of parenting of the prisoners. I propose to impose identical sentences but I should do so individually. 
      
       
      
     25     
     Penetito Mika, for the manslaughter of Samani Amete, you are sentenced to two years imprisonment. I specify no non parole period as I intend to suspend that sentence for the full term of two years. I order the sentence to be suspended for the period of two years. I further order that the prisoner be released from custody on condition that he enters a good behaviour bond for a term of two years from today upon the following conditions: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) that he will appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during those two years;

         (3) that he will inform the Registrar of the Supreme Court of any change in his residential address; and 
         
        
        
         
          
         (4) that he will attend as directed at the Child Protection Family Services or any alternative counselling service to which he may be directed for the purpose of addressing parenting skills.

     Siniue Sagato, for the manslaughter of Samani Amete you are sentenced to two years imprisonment. I specify no non parole period as I intend to suspend the sentence for the full term of two years. Accordingly, I order the sentence to be suspended for two years. I further order that you be released from custody on condition that you enter a good behaviour bond for a term of two years from today upon the following conditions:

         (2) that you will be of good behaviour; 
         
        
        
         
          
         (3) that you will inform the Registrar of the Supreme Court of any change in your residential address; and

       REGINA v PL 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: This matter, being heard under the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, s11 of that Act applies, which relates to the non-publication of the name, not only of the young person before the Court, but other young people. People who are not involved in the proceedings, with the exception of course of members of the press, should not remain in the Court.  
     
      
    2    On 30 April 1999, the young person, who I shall refer to by his initials, PL, was committed to this Court together with his co-accused, for trial on a number of serious offences, including murder and robbery in company. A trial date was fixed for 7 August 2000, but was vacated after PL indicated that he wished to change his plea to guilty of robbery in company. 
     
      
    3    On 22 June 2000, the Crown presented an indictment charging PL with one count of robbery in company, contrary to s99(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (“the Act”).  
     
      
    4    On 11 January 1999, at Berkeley, in the State of New South Wales, whilst in the company of two other young persons and Johnathon Whitfield, PL was charged with robbing Ralph Mason of one compact disc player and one mobile phone, both of which were the property of Ralph Mason.  
     
      
    5    PL pleaded guilty to that charge, and the matter was stood over to 4 August 2000 for sentence, and in turn to today for submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    6    The facts are that on 11 January 1999, at 12.45 am, a neighbour of Ralph Mason, Mr Galea, was watching television at his home in Berkeley Street, Berkeley, and heard his dog bark and a person screaming for help. Mr Galea went to his front window and looked towards the front yard of the neighbour's premises. Mr Galea noticed that a person was standing near the white picket fence that divided the two properties, and that that person was waving an arm. That person then moved from Mr Galea's line of vision, and Mr Galea returned to watching television, believing that it was just the local kids playing around. 
     
      
    7    As Mr Galea walked towards the back of his house to resume watching television, he noticed that another neighbour had a light on in the backyard. Mr Galea then walked outside and had a short conversation with his neighbour, and later returned to watching television. 
     
      
    8    As he went back into his house, Mr. Galea went into the laundry area which looks out on to the deceased's property. Mr Galea looked out the window, and observed someone walking quickly inside the deceased's premises next door, leap forward on to something and then take a couple of steps forward and fall to the floor. Mr Galea contacted the police and then returned to his laundry window, where he could still see someone on the floor at the deceased's premises. 
     
      
    9    Shortly after 1am, police officers attended 29 Berkeley Road, Berkeley. As they approached the front door of the house, a sensor light came on and they observed a trail of blood on the concrete leading to the front door. The front screen door was buckled. At the rear of the house, police found bloodstains on the carpet. The deceased was lying on the floor beside a lounge. A telephone cord stretched from the wall to the deceased, with the handset under the deceased. Bloodstains on the carpet were present in the room adjacent to the front door, and the pot-plant was knocked over. 
     
      
    10    The deceased was conveyed to Wollongong Hospital, where a post-mortem examination was conducted. The examination revealed two stab wounds in the deceased's back, one penetrating the aorta, inferior vena cava and the kidney. There were also some additional head injuries, causing a fracture to the skull. 
     
      
    11    On 16 January 1999, PL was arrested and taken to Warilla Police Station, where he was questioned. During an electronically recorded police interview, PL admitted to being at the scene of the murder with three other youths. PL said that Johnathon Whitfield had kicked the screen door, and that Whitfield had forced his way into the premises, and that he was followed by the other two. PL said that one of the other youths took a metal pole from him, and gave the PL a knife. PL admitted during the interview that he knew who stabbed the deceased. PL said that Whitfield said- after running away from the premises and catching up with the other youths- ""I stabbed him"", whilst Whitfield was washing the blood off. 
     
      
    12    PL admitted during the interview that some pre-planning had been discussed concerning the incident. They had chosen the deceased's premises to rob because he was a rich man, and that they were going to ""tie the bloke up and just keep all the stuff"". PL claimed that there had been no talk of hurting the deceased. 
     
      
    13    PL was born on 2 May 1986. He was twelve years of age when he was involved in this offence. It is, therefore, necessary to have regard to the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 in imposing sentence. 
     
      
    14    Part 2 Div 4 of that Act, which deals with penalties imposed, provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
          
        Application 
         
          
         
         16. This Division applies to a person - 
         
          
         
          
          (a) who has pleaded guilty to an indictable offence in, or has been found guilty or convicted of an indictable offence by, a court other than the Children's Court; 
           
          (b) who was a child when the offence was committed; and 
           
          (c) who was under the age of twenty-one years when charged before  
           
          the court with the offence."" 
           
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    15    If the conviction was for a ""serious indictable offence"", then the matter must be dealt with according to law. This is not a serious indictable offence and, therefore, the Court may deal with the offender according to law, or in accordance with Div 4 Pt 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. 
     
      
    16    The offence of robbery in company, contrary to s97 of the Act, carries a penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. It is, therefore, not a serious indictable offence for the purposes of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act.  
     
      
    17    In determining whether a sentencing judge deals with an offender according to law or according to the less harsh regime of the Children's Court, it has been held in R v R (1993) 71 A Crim R 95, a decision of Hunt CJ at CL at 98-99, that some of the matters to be taken into account are the nature of the particular offence for which the offender is standing for sentence, the age and maturity of that offender, both at the time of the offence and when standing for sentence, and the nature of the penalty which would be appropriate in the circumstances. 
     
      
    18    The prisoner was born in Australia, and is the only son of his mother. PL’s mother, together with her husband, had two other children. It is not clear whether PL’s natural father is the same father of the other two children. 
     
      
    19    In December last year, PL’s father and mother separated, causing the family to each go their own separate ways. The father and his two daughters went to New Zealand, and PL and his mother stayed in Australia. Whilst the elder daughter now lives with her father, the younger daughter resides with some relatives. There is no contact between the children any more. Prior to the separation, they were an apparently close family with regular church and community involvement. 
     
      
    20    In 1989, PL’s father was seriously injured after he fell under a train. The accident left him with a number of serious health problems, and he was incapacitated and required regular treatment and operations. As a result, the family suffered some financial hardship, and they became financially dependent on welfare assistance and had to live quite frugally. 
     
      
    21    In May 2000, PL’s father received a large financial compensation settlement, and the family were able to buy a home in Marrickville. The father then returned to Tonga to establish a small business, and has built a home for him and his daughter there. PL’s father has returned to Australia on one occasion since he left for Tonga, to demand that PL's mother release to him the remainder of the compensation pay-out. When she refused to release the money, she was physically assaulted, which forced her to obtain an Apprehended Violence Order against him. PL’s father then removed the two daughters from Australia against her wishes.  
     
      
    22    As a result of the separation, PL’s mother has been absent from the family home for a number of extended periods. Each time she has had to leave, PL was placed under the supervision and care of his uncle, who resides at the family home at Marrickville. 
     
      
    23    To add to this disharmony, in July 2000 PL’s mother suffered a stroke that has left her with some facial paralysis. She is unable to work and cannot afford to pay the bills. 
     
      
    24    At the time of the offence, the PL was living in the family home and attending Year Seven at Marrickville High School. It appears that PL was not the greatest model student, and would often find himself in fights with other students. He found that there was racial discrimination against him, which tended to cause him to be friendly with older youths of Islander origin. 
     
      
    25    He currently attends Edgeware School at Dulwich Hill, which is a school for youths with emotional and behavioural problems. Initially, he attended lessons on a one-on-one basis, but now he is in a classroom with other students. 
     
      
    26    It has been conceded by the Crown that the case against Whitfield would be a weak case without the evidence of PL. The evidence before me is that PL gave a complete and truthful account to the police. That was the evidence of Det. Snr. Const. Atlas. 
     
      
    27    PL was in custody for some 177 days on this charge until bail was granted and, although it was on a number of relatively minor matters committed earlier and unrelated to this offence, he has, of course, spent just over a month in custody since he was originally released. Those matters do not, however, concern this Court. It is, however, of some consequence that he has had a further period in custody, and understands the nature of that custody. 
     
      
    28    Offences such as robbery in company, for adults, have been the subject of a guideline judgment emphasising the seriousness of the offence but, of course, his youth means that he is not subject to that regime. I merely note that the seriousness of this offence has been underlined by that guideline judgment. He did enter a plea at the earliest opportunity, and is entitled, for his actions since he was apprehended, on the authority of R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, to a significant reduction as a matter of the policy of the law. 
     
      
    29    It is, in the circumstances of the case, appropriate that PL be dealt with in accordance with Div 4 Pt 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. 
     
      
    30    In considering the matters which the Court must take into account, I have received a very helpful report from Louise Kemp, who is with the Department of Juvenile Justice and, of course, a School Report, from which I have been able to determine the extent of the racism that PL had demonstrated to him, and his anger and sense of injustice. It was difficult to find a school that accepted PL, in the light of the charges which he then faced, one of which was of a more serious nature in respect of which he is no longer the subject of proceedings. 
     
      
    31    The assessment of PL is that Miss Kemp found him to be extremely honest. He was clearly young and lacked confidence and self-esteem during the first contact. He has, because of his concern about diabetes, undertaken a weight loss and exercise programme, which has been very successful, and is evidence of part of his maturing process.  
     
      
    32    His cultural background and youth has meant that his verbal skills are not highly developed, but he has co-operated in the counselling process. He has been punctual attending appointments, something not common with people of his age. He has had a series of crises with which he has coped. 
     
      
    33    The opinion of Miss Kemp, which I accept, is that there has been a high degree of turn-around by PL. He is performing well at school. He is regularly attending counselling. I accept that there has been a high level of rehabilitation which the Court is bound to take into account. He has demonstrated his ability and willingness to comply with stringent supervisory requirements, and he would gain from supervision. 
     
      
    34    It seems to me, in the circumstances, that the appropriate order which the Court should make is not that PL should serve a custodial sentence, but that he should be released on probation on conditions for a period of two years. 
     
      
    35    The conditions that I would impose are: that PL subject himself to the guidance of the Juvenile Justice Department, and obey that department’s reasonable guidance and directions; that he is to reside with his mother, and in the event of his mother having to go overseas, that he be placed in the care of another responsible adult person nominated by his mother. He is also to continue his present schooling or such other schooling as may be considered appropriate depending on his state of development. He is not to commit any further criminal offences, and is to keep the peace.  
     
      
    36    I, therefore, make that probation order and impose those conditions on the order. 
     
      
    37    HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that? 
     
      
    38    PL: Yes. 
     
      
    39    HIS HONOUR: You accept the conditions that I have laid out? 
     
      
    40    PL: Yes. 
     
      
    41    HIS HONOUR: Good luck with your schooling and good luck with the next few years ahead. 
     
      
    42    PL: Thank you.

    2   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant for leave to appeal against sentence was convicted on one count of, without reasonable excuse, attempting to obtain possession of prohibited import to which s.233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) applied, that is, a quantity of cocaine which had been imported into Australia in contravention of the Act, being not less than the trafficable quantity. In respect of that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for six years with an non-parole period of three years to commence on 8 September 1999 and pre-sentence custody was taken into account. 
    3   The circumstances of the offence were set out in an agreed statement of facts to which the learned sentencing judge had reference. That agreed statement of facts referred to the arrival of a courier, Anita Adomaa, into Australia carrying a Johnsons baby powder canister containing the cocaine. The gross weight of the powder and container was recorded as approximately 624 grams. The consequent analysis of the powder confirmed the presence of cocaine weighing 156 grams pure weight. She was apprehended by police and assisted them. In particular, having been provided with a substitute canister of baby powder, she arranged for the attendance of the applicant at motel premises and a transaction then ensued which his Honour set forth in his remarks on sentence. 
    4   There was discussion as to how much the applicant had brought with him to pay for the drug and his ability to test the drug to ensure that it was of the requisite kind and quality. Upon attempting to test it he noted that it was talcum powder, he noted also that the canister was made in Australia. He left the room and was subsequently arrested. Initially, he declined to have any conversation as to the matter with police but in due course when the matter came forward before his Honour he relied upon his admission to police of a long term addiction to heroin and also being a heavy steroid user. His Honour was also referred to the applicant's prior convictions. 
    5   The applicant pleaded guilty before his Honour and the matter went forward on the basis that it was necessary for his Honour, who had sentenced Adomaa, the courier, to determine the applicant's role as relevant to the sentence that his Honour would impose. 
    6   The applicant gave evidence on this and his Honour made the following findings:- 
     
      
       
       ""I have taken into account all those things the prisoner told the court in evidence. Accepting as I do that what he said is true, I have to say that this case assumes a somewhat different aspect than it would otherwise have done. 
       
      
      
       
       It turns out that it is not by design that the prisoner was part of this group of importers of illicit drugs, but rather an addict who happened to be in the premises of a person who was perhaps the principal or co-principal in this enterprise. I accept that he was at those premises of this person, a female dealer and importer, fortuitously and overheard parts of telephone conversations when she was talking about the importation to others. Unfortunately for him, he seized only too readily the opportunity offered to him by this person to become an integral player in this scenario. 
       
      
      
       
       In the short term, his opportunistic actions had unfortunate results for him, leading to his arrest."" 
       
      
    7   His Honour went on:- 
     
      
       
       ""Most of what I have said so far has had to do with the way the prisoner became involved in this matter. Although it may not be as serious for him if he had been one of the plotters who had played a part in the originating of this importation, it is serious enough. The courts have said time and again that without people like the prisoner, crimes like this could not be committed."" 
       
      
    8   His Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
       ""In the case of  
       Regina v. Maunchukingkan 
        (1990) 5 A. Crim. R. 247, it was said that couriers and intermediaries must expect substantial sentences. This prisoner was an intermediary; an opportunist rather than an organiser, but an intermediary, nonetheless. I have already set out my reasons for concluding that he must be sentenced more heavily than the courier."" 
       
      
    9   His Honour dealt with submissions that the prisoner was less culpable than the courier holding that in his view this prisoner was more culpable than the courier objectively and subjectively, but only marginally. 
    10   The sentence his Honour passed on the courier was subject to a reduction of 50% for co-operation and assistance. The sentence his Honour passed upon this applicant almost precisely corresponded in extent to what he would have passed on the courier except for that reduction for assistance. 
    11   The short point taken on this application is that his Honour failed to appreciate that the role of the applicant was of less culpability than that of the courier or at least no worse than that of the courier. It has been submitted that it is not appropriate to deal with the matter by a labelling or categorisation exercise particularly in the light of what had been said by the High Court in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Olbrich (1999) 108 A. Crim. R. 465. What was necessary to consider was the factual role adopted by the individual in the particular transaction. 
    12   It appears to me that his Honour took exactly this approach when he concluded that the applicant ""seized only too readily the opportunities offered to him by this person to become an integral player in this scenario"". 
    13   Accepting what had been put on his behalf that this was the opportunistic involvement of a drug affected junky in performing a delivery man role for the purpose of seeking to obtain some of the drug, it was a voluntary assumption of an essential and integral role in the importation into Australia of the proscribed substance and an opportunistic involvement in a most serious crime. 
    14   Having regard to all those matters and in particular to the requirement in s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that the court shall dismiss the appeal unless it is of the opinion that some other sentence, in this case less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed, I am of the view that the appeal cannot succeed. In those circumstances and since the substantial question of role has been raised and that matter at least fully argued, I am of the view leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. 
    15   BEAZLEY, JA: I agree. 
    16   WOOD, CJ at CL: I also agree. 
    17   BEAZLEY, JA: The order of the court is as proposed by Justice Greg James.

     REGINA v DAVID MIN LIN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1    BEAZLEY JA: On 27 September 1999 Mr David Min Lin pleaded guilty to a charge of a conspiracy to commit an offence under section 86(1A) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The maximum penalty for the offence prescribed at that time was two years and/or a fine of $13,200.  
     
      
    2    On 28 September 1999 Sides DCJ sentenced Mr Lin to twelve months' imprisonment to commence on 28 September 1999. His Honour directed Mr Lin was to be released after the expiration of eight months of his sentence on recognisance in a sum of $200 to be of good behaviour for a period of two years from the date of his release. 
     
      
    3    The applicant was one of a number of people who were arrested following an unsuccessful attempt to smuggle sixty-nine Chinese illegal immigrants into Australia in May 1999. These persons had travelled to Australia on a vessel called the ‘Ka Yuen’ pursuant to arrangements which had been put in place by a criminal syndicate in Hong Kong. Once in Australian waters off the local Sydney coast it was planned to bring these persons ashore in a smaller fast speed boat. A boat called the ‘Gruesome’ was purchased for that purpose. A number of local Sydney residents all of Chinese origin were found to be involved in the conspiracy to bring the illegal immigrants into Australia. 
     
      
    4    The main local organiser was identified as a Mr Xin Chen (Chen). Mr Lin was introduced into the conspiracy by Chen on 8 May 1999. By that time the conspiracy was well advanced both at the Hong Kong and Australian end, but there were still major arrangements which needed to be made in Australia to bring the matter to fruition. 
     
      
    5    His Honour found, and there has been no contest, that Mr Lin's involvement, which was solely at the Australian end, was as follows. He had visited a number of jetties and wharves in the Sydney area inspecting them for the purposes of launching the boat ‘Gruesome’ for bringing the illegal immigrants ashore. He had attended to the rental of a number of vehicles including a Nissan Patrol, two Toyota Taragoes and a Toyota Mini-Bus. Together with Chen had organised others to assist in the driving of the vehicles. He had made arrangements for the rental of an additional house. He purchased three maps at the request or instruction of Chen. He had also been with Chen and assisted in identifying appropriate rental property. He assisted with the launch of the ‘Gruesome’ and he in fact boarded that boat. After the ‘Gruesome’ developed engine troubles and wasn't able to be used to bring the illegal immigrants ashore as had been planned, he took steps to have the boat repaired. These steps included making enquiries to locate a mechanic and he also went to collect a smaller boat which was owned by Chen which was to be used in the event that the ‘Gruesome’ could not be repaired. He expended in excess of $2000 of his own money in various purchases associated with the conspiracy and in the rental of the vehicles. 
     
      
    6    His Honour the sentencing Judge considered that these matters indicated that Mr Lin’s “was a very active role”. His Honour noted that there was no evidence that he was a principal or a financier of the conspiracy. Nonetheless, he observed that the success of this enterprise depended upon the persons on the ship being brought ashore very quickly and once ashore being moved away from the landing point. His Honour found “this was particularly crucial” as the illegal immigrants were to be brought ashore in a densely populated area. His Honour concluded that Mr Lin “was thus an important cog in the wheel of this venture and his role was important to the overall success of the venture”. His Honour further found that the reason for his involvement in the conspiracy was financial gain. He was to have received $3000 as well as be refunded the money he had himself expended. 
     
      
    7    His Honour took into account a number of factors in determining what was the appropriate sentence to impose. He made reference to his early admissions, his early plea of guilty and his early offer to assist authorities. He considered all of these matters indicated a strong case of contrition. However, later in his remarks on sentence, he expressed his concern that Mr Lin had not appreciated the enormity of his crime. He considered the attempts Mr Lin made during the course of his evidence to minimise his involvement demonstrated that. His Honour thought Mr Lin lacked insight into the real nature of his participation. He thought that for that reason there was a necessity to apply personal deterrence in the matter. He also considered the general deterrence was an important consideration. 
     
      
    8    In relation to the plea of guilty his Honour noted that it was clear that the prosecution had a strong case in any event. It was also clear that the assistance offered and the assistance which was promised, although real, would be of limited value having regard to the extent of the evidence which was already in the hands of the investigating police. If anything, it would seem that the assistance which he could provide was of a corroborative nature. 
     
      
    9    His Honour noted that this was a very serious offence and that he considered Mr Lin's involvement fell into the worst type of case, notwithstanding that he was not at the top of the hierarchy of those involved. His Honour believed that a custodial sentence needed to be imposed and that to do otherwise would be an affront to community standards. He took into account Mr Lin’s prior good character and other personal circumstances which he noted would invite the sympathy of a Court. 
     
      
    10    It is submitted on behalf of Mr Lin that the trial Judge fell into error in the sentencing process in a number of respects. First, it was submitted that his Honour was influenced by the fact that the sentence for this particular offence has been increased substantially to a maximum sentence of ten years and that in engaging in the sentencing process his Honour had his mind on that maximum penalty rather than the penalty which was relevant at the time. Although there was minimal reference made during the course of oral submissions to the increase in the penalty and although the Crown referred to this in their written submissions, there is no reference whatsoever to it in his remarks on sentence, nor is there any reference in the discussion between his Honour and counsel which would indicate that his Honour had any regard to other than what was the penalty at this time. I consider that there is no force in the submission put forward. 
     
      
    11    It was next submitted that his Honour erred in the manner in which he applied the provisions of s 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth). That section provides that if a Federal sentence is to be served in a prison of a State where State sentences are not subject to remission or reduction then the Court imposing the sentence must take that fact into account in determining the length of the sentence and must adjust the sentence accordingly. 
     
      
    12    The complaint which is made here is not that s 16G was ignored by his Honour but that it was applied wrongly by his Honour. It is unclear from his Honour's remarks on sentence whether, in determining the appropriate sentence which could be imposed, he took into account the assistance which had been provided and which had been undertaken to be provided to the authorities together with the other matters which were relevant here under s 16A(2) and then applied section 16G, or whether he engaged in the reverse process. If it was the latter, his Honour was in error, as has been said consistently by the Court in dealing with this particular section (see for example R v Budiman (1998) 102 A Crim R 411 at 415; R v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 especially at 384 to 385; and R v Lee [1998] 1 ER 637 at 642). 
     
      
    13    I think it is better to proceed on the basis that his Honour did err in the manner in which he applied s 16G and, therefore, I consider that leave to appeal should be granted. However, s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW) provides that on an appeal against sentence, unless the Court is of the opinion that some other sentence other than that imposed by the sentencing Judge should have been imposed, the Court on appeal should dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    14    In my opinion the sentence imposed by his Honour having regard to the seriousness of the offence, the extent of criminality of Mr Lin, even taking into account the assistance to authorities and the relevant matters under s 16A(2) was appropriate and ought not to be interfered with. In arriving at this view, I have had regard to the submission that Mr Lin's co-offender Chen received a sentence of fifteen months with a period of imprisonment of twelve months to be served and that Chen was more extensively involved and at a higher level in the hierarchy and that having regard to the principles of parity Mr Lin's sentence was disproportionate. I do not agree. There is not in fact any disparity. Mr Lin received approximately two-thirds of Chen's sentence and, as I have indicated, the sentence which was imposed by the sentencing Judge here was, in my view, an appropriate one. 
     
      
    15    It was also suggested that this was an appropriate case for periodic detention and that his Honour erred in failing to permit a pre-sentence report to be obtained, that being a pre-requisite to a sentence of periodic detention. It will be obvious from what I have already said that I do not consider that this was a case appropriate for periodic detention. It was a serious crime. There was a high level of involvement by Mr Lin. It was a case that called for a custodial sentence and I consider that the custodial sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge was an appropriate one. I therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    16    WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. I only wish to add that s 16G of the Crimes Act requires that the Court make an adjustment to the sentence, in the particular case before it, as is appropriate for that case, having regard to the fact that the offender will serve the sentence imposed in a State which does not provide for remissions. 
     
      
    17    Two observations may be made in this regard. First, while it has been customary to reduce the sentence otherwise appropriate by a factor of approximately one-third, there is no rule of law to the effect that this is to be the adjustment to be made automatically in every case (see R v Beeforth unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 November 1995). Secondly, it is inappropriate to follow the course, which appears to me to have been advanced in this case, requiring the sentencing Court to give cumulative and separate credit for each and every one of the mitigating circumstances which may be present. Otherwise this risks producing a sentence which lacks proportionality to the total criminality involved. In many instances those circumstances of a mitigating kind do overlap and this Court has made it plain that it is inappropriate to simply accumulate them separately. 
     
      
    18    Having regard to the matters identified by the presiding Judge I am not persuaded, if any error was in fact disclosed by the approach taken by his Honour, that the sentence which could have been imposed would have been other than that in fact imposed. The objective criminality involved in large scale people smuggling, and the risks of hardship and exposure to extortion associated with that activity are both evident and significant. The offence is such that a real element of deterrence is required both personally and generally. 
     
      
    19    I am satisfied in this case that the criminality of the applicant was extensive and that the sentence imposed below was entirely appropriate. 
     
      
    20    I would agree while leave to appeal should be granted the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    21    GREG JAMES J: I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding Judge. I agree with the reasons she has given. I agree with the remarks made by the Chief Judge at Common Law. 
     
      
    22    BEAZLEY JA: The orders which the Court makes are as follows: 
     
      
      (i) Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
      (ii) The appeal is dismissed. 
       
      (iii) Confirm the sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge and note that the appellant is eligible to be released six months less two days from today having already served two months and two days of the custodial portion of the sentence.

     REGINA v AN VAN NGUYEN 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
       
      
    2   GREG JAMES J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3   KIRBY J: Mr An Van Nguyen was charged, jointly with Mr Phuong Van Nguyen, in having, on 23 September 1998, supplied heroin (s25(a) and s29(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985). 
     
      
    4   Mr An Van Nguyen was convicted (as was Mr Phuong Van Nguyen). An appeal was lodged against that conviction, but abandoned. Mr An Van Nguyen seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    5   The sentence imposed by the trial Judge, Acting Judge Stewart, was eight years penal servitude. His Honour found no special circumstances. He fixed a minimum term of six years, and an additional term of two years. He ordered the term to commence on the day Mr An Van Nguyen went into custody (10 August 1999). 
     
      
    6   The Crown acknowledges error on the part of the sentencing Judge. His Honour referred to the maximum penalty in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The maximum penalty under the Act is 25 years imprisonment or penal servitude and/or two thousand penalty units.” 
        
       
      
    7   The maximum penalty is in fact 15 years. 
     
      
    8   The Crown provided material from the Judicial Commission, as well as a precis of cases involving the supply of similar amounts of heroin. Making all appropriate assumptions, the range of sentence suggested by this material was between three and four years. It is plain, therefore, that his Honour’s error had an effect upon the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    9   As conceded by the Crown, re-sentencing is therefore required. I should, in these circumstances, briefly refer to the evidence. Mr An Van Nguyen (the applicant) was the brother-in-law of his co-accused, Mr Phuong Van Nguyen. Mr Phuong Van Nguyen was married to the applicant’s sister. On the Crown case, the applicant and his brother-in-law, in September 1998, established a business supplying heroin. They did so from premises at Frederick Street, St Peters. One witness gave evidence that he had been approached by the applicant, and offered heroin. The availability of that drug from these premises soon spread by word of mouth. 
     
      
    10   On 23 September 1998, the police obtained a warrant to search the premises. An amount of 6.7 grams of heroin was found concealed in a number of locations. The paraphernalia associated with the supply of drugs was also found. It included aluminium foil cut into small sections, scissors, and water-tight balloons. Whilst the search was under way, a number of individuals came to the premises. They told police that their purpose was to purchase heroin (cf R v Firman (1989) 52 SASR 391). 
     
      
    11   The applicant was born on 15 June 1968. He is 32 years old. He has been in Australia for about ten years. He had two minor convictions soon after his arrival which the sentencing Judge, Acting Judge Stewart, was prepared to disregard. I, too, will approach the matter upon the basis that the applicant is a person with no relevant convictions. He is a married man. He has three young children, aged ten years, eight years and almost one year. 
     
      
    12   He was, at the time of these events, unemployed. Unquestionably, the circumstances in which he lived after his arrival in Australia were difficult. He shared accommodation with a number of families, who were related to either his wife or himself. He was said to be a good husband, and to attend church regularly. 
     
      
    13   Mr Odgers, appearing for the applicant, urged a finding of special circumstances, in terms of s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999. That section, on his argument, gives greater emphasis to rehabilitation than the approach required under s5(2) of the Sentencing Act, 1989, which the new Act replaced. The applicant has, since his incarceration, seriously pursued activities which will assist in his rehabilitation. He has completed a number of courses. They include Oral Communication, Word Processing, and Leatherwork. The abandonment of his appeal against conviction was, according to his Counsel, consistent with an acknowledgment of responsibility, which is fundamental to rehabilitation. 
     
      
    14   Rehabilitation is, of course, an important consideration. The applicant’s efforts in making good use of his time in prison are a matter to his credit. However, rehabilitation is but one of the objectives which the sentence should serve. The applicant’s crime was serious. His motive was purely commercial. He was not an addict, and nor was his brother-in-law. In these circumstances, deterrence, both general and personal, must figure prominently in any sentence imposed. 
     
      
    15   Like the trial Judge, I do not believe that there are special circumstances. In my view the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for three years and eight months, with a non parole period of two years and nine months. 
     
      
    16   I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The applicant should be given leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2. The appeal against sentence should be allowed, and the sentence quashed. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof, the applicant should be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 3 years and 8 months, commencing on 10 August 1999, and expiring on 9 April 2003. There should be a non parole period of 2 years and 9 months, commencing on 10 August 1999 and concluding on 9 May 2002. On the 10 May 2002 Mr An Van Nguyen will be eligible for parole.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2   GREG JAMES J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3   KIRBY J: Phuong Van Nguyen and An Van Nguyen were charged that on 23 September 1998 at St Peters they supplied a prohibited drug, heroin (s25(1) and s29(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985). 
     
      
    4   The trial proceeded before Acting Judge Stewart and a jury. Both accused were found guilty. Mr Phuong Van Nguyen (the appellant) appeals against his conviction. He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      The Background 
       
      
    5   On 23 September 1998, the police obtained a warrant to search premises at 91 Frederick Street, St Peters. A video was made of the search as it was undertaken. After the police arrived, there was some delay before the door was opened. The only occupants of the premises were Mr An Van Nguyen and Mr Phuong Van Nguyen. The house itself was bare. There were no furnishings, apart from a bed roll, a TV and a video. There were a few pots and pans in the kitchen, and a refrigerator. There was nothing upstairs. There were no clothes. There were none of the accompaniments of ordinary living. There was nothing to suggest the presence of a woman and a young child (a matter relevant to the account later given by the appellant). 
     
      
    6   A number of items were discovered in the course of the search. They were consistent with the operation of a business supplying heroin. At the rear of the premises, there was a plastic bottle. The bottle contained five pieces of white rock-like substance, later identified as heroin. The bottle was concealed beneath pebbles. 
     
      
    7   Further, a hole had been cut into a pipe beneath the kitchen sink. The pipe led to a drain. Within the drain, and sealed to prevent the intrusion of water, the police found more heroin. It was packaged in silver foil and balloons. The balloons had been cut, and each end tied with a knot. The Crown invited two inferences. First, that the hole in the pipe had been cut to enable the rapid disposal of heroin in the event of a search. Water from the kitchen tap pushed the watertight balloons into a sump from which they could later be retrieved. Secondly, the delay in opening the door to the police was used to flush the heroin into the sump. 
     
      
    8   The search also revealed the paraphernalia associated with the sale of drugs. On top of the refrigerator there was aluminium foil. A small rectangular section had been cut from the foil. There was a pair of scissors. There were small squares of aluminium foil within a kitchen cupboard. There was a box of balloons, as well as a syringe. Within a vacuum cleaner, there were the off-cuts of balloons. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    9   The Crown was required to deal with two issues. First, the charge was that the two accused had supplied heroin on a particular day (23 September 1998). Fundamental to that charge was that the heroin found at the premises, 91 Frederick Street, was in the joint possession of the two accused. Secondly, the Crown was obliged to demonstrate that the heroin was available for supply. This was not a case where the heroin found at the premises was offered to someone for sale. Supply had to be inferred from the circumstances of joint possession. 
     
      
    10   If the Crown were able to prove joint possession, the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985 assisted the Crown in respect of the second requirement. The aggregate weight of the heroin in the plastic bottle, and that retrieved from the sump, was 6.7 grams. Under the Act (s29), possession of a trafficable quantity of heroin is deemed to have been possession for the purposes of supply. A trafficable quantity is 3.0 grams. The statutory defence by which the operation of the deeming provision may be avoided was not raised. 
     
      
    11   How, then, did the Crown seek to prove joint possession, given that the heroin found at the premises was physically remote from the two individuals who occupied the premises? The Crown relied upon three things. 
     
      
    12   First, there was evidence to connect each accused with the premises, quite apart from their presence on the day of the police search. Mr Phuong Van Nguyen had leased the premises on 1 September 1998, three weeks before the search. He said he had done so to house his wife and young child. He said that he had spent perhaps half of the preceding weeks at the premises. His wife and child had been there longer. Mr An Van Nguyen was Mr Phuong Van Nguyen’s brother-in-law. He acknowledged having been to the premises every few days, and sometimes twice a day, to visit his sister and her child. 
     
      
    13   Secondly, there was evidence from a number of witnesses who had purchased heroin from the premises within the preceding three weeks. Each said that they had gone to the premises for that purpose. Indeed, whilst the search of the premises was under way, two individuals came to the premises. When questioned by police, they each identified their purpose as the purchase of heroin (cf R v Firman (1989) 52 SASR 391). 
     
      
    14   Thirdly, on the day before the search (22 September 1998), a young man, Mr Norman Yenney, was seen entering the premises. A short time later he was seen leaving the premises. He was stopped by police. When searched, he was found to have heroin in his possession. It was packaged in aluminium foil inside a small balloon. He told the police that he had purchased the heroin a short time before from some Asian males at a house in Frederick Street. Mr Yenney was then arrested. He was charged with having been in possession of heroin. He later gave evidence for the Crown. 
     
      
    15   Mr Yenney described five transactions in which he purchased heroin in the two weeks preceding 22 September 1998. Each transaction was undertaken in the house at Frederick Street. Each purchase was made from an Asian male known to him as “Jason”. Jason was later identified as Mr An Van Nguyen, the co-accused of the appellant. Mr Yenney said that on three of these occasions a person, whom he later identified as the appellant, was present. Indeed, on one such occasion, he handed the appellant the money whilst Jason retrieved the drugs from the rear of the house. The drugs, when received, were packaged in foil inside a balloon. 
     
      
    16   Mr Yenney provided the police with a description of the two persons with whom he had dealt. The description was consistent with the appearance of Mr An Van Nguyen and Mr Phuong Van Nguyen. Both accused, on advice, declined to participate in an identification parade. 
     
      
    17   No steps were taken by the police, at that time, to have Mr Yenney identify, by reference to photographs, the persons with whom he had dealt. Almost one year later (on 6 July 1999), as the matter was about to go to trial, Mr Yenney was asked to identify the people from whom he had purchased the heroin. He attended the Campsie Police Station where he was shown two videos by Const Lamey. The identification of Mr An Van Nguyen (the appellant’s co-accused) occurred in the following circumstances, described by Const Lamey: (T.62/63) 
     
      
       
        
        “I inserted a video cassette marked ‘B’ into the video player. At the end of the video, Mr Yenney nominated photographs numbered one, four and ten. I rewound and played the video marked ‘B’ again, at the request of Mr Yenney. Mr Yenney delayed the tape on photograph number four. 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘That would appear to be the one that called himself Jason, which is the one I dealt with’.” 
        
       
      
    18   Const Lamey then played the second video. It included a photograph of the appellant. His evidence as to Mr Yenney’s response was in these terms: (T 63) 
     
      
       
        
        “He said, ‘I reckon that’s another one, the other one. I’m pretty sure about number seven. Twenty rings a bell, I’ll look at them again.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I rewound and played the video marked ‘A’ again at the request of Mr Yenney. 
        
       
       
        
        He said, ‘I don’t know about number twenty, maybe I’ve seen him somewhere different. In regards to the house at Sydenham, I’m pretty sure it is number seven on this tape, and number four on tape ‘B’.’” 
        
       
       
      The Case for the Appellant 
       
      
    19   The appellant denied ever having met Mr Yenney. He denied knowing that there were drugs on the premises. He further denied that anyone came to the premises seeking drugs. 
     
      
    20   The appellant acknowledged, however, that the aluminium foil found on top of the refrigerator had been purchased by his wife. He said, moreover, that the box of balloons was a gift from him to his young daughter. He provided what can only be described as a ludicrous explanation for the off-cuts of the balloons found in the vacuum cleaner. One gathers from his explanation that he grew tired of blowing up the balloons for his daughter. He, therefore, cut off their ends in front of her. He later vacuumed. He had no explanation for the fact that the remnants, when vacuumed, included only the ends of the balloons and not the more substantial middle section. 
     
      
       
      The Issue of Identification 
       
      
    21   There are a number of grounds of appeal. Ground 2 was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial Judge failed to direct the jury adequately on identification.” 
        
       
      
    22   Mr Yenney was obviously an important Crown witness. If accepted, he transformed a strong Crown case into one which was overwhelming against each accused. Acceptance of his evidence, however, turned upon the identification of each accused, and their role in each sale. His Honour correctly characterised this issue, in his directions to the Jury, when he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “The case is very much about identification in some ways ….” 
        
       
      
    23   Whilst there could be no issue as to the presence of the appellant and Mr An Van Nguyen at the time of the search (since they appeared on the video), there was, in his Honour’s words, “a very real issue about the identification by Mr Yenney”. 
     
      
    24   The appellant asserts that his Honour’s directions did not meet the requirements of s116(1)(a) and (b), and s165(1)(b) and, s165(2)(a), (b) and (c) of the Evidence Act, 1995. Redirections were sought by counsel for the accused. The Crown joined in that request. His Honour, however, declined to redirect the Jury on this issue. 
     
      
    25   Counsel for the Crown, on this appeal, has conceded that his Honour’s directions did not meet the requirements of the Act. There was no reference to the period of ten months between the events described, and the identification made at the Campsie Police Station. There was no reference to the identification having been made from photographs, and the potential for unreliability. Although there was a reference to the need for special caution, there was no elaboration, nor an indication of the matters relevant in the circumstances (contrary to s116(1)(b) and s165(2)(b) and (c)). Specifically, there was no reference to the possible dangers arising from a person of one race identifying someone from a different race. 
     
      
    26   The concession by the Crown was properly made. The instructions on identification did not meet the requirements of the Act. There was, therefore, error on an important issue. 
     
      
    27   The appellant asserted a number of other errors. The Crown argued that, in each case, the directions given by his Honour were adequate. I do not believe it is necessary to deal with each issue, in view of the conclusion I have reached in respect of identification. Since there was error on an important issue, it is convenient to move directly to the proviso. 
     
      
       
      The Proviso 
       
      
    28   The Crown urged the application of the proviso to s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act, 1912. Notwithstanding the error, the Crown asserted that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice. The case against Mr Phuong Van Nguyen, it suggested, was overwhelming. 
     
      
    29   However, the only evidence which unambiguously connected the appellant to the heroin, was the evidence of Mr Yenney. It was Mr Yenney who specifically identified the appellant as a participant in the enterprise of selling heroin. The words of Gibb J in Kelleher v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 534 are, therefore, apposite: (at 550/551) 
     
      
       
        
        “Experience, including recent experience, has shown that such miscarriages can occur even when all the precautions provided by the law as safeguards against mistaken identification have been fully observed. It is therefore obviously necessary that at a trial where the evidence implicating the accused is evidence that he was identified by a witness or witnesses who were not previously acquainted with him, both judge and jury should be constantly alert to guard against the possibility that the evidence may be mistaken and an innocent man convicted. I would respectfully endorse the words of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in  
        Arthurs v Attorney-General (Northern Ireland) 
         ((1970) 55 Cr App R 161 at 168): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It is manifest that in cases where the vital issue is whether the identification of the accused person is certain and reliable the judge must direct the jury with great care. However careful is his general direction as to the onus of proof, the judge will feel it necessary to deal specifically with all the matters relating to identification.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    30   There being error on an important issue, before the proviso can be applied, the Court, having reviewed the whole of the evidence, would need to be satisfied that any jury, properly instructed, was certain to convict the appellant (Kelleher v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 540). Expressed in another way, the proviso cannot be applied if the appellant has, by reason of the error, lost the chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted (Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514). 
     
      
    31   I have said already that it was a strong Crown case. The appellant’s denial of complicity was coupled with a fanciful explanation for the balloons. However, the jury, were they to reject the appellant’s version, should have put that version to one side. The jury would then have been required to examine whether, on the evidence presented by the Crown, the appellant’s guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although unquestionably conviction of the appellant on such evidence was highly likely, I do not feel myself able to say that it was certain. I cannot exclude the possibility that the appellant, by reason of the error, may have lost the chance of an acquittal which was fairly open to him. 
     
      
    32   In reaching that view, I am conscious of the fact that, in a new trial, the Crown may seek to tender the evidence of the appellant given in the present trial. It may, at the same time, seek from the trial Judge a direction (not provided in the present trial) that the false explanation given by the appellant was provided through a consciousness of guilt (R v Edwards (1993) 178 CLR 193; Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28) Were that course taken, the jury would then be entitled to take account of the false explanation (assuming that it so determined) on the question of guilt. The Crown case, in that circumstance, may be such that a conviction would be inevitable. 
     
      
    33   I should not, however, have regard to the likely outcome of any new trial in determining whether, in the present trial (where error has been demonstrated) there was a substantial miscarriage of justice (cf R v De-Cressac (1985) 1 NSWLR 381, per Street CJ at 390). 
     
      
    34   I therefore decline to apply the proviso to s6(1) of the Act. I believe that the appropriate orders are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. That the appeal should be allowed. 
       
       
      2. That the conviction and sentence of Phuong Van Nguyen should be quashed. 
       
       
      3. That there should be a new trial.

       REGINA v Allan David MURRAY 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    HEYDON JA: I agree. 
     
      
    2    SMART AJ: I also agree. 
     
      
    3    IRELAND AJ: The applicant before this Court pleaded guilty to five counts of passing valueless cheques in contravention of s 178B of the Crimes Act, 1900 and one count of obtain benefit by deception in contravention of s 178BA of the Crimes Act, 1900, before her Honour Judge Tupman in the District Court at Penrith, on 1 September 1999. 
     
      
    4    Four further offences of passing valueless cheques were taken into account on a Form 1. The offences were committed between 30 September 1994 and 8 January 1995. 
     
      
    5    On 2 September 1999, Tupman DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows:- 
     
      
       
      In relation to Counts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, her Honour deferred passing sentence (pursuant to s 558 of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ) upon the applicant entering into a recognisance in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years. 
       
       
      The recognisance was subject to the conditions:- 
       
        
        (i) that the applicant accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service; and 
         
        (ii) that he pay two of the amounts, i.e. $285 and $175, at a rate of $50 per month. 
        
       
       
      In relation to Count 3, the applicant was ordered to perform 300 hours of community service, under the supervision of the Queanbeyan Local Court and the Queanbeyan office of the Probation and Parole Service. 
       
      
    6    Her Honour's remarks on sentence, which occupy ten pages, make plain that, in considering the appropriate sentence to be passed, a great deal of thought was given to relevant sentencing considerations, including, in particular, the applicant's services to the Aboriginal community in which he had played a prominent role over many years. 
     
      
    7    The penalty imposed was, in the circumstances, minimal in the extreme, particularly when consideration is had to the applicant's criminal history, which is extensive and includes serious offences, albeit, not of the precise nature of those being considered by the sentencing judge in the proceedings before Tupman DCJ. In fact, Mr Murray describes the penalties imposed in the present case as ""the best sentence I ever received in my life"". 
     
      
    8    The application which the applicant now wishes to make before this Court is for favourable consideration and exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy. 
     
      
    9    The exercise of such power is not within the jurisdiction of this Court and is a matter for the Executive Government. In R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351, Street CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at p 353-354:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""This Court as the Court of Criminal Appeal functioning within its well-established jurisdictional boundaries is concerned, both in appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence, primarily to ascertain whether the decision of the first instance judge was in error and, if so, in what way it should be corrected. Normally error requires the evaluation of the material placed before the first instance court. There are, however, well-established bases upon which error in the first instance proceedings can be disclosed by fresh evidence or new evidence. In addition the Court's jurisdiction is exercisable where it is shown that there has been a miscarriage of justice. … This Court exercises judicial power; it has no power or authority to give administrative directions regarding the treatment of prisoners. Nor has it power or authority by administrative order to change the character or concomitants of sentences or to bring about total or qualified release of persons in custody. That power and authority resides in the hands of the Executive Government."" 
        
       
      
    10    As pointed out by Mrs Hock, counsel for the respondent, this passage was more recently cited with approval in Jones (1993) 70 ACrimR 449 at 456-457. In that case, Carruthers J, with whom Sheller JA and Sully J concurred, at p 457, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""It must be remembered that s 53 of the  
        Sentencing Act 1989 
         (NSW) provides that nothing in that Act limits or affects in any manner the Royal Prerogative of mercy."" 
        
       
       
      See also s 102 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 
       which came into force on 3 April 2000. 
       
      
    11    For these reasons, in my view, this application is incompetent and must be refused.

     REGINA v George ADLER 
      
     
     JUDGMENT 
     1   HEYDON JA: The Court is in a position to deliver judgment now in this matter which has a degree of urgency because the trial is scheduled to commence tomorrow. I will ask Smart AJ to deliver the first judgment. 2   SMART AJ: Pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 George Adler seeks leave to appeal against the decision of Judge Shadbolt, following a hearing on the voir dire, to admit the evidence of Mrs Vera Antonia Konsuo that the man who telephoned her and deceived her by a series of false representations was the applicant. It was a case of aural identification. Mr Adler also seeks leave to appeal against the refusal of a permanent stay of proceedings. Once the evidence of aural identification is admitted it could not be said that the prosecution was bound to fail and accordingly that basis for a stay would not exist. The Crown has further contended that its case was not bound to fail even if the evidence under challenge was rejected although it concedes that it would face some difficulties. 
    3   The draft indictment contains some 12 counts charging that on various dates between 1 October 1996 and 1 November 1996 both inclusive the applicant dishonestly obtained for himself or another person a valuable thing, namely, a cheque in a specified amount drawn in favour of Cornelius Van der Heul by deception by specified representations which he knew to be false. In view of the number of representations pleaded the precise terms of counts in the indictment may require further consideration to avoid duplicity problems. 
    4   The Crown case is that the applicant, while an inmate at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, telephoned Mrs Konsuo, a travel agent, and represented that she should invest in shares in a company called Natfibre, that it was a secure investment in water filtration and she would receive a specified return ($4.82 for every dollar invested in counts 1 to 7). The Crown alleged that the applicant knew these representations were false, in that shares in the company Natfibre were not available to the public, the company was not involved in water filtration, that he was not authorised to sell shares in, nor secure investors for Natfibre and that he had no authority to hold out any figures indicating a return on investment to a member of the public.5   In respect of counts 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 the amount represented as a return to be received was $5.61 for every dollar invested and as to counts 8, 9, 10 and 12 there was a further representation that she would get a return of $128,000.6   The judge summarised the evidence of Ms Konsuo. It appears from her evidence that she first met the applicant in 1992 or 1993 when, as a travel agent, she did some work for him. Over approximately a month and a half she transferred money for him, rearranged an airline ticket for his adult son and made travel arrangements for Mr George Adler and his family. The transfer transactions were all handled by Ms Konsuo and accomplished when he came to her office. The money transfer transactions took between eight and 20 minutes each and these occurred on three or four occasions. The occasion on which the ticket details were altered also involved him attending at the office and giving instructions and attending on a second occasion. There was conversation between Ms Konsuo and the applicant on these occasions. On another occasion when she arranged a holiday trip for the applicant and his family the applicant attended at her office for about 45 minutes during which time she made the bookings and was paid. Again there was conversation between Ms Konsuo and the applicant.  
    7   Ms Konsuo thought that the last time she spoke to the applicant face to face was in 1993 or possibly late 1992. She said that the applicant had a well educated outstanding male Australian voice but she had more than 100 male customers with the same voice qualities. She agreed that when the applicant spoke to her in June 1996 and raised the question of investing in Natfibre she did not go through the mental exercise of trying to identify the voice of the person that spoke to her on the telephone as that of the applicant as he had identified himself by name in the conversation as the applicant.  
    8   Despite persistent cross-examination she remained firm in her view that the person who spoke to her from June 1996 onwards was the applicant and that she recognised his voice. That was on reflection. 
    9   The judge reviewed a series of decisions as to voice identification and then considered the terms of the Evidence Act 1995 and the effect of this Act on the previous decisions.  
    10   The judge referred to R v Smith (1984) 1 NSWLR 463 where O’Brien CJ of CrD reviewed the law on voice identification placing considerable reliance on some United States decisions, R v Brownlowe (1987) 7 NSWLR 461 and R v Brotherton (1993) 29 NSWLR 95. The judge also referred to a series of American cases, perhaps the most significant of which is United States v Cerone 830 Federal Reports, Second Series 938 (Eighth Circuit, 1987) in which the Federal Court of Appeal said in para 17: 
     
      
       
       ""Any person may identify a speaker's voice if he has heard the voice at any time... Minimal familiarity is sufficient for admissibility purposes. Attacks on the accuracy of the identification go to the weight of the evidence and the issue is for the jury to decide..."" 
       
      
    11   That case was decided after Smith and was probably not available in Australia when Brownlowe was decided. The approach in Cerone differs from the view taken of the United States decisions in Smith. The primary judge also noted that Smith's case had not been followed in Victoria, in R v Hentshel (1988) VR 362 at 369, R v Harris (No 3) (1990) VR 310 at 316- 317, nor in the Australian Capital Territory in R v Miladinovic (1992) 60 ACR 206. Smith has also not been followed in Tasmania.12   The judge also referred to the decision in Bulejcik v The Queen 185 CLR 375 and had regard to the terms of the judgments in that case. That decision did not resolve whether the principles stated in Smith and applied subsequently were correct.13   After that review the judge considered the Evidence Act 1995. This deals specifically with identification evidence and it was upon that Act that the judge based his decision. The judge, after having regard to the terms of the definition of identification evidence in the dictionary of the Act, s 116 and s 55 held: 
     
      
       
       ""The foregoing indicates a clear intendment to alter the common law by making provision for the reception of voice identification without any threshold considerations whilst leaving a discretion to exclude under ss 135 and 137. In short, save for the direction under the identification section, identification evidence is to be treated as all other evidence which has been of course, the view of the Court of Appeal in Victoria and the Supreme Court in the ACT."" 
        
       
      
    14   I agree with the approach taken by the judge.  
    15   Identification evidence in the dictionary of the Act is described as follows:  
     
      
       
       ""Identification evidence means evidence that is: 
        
       (a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where: 
        
       (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed, or 
        
       (ii) an act connected to that offence was done, at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time, or 
        
       (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion."" 
       
      
    16   Section 116 of the Evidence Act provides that where identification evidence has been admitted the judge is to inform the jury: 
     
      
       
       ""(a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence and 
        
       (b) of the reasons for that need for caution both generally and in the circumstances of the case."" 
        
       
      
    17   There are three sections in the Act designed specifically to deal with identification evidence. They are contained in Part 3.9 and comprise sections 114, 115 and 116. Section 114 deals with visual identification evidence, S115 deals with evidence of identification by pictures and s 116 deals with directions to the jury. Sections 114 and 115 contain threshold tests. There is no corresponding test as to voice identification evidence. Section 116 uses the phrase ""identification evidence"" and that picks up the definition to which I have earlier referred. The legislature envisaged that s 116 applied to directions given in respect of identification evidence as defined and that includes voice identification evidence. I also add a reference to s 165(1) which provides for a warning to be given as to identification evidence.18   The admission of voice identification evidence is governed by s 55 (1) of the Act which makes relevant evidence admissible and requires no threshold question to be resolved.19   Mr Jeffreys for Mr Adler referred to three decisions in this Court, namely, R v Cassar [1999] NSWSC 321 (Sperling J), R v Colebrook [1999] NSWCCA 262 and R v Leung (1998-9) 47 NSWR 404 at 410. None of these cases decided the point that has now come before this court. From Cassar it appears that the point was not argued; in Colebrook the applicant was unrepresented, the matter was not fully argued. The Court made some general observation but did not deal specifically with the point. Leung does not seem to take the matter any further. No assistance is to be gained from these cases. 
    20   The judge considered whether the evidence should be excluded on discretionary grounds and resolved that question in the negative. Mr Jeffreys submitted that the judge's discretion had miscarried and that in the exercise of his discretion he should have attached very considerable weight to the principles enunciated in Smith. The judge was conscious of the arguments which had been advanced and he took the view that the probative value of the evidence was high and outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to the complainant. The evidence was prejudicial but was not unfairly so. 
    21   There is no sound ground for holding that the judge’s discretion miscarried.22   A further matter needs to be mentioned. The Crown has contended that even if the voice identification evidence were rejected there is other evidence from which an inference could be drawn that the caller was Mr Adler and not somebody else. It relies on these matters. Some time after the last payment on 1 November 1996 there were a number of telephone calls by the applicant to Ms Konsuo. It was the same voice that she had dealt with over the telephone which induced her to part with 11 payments. In one telephone call (and there were a number), he said $15,000 had been paid into her account. It was, but the cheque was later dishonoured. In another call he said $65,000 had been paid into her account; it was, but the cheque was dishonoured.  
    23   On another occasion he telephoned her and said that Graham Boys of Concrete Constructions would give her some money. The Crown said that Mr Boys will give evidence that in two separate telephone calls the applicant asked him to write a cheque for Vera Konsuo firstly for or $15,000 and secondly for 65,000. Both cheques were subsequently dishonoured as the applicant did not live up to his promise to Mr Boys to transfer funds into his account to cover them. Mr Boys can identify the applicant's voice.  
    24   The Crown contends that on 9 January 1997 Ms Konsuo's account was actually credited with $6,815. On that day the applicant telephoned Andrew Sinclair and asked him to pay $6,815 into Vera Konsuo's account which he did. Mr Sinclair is to give evidence and he can identify the applicant’s voice.  
    25   In March 1997 the applicant telephoned Dr Chen and asked him to pay $10,000 into Vera Konsuo's account which he did. Dr Chen is to give evidence and he can identify the applicant’s voice.  
    26   Count 5 involves a cheque made out to cash for $5,000 which the applicant’s son (Rodney) picked up from Vera Konsuo on 17 October 1996. That day $5,000 in cash was handed to Levitt & Co, solicitors, in part payment of the applicant’s legal costs.  
    27   Count 7 involves a cheque made out to cash for $10380. This was picked up by Rodney Adler from Ms Konsuo on 25 October 1996. That day $10,000 in cash was handed to Levitt & Co in part payment of the applicant's legal costs.  
    28   Count 9 involves a cheque made out to cash for $13,000 which was picked up by Rodney Adler from Mrs Konsuo on 29 October 1996. That day cash in the sum of $13,000 was handed to Levitt & Co in part payment of the applicant’s legal costs.  
    29   A Correctional Service Officer will give evidence that on 5 May 1997 he was monitoring inmates’ telephone calls. On that day he listened into the applicant's telephone call and the applicant asked Joy to put him through to Vera. He talked about her getting $80,000 that day. Apparently since the submissions have been prepared it has become known that Joy will say that she cannot make such a transfer.  
    30   We have been told by the Crown that there is a further witness who has given or is giving a statement to the Crown to the effect that the switchboard for the relevant telephone number did have the capacity to transfer calls through to Ms Konsuo and that many calls were received from Mr George Adler. 
    31   Mr Jeffreys submitted that the evidence available to the Crown would not be sufficient for it to make out a case in the absence of the voice identification evidence. There is a body of evidence from which adverse inferences can be drawn. This is a case where the evidence will have to be taken before any decision can be made. 
    32   This second matter points up indicates the difficulty that any application for the grant of a permanent stay faces. Even if the voice identification evidence is admitted and the stay is refused, the applicant retains all his appeal rights. 
    33   A case has not been made out for the granting in this court of a stay of proceedings. On the materials before us the voice identification evidence would appear to be admissible, there being no threshold questions. Its weight becomes a matter for the jury. In any event the other matters on which the Crown relies would need to be investigated and led. Leave to appeal should be refused. 
    34   HEYDON JA: I agree with Smart AJ. 
    35   I wish to add this. I agree also with the reasoning of Shadbolt DCJ, subject to one correction. He said that “Of those sections which govern identification per se, namely 114, 115 and 166, only the latter section is relevant to voice identification”. His reference to “166” is a typographical error for “116”. To s 116 should be added s 165, which specifically refers to the giving of warnings about the reliability of various forms of evidence including voice identification. 
    36   The primary submission, which was put with considerable capacity by Mr Jeffreys, was that if the principles stated in the line of cases commencing with R v Smith [1984] 1 NSWLR 463 were to be removed by statute, there must be explicit mention of voice identification evidence in the part of the Act which deals with identification. There is in my judgment explicit reference by reason of the fact that ss 116 and 165 turn on the definition of identification evidence. Identification evidence is defined as meaning evidence that is an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles “(visually, aurally, or otherwise)”, a person who was, present, or a person at or near specified places. What is encompassed within the words “or otherwise” is unclear. They may be intended to cover such unusual cases as identification by touch or identification by the sound of a person’s particular gait. 
    37   In view of the specific threshold requirements for the reception of visual identification in s 114 and of picture identification evidence in s 115, coupled with the absence of specific threshold requirements for the reception of other forms of identification evidence, sufficiently explicit language appears to have been employed to meet the criterion for which Mr Jeffreys contended. 
    38   The three cases to which he drew attention this morning can be dealt with as follows. R v Cassar [1999] NSWSC 321 did not involve any consideration of the argument which Shadbolt DCJ adopted. Indeed, according to Sperling J in paragraph [27] of his reasons for judgment, ‘it was common ground” in the submissions by the Crown and the accused that the relevant test was to be found in the R v Smith line of authority. In R v Colebrook (1999) NSWCCA 262 the appellant was unrepresented and the court, on its own motion, examined whether the voice identification evidence was admissible. There was no recorded submission on the part of the Crown or the accused advancing the argument which Shadbolt DCJ accepted. In R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405, Simpson J appears to have reserved the correctness of the R v Smith line of authority. In paragraph [25] of the judgment in particular she said of it: 
     
      
       
       “All these decisions concerned the pre-Evidence Act admissibility of voice identification evidence. It will be necessary to return to a consideration of these decisions. They are not, in my opinion, relevant to the question whether the evidence was rendered admissible by s 78.” 
       
      
    39   The evidence to which she referred was the evidence of an ad hoc expert on the identification of voices on tape. 
    40   Some support is given to Shadbolt’s DCJ’s conclusion by Mr Howie QC, as he then was, in “Identification Evidence Under the Evidence Act 1995” (1996) 3 Criminal Law News 13 at 15-16. He opined that there “is nothing in the Evidence Act which limits voice identification as was done under the common law of this state.” 
    41   For the reasons given by Smart AJ and for those additional reasons, I support the order proposed by Smart AJ. 
    42   IRELAND AJ: I also agree with Smart AJ and the remarks which have been made by Heydon JA. 
    43   HEYDON JA: The orders of the Court will be the orders as proposed by Smart AJ.

     REGINA v Leslie Joseph MURPHY 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2   GROVE J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3   KIRBY J: In 1997 Leslie Joseph Murphy was charged with two offences under s61D Crimes Act, 1900. Each charge was in the same terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “For that he, between 31 December 1981 and 1 April 1982, at Bondi in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with Nicola Margaret McKay without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, she being under the age of 16 years, namely 14 years.” 
        
       
      
    4   Mr Murphy, on advice, consented to being tried by a Judge alone (s16(1) Criminal Procedure Act, 1986). The trial proceeded before Acting Judge Downs QC. His Honour gave judgment on 3 September 1999. Mr Murphy was convicted on each count. 
     
      
    5   Mr Murphy was sentenced to six years penal servitude in respect of each offence, such sentences to be served concurrently. A minimum term of four years was fixed, with an additional term of two years. 
     
      
    6   Mr Murphy appeals against both convictions. He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    7   Ms Nicola McKay (the complainant) was born on 30 May 1967. At an early age she ran away from home. She described herself as a “street kid”. By the time she was aged 14, she had been declared “an uncontrollable child” by the Children’s Court. An order was made committing her to the care of The Paddington Refuge. The refuge was located in Oxford Street, Paddington, in what was known as The Caretaker’s Cottage. 
     
      
    8   Ms McKay occupied much of her time at the Hoyts Cinema complex in George Street, as did many other “street kids”. Over a six month period she said that she came to know the appellant, Mr Murphy. She did not meet him. However, she became aware of his reputation, and that of several of his brothers. They were “The Murphys”. She knew their names, Daniel, Leslie and Dean. She said this: (T.11) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Yes, how did you come to know these people by name? 
         
        A. Because everybody knew them, and they were pointed out to you, to be aware of.” 
        
       
      
    9   Ms McKay said that she saw the appellant every day. She gave the police a description of him. Her description included the fact that he had tattoos, including a tattoo in the shape of “a teardrop under his left eye” (T.13). 
     
      
    10   The complainant could not call to mind the date of the incident. She said, however, that it occurred when she was 14. She went with a friend, Ms Karen O’Riordan, to a nightclub, The Palms. She had not visited that nightclub before, nor since. Whilst at the nightclub, she and Ms O’Riordan were approached by Mr Les Murphy (the appellant), and Dean Murphy (also known as “Dean Crockett”). Ms McKay said that she was wary of them because of their reputation. An invitation was extended to have “a smoke”, a reference to marijuana, which she understood. She therefore left the club with the appellant, Dean Murphy, and Ms O’Riordan. She thought it would be safe to do so because Ms O’Riordan knew the Murphys well. 
     
      
    11   Ms McKay said that she had not consumed alcohol, and was not affected by drugs. 
     
      
    12   Having left the club, she went with the group to a flat in Bondi. She said that the incident which gives rise to the charges occurred in that flat. She had no recollection of how she got from the nightclub to the flat. She said this: (T. 16) 
     
      
       
        
        “As I started to climb the stairs up the top, I turned around and noticed that Karen wasn’t there.” 
        
       
      
    13   Before going to the incident, I should briefly refer to the evidence of Ms Karen O’Riordan. In 1982, she also was a resident at The Caretaker’s Cottage. She was a year or two older than Ms McKay. She recalled attending The Palms nightclub with Ms McKay. They were together at the club on only one occasion. However, her account of that evening was quite different from that provided by the complainant. First, she did not know the Murphy brothers, either personally or by reputation. She did, however, meet them some time later. Secondly, Ms O’Riordan’s evidence did not suggest that she and Ms McKay were approached by the Murphy brothers that evening, and asked to go outside for “a smoke”. Thirdly, she did not leave the club with Ms McKay, or the Murphy brothers. She left with a person named Mork. Fourthly, it was her recollection of the complainant on that evening that she was “vague” and “out of it”. She explained what she meant in these words: (T.75) 
     
      
       
        
        “Had something to drink, or like a smoke of marijuana or something.” 
        
       
      
    14   Whilst dealing with Ms O’Riordan’s evidence, it is convenient to refer to another aspect. I will shortly deal with the evidence given by the complainant concerning her complaints after the incident. She asserted that one of the persons to whom she complained was Ms O’Riordan. Ms O’Riordan, indeed, recalled a complaint concerning rape. However, the incident described to her bore no relation to the incident giving rise to the charges against the appellant. Ms McKay, on Ms O’Riordan’s recollection, alleged that she had been raped by ten or twelve men at the Rocks. She did not know who the men were. 
     
      
       
      The Incident 
       
      
    15   Returning to the complainant’s evidence, she said that she entered the flat at Bondi with the appellant and Dean Murphy. There were three people inside the flat. There was Danny Murphy, whom she recognised as one of the “Murphy brothers”. There was also a man named Steve, and a woman, Bonnie, who later became Danny Murphy’s wife. 
     
      
    16   The flat was small, and sparsely furnished. Within two minutes of her arrival, Danny Murphy produced a gun. He ordered her to “to strip”. At the same time, his brother Les Murphy (the appellant) produced a knife. Ms McKay described the knife in these words: (T.20) 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s like a Rambo style knife that Sylvester Stallone uses …” 
        
       
      
    17   It had a serrated edge. She said that she was terrified. She therefore removed her clothes. She was then ordered to lie on the floor. She did so, curling up into a foetal position. The appellant pushed her legs apart, and then penetrated her vagina. They had sexual intercourse. She pleaded with him not to do so. 
     
      
    18   Being a small flat, essentially one room, the actions of the appellant took place in the presence of the others. Ms Bonnie Murphy, on the complainant’s account, encouraged the appellant, saying these words: (T.23) 
     
      
       
        
        “C’mon, c’mon. I can’t wait. It will be my turn soon.” 
        
       
      
    19   This was the evidence relied upon by the Crown in support of the first count. 
     
      
    20   A second incident then occurred. One gathers it took place shortly after. Dean Murphy lay on the floor. Daniel Murphy and the appellant then held the complainant’s arms and legs. She was placed on top of Dean. Dean thereafter engaged in anal intercourse. At the same time the appellant had vaginal intercourse. Ms McKay described Bonnie Murphy as, “just egging everyone on” (T.25). 
     
      
    21   This was the evidence relied upon by the Crown in respect to the second count. 
     
      
    22   Ms McKay then described a further act of intercourse, on this occasion with Danny Murphy. The remaining male in the flat, Steve, simulated intercourse, but did not penetrate. 
     
      
    23   After these events, the complainant at some point lost consciousness. In the early hours of the morning she woke up. She gathered her clothing, and left the flat. She made her way back to The Caretaker’s Cottage. 
     
      
       
      Complaints by Ms McKay 
       
      
    24   Ms McKay gave evidence, without objection, concerning complaints made after the incident. She did not complain straight away. She said this: (T.28) 
     
      
       
        
        “I was scared. I was a street kid. I didn’t think anybody would believe me.” 
        
       
      
    25   However, she later spoke to a number of people, including young women at the refuge. One was Ms O’Riordan, whose evidence I have already referred to. She also spoke to Ms Cathy Perish. She thought the conversation took place within two days, or two weeks of the incident. Ms Perish gave evidence that she remembered having been told by the complainant, in early 1982, that “she had been raped by the Murphys”. Ms Perish passed the information to a youth worker, Deborah Coulter. 
     
      
    26   Ms Coulter gave evidence. She recalled Ms McKay. She could not recall, however, having received a complaint of rape. She, nonetheless, remembered that there were such complaints from young women housed at the refuge. They were recorded in a log book. Evidence was given by a police officer who searched for the log book. It could not be found. 
     
      
    27   Ms McKay said that, as a consequence of Ms Coulter’s intervention, arrangements were made for her to speak to two detectives. She provided her account of the incident to these police officers but never heard from them again. Enquiries were made in 1997 in an attempt to identify the officers. They could not be identified. 
     
      
    28   Ms McKay also made a complaint to Sergeant Eager. She had dealt with Sergeant Eager in August 1991. At that time he escorted her back to The Caretaker’s Cottage. After the incident at the Bondi flat, she spoke to him again. She could not recall when, in relation to the time of the incident, that conversation took place. 
     
      
    29   Sergeant Eager remembered having spoken to the complainant on the telephone. He did not make a note of that conversation. However, he recalled Ms McKay having said that she had been raped by “the Murphy brothers” at a flat in Bondi. In her account, she referred to a gun. He made arrangements for her to come to the police station the next day. However, she failed to attend. 
     
      
    30   Sergeant Eager had an entry in his duty book for 17 March 1982. It related to Mr Leslie Murphy (the appellant). It concerned an altogether different complaint. However, Sergeant Eager was able to say, by reference to that note, that his conversation with Ms McKay took place before 17 March 1982. This, no doubt, was the basis upon which the Crown selected the dates in the indictment. 
     
      
    31   A number of witnesses gave evidence which was at odds with that of the complainant. I have referred to the evidence of Ms O’Riordan, who recalled a quite different complaint. Ms McKay said that she also told her parents six or twelve months after the incident. They simply laughed. Ms McKay ran from their presence, and has remained estranged from them. 
     
      
    32   Mr and Mrs McKay, the parents of the complainant, gave evidence. They each said that their daughter had never complained of having been raped. 
     
      
       
      The Evidence of Ms Bonnie Murphy 
       
      
    33   The complainant went to the police in March 1997. She was seen by Det Snr Const Alt. He, thereafter, became the case officer for the investigation. He located Ms Veronica Murphy, the person known to the complainant as Bonnie. She had since married Danny Murphy, and was living in Townsville. 
     
      
    34   Detective Alt went to Townsville to interview Mr and Mrs Murphy. Mr Murphy gave an interview. However, Ms Bonnie Murphy, having been cautioned, refused to do so. Mr Danny Murphy was charged with an offence arising out of the incident in the Bondi flat. He was also charged with another offence, and was taken into custody. The police later spoke to Mr Danny Murphy whilst in custody. They then sought, and were given permission by the DPP, to take what was referred to as an “induced statement” (T.99). Ms Bonnie Murphy was then reinterviewed. No caution was administered. In these circumstances she made a statement which the police understood could not be used against her (T.100). 
     
      
    35   Against this background, Ms Bonnie Murphy was called by the Crown. Ms McKay had asserted, in her evidence, that Ms Bonnie Murphy was present during the commission of the offences, and had given encouragement. There was plainly an obligation on the Court under s132 of the Evidence Act, 1995, to apprise Ms Murphy of her right to object, or make application under s128 of the Act. No reference was made by the Crown to either s132 or s128. Ms Murphy was not warned. This aspect may have some relevance to the obligations of the trial Judge when dealing with the evidence given by Ms Murphy. I will return to that issue later. 
     
      
    36   Ms Bonnie Murphy said that at one stage she lived in an upstairs flat at Bondi with her then boyfriend, Danny Murphy. She recalled the complainant. She identified her from a photograph. She remembered an occasion when Les Murphy (the appellant), Dean Murphy and another male came to the flat with the complainant. Dean and Les Murphy were in good spirits. She remembered the appellant saying the following words to the complainant: (T.120) 
     
      
       
        
        “And Les said to this girl that if she doesn’t sleep with Dean, his mate, Dean was going to belt him.” 
        
       
      
    37   She recalled that at some point the complainant was naked. She could tell from her facial expression that she was upset. Ms Bonnie Murphy’s boyfriend, Daniel, then came home. He wanted to know what was going on. The complainant was still undressed and upset. 
     
      
    38   Ms Murphy then went to bed with Daniel. The bed was in the corner of the single room flat. The light remained on. She then noticed the complainant was on the floor. The third male (whose identity she did not know) was lying on top of Ms McKay , and they were engaging in sexual intercourse. Les Murphy and Dean Murphy were nowhere to be seen. Whilst intercourse was taking place, Ms Bonnie Murphy described the complainant in these words: (T.125) 
     
      
       
        
        “She was still upset. She was, I think she was crying and I think she said to that guy that she wanted to go.” 
        
       
      
    39   In cross examination, Ms Murphy said that neither her husband, Les Murphy (the appellant), nor Dean Murphy, had sexual intercourse with the complainant. No gun was produced, nor a knife. At no stage did she encourage anyone to have sexual intercourse with the complainant. 
     
      
       
      The Case for the Accused 
       
      
    40   Mr Leslie Murphy gave evidence. He did not recognise the complainant. He denied having had intercourse with her. He said he had not been to The Palms nightclub. He never went to Daniel’s flat at Bondi with Dean Murphy. He acknowledged, however, that he did frequent the Hoyts Cinema Complex. 
     
      
    41   Mr Murphy had tattoos on his arms, legs and back. There was no reference to his having a tattoo in the shape of a tear beneath either eye. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal 
       
      
    42   The grounds of appeal were remarkably general. They were stated in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The trial Judge failed to direct himself on principles of law. 
        
       
       
        
        2. He failed to include in his judgment the principles of law that he applied. 
        
       
       
        
        3. He failed to set out in his judgment the findings of fact except some upon which he relied to convict. 
        
       
       
        
        4. He failed to include in his judgment the warnings he should have given to a jury were there a jury. 
        
       
       
        
        5. He failed to consider in his judgment or at all the attacks on the evidence made in cross-examination of any of the Crown witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The verdicts are unreasonable. 
        
       
      
    43   Written submissions were prepared by counsel for Mr Murphy. They did not identify in any precise way the errors of law about which complaint is made. However, using these submissions, and the arguments put on behalf of the appellant, it is my understanding that the appellant’s complaints against the judgment of Acting Judge Downs QC were as follows: 
     
      
    · First, that his Honour’s judgement was inadequate, in that he was obliged to canvass the evidence, and had failed to do so. 
     
      
    · Second, that his Honour drew inferences from the evidence of Ms Bonnie Murphy which were not open. 
     
      
    · Third, that his Honour failed to recognise that, in certain vital respects, the complainant’s evidence was unsupported. His Honour was, accordingly, obliged to evaluate the complainant’s credibility. He failed to do so. 
     
      
    · Fourth, that in the context of his evaluation of the evidence, his Honour was obliged to acknowledge and apply warnings relevant to his task, as required by s165 Evidence Act, 1995. 
     
      
       
      The Obligation of the Trial Judge to Give Reasons 
       
      
    44   The obligations of a Judge sitting alone in a criminal trial are defined by s17 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986. That section is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        17 
         (1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury. 
        
       
       
        
         (2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. 
        
       
       
        
         (3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.” 
        
       
      
    45   The predecessor of that section (which was in identical terms) was considered by the High Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ) in Fleming v The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379: (p 386 para 22) 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, in the present case, the obligation to give reasons is specified in the statute itself, namely in the mandatory terms of s33  
        (now s17) 
        . Such a provision is an expression of legislative concern not only for the effective exercise by the Court of Criminal Appeal of its jurisdiction conferred by ss5 and 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. More fundamentally, s33  
        (now s17) 
         evinces a concern that, in the operation of the new regime established by Pt 9 of the Criminal Procedure Act whereby trial by jury is replaced in certain circumstances by trial by judge sitting alone, justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done.” (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    46   There is, of course, a general obligation on the Court at first instance to provide reasons. The obligation was expressed by Jordan CJ in Carlson v The King (1947) 64 WN(NSW) 65 in these terms: (at 66) 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been established that it is the duty of a court of first instance, from which an appeal lies to a higher court, to make, or cause to be made, a note of everything necessary to enable the case to be laid properly and sufficiently before the appellate court if there should be an appeal. This includes not only the evidence, and the decision arrived at, but also the reasons for arriving at the decision.” 
        
       
      
    47   That obligation, in the context of s17(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, was described by the High Court in Fleming v The Queen (supra) in these terms: (p 388 para 28) 
     
      
       
        
        “… whilst s33(2) 
         (now s17(2)) 
        , when specifying that which a ‘judgment’ must include, does not use the expression ‘reasons for judgment’, it should not be taken as intending that the requirements of s33(2) 
         (now s17(2)) 
         be satisfied merely by a bare statement of the principles of law that the judge has applied and the findings of fact that the judge has made. Rather, there must be exposed the reasoning process linking them and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict that is reached.” (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    48   The Court continued: (p 388 para 30) 
     
      
       
        
        “The obligation imposed by s33(2) 
         (now 17(2)) 
         was to ensure that the judgment included all principles of law which the judge applied. Unless the judgment shows expressly or by implication that the principle was applied, it should be taken that the principle was not applied, rather than applied but not recorded.” 
        
       
      
    49   I will deal separately, below, with the statutory requirements in respect of warnings (s17(3)). 
     
      
    50   To what extent is a Judge, in satisfying these obligations, obliged to canvass the evidence? In New South Wales Medical Defence Union Limited v Crawford [No 2] (NSWCA, 30 June 1994), in the context of a civil trial, Mahoney JA said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not necessary that a judge, in his judgment, refer to every aspect of the case or every step in the reasoning to his conclusion … nor should it be readily inferred that, because evidence is not referred to, it has been overlooked. … Such an inference is warranted only where a reference to the evidence is to be expected. Where the purpose of the judgment is to articulate conclusions rather than to detail reasoning or where, as here, the facts are complex and the judgment is necessarily long, such an inference will not ordinarily be drawn.” 
        
       
      
    51   In determining whether you would expect a Judge to refer to the evidence, or to an argument advanced by a party, insight is provided by an understanding of the purposes which a judgment is designed to serve. McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) NSWLR 247 identified three purposes: (at 279) 
     
      
       
        
        “The giving of reasons for a judicial decision serves at least three purposes. First, it enables the parties to see the extent to which their arguments have been understood and accepted as well as the basis of the judge’s decision. … Secondly, the giving of reasons furthers judicial accountability. … Thirdly, under the common law system of adjudication, courts not only resolve disputes - they formulate rules for application in future cases. … Hence the giving of reasons enables practitioners, legislators and members of the public to ascertain the basis upon which like cases will probably be decided in the future.” 
        
       
      
    52   The High Court in Fleming v The Queen (supra) referred with approval to that analysis (para 22). In R v Maxwell (CCA, unreported, 23.12.98), the Court (Spigelman CJ, Sperling and Hidden JJ) said this: (at 46) 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant had a right to expect that the arguments put on his behalf would be dealt with in such a way that he could be satisfied that they had been understood and, either accepted, or, if rejected, that the rejection was based on a clear and rational process of reasoning.” 
        
       
      
    53   A number of issues, therefore, arise: 
     
      
    · First, was there an important issue, or a body of evidence, to which the trial Judge did not refer? 
     
      
        
      
    · Secondly, if so, was the significance of that issue, or that evidence, such that you would have expected the trial Judge to have dealt with it? 
     
      
    · Thirdly, did the trial Judge deal in substance, if not in terms, with the arguments put on behalf of the appellant? 
     
      
       
      The Judgement in Respect of Ms Bonnie Murphy 
       
      
    54   The trial lasted one week. The evidence occupied three days. Counsel addressed on the fourth day. His Honour reserved his decision, which was given on the fifth day. The judgement was brief. It ran to nine pages. It included the following statement: (at 6/7) 
     
      
       
        
        “Although a number of witnesses gave evidence in the Crown case and I will refer to them later, it was mainly Veronica Murphy, Danny Murphy’s wife, who satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had had sexual intercourse twice with Nicole McKay without her consent knowing that she was not consenting.” 
        
       
      
    55   His Honour then set out aspects of the evidence of Ms Bonnie Murphy. He made the following comments upon her motivation: (at 7) 
     
      
       
        
        “In an endeavour to assist her husband and the accused she even went so far as to allege that her husband did not arrive at the premises until some considerable time after the others and so far as the accused is concerned that he left the room for some unspecified time when she said he went to the toilet.” 
        
       
      
    56   His Honour’s conclusion concerning Ms Murphy’s evidence was in these terms: (at 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “In coming to the conclusion that I should not accept parts of her evidence I have borne in mind the fact that she is and continues to be Danny’s wife and also if her evidence was to be accepted she was a person who did not mind or object to, firstly four adults coming into her bedroom at night when her husband was out, secondly, she did not comment or object to four adults remaining in her bedroom at night, thirdly, she did not object or comment upon the fact that a female stranger took off all her clothes and left them off. She did not comment or object when in her presence and in the presence of others sexual intercourse took place on the floor of her bedroom between two strangers. And I should add, after all this, while the four others remained in the room her husband joined her in bed and they went to sleep with the light on. In these circumstances it is far more likely that she condoned what went on in the room or as Miss McKay said she encouraged it.” 
        
       
      
    57   The evidence of Ms Murphy (if accepted) was capable of supporting the complainant’s evidence in a number of respects. First, she affirmed that she had lived with Mr Danny Murphy in an upstairs flat at Bondi. Secondly, she affirmed that the appellant and Dean Murphy came to the flat with the complainant and another man. Thirdly, Ms Murphy confirmed that the complainant was naked, and had sexual intercourse whilst at the flat. Finally, Ms Murphy corroborated the complainant’s assertion that she was distressed about being naked, and about having sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    58   However, it was not possible to transform Ms Bonnie Murphy’s evidence that the appellant did not have intercourse with the complainant, into satisfaction, based upon her evidence, that he did. Nor did her evidence provide a basis upon which the learned trial Judge could have been satisfied that the appellant had intercourse with the complainant twice, without her consent. 
     
      
    59   Before his Honour could make a finding on the question of the guilt of the accused (s17(1) Criminal Procedure Act), he had to accept the complainant’s evidence. It was the complainant who gave a description of the circumstances in which the offences took place. She alone identified the appellant, and established the two acts of penetration, to which she did not consent. 
     
      
    60   His Honour did not say, in terms, that he accepted the account of the complainant. Indeed, he made the following comment which rather suggested that he believed himself relieved of the need to determine that issue by reason of Ms Murphy’s evidence: (p 9) 
     
      
       
        
        “In trials of this nature more often than not because of the very nature of the offence that is alleged the Court has to weigh up the evidence of one person, the alleged victim, against that of an accused. This was not the case in this trial because as I have already indicated there were other people with the victim and the accused both before and at the time the offences were committed. This simplified my task in deciding that the accused was guilty.” 
        
       
      
    61   His Honour was, in my view, obliged to consider whether the account given by the complainant, implicating the appellant in the two acts of intercourse, was truthful, and reliable. 
     
      
    62   Moreover, in determining that issue, the trial Judge was obliged to state, and keep in mind, warnings which were relevant to an acceptance (or rejection) of the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
       
      Warnings Under s165 Evidence Act 
       
      
    63   There is, as already indicated, a specific obligation imposed upon a Judge sitting alone in a criminal trial, in respect of warnings. The obligation arises from s17(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986, which I repeat: 
     
      
       
        
        “17(3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.” 
        
       
      
    64   In Fleming v The Queen (supra) the Court made the following comment (upon a provision in the same terms as s17(3)): (p 389 para 31) 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 33(3)  
        (now s17(3)) 
         is framed in a fashion which differs from that of s33(2)  
        (now s17(2)) 
         and which emphasises the particular importance attached by the legislature to the requirements of the law with respect to warnings.” (parentheses added) 
        
       
      
    65   The Court added: (p 389 para 32) 
     
      
       
        
        “The obligation imposed by s33(3)  
        (now s17(3)) 
         ‘ to take the warning into account’ is not only to be discharged but also to be seen to be discharged. The means by which the obligation may be discharged is that indicated in s33(2)  
        (now s17(2)) 
        , namely the inclusion in the reasons for judgment of the particular requirement for a warning among the principles of law applied by the judge. The various requirements that warnings be given have been expressed as rules of law or practice.” (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    66   The obligations must not be dealt with in a perfunctory manner. The Court said this: (p 389 para 33) 
     
      
       
        
        “The result is to require the recording and heeding of a warning, if one is called for in the particular case, and the giving of effect to it in a real sense by stating reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or as a consequence of it, a particular verdict is reached. A mere recording or statement of it, without more, would amount to an empty incantation. If these criteria are not satisfied in a particular case, then the judge is to be taken as not discharging the obligation imposed by s33(3)  
        (now s17(3)) 
         that the warning be taken into account.” (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    67   Elsewhere, the Court said this: (p 390 para 37) 
     
      
       
        
        “No doubt consciousness of the importance of such a warning will be of second nature to many judges. However, as we have said, an animating principle which lies behind the requirements of s33 
         (now s17) 
         is that criminal justice not only be done but also be seen to be done. The judgment must show expressly or by necessary implication that the warning was taken into account. If the judgment does not do so, a breach of s33(3)  
        (now s17(3)) 
         has occurred. It is no answer that the trial judge is an experienced judge who was well aware of the requirement of a warning and that he or she must have taken the warning into account."" (parentheses added) 
        
       
       
      Were Warnings Required? 
       
      
    68   Before dealing with the complainant’s evidence, and whether warnings were appropriate in the context of that evidence, it is convenient to deal with the evidence of Ms Bonnie Murphy. Section 165(1)(d) is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        165 
         (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 
        
       
       
        
        …. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding; 
        
       
      
    69   On the complainant’s evidence, Ms Bonnie Murphy was a principal in the second degree. She was present, and encouraged the commission of the crime. His Honour made the following observation, to which reference has already been made: (p 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is far more likely that she condoned what went on in the room or as Miss McKay said she encouraged it.” 
        
       
      
    70   Ms Bonnie Murphy, therefore, was a witness whose evidence may be unreliable. I would have expected the trial Judge to have adverted to that issue, and to have considered the effect, if any, upon her evidence. 
     
      
    71   The Crown, in its submissions, made the following comment upon this aspect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Contrary to the usual situation with an accomplice, Ms Murphy was doing her best (albeit ineptly) not to inculpate the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    72   Whilst there is force in that submission, it really is the sort of observation which the Judge may have included, had he addressed that issue, as I believe he was obliged to do. 
     
      
    73   Turning to the complainant’s evidence, a number of aspects suggested the need for a warning: 
     
      
    · First, there was an issue of identification (s165(1)(b)). 
     
      
    · Secondly, there was an issue concerning whether the complainant was affected by drugs, or alcohol (s165(1)(c)). 
     
      
    · Thirdly, there was an issue of delay (R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362). 
     
      
    · Fourthly, in respect of vital issues (non consensual intercourse with the appellant on two occasions), the prosecution case depended entirely upon the evidence of the complainant (R v Longman (1989) 168 CLR 79). 
     
      
    74   In my view, the judgment by his Honour needed to advert to each warning, and identify “reasons why, notwithstanding such warning, or as a consequence of it, a particular verdict is reached” (Fleming (supra) (para 33)). There was no express reference to any such warnings. His Honour made some references to delay, in the context of complaints, but not otherwise. 
     
      
    75   The Crown suggested, however, that his Honour’s judgment demonstrated, by necessary implication, that the appropriate principles were applied. On the Crown’s submission, the case was not one which fell within the following precept identified by Brennan J in Bromley v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 315: (at 325) 
     
      
       
        
        “When the danger in acting upon the evidence is real and substantial and when the conduct of the trial and evidence … are such that the jury may not have fully perceived or the jury’s attention may have been diverted from the danger, a warning should be given.” 
        
       
      
    76   That sort of concept may be thought to underpin the categories of evidence that may be unreliable in s165(1). The Crown asserted that this case, rather, should be characterised as falling within the concluding words of the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in the same case: (at 325) 
     
      
       
        
        “If the danger is equally obvious to the lay mind, a failure to warn of its existence is much less likely to result in a miscarriage of justice and thus much less likely to provide a ground for quashing a conviction than if the court has a special knowledge of the danger. If the danger is so obvious that the jury are fully alive to it without a warning, no warning need be given.” 
        
       
      
    77   However, the terms of his Honour’s judgment do not necessarily imply, to my mind, that his Honour took account of each of these warnings in reaching his verdict. I believe, therefore, that there was a failure to satisfy the requirements of s17(3). 
     
      
    78   Moreover, in the context of each issue, in respect of which a warning would have been appropriate, his Honour did not refer to the evidence relevant to that issue. I would have expected him to have done so, had he taken such evidence into account. 
     
      
    79   Dealing with the issue of identification, the evidence raised a number of issues. First, the appellant produced a photograph of himself with long hair. He said the photograph depicted his hair as it was in 1982. At the time of the trial he had short hair. The complainant gave a description of him, as he was in 1982, which included a reference to short hair. 
     
      
    80   Secondly, the complainant said that he had a tear-shaped tattoo under his left eye. When pressed, she said that it may have been a mole or a freckle. The appellant gave evidence that he had a number of tattoos. They were on various limbs, and his back. He made no reference to a tattoo as described by the complainant. 
     
      
    81   Thirdly, the complainant said that he was 22 years old (she being then 14), and was one of many Murphy brothers (only some of whom she knew). He, in fact, was 18 years old. 
     
      
    82   On the other hand, the complainant gave evidence that she knew the appellant well. She had seen him almost daily for a period of six months. It was open to his Honour to accept her account. However, I believe his Honour was required to acknowledge the potential for unreliability of the complainant’s account, and provide reasons why, notwithstanding that potential, he was persuaded. I would have expected his Honour, in such reasons, to have adverted to aspects of the evidence which suggested her account may be false or mistaken. 
     
      
    83   Let me then turn to the suggestion that the complainant may have been affected by drugs. There was evidence which, if accepted, may have suggested the complainant was affected by alcohol or drugs, and that her account, therefore, may be unreliable. First, although only 14 years, she had been to licensed premises on a number of occasions. Immediately before the incident, she said that she was in the bar at The Palms nightclub, when she was approached by the appellant and Dean Murphy. 
     
      
    84   Secondly, the approach by the appellant and his brother, according to the complainant, included an invitation to smoke marijuana. The complainant (and Ms O’Riordan) accepted that invitation and left the club. 
     
      
    85   Thirdly, Ms O’Riordan, who remembered being with the complainant at The Palms nightclub, gave evidence that the complainant was “vague”, and “out of it”. She assumed that she had taken alcohol or drugs, although she had not seen her do so. 
     
      
    86   Fourthly, there were odd aspects of the complainant’s account which may have been explicable on the basis of drugs or alcohol. She had no recollection of the journey from the nightclub to the flat at Bondi. One minute she was with Ms Karen O’Riordan at the foot of the stairs at Bondi, and then Ms O’Riordan was gone. 
     
      
    87   Finally, the complainant, according to Ms O’Riordan, later acknowledged to her that she was taking heroin. 
     
      
    88   The complainant, on the other hand, gave evidence that she had no alcohol and no drugs that evening. His Honour made no reference to the potential for unreliability under s165(1)(c), nor to any of the evidence on this issue. I would have expected him to have done so. 
     
      
    89   Passing to the next issue, that of delay, the Crown said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Throughout the trial it must have been apparent to all concerned that both Crown and defence were labouring under the difficulties of adducing and testing evidence of events of some antiquity. If there had have been a jury it would have been patently obvious to the jurors as well. Once again to paraphrase from the judgment of Brennan J in  
        Bromley 
        , supra - if there was a danger, it was one that was ‘ 
        so obvious that (a) jury (would have been) fully alive to it without a warning (and so) no warning need(ed to) be given.’ 
        ” 
        
       
      
    90   However, I do not believe it was obvious. His Honour’s assessment of the appellant’s evidence, for instance, included these observations: (at 8/9) 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused alleged that he had never been to the Palms nightclub yet Karen O’Riordan said she had seen him there. Furthermore, the accused told the police that he did not know Miss McKay. That is difficult to believe because Veronica Murphy said that her husband Danny appeared to know her and as the brothers kept such a close association I would have expected the accused to have known her by sight particularly when Cathy Perrish who lived at the refuge with her and was a friend of hers used to play pinball with the accused and Dean Crockett. Consequently, as I have said I do not accept the accused as a witness of truth.” 
        
       
      
    91   Leaving aside the logic of these observations, an issue arose as to whether, on these issues, the accused simply forgot, and therefore was unreliable, rather than untruthful. Delay was relevant in determining that issue. It is not obvious to me that his Honour recognised that this was so. There are other examples. 
     
      
    92   However, I will pass to the final aspect. His Honour needed to state, in terms, that in respect of the complainant’s evidence in certain vital respects (penetration on two occasions), her evidence was unsupported. Was it reliable? That question was never posed. His Honour never acknowledged that the complainant’s evidence may be unreliable, and needed to be scrutinised with great care (Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79, per McHugh J at 107). He should have done so. He should, with respect, have evaluated her evidence, bearing in mind the warnings to which I have made reference. 
     
      
    93   In the course of such evaluation, I would have expected his Honour to have referred to the evidence of Ms Karen O’Riordan. In a number of respects, which have been described (supra para 13), the evidence of Ms O’Riordan was starkly at odds with that of the complainant, in relation to the events at The Palms nightclub. No reference was made to these differences. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    94   I believe that there were errors of law in terms of s17(2) and s17(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986. 
     
      
    95   I, therefore, believe the appeal should be allowed. However, I do not believe that, on the whole of the evidence, I can say that it was unreasonable to believe the complainant, or that the nature and quality of the evidence at trial was such that the trial Judge ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    96   I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal should be allowed. 
       
       
      2. The convictions and sentence of the appellant should be quashed. 
       
       
      3. There should be a new trial.

    1    SPIGELMAN CJ :  I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
       
      
    2    GROVE J :  This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ on 8 April 1999 in Sydney District Court. Matters of principle have been raised and leave to appeal should be granted.  
     
      
       
      
    3    The appellant was committed to the District Court for sentence pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act after pleading guilty before Lithgow Local Court to four charges namely, escaping from lawful custody; common assault (two counts) and stealing a motor vehicle. The maximum penalty for such offences was prescribed in the following enactments: Correctional Centres Act 1952, s32 - ten years penal servitude; Crimes Act 1900, s61 - two years imprisonment and Crimes Act 1900 s154AA - ten years penal servitude. Recent legislation has replaced penal servitude by imprisonment as a description of full time custody but this is not germane to any present issue.  
     
      
       
      
    4    The learned judge sentenced the appellant to a minimum term of eighteen months penal servitude with an additional term of six months for escape; eighteen months fixed term on each charge of assault and twelve months fixed term for stealing the motor vehicle. All sentences were directed to commence on 14 June 2000 and were to be served concurrently. The commencement date coincided with the expiry of the minimum term component of a sentence being served by the appellant for armed robbery which had been imposed in the ACT Supreme Court.  
     
      
       
      
    5    The facts were that on 16 September 1998 the appellant and Nick Papadatos were inmates of the Oberon Young Offenders Centre. The appellant was scheduled to become eligible for release to parole on 14 June 2000 in respect of the sentence for armed robbery then being served. Papadatos was serving a sentence after breaching a recognizance earlier granted to him and was scheduled for release on 25 January 1999. The recording on a sheet of police facts that his scheduled release date was 23 March 1999 would appear to be an error. The pair escaped by forcing wire and bars in a toilet area at the Centre. They walked to a homestead occupied by a retired couple (aged sixty three and fifty eight) at a place known as Porter’s Retreat. The escapees arrived between 10 and 11 pm and the occupants became aware of the presence of intruders when a security light switched on and they heard a door being rattled. In answer to challenge the escapees claimed that a vehicle had broken down and the occupants emerged from the house. They were threatened with a knife and a second implement which was probably a screwdriver. The victims persuaded the intruders that they had no money but they were forced to hand over the key to their car, a Mitsubishi Magna sedan. Although it was suggested that the victims would be tied up, the offenders were persuaded not to do this. The appellant used a knife to cut the telephone line.  
     
      
       
      
    6    The escapees left in the Magna sedan. The victims used a second vehicle to travel to a neighbouring house from which they raised the alarm. The appellant and Papadatos were stopped in the stolen vehicle at Mt Victoria where police conducted what was described as a dangerous vehicle stop.  
     
      
       
      
    7    At Katoomba police station Papadatos admitted escaping and stealing the car and, although he participated in the events at the homestead, he claimed that he did not have a knife and did not produce any screwdriver while he was there. The appellant declined to be interviewed.  
     
      
       
      
    8    Papadatos was dealt with in the Lithgow Local Court on identical charges to those preferred against the appellant. He was sentenced to six months fixed term for escape; six months fixed term on each count of assault and a minimum term of nine months with additional term of three months for stealing a motor vehicle. With the exception of the sentence for escape, all sentences were ordered to commence on 25 November 1998. The sentence for escape was ordered to commence on 25 January 1999, that is to say from the date upon which Papadatos was scheduled for release in respect of the sentence being served at the time of escape. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The appellant was committed to the District Court for sentence on the same day as Papadatos was dealt with and from the same court. The Local Court did not deal with the appellant as it would have been perceived that any sentence, even sentences identical to those imposed upon Papadatos, would be outside of jurisdiction having regard to extant statutory provisions now found in s58 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 viz: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “58 (1) A Local Court may not impose a sentence of imprisonment (the  
         new sentence 
         ) to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with another sentence of imprisonment (the  
         old sentence 
         ): 
         
        
        
         
          (a) …………. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) if the date on which the new sentence would end is more than 3 years after the date on which the old sentence began.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    10    Whilst this appeal was pending a series of statutes concerning sentencing and sentence administration came into effect and as a consequence a number of statutory provisions have been placed into the new coordinated legislative scheme and others have been renumbered. Where an identical provision has simply been moved into a new statute or renumbered I will use its current reference. 
     
      
       
      
    11    Freeman DCJ examined the participation of the appellant and Papadatos in the offences, compared their prior records and came to the conclusion that there was, to use his Honour’s expression “little to choose between them”. This finding was not challenged by the Crown and it was plainly correct. In the result the appellant will, in terms of the longest and encompassing sentence for escape, serve eighteen months additional to his current sentence after which he will become eligible for parole during six months additional term. In contrast, Papadatos received the longest sentence for the same group of crimes in respect of the offence of stealing the motor vehicle but the nine months minimum term commenced on the day of imposition, 25 November 1998, so that he would serve the first two months concurrently with custody that he was obliged to serve in any event. The whole of the sentence of six months for escape, although ordered to commence later on 25 January 1999, would be wholly served within the nine months minimum term and in addition, given an overall length of sentence apparently less than three years, Papadatos would be entitled to an order from the Court for his release upon the expiry of the minimum term as distinct from merely acquiring eligibility for parole: Sentencing Act 1989 ss8 and 24. 
     
      
       
      
    12    Freeman DCJ was aware of the impositions on Papadatos and in his remarks on sentence exposed his careful analysis which led him to an assessment that those sentences were manifestly inadequate. He added that they (the Local Court sentences) “do not bind me even under the principle of parity”. 
     
      
       
      
    13    The appellant contended that, in the light of the finding that there was no relevant basis for distinguishing between Papadatos and himself, he harboured a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the harshness with which he had been treated when the sentences were compared.  
     
      
       
      
    14    The principles to be applied when a question of parity between co-offenders arises were discussed in Lowe v The Queen 1984 154 CLR 606. Mason J commented that the avoidance and elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community: @ 611. 
     
      
       
      
    15    Counsel for the appellant conceded that the impositions by Freeman DCJ could not, when considered apart from the discrepancy between them and those received by Papadatos, be categorized as manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      
    16    It therefore arises for determination whether Freeman DCJ was correct in assessing the sentences imposed upon Papadatos as manifestly inadequate. I consider that he was. The objective circumstances of the four offences have been sketched above and an effective extension of custody already required to be served for previous offence, amounting to seven months, comprehensively failed to reflect the seriousness of the offences and is below the lower threshold of any range representing the sound exercise of the magistrate’s discretion. 
     
      
       
      
    17    This poses a following question of whether the principle of parity operates so that the sentences, acknowledged to be within appropriate range, received by the appellant should be reduced to or towards the inadequate sentences received by the co-offender. 
     
      
       
      
    18    In Lowe Brennan J rejected the notion that where one right and one wrong sentence were perceived, a court should address the situation by producing two wrong sentences: @ 617 and see R v Stroud 1977 65 Cr App R 150. However Mason J said that the correct principle was “that a court of appeal is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance, by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate” : @ 613-4. Dawson J (with whose reasons Wilson J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “But justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognized both here and in England that any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done ……………. This has led to the variation of sentences by courts of appeal in order to reduce the disparity between sentences separately imposed upon co-offenders even where the sentence varied was not in itself excessive. The cases suggest that there has been a greater reluctance in England than here to vary the longer sentence in such a situation. There is always the dilemma that in order to eliminate the disparity the Court may have to reduce a sentence which it regards as proper in itself because of an inadequate sentence imposed upon a co-offender. To do so, it has been observed, is to compound the error. The view has been expressed in England that a court should not interfere unless the disparity is gross or glaring and the circumstances are ‘most exceptional’ ………. The decisions in this country to not appear to be quite as restrictive as this but on any view the interference of a court of appeal is not warranted unless the disparity is such that the sentence under appeal cannot be allowed to stand without it appearing that justice has not been done. The difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice……….” @623-4. 
         
        
       
      
    19    Synthesis of these views confirms that a decision to make any reduction is discretionary. Recognizing this Hunt CJ at CL (James J agreeing, Smart J dissenting) said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The issue is whether the particular sense of grievance (or injustice) is a legitimate one. There is in my view, a stage at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so grave that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one”:  
         R v Diamond 
          unreported CCA 18 February 1993. 
         
        
       
      
    20    Freeman DCJ referred to Diamond and it can be inferred that he regarded the gravity marking the inadequacy of the sentences received by Papadatos as such that appropriate sentence for the appellant could not engender a grievance which was legitimate. 
     
      
       
      
    21    The judgments in Lowe dealt with the discretion to intervene possessed by an appellate court but a similar discretion must be possessed by a sentencing judge when faced with manifestly inadequate sentence imposed upon a co-offender whose culpability and circumstances were equivalent.  
     
      
       
      
    22    The appellant’s contentions were not limited to the simple measure of discrepancy between the sentences received and it was contended that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the circumstance that Papadatos was dealt with in a court where the maximum custody possible to be imposed was two years imprisonment whereas in the District Court the appellant faced the maxima above set out, the highest being set at ten years penal servitude.  
     
      
       
      
    23    The prescriptions for selection and limitation of jurisdiction are made by ss20 and 27 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 viz: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “20 (1) An indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily by a Local Court unless the prosecuting authority or the person charged with the offence elects in accordance with this Division to have the offence dealt with on indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         27 (1) This section prescribes the maximum penalty that may be imposed for an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 dealt with summarily under this Division in any case where the maximum penalty (when the offence is dealt with summarily) is not provided by law. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) The maximum term of imprisonment that a Local Court may impose for an offence is, subject to this section, 2 years or the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law for the offence, whichever is the shorter term.” 
         
        
       
      
    24    It was submitted that, upon true construction, these words were not merely jurisdictional but performed the same function as the specification of a maximum penalty in a statute, relevantly in this case the statutes abovementioned. The submission was sought to be supported by a variety of considerations including reference to the legislative history of delegation for trial of ranges of offences to the lower echelons of court hierarchy and language in particular statutes where there was express prescription of a different maximum penalty to be applied if an offence was tried and conviction followed summary trial or trial on indictment. Examples were the Firearms Act, s7 and the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, s31. 
     
      
       
      
    25    It was pointed out that there was no procedure for a magistrate to send a matter to a higher court, it being expressly provided that in the case of a plea of guilty an election to have a matter dealt with on indictment may not be made after the presentation of the facts relied upon by the prosecutor to prove the offence: Criminal Procedure Act, s23. It is convenient to observe at this point however, that the Second Reading Speech of the Attorney General on 24 May 1995 when the discretion previously possessed by a magistrate was removed, reveals that the purpose of change was to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system by preventing any potential situation wherein a trier of facts would need to be privy to information, in particular the antecedent record of the defendant, before reaching a verdict. In articulating the dilemma of a magistrate, whether he or she should proportion a matter presently before the Local Court against the jurisdictional maximum of two years imprisonment as that appropriate to a “worst case” and/or “worst offender”, the argument touched upon but did not answer the central issue of contention. 
     
      
       
      
    26    Attention was drawn to the apparent existing practice of utilization of Local Court jurisdiction and particular reference was made to the revelation of a median sentence of four months for offences of escape in the statistics collected by the Judicial Commission. 
     
      
       
      
    27    None of these considerations is determinative of the true construction of the statute nor are they so in combination. Determination turns upon what I have called the central issue, which is whether the statutory provision of a maximum available penalty of two years in s27(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act has the effect of making a higher prescribed statutory maximum for a particular offence irrelevant to a sentence determination by a magistrate exercising the jurisdiction of the Local Court. 
     
      
       
      
    28    The question has not previously been directly raised in this Court but it has been dealt with in similar context elsewhere. Of course, each of those instances was determined within the sphere of operation of local legislative provisions but it is unnecessary to recite in detail all of these as a clear approach to the matter of principle can be discerned. 
     
      
       
      
    29    In Queensland in R v Doyle 1987 30 A Crim R 1 Shepherdson J said, and although the other members of the Court, Connolly and Vasta JJ, reached a different conclusion as to result, they did not dissent from this statement:  
     
      
       
        
         
         “Because he was dealt with summarily the maximum penalty to which he was exposed on each charge was imprisonment with hard labour for two years. 
         
        
        
         
         It may be that the stipendiary magistrate thought, when sentencing this respondent, that that two years’ term of imprisonment had to be reserved for the worst type of breaking and entering with intent. If that were his view then with respect he was wrong. The maximum penalty for housebreaking that is breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent is imprisonment with hard labour for fourteen years. It is my view that when housebreaking and similar offences are dealt with by magistrates under s443(eb) then there may well frequently be occasions when they will impose sentences of two years’ imprisonment or slightly less. A magistrate, in deciding whether to deal with a housebreaking or similar offence under s443(eb) should look at the spectrum of sentences up to the maximum term for the particular offence and if he elects to deal with the case summarily he may impose a penalty within that range taking care not to exceed the maximum term prescribed by s443 namely imprisonment with hard labour for two years.” 
         
        
       
      
    30    In South Australia in Canino v Venning 1993 66 A Crim R 92 Perry J observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It is true that in the case of a ceiling on the maximum sentence which may be imposed in a court exercising summary jurisdiction, the court should first look to the maximum sentence imposed by the relevant statute, and work to that. If a penalty is arrived at by that process beyond the jurisdictional maximum, the jurisdictional maximum will confine the penalty to be imposed…….” 
         
        
       
      
    31    The same view was expressed in a Full Court in Higgins v Fricker 1992 63 A Crim R 475 where Mullighan J said, dealing with an offence for which there was a prescribed statutory maximum of five years imprisonment but a jurisdictional limit of two years imprisonment available when it was dealt with by a special magistrate in a court of summary jurisdiction: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The limitation on the sentence which may be imposed by a magistrate does not create the maximum penalty for the offence. The maximum remains at five years.” 
         
        
       
      
    32    In the Northern Territory, a series of cases contained observations to like effect: Sultan v Svikart 1989 96 FLR 457; Maynard v O’Brien 1991 105 FLR 58. In Kumantjara v Harris 1992 109 FLR 400, Kearney J noted that it was incorrect for a magistrate to regard the maximum penalty within his jurisdiction (two years imprisonment) as reserved for the “worst case” of the type of offence before the Court and endorsed the statement by Shepherdson J in the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal above cited.  
     
      
       
      
    33    In Victoria in Hansford v His Honour Judge Neesham 1995 2 VR 253 Brooking J (Hampel and Smith JJ agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Section 113 (of the Victorian Sentencing Act) accepts as of course it must, that all offences covered by s53(1) have a maximum penalty fixed by the law and operates by way of limiting the power of the inferior court, by depriving it of the power which the conferring of the jurisdiction to hear and determine would otherwise give it - the power to inflict anything up to the maximum penalty - in the sense that that power is cut down to a power to pass no more than a two year sentence of imprisonment. 
         
        
        
         
         If two years were to be treated as reserved for the worst category of case of robbery, as the appellant contends, extraordinary results would ensue. The indictable offences which may be tried summarily under s53 of the Magistrates’ Court Act include, for example, offences punishable by three years’ imprisonment, so that on the appellant’s argument these offences would have to be treated as punishable by the same maximum sentence as robbery, 12½ years. So, on the appellant’s argument, a ‘middle of the range’ robbery might be expected to attract, other things being equal, the same sentence as a ‘middle of the range’ threat to inflict serious injury, the offence constituting item 3 of Sch.4 to the Magistrates’ Court Act, for which the maximum penalty is three years (Crimes Act s21). I think it is absurd to suggest that the statutory maximum for an offence is irrelevant to the determination by a magistrate of the appropriate sentence. The result of accepting the appellant’s argument would be that all indictable offences triable summarily would have to be treated as offences of the same degree of gravity. This is, if I may say so, sentencing nonsense.” 
         
        
       
      
    34    It should be acknowledged that there have been comments that the jurisdictional ceiling in a magistrate’s court should be regarded as appropriate to a “worst case” which is proper to be tried summarily. There are obvious practical difficulties in assessing the lastmentioned quality in advance of forum selection. However comments to this effect by Starke J and Murphy J in Freeman v Harris 1980 VR 267 were identified as obiter dicta by Brooking J in Hansford and disapproved in that case. The comment by Kearney J in Freeman v Pulford 1988 92 FLR 122 referring to different maximum sentences should be considered in the light of his Honour’s subsequent express adoption of the principle as expressed by Shepherdson J in Doyle. 
     
      
       
      
    35    The result of true construction of the statutory provisions in New South Wales is that, what has been prescribed is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. In other words, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The implication of the argument of the appellant that, in lieu of prescribed maximum penalties exceeding two years imprisonment, a maximum of two years imprisonment for all offences triable summarily in the Local Court has been substituted, must be rejected. As must also be rejected, the corollary that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be reserved for a “worst case”. 
     
      
       
      
    36    That conclusion is compatible with the observation of Allen J (Smart and Dunford JJ agreeing) in R v Young unreported CCA 27 October 1993: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It is not the function of Local Courts to give less than appropriate sentences because the matters are being dealt with in the Local Court rather than in the District Court or the Supreme Court.” 
         
        
       
      
    37    The question arises whether when dealing with a matter in a higher court cognizance should be taken of a circumstance that the offence was within lower court jurisdiction and could have been dealt with there. In a number of cases the circumstance that a matter could have been dealt with in a Local Court has been referred to as a matter of sentence mitigation.  
     
      
       
      
    38    In Western Australia in R v Miller 1989 44 A Crim R 185 Wallace J (Malcolm CJ and Brinsden J agreeing) stated that the fact that an offence, dealt with in a higher court, could have been dealt with in a court of summary jurisdiction with consequent ceiling on available maximum penalty may be taken into consideration in relation to argument of overall excessiveness. 
     
      
       
      
    39    This was cited with approval in this Court by Hunt CJ at CL (Smart and Studdert JJ agreeing) in R v Sandford 1994 72 A Crim R 160 when he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The judge also rejected the submission that, because the charge could have been dealt with in the Local Court, he should impose a sentence no higher than would have been imposed in that Court (where the maximum sentence was imprisonment for two years and/or a fine of $2,000). That submission was put too broadly and it was correctly rejected. It will usually be appropriate to take into account the fact that the offence could have been dealt with summarily:  
         Miller 
          (1989) 44 A Crim R 185;  
         Bardo 
          (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 14 July 1992) at p 1. But it is not a universal rule.” 
         
        
       
      
    40    There have been observations to like effect in R v Dalton-Morgan unreported CCA 14 December 1989; R v Smith unreported CCA 11 September 1991 and R v Crombie (1999) NSWCCA 297.  
     
      
       
      
    41    In Crombie (a two judge bench) Wood CJ at CL (Simpson J agreeing) after reference to cases in which the Court had acknowledged the relevance of the consideration that a matter could be dealt with in a Local Court to the exercise of discretion by a sentencing judge, said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “None of those decisions go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Moreover, where it appears that in the circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal.” 
         
        
       
      
    42    It was submitted by the Crown that these cases do not expose any reasoning underlying a principle that the availability of summary jurisdiction and lower ceiling of penalty should be a matter of mitigation. The cases reveal that the circumstance can, rather than should, be a matter of mitigation. All offenders in the relevant situation would have lost the chance of being dealt with within the restrictions applicable in the summary court and for that reason that chance should not be ignored. The significance of the loss of that chance would undoubtedly vary from case to case and in some cases it would contribute to mitigation, in others, not. I see no reason to depart from the approach taken in those cases but they are authority for the proposition that it is a matter to be taken into account and not a universal factor for reduction of sentence.  
     
      
       
      
    43    Freeman DCJ neither accepted nor rejected the loss of such a chance as germane to the sentences to be imposed upon the appellant. His Honour did however, when rejecting assessment in parity with the sentences imposed on Papadatos, say that he should approach (and therefore set) the sentences at “the bottom of the range of adequacy”. That approach was taken for example in R v Capper 1993 69 A Crim R 64 when Anderson J said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “When a co-offender has been treated with excessive leniency, justice may sufficiently be done if the prisoner receives as lenient as sentence as can be justified within the accepted range for this kind of offence in the light of matters personal to the prisoner, including his record ….” 
         
        
       
      
    44    The appellant did not challenge the learned judge’s expressed aim but contended that the sentence imposed did not achieve it. He relied upon the available statistics relating to escape from custody (upon which he received the longest and encompassing sentence) but he acknowledged that there had to be taken into account the further offences committed whilst at large. In a table relating to impositions other than in the Local Court, for the offence of escaping from lawful custody (examined in isolation) 76 percent of a sample of 393 cases of “all offenders” received minimum terms of less than eighteen months and only 7 percent received longer minimum terms than the appellant. Even allowing for the additional offences for which sentences were ordered to be served concurrently, I consider that the appellant’s challenge that the aim of setting a sentence at the bottom of the range was not achieved has been made good. 
     
      
       
      
    45    The final, and separate argument, advanced on behalf of the appellant related to the absence of departure from the proportion of division into minimum and additional terms specified in s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 by reason of the special circumstances of the appellant. The only reference to special circumstances in his Honour’s remarks on sentence was an observation that the sentence previously imposed in the ACT Supreme Court had such an adjustment. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “No doubt the special circumstances his Honour would have had in mind would have included the youth of the prisoner, the fact that he had not previously been before the courts, certainly the fact that he was going into custody for the first time, and also in all probability, judging by the material in this Court, an indication that the prisoner had promise in terms of his capacity to be rehabilitated.” 
         
        
       
      
    46    No further reference was made. The absence of statement that special circumstances have been considered can be an indication that the matter has been overlooked: R v Moses Bo Too unreported CCA 16 July 1992.  
     
      
       
      
    47    However in the present case, save the youth of the appellant, there is little to found a finding deriving from special circumstances that there is a need for an extended term of supervision on parole. The matters which his Honour had perceived would have operated at the time of assessment of sentence in the ACT Supreme Court had changed. The appellant was no longer as youthful, it was not his first commitment to prison and the conduct giving rise to his appearance before the Court undermined the promise of rehabilitation earlier foreseen.  
     
      
       
      
    48    In summary, I consider the appellant has made good his argument on two grounds. First the omission to consider whether the loss of the chance that the matters might have been dealt with in the jurisdictionally limited Local Court. I do not overlook that the actual loss to the appellant was inevitably the result of his own previous criminality combined with the operation of s58 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and it is likely therefore that the lost chance would be estimated to have had little, if any, value but no decision on the issue was made. The second, and more important, ground was the failure to achieve the aim of setting a sentence towards the bottom of the available range as was his Honour’s explicit intention. 
     
      
       
      
    49    The intervention of this Court being attracted, it falls for it to resentence the appellant and to exercise its own discretions. Although it is well established that this Court does not allow an appeal against sentence simply because it would have itself have imposed a lesser sentence on an appellant, once ground for intervention has been established it is appropriate to implement its own view on resentence.  
     
      
       
      
    50    A comparison of the minimum term elements of the sentences received by the offenders shows that for the same crimes and without relevant distinction in culpability, Papadatos is to serve seven additional months and the appellant, eighteen months. I would for myself assess the difference between the sentences, particularly having regard to the minimum term elements, as manifestly excessive. Cf Lowe per Dawson J @ 624.  
     
      
       
      
    51    I am of a further view, however, that the sentences received by Papadatos were so grossly inadequate that, in accordance with the principles adumbrated above and in particular the remarks of Anderson J in Capper, the sentences should not be reduced to that level. I have earlier made reference to some statistics supplied by and relied upon by counsel. Those statistics isolated the offence of escape from custody and cannot be directly applied because the principle of totality requires weight to be given to the three further serious offences, the two assaults and stealing the motor vehicle. 
     
      
       
      
    52    I would not find that there are special circumstances requiring departure from the formula specified in s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The resentence by this Court should be set in terms of this Act: R v Carrion (2000) NSWCCA 191. 
     
      
       
      
    53    I would make the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
       (1) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
        
       (2) Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
        
        
       (3) In lieu thereof, the appellant sentenced as follows: 
        
        
        (a) For escaping lawful custody: imprisonment for sixteen months with a non parole period of twelve months, each to commence on 14 June 2000; 
        
        
        (b) For each offence of assault: imprisonment for nine months commencing on 14 June 2000 and, 
        
        
        (c) For stealing a motor vehicle: imprisonment for six months commencing on 14 June 2000. 
        
        
       (4) All sentences to be served concurrently. 
        
        
       (5) No non parole period set in respect of the sentences for the assaults which will be wholly subsumed within the non parole period fixed in respect of the offence of escape. 
        
        
       (6) 13 June 2001 specified as the earliest date upon which the appellant would become eligible for release on parole.

     JUDGMENT 
    1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
     ********** 
    2   GROVE J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Kirby J in draft form. Save the specification of a non-parole period exactly equivalent to the minimum term imposed by Backhouse DCJ, I agree with that judgment. 
     
      
    3   It seems to me that the conclusions that the sentences in the District Court were manifestly inadequate and that the case was not one for the exercise of the residual discretion of this court to dismiss a Crown appeal could not stand consistently with a resentence in which the mandatory period of custody did not vary, and necessarily vary upwards. 
     
      
    4   For the reasons given by Kirby J there is cause for optimism about the respondent’s future which I share but in my opinion the very least non parole period should be one fixed at two and one half years. 
     
      
    5   I would allow the Crown appeal and quash the sentences below and in lieu thereof sentence the respondent on each count to imprisonment for four years with a non parole period of two and one half years, sentence and non parole period commencing on 1 June 1999. Sentences to be served concurrently and earliest date of eligibility for parole specified as 30 November 2001.   
     
     ********** 
    6   KIRBY J: This is a Crown appeal against sentence (s5D Criminal Appeal, Act 1912). The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against the sentence imposed by her Honour Judge Backhouse QC upon Daniel Brent Kenneth Ridgeway on 11 February 2000. 
     
      
    7   Mr Ridgeway pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (s97(1) Crimes Act, 1900). He also asked her Honour to take account of a number of offences which were included on Form 1. There were ten such charges, as follows: 
     
      
    · two charges of malicious damage to property (s195 Crimes Act) 
     
      
    · five charges of stealing 
     
      
    · a charge of receiving (s188 Crimes Act) 
     
      
    · a charge of possessing without lawful excuse implements capable of being used to enter a conveyance (s114 Crimes Act) 
     
      
    · possessing a prohibited drug (s25 Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act, 1985) 
     
      
    8   Taking account of the matters on Form 1, Backhouse DCJ imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment on each charge. The sentences were concurrent. Her Honour found special circumstances. She fixed, in respect of each charge, a minimum term of two years, with an additional term of one year. 
     
      
       
      The Circumstances of Each Charge 
       
      
    9   Each robbery displayed some planning, although not much. Mr Ridgeway, on both occasions, was in company. The crime was, in each case, captured on film by surveillance cameras. In neither case did Mr Ridgeway attempt to alter his appearance by disguise. When the surveillance films were viewed by police, Mr Ridgeway was immediately recognised. 
     
      
    10   The first robbery took place on 18 May 1999. Money was demanded from a female attendant in a video store in Liverpool. The offence occurred at 7.50 pm. The circumstances were described in a document placed before her Honour, which was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Upon entering the store the prisoner looked around whilst the co-accused Smith and two further unidentified co-accused kept watch at the front of the store. At this point in time the prisoner approached the store attendant, Jean Mulheron, and handed her a $5.00 note requesting change. The victim Mulheron opened the cash register with the view of giving change when all of a sudden the prisoner produced a hypodermic syringe which he pointed towards the victim and demanded, ‘Give me the money.’” 
        
       
      
    11   The attendant was terrified. Having emptied the contents of the cash register into a plastic bag, Mr Ridgeway, at the suggestion of his companion, then demanded that she turn out her pockets. More money was taken, making a total of $300. 
     
      
    12   A victim impact statement was placed before the sentencing Judge. The person from whom the demand was made continues to re-live the terror of that night. It has effected her confidence. It has made her suspicious. She has experienced depression, although she has made some recovery. 
     
      
    13   The second robbery occurred within a matter of days. It took place on 31 May 1999. Mr Ridgeway and a companion entered a service station. The companion had a machete. The offence occurred late at night (11.50 pm). Again the victim was a female attendant. Money was demanded. The attendant produced $170 from the register. It was placed in a plastic bag. Mr Ridgeway and his associate then left the service station by car. 
     
      
    14   The police were immediately notified. A description of the car, and the offenders, was provided. Within twenty minutes the car was intercepted. It was searched, and the machete was found. Mr Ridgeway’s companion was also found to have the money which had been stolen (or so much of it as remained after the purchase of cigarettes). Notwithstanding the video surveillance film, Mr Ridgeway, at first, denied any involvement. He later, however, acknowledged his part in the crime. 
     
      
       
      The Form 1 Offences 
       
      
    15   Mr Ridgeway was born on 30 November 1978. He is therefore 21 years old. The Form 1 offences occurred when he was 19 years old. They span a period of time between December 1997 and 17 May 1998. The charges of malicious damage apparently arose out of an argument with his sister. They occurred in March 1998. The damage in each case was to a window in his sister’s home. 
     
      
    16   There were several offences of stealing which Mr Ridgeway acknowledged. They related to the same period (March 1998). Individual charges of theft were laid in respect of a CD player, a video and television, and a blender. The receiving charge related to 17 compact discs found in Mr Ridgeway’s possession when he was searched by the police. The implements in his possession were car keys. The prohibited drug was a small rock of heroin. The other two stealing charges related to a video game play station, and to a wallet said to belong to his employer. 
     
      
    17   Individually these charges were not as serious as many which come before these Courts. Collectively, nonetheless, they demonstrated a problem. Mr Ridgeway, as he later acknowledged, had chosen at this time to live outside the law. 
     
      
       
      The Subjective Case of Mr Ridgeway 
       
      
    18   The subjective features of Mr Ridgeway’s case provided a strong counterpoint to this bleak picture. Mr Ridgeway had experienced considerable hardship in his early years. His father, apparently, had spent much of his life in gaol. Mr Ridgeway first met his father at the age of 12 years. Soon thereafter his father again disappeared from his life. In his early childhood he and his sister were abandoned by their mother. He was thereafter cared for by his grandmother until she died, and then by his aunt. He showed some promise at school, but was obliged to leave early to earn a living. He obtained work as an apprentice chef. He completed part of a TAFE course as a cook. Again, for economic reasons, he was obliged to abandon that course. He became a labourer, working as a furniture removalist. He fell into bad company, and began experimenting with drugs. He smoked marijuana and later heroin. On three occasions he used heroin intravenously. 
     
      
    19   For the purposes of sentence, he was interviewed by Ms Katherine Barrier, psychologist. She furnished a report dated 4 February 2000. Her report provides some basis for optimism. First, she detected in Mr Ridgeway no serious psychopathology. Secondly, she saw what she regarded as genuine remorse. Judge Backhouse accepted that Mr Ridgeway had shown remorse. 
     
      
    20   Thirdly, Ms Barrier also saw genuine dismay, on the part of Mr Ridgeway, as to the way in which his life had rapidly fallen apart, under the influence of drugs. He had resolved, in the future, to have nothing to do with drugs. He had successfully maintained that resolve within prison, notwithstanding the availability of drugs. He had undergone a number of urine tests, and been found to be drug free. 
     
      
    21   Fourthly, Ms Barrier believed Mr Ridgeway may benefit from further formal education. He expressed an intention of pursuing the Higher School Certificate. 
     
      
    22   There is a further reason for optimism. Mr Ridgeway has re-established his relationship with his mother, who is now living in Kempsey. He also has the support of a family friend, Mr Bourke. Mr Bourke gave evidence on his behalf before Backhouse DCJ. Mr Ridgeway, therefore, is not as isolated as he was. 
     
      
    23   Unquestionably, there was, therefore, a strong subjective case made out on behalf of Mr Ridgeway. 
     
      
       
      Complaints by the Crown 
       
      
    24   Her Honour, in her remarks on sentence, referred to the guideline judgment (R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346). She said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “I also mention at this point of time that the Court of Criminal Appeal in its decision in  
        R v Henry 
        , which was, I think, a Bench of five judges, gave their judgment on 12 May last year and laid down guidelines in respect of offences of this kind. Indeed, the Court at page 58 of its judgement set out in paragraph 162 a number of factors which it indicated that crimes involving those factors would normally call for a sentence within a range of - to generally fall between four and five years for the full term and that aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the average, which itself is a starting point.” 
        
       
      
    25   The Crown identified four matters which should have been regarded by the sentencing Judge as features of aggravation. 
     
      
    26   First, the guideline judgment was concerned with one armed robbery. Mr Ridgeway was being sentenced for two such robberies. 
     
      
    27   Secondly, the offences acknowledged in Form 1 could not be ignored. Applying the principle of totality, the sentence needed to reflect the criminality involved in all offences. 
     
      
    28   Thirdly, the robberies occurred during the currency of a recognisance imposed upon Mr Ridgeway on 17 May 1998, and expressed to bind him for a period of one year. Indeed, the first robbery occurred the day after that recognisance had been imposed (18 May 1998). 
     
      
    29   Fourthly, the threat offered in the first robbery, at the video store, was a syringe. The use of a syringe as a weapon has been especially condemned by the Court of Criminal Appeal (R v Micallef (CCA, unreported, 3 November 1997)). 
     
      
    30   The Crown asserted, therefore, that in selecting a sentence one year below the minimum term in the range suggested by the guideline judgment, her Honour had failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences (R v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594). 
     
      
       
      The Response on Behalf of Mr Ridgeway 
       
      
    31   Counsel for Mr Ridgeway responded to these arguments in a number of ways. 
     
      
    32   First, her Honour was entitled to discount the sentence which she imposed by reason of the co-operation of Mr Ridgeway, and his plea of guilty. The victim thought that Mr Ridgeway had a syringe. However, it was concealed within his sleeve. She was, therefore, unsure. In these circumstances, although conviction for robbery was inevitable, conviction for robbery using a syringe was not. For my part I do not find such an argument persuasive. At best, it removes one aspect of aggravation, namely, the syringe. The offence remains that of armed robbery. 
     
      
    33   Secondly, it was said on behalf of Mr Ridgeway that there were no aggravating features associated with the syringe. It was not filled with blood. There was no reference to AIDS (which might engender even greater terror). Again, however, I do not find such an argument attractive. The threat from a syringe is implicitly a threat of infection through AIDS. A syringe is hardly a weapon without such a threat. 
     
      
    34   Thirdly, it was said that the offence demonstrated little planning. However, the profile of a typical offence under the guideline judgment (to which I will shortly refer) assumes little or no planning. 
     
      
    35   Fourthly, Mr Ridgeway received no discount for having provided assistance to the authorities. Yet, it was argued, he might legitimately have claimed such a discount, he having provided the police with the name of his co-offender in the first robbery. I do not believe, however, that naming Mr Smith can be regarded as assistance, or, at least, can be regarded as useful assistance (cf The Queen v Yenice (1994) 72 A Crim R 234, per Hunt CJ at CL at 239). Mr Ridgeway was made aware at the time of his arrest that Mr Smith had already been interviewed, and arrested. He simply provided a narrative in response to the questions asked by the police. The narrative happened to include (appropriately) Mr Smith, who was involved. 
     
      
    36   It was further submitted that Backhouse DCJ was not in error in attaching considerable significance to the strong subjective case of Mr Ridgeway. On this aspect, three arguments were advanced on behalf of Mr Ridgeway.  
     
      
    37   First, whatever the objective gravity of the charges, they must be weighed along with the individual circumstances of the person being sentenced. Mahoney ACJ in R v Lattouf (CCA, unreported, 12 December 1996) said this: (at 7) 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles which will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it. That is clear from what I have said as to the principles in  
        Readman 
         and  
        Roberts 
        . But there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard; there are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve. Paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case. To see the sentencing process as involving no more than stern punishment for each offender is not merely simplistic; it damages the public interest. A sentencing process which is seen by the public merely as draconian and not just will lose the support of those whom it is designed to protect. If a sentencing process does not achieve justice, it should be put aside.” 
        
       
      
    38   Secondly, even in the context of an armed robbery, the requirements of justice may demand a non-custodial sentence in an exceptional case (cf R v Govinden [1999] NSWCCA 118, a decision made after R v Henry (supra)). Whilst a non-custodial sentence was not suggested on behalf of Mr Ridgeway, nonetheless, the capacity of subjective circumstances to ameliorate a sentence which may otherwise be appropriate must be recognised. 
     
      
    39   Thirdly, although her Honour found special circumstances, she did not significantly moderate the sentence on that account. She imposed a head sentence of three years which would suggest (according to the statutory formula) a minimum term of two years and three months. Instead, her Honour fixed a minimum term of two years, a discount of three months. 
     
      
    40   In these circumstances, it was submitted on behalf of Mr Ridgeway, that the Court should not interfere. Spigelman CJ made the following remark in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85: (at para 19) 
     
      
       
        
        “The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified in the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred.” 
        
       
      
    41   See Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310. 
     
      
    42   In Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295, the Court said this: (at 299/300) 
     
      
       
        
        “An appeal by the Crown against sentence has long been accepted in this country as cutting across the time-honoured concepts of criminal administration by putting in jeopardy for the second time the freedom beyond the sentence imposed. That being so, a ‘court entrusted with the jurisdiction to grant or refuse such leave should give careful and distinct consideration to the question whether the Attorney-General has discharged the onus of persuading it that the circumstances are such as to bring the particular case within the rare category in which a grant of leave to the Attorney-General to appeal against sentence is justified.’” (footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    43   It was submitted on behalf of Mr Ridgeway that the Court should not intervene, on the basis that there was no error of principle. Alternatively, if the Court feels constrained to intervene, it should not disturb the minimum term imposed by her Honour. 
     
      
       
      The Sentencing Guidelines 
       
      
    44   The assumptions behind the sentencing guidelines match, almost exactly, the circumstances of Mr Ridgeway in respect of each robbery. The category of case towards which the guideline was directed in R v Henry was identified by Spigelman CJ in these terms (R v Henry (supra)): (at 380, para 162) 
     
      
       
        
        “It appears from the cases that come to this Court, including the present proceedings, that there is a category of case which is sufficiently common for purposes of determining a guideline: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Small amount taken; 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    45   Spigelman CJ said this in relation to such a case: (at 380, para 165) 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. I have arrived at this figure after drawing on the collective knowledge of the other four members of the Court with respect to sentence ranges. I have also reviewed the sentences which this Court has imposed on occasions when it has intervened, including in Crown appeals where the principle of double jeopardy applies. The proposed range is broadly consistent with this body of prior decisions in this Court.” 
        
       
      
    46   The Chief Justice added: (at 381, para 169) 
     
      
       
        
        “Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range as this Court’s prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point.” 
        
       
      
    47   The matters relevant to an adjustment of the sentence were identified in these terms: (at 381, para 170) 
     
      
       
        
        “In addition to factors which may arise in any case, for example, youth, offender’s criminal record, co-operation with authorities, guilty plea in the absence of a strong case, rehabilitation efforts, offence committed whilst on bail etc, a number of circumstances are particular to the offence of armed robbery. These include: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) nature of the weapon; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) vulnerability of the victim; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) position on a scale of impulsiveness/planning; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) intensity of threat, or actual use, of force; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) number of offenders; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) amount taken; 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) effect on victim(s).” 
        
       
      
    48   Here there were, as the Crown asserts, matters of aggravation. Even giving full weight to the issues identified on behalf of Mr Ridgeway, including the strong subjective case, there was no warrant, in my view, for the sentence falling below a term of four years. A term of less than four years did not, in my view, adequately reflected the totality of the criminality involved. I believe, therefore, that there was error. 
     
      
    49   Further, where a sentencing Judge proposes to depart from the guidelines, the reason for doing so should be stated. It should not, in my view, be left to inference. 
     
      
    50   Addressing the issue of re-sentencing, I believe, as did Backhouse DCJ, that there are special circumstances. The youth of Mr Ridgeway, the fact that it is his first time in custody, and his prospects of rehabilitation, make it appropriate that he be considered for parole somewhat earlier than the usual statutory period. 
     
      
    51   Fixing the appropriate period presents some difficulty. Were I sentencing Mr Ridgeway for the first time, I should be inclined to fix a period of two and a half years as an appropriate non-parole period. I recognise, however, that, being a Crown appeal, there is an element of double jeopardy. In the circumstances, I am persuaded that the non-parole period fixed by her Honour should not be disturbed. 
     
      
    52   I, therefore, suggest the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal should be allowed. 
       
       
      2. The sentence should be quashed. 
       
       
      3. In lieu of such sentence, Mr Ridgeway should be sentenced to 4 years imprisonment, commencing on 1 June 1999 and expiring on 31 May 2003. That there should be a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 June 1999 and expiring on 31 May 2001. Mr Ridgeway will be eligible for release on parole on 1 June 2001.

       Matter No.50093/98 
         
        
       
      
     2     
     I will deal first with the stated case in matter No. 55593/98. It is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
       THE PROCEEDINGS 
        
        
       1. The proceedings are one of three concurrent prosecutions brought by the Environmental Protection Authority as Prosecutor against Rodney Scott TAYLOR, the Defendant, alleging that the Defendant has committed offences against section 33(1) of the Pesticides Act 1978 (NSW), being use of a registered pesticide in careless disregard of an instruction on a registered pesticide label. 
        
        
       2. The Defendant on notice moved for dismissal of the proceedings on the ground that no information was laid by the Prosecutor in accordance with section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978. I heard the said motion on 11 September 1998 and delivered my Reasons for Judgment on 5 November 1998. 
        
        
       3. In delivering my Reasons, I proposed to dismiss the Defendant’s motion and the Defendant requested me to state questions of law pursuant to section 5A(1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal. I agreed to that request. 
        
        
       FACTS 
        
        
       I made the following findings of fact: 
        
        
       4. The prosecutor commenced each of these proceedings by way of summons filed on 2 June 1998 seeking an order under section 41 Land and Environment Court Act 1979 to appear. The order was issued on the same day. 
        
        
       5. The offence to which the summons refers is alleged to have been committed on or about 4 June 1997. 
        
        
       6. The Prosecutor clearly intended to commence the proceedings by way of summons in an attempt to comply with the procedure for commencement established by the Supreme Court Rules as they apply in the Land and Environment Court. 
        
        
       7. The Environmental Protection Authority is the party informing the Court of the offences alleged. 
        
        
       8. Each summons contains particulars of the offence alleged by stating the particular instruction which has been disregarded. 
        
        
       9. The Defendant has not sought further particulars of the offences disclosed by the summonses. He can still do so. 
        
        
       REASONS FOR DECISION 
        
        
       10. The Defendant submitted that section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978 requires proceedings for an offence against that Act to be commenced by way of information. I did not accede to that submission. 
        
        
       11. Section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978 provides 
        
        
         
          
           
           “Except as provided by subsection (4), proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be commenced by information laid within 12 months after the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed.” 
           
          
         
        
        
       12. The Defendant submitted that to the extent there is an inconsistency between section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978 and Part 75 rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules, as adapted by Part 6 rule 2(d) of the Land and Environment Court Rules, which provides that 
        
        
         
          
           
           “Proceedings for an offence under any Act which may be taken before the Court in its summary jurisdiction shall be commenced in the Court by summons claiming an order under  
           section 41 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1970 (NSW) 
            in respect of the offence and claiming that the defendant be dealt with according to law for commission of the offence.” (underlining is the necessary adaptation) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
          
         
         
         the former special provision prevails over the latter general provision. I acceded to that submission however, for the reasons given in paragraphs 13 to 21 inclusive (below), I found that there was no inconsistency. 
         
        
        
       13. I held that the provision in section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978 for commencement of proceedings by information is not a mandatory provision. 
        
        
       14. I distinguished John L Pty Ltd v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 514 on the ground that the majority of the Court treated the procedure outlined by the Consumer Protection Act 1969 section 56(4) as mandatory. 
        
        
       15. I held that the object of section 59(3) Pesticides Act is to establish a procedure for the commencement of proceedings against those who breach the provisions of the Act, which may begin with the laying of an information, but also may be initiated by a procedure which is fundamentally consistent with that procedure. I held that the general object of the Pesticides Act is achieved if the proceedings in the present case are commenced by summons. I therefore considered that the term “may” in referring to an information in section 59(3) is only directory. 
        
        
       16. I further held that proceedings may be commenced pursuant to section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978 by information or by other relevant initiating process which performs the same function as an information. 
        
        
       17. I held that it is the duty of the Court to reconcile the operation of competing statutes where it is possible. 
        
        
       18. I held that it was relevant to whether a summons can satisfy the requirements for the initiation of proceedings under section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978 that the term “information” can include an indictment (R v Hull (1989) 16 NSWLR 385 at 389). 
        
        
       19. I held that the mere presence of the word “lay” or “laid” in a statutory provision providing for the commencement of proceedings by information by itself does not exclude an initiating process by means other than information. 
        
        
       20. I held that permitting, in certain circumstances, a summons to initiate proceedings for an offence against s 33(1) Pesticides Act 1978 would not render s 40 of that Act meaningless. 
        
        
       21. I held that the summons filed in these proceedings performed the same function as an information and therefore satisfied the requirements of section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978. 
        
        
       22. I held that the proceedings have been correctly commenced notwithstanding the fact that they have been commenced by summons. 
        
        
       23. The Defendant submitted, in the alternative, that the proceedings were void on the grounds that the summons was not sufficiently particular. The text of the summons was: 
        
        
         
         “The Prosecutor claims: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           1. An order that the Defendant, Rodney Scott Taylor of 1 Holman Street, Kempsey in the State of New South Wales appear before a Judge of the Court to answer to the charge that on or about 4 June 1997 at 73 Tozer Street, West Kempsey in the said State, he committed an offence against section 33(1) of the Pesticides Act 1978 (NSW) (“the Act”), in that, not being a person authorised under section 25 of the Act, he did, in using a registered pesticide, carelessly disregard an instruction on a label affixed to a container in which he knew or had reasonable cause to suspect the registered pesticide to have been, there being a registered label for an approved container for the pesticide that contains that instruction. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Particulars 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) Registered Pesticide: Ficam W Insecticide 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) Instruction: “Do not allow contact with mattresses, bedclothes or clothing” 
           
          
         
        
        
       24. The Defendant submitted that the summons did not contain the essential particular as to the act constituting and the manner of committing the offence because 
        
        
         
         (i) the relevant instruction contained multiple parts; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) the summons did not identify which aspect of the instruction was alleged to have been disregarded; and 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) no acts or omissions were particularised. 
         
        
        
       25. The Defendant further submitted that there is no statutory provision applicable to the proceedings permitting amendment of the summons to cure the lack of an essential particular or preventing objection on the grounds of such a defect. The Defendant submitted that section 43 of the Land and Environment Court Act does not apply to proceedings commenced by information pursuant to section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978. 
        
        
       26. The Defendant submitted in the alternative that, if the said section 43 applies to the proceedings, that section would not cure invalidity due to the failure of the initiating process to specify an essential element of the charge. 
        
        
       27. I did not accede to these submissions. 
        
        
       28. I held that the summons was sufficiently particular. 
        
        
       29. I further held that section 43 of the Land and Environment Court Act applies to the proceedings and that this provision empowers the Court to ignore defects in initiating processes. 
        
        
       30. The Prosecutor had submitted in the alternative that if I found that section 59(3) Pesticides Act required the proceedings to be commenced by way of information, that the summons filed herein “served as” an information. The Defendant submitted that, if the summons was otherwise held to “serve as” an information, no informant was identified and the summons is not in its terms a statement by an informant that the Defendant committed an offence. Ultimately, the point did not arise because I held that the proceedings were not required to be commenced by way of information. However, I considered the submissions on this point in determining the validity of the summons. I held that the summons identified the Environmental Protection Authority as prosecutor and therefore that the Environmental Protection Authority is the party informing the Court of the offences alleged. I held that the summons is valid. 
        
        
       31. The Defendant made further submissions which are not relevant to the questions presently stated for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
        
        
       APPELLANT’S CONTENTIONS 
        
        
       32. The appellant contends that I would err in law in dismissing the notice of motion on the grounds that 
        
        
         
         (1) section 59(3) of the Pesticides Act 1978 requires proceedings for an offence against that Act in the summary jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court to be commenced by way of information; and 
         
        
        
         
         (2) it is not sufficient compliance with the requirement in (1) to commence the proceedings by way of summons; and 
         
        
        
         
         (3) alternatively, the summons is void for want of sufficient particularity. 
         
        
        
       ANNEXURES 
        
        
       33. I annexe 
        
        
         
         (a) a copy of the summons; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a copy of an exhibit received on the Defendant’s motion, namely a copy of a specimen charge sheet; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) a copy of my reasons for decision. 
         
        
        
        
       STATED QUESTIONS 
        
        
       34. I submit the following questions for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal: 
        
        
         
         (1) Are proceedings in the summary jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales for an offence against section 33(1) of the Pesticides Act 1978 required to be commenced by the laying of an information? 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Are these proceedings invalid because they were commenced by filing of the summons herein pursuant to Part 75 rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules, as adapted by Part 6 rule 2(d) of the Land and Environment Court Rules? 
         
        
        
         
         (3) If the answer to either question (1) or question (2) is “NO”, 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) is the summons lacking an essential particular; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) if the answer to (a) is “YES”, are the proceedings void? 
           
          
         
        
        
       
      
     3     
     Hereafter, I will refer to the defendant below as “the appellant” and the plaintiff below as “the respondent”. 
      
       
      
     4     
     I will deal with the questions asked in order. 
      
       
        
       Question 1: Are proceedings in the summary jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales for an offence against section 33(1) of the  
       Pesticides Act 1978 
        required to be commenced by the laying of an information?  
        
       
      
     5     
     Section 59 of the  
     Pesticides Act 1978 
       
     (NSW) 
      provided as follows, so far as is relevant: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Proceedings for offences 
          
         59(1) 
          Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations: 
          
         (a) ….. 
          
         (b) may be disposed of summarily before a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate sitting alone or before the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) ….. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) …..(P)roceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be commenced by information laid within 12 months after the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed.” 
         
        
       
      
     6     
     The section initially provided for proceedings for an offence to be instituted only in a Local Court. By the  
     Pesticides and Allied Chemicals 
       
     (Amendment) Act 1987 
     , s 59(1) was amended to allow such proceedings to be brought, as an alternative, in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales. Before the amendment s 59 provided as follows, so far as is relevant: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Proceedings for offence 
         
        
        
         
         59(1) 
          Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations shall 
         
        
        
         
         (a) ….. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) be disposed of summarily before a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) ….. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Any such proceedings may be commenced by information laid within 12 months after the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed.” 
         
        
        
       Subsection (3), it may be noted, was not altered in any substantive way. 
        
       
      
     7     
     The amendment was made in the context of the procedures of the Land and Environment Court. Part 6 r 2(1) of the rules of that court provided that certain rules of the Supreme Court of New South Wales applied to the relevant part of the Land and Environment Court’s jurisdiction, with certain adaptations. As adapted, Pt 75 r 7 of the Supreme Court rules applied to summary proceedings for an offence in the Land and Environment Court. The adapted rule was (and is) as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Proceedings for an offence under any Act which may be taken before the Court in its summary jurisdiction shall be commenced in the Court by summons claiming an order under section 41 of the 
          Land and Environment Court Act 1970 (NSW) 
          in respect of the offence and claiming that the defendant be dealt with according to law for commission of the offence.” 
         
        
       
      
     8     
     Part 6 r 2(2) of the rules provides that a summons seeking an order pursuant to s 41 is to be accompanied by affidavits intended to be relied on by the prosecutor as prima facie evidence of the offence. (Whether such affidavits were filed in the present case is not apparent from the stated case or otherwise from the appeal papers. Nothing was said on the point at the hearing of the appeal. I proceed on the basis that nothing concerning such affidavits - whether filed or not filed - operates to the advantage or disadvantage of either side.) 
      
       
      
     9     
     Section 41 is as follows, so far as is material. 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         41. Orders for appearance or apprehension of defendants 
         
        
        
         
         (1) Upon an application being made by any person (in this Division referred to as the  
         prosecutor 
         ) in accordance with the rules, a Judge shall make an order: 
          
         (a) ordering any person alleged in the application to have committed an offence punishable in the Court in its summary jurisdiction to appear at a time and place specified in the order to answer to the offence charged in the order …...” 
         
        
       
      
     10     
     The form prescribed for such an application is a summons, claiming an order that the defendant appear to answer to the offence (Form 74A). The prescribed form of order is to that effect (Form 74B). 
      
       
      
     11     
     Lloyd J held that s 59(3) of the  
     Pesticides Act 1978 
      was not a mandatory provision, and that the subsection allowed proceedings to be instituted by a process which fulfilled the same function as an information. 
      
       
      
     12     
     I disagree. The word “may” is used in relation to commencement by information and in relation to the time limitation. It would be a strange thing if the legislature were to have used the one word as having a mandatory meaning in one respect and not the other. The time limitation cannot be anything but mandatory. It follows that commencement by information is also mandatory. 
      
       
      
     13     
     Furthermore, the two elements in the subsection are inextricably intertwined. It is an information which must be laid within 12 months, not any alternative process. It is unlikely to have been intended that proceedings instituted by information must be commenced within 12 months while proceedings instituted in some other way could be commenced at any time. 
      
       
      
     14     
     I conclude that s 59(3), in its original and amended form - there being no substantive change - required that proceedings for an offence be commenced by information and in no other way. 
      
       
        
       I would, for these reasons, answer question (1), Yes. 
        
        
        
       Question 2: Are these proceedings invalid because they were commenced by filing of the summons herein pursuant to Part 75 rule 7 of the  
       Supreme Court Rules 
       , as adapted by Part 6 rule 2(d) of the  
       Land and Environment Court Rules 
       ?  
        
       
      
     15     
     In my opinion, a summons under Pt 75, rule 7 is an information within the meaning of s 59(3). (It would be the more so, if affidavits were filed with it, disclosing a prima facie case, but that is put out of account.) My reasons follow. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The word “information” is most commonly used to mean the document by which criminal proceedings are instituted before a magistrate. The function of such an information is to provide sufficient information for the issue of a summons directing the defendant to appear to answer the charge. Depending on the context, however, the word may have a wider meaning. In  
     Hanley 
       
     v Steel 
     , 
      (1973) 5 SASR 242 at 246. 
      Bray CJ said that an information can be “an initiatory proceeding of some kind …the initiatory step in proceedings of a criminal nature, which are to be disposed of summarily …...” The word has been held, in context, to comprehend an indictment:

     ,

      (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 333. 
      Fraser No 2. 
      (1985) 1 NSWLR 681. 
      In 
      Hull 
     , 
      (1989) 16 NSWLR 385. 
      the Court of Criminal Appeal was concerned with s 45B of the  
     Poisons Act 1966 
     , which provided that an “information” for an offence may be laid within 2 years after the alleged commission of the offence. The prosecution had been commenced by indictment. It was held that s 45B applied. Gleeson CJ said at 394: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion s 45B has the meaning and effect contended for by the appellant. The word “information” is used in the wider rather than the narrower sense, and the time bar imposed by the section relates to the commencement by any means of a prosecution for an offence of the kind to which the section relates. For the reasons which follow I also consider that to issue an ex officio indictment against a person who has been discharged by a magistrate relevantly involves the commencement of proceedings.” 
         
        
       
      
     17     
     In the present case, the legislature amended s 59 of the  
     Pesticides Act 
       
     1978 
     , giving the Land and Environment Court jurisdiction to try offences under the Act. It did so in the context of the procedures of that court, which provided for proceedings of the relevant kind to be instituted by summons for an order requiring the attendance of the defendant to answer the charge. 
      
       
      
     18     
     In these circumstances, the word “information” in s 59(3) is to be construed to include such a summons. I would, therefore, answer question (2), No. 
      
       
      
     19     
     The summons being an information within the meaning of the legislation, the answer to this question must be, No. 
      
       
        
       Question 3(a): If the answer to either question (1) or question (2) is “NO”, is the summons lacking an essential particular? 
        
       
      
     20     
     To be valid, an information must identify the essential factual ingredients of the offence charged:

     A distinction has been drawn between “essential factual ingredients” (particulars required for the validity of an information) and particulars required merely to ensure that the defendant is able to prepare his or her defence:

     The authorities provide no comprehensive formula for what constitute essential particulars. However, in  
     Johnson v Miller  
     various requirements were identified. These include “the time, place and manner of the defendant’s acts or omissions”: per Dixon J at 486, citing  
     Smith v Moody 
      at 61,63. Dixon J went on to say (at 489-490):  
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion he (the prosecutor) clearly should be required to identify the transaction on which he relies and he should be so required as soon as it appears that his complaint, in spite of its apparent particularity, is equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the complaint. For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. The court hearing a complaint or information for an offence must have before it a means of identifying with the matter or transaction alleged in the document the matter or transaction appearing in evidence.”

     The summons in the present case does not specify the essential ingredients of the alleged offence. It specifies the legal elements of the alleged offence, but it does not specify the  
     acts  
     or 
      omissions  
      by which the appellant is alleged to have carelessly disregarded the instruction on the container. In particular, it does not specify whether the pesticide is alleged to have come into contact with a mattress (or mattresses), bedclothes or clothing, nor does it specify in what  
     manner  
     (that is, by what acts or omissions) the appellant is alleged to have allowed the pesticide to come into contact with such item or items.  
      
       
      
     24     
     Question 3(a) should accordingly be answered, “Yes”. 
      
      
       
       Question 3(b): If the answer to 3(a) is “YES”, are the proceedings void? 
       
      
      
     25     
     Section 43 of the  
     Land and Environment Court Act 
      1979 provides, so far as is material, that no objection shall be taken or allowed to any application (ie the summons) referred to in, or to any order made under s 41, by reason of any alleged defect in it in substance or in form. This is what is known as a  
     Lord Jervis 
      provision. Similar provisions are to be found in the  
     Justices Act 
      1902, ss 30 and 65. 
      
      
     26     
     A distinction is drawn between informations which fail to specify the legal elements of the offence and those where essential factual particulars have not been given. Where an information fails to specify the essential legal elements of the offence, the information is not saved by a

     The summons in the present case falls within the second category of defective informations. It is saved by s 43. 
      
       
      
     28     
     Question 3(b) should accordingly be answered, “No”. 
      
       
        
       Matters No. 50094/98 and 50095/98  
       
      
     29     
     The only material difference between matter No. 50093/98 and the other two matters, as recorded in the respective stated cases, relates to the particular label instruction allegedly disregarded. In matter No. 50094/98, the instruction was, “Do not contaminate utensils or surfaces where food may be prepared or stored.” In matter No. 50095/98, the instruction was, “Keep away from cooking and eating utensils and remove or cover raw or processed foodstuffs before spraying.” The stated cases in matters 50094/98 and 50095/98 incorporate by reference the substance of the stated case in matter 5003/98, with that sole exception. The questions asked of this Court in each case are the same. 
      
       
      
     30     
     What I have said in relation to matter 50093/98 applies equally to the other two matters, with the same result.  
      
       
        
       Determination 
       
      
     31     
     The questions in each of the stated cases should be answered as follows: 
      
       
        
       (1) Yes 
        
       (2) No 
        
        
       (3)(a) Yes 
        
        (b) No 
        
        
       Appeal procedure 
        
       
      
     32     
     As is recorded in the stated case, the judge was requested to state these cases pursuant to s5A(1A) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
      and agreed to do so pursuant to that section. Section 5A(1A) had, however, been repealed and replaced by s 5AE with operation on and from 31 July 1998. 
      
       
      
     33     
     Section s 5AE provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Point of law stated during summary proceedings 
          
         5AE(1) At any time before the completion of proceedings before the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction, the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction … the judge hearing the proceedings may, or if requested by the Crown must, submit any question of law arising at or in reference to the proceedings to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination. 
          
         (2) The Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the court concerned as it thinks fit.” 
         
        
       
      
     34     
     The requests to the judge were valid requests under s5AE(1) and the stating of the case was a valid exercise of power or function under the section. It is of no importance that it was thought by all concerned, and so recorded in the stated case, that the process was undertaken pursuant to a section by then repealed, whereas it was in fact authorised by a new section of the act, carrying a different number but which was, in presently relevant respects, in identical terms. What was done was validly done irrespective of what was thought to be the foundation of the validity. There is no procedural problem. 
      
       
      
     35     
     Having determined the questions submitted for determination pursuant to s 5AE(1), the function of this Court is, pursuant to s 5AE(2), to make such order or give any such direction to the court concerned as it thinks fit. 
      
       
        
       Consequential orders or directions 
        
       
      
     36     
     The appropriate order is that the proceedings be remitted to the Land and Environment Court for determination according to law. 
      
       
        
       Costs 
        
       
      
     37     
     As I have said, s5AE is in terms identical with the repealed s5A(1A) concerning the request to state a case and the stating of a case. However, the way the Court of Criminal Appeal is to deal with the stated case has been changed. Under s 5A(1A), the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to deal with the proceedings as an appeal. Under s5AE, the Court is required to determine the questions asked and to make such orders or give such directions as it thinks fit (as I have proposed in this case). 
      
       
      
     38     
     Section 17(1) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
      provides that, on the hearing or determination of  
     an appeal 
     , no costs shall be allowed on either side. The effect of that section was held to be that costs could not be awarded in proceedings pursuant to s5A(1A):  
     Environment Protection Authority v Leaghur Holdings Pty Ltd 
     ; 
      (1995) 80ACrimR 553. 
       
     Environmental Protection Authority v Cooke 
     Unreported, NSWCCA, 14 March 1996. 
      It was to bring the s5A(1A) procedure into line with s5B and s5BA, particularly as to costs, that the amendment was made. Section 17(1) does not apply to s5AE. 
      
       
      
     39     
     There is, accordingly, power to award costs in the present proceedings. 
      
       
      
     40     
     The Authority has not advanced a submission that costs should be awarded merely because it is the successful party. In those cases under s5B where costs have been awarded, the court has mentioned special reasons for doing so. In  
     Maddan, 
      (1995) 85 ACrimR 367. 
       
     for example, Hunt CJ remarked (at 7) that the stated case was “poorly drafted”, “raised no appropriate question of law and that every issue argued before this court was determined against the appellant.” 
      
       
      
     41     
     In  
     Wood, 
      Unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1990. 
       
     Campbell J commented (at 6) that while the appellant had a “technical defence” which he was entitled to pursue, in his opinion the point raised by the appellant was not a good point. The decision was not a matter of public importance.  
      
       
      
     42     
     In  
     Clyne, 
      [1980] 1 NSWLR 599. 
       
     Moffit J, with whom Begg and Cantor JJ agreed, said (at 602): 
      
       
        
         
         “But for the application by Clyne for a stated case, it is clear that his appeal to the District Court would have been dismissed. He made written submissions drawn by him. These raised many questions, some highly artificial. They so obviously lacked merit that, when the hearing commenced, senior counsel briefed to argue the case announced that he abandoned them, or virtually so. The matter argued was substantially a new case. Even so, there was no merit in the new case, and counsel for the respondent was not called on. It is clear that it is appropriate that Clyne should be ordered to pay the costs.” 
         
        
       
      
     43     
     In  
     Proust 
     , 
      (1989) 17 NSWLR 267. 
      Samuels JA remarked (at 272): 
      
       
        
         
         “Before parting with the matter, I feel bound to observe that the form of the case stated does not, in my opinion, conform to what is contemplated by s5B….The case before us does not submit any fully formulated question of law but merely recites the learned judge’s decision and the respects in which the parties contend that that decision was wrong; and ends by presenting the general inquiry whether the judge’s determinations were erroneous in point of law. There is no question specifically asked in terms which enable a direct answer. I think that it would be better if these cases were stated by formulating the question or questions of law which have arisen in the fully interrogative form.” (at 272) 
         
        
       
      
     44     
     In  
     Clifford 
     , 
      [1980] 1 NSWLR 314. 
       
     human rights issues were raised, and the court considered that the case was one of general importance. Nagle CJ at CL made recommendations for legislative change. 
      
       
      
     45     
     In these cases -  
     Maddan, Wood, Clyne, Clifford and Proust 
      - costs were awarded against the unsuccessful appellant. There were special reasons for doing do so in each case.  
      
       
      
     46     
     There are then two cases where costs were awarded against the unsuccessful respondent, who was also the prosecuting authority. In  
     NSW Grains Board v Davis, 
      Unreported NSWCCA 17 July 1997. 
       
     Gleeson CJ awarded costs on the basis that the stated case had been unsatisfactorily enunciated and that the question of law was not of general importance. In  
     Vatner 
      (1992) 29 NSWLR 311. 
      the court found that the defendant’s arrest had been unlawful. Again, there were special reasons for awarding costs.  
      
       
      
     47     
     In the present case, the defendant had a cogent point, which was properly argued. There is no special reason for awarding costs in favour of the prosecuting authority in this case. I propose that no order for costs be made.  
      
       
        
        
       Orders 
        
       
      
     48     
     The only order I propose is that the proceedings be remitted to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales for determination according to law.

     FRIDAY 25 AUGUST 2000 
      
      
      
      REGINA v. PAUL MICHAEL OFFER 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On 26 April 2000, an indictment was presented against the offender, Paul Michael Offer, charging him with one count of having, on 15 February 1997, caused grievous bodily harm to Nagwa Gerges with intent to murder her; one count of murdering Ronald Gregory Mills on 27 September 1997; and three counts of having solicited another to murder Ronald Gregory Mills, Maher Nicola Gerges and Mark George Chapman. Those last offences were alleged to have been committed between about 1 September and about 30 November 1997. 
    2   The offender pleaded not guilty to all of those counts and was placed in the charge of a jury for trial. 
    3   The Crown Prosecutor opened to the jury, in detail, the evidence that it was proposed to lead against the offender. Following which, the proceedings were adjourned until the following Monday. On that day, following the offender's intimation of a willingness to plead guilty to counts one and two in the indictment, the offender was re-arraigned on those counts and, before the jury, pleaded guilty. Verdicts of guilty were returned by the jury in accordance with my direction and in accordance with the request of the Crown Prosecutor, to which Mr. Spencer of counsel for the offender assented, the jury was discharged on the remaining three counts on the indictment, I being informed that it would be sought that those counts be taken into account on a Form 1 and that the Crown accepted that procedure. That Form 1 was provided to me and I take those offences into account on the offence of murder, as I have been requested. 
    4   On that day, 1 May 2000, I convicted the offender on counts one and two of the indictment, that is, the offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder and the offence of murder. 
    5   It is regrettable that at the time my attention was not drawn to s.91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1996 as inserted as and from 1 January 2000 which required me to discharge the jury from giving a verdict in these circumstances and to find the accused person guilty of the offence myself. 
    6   Prior to convicting the offender, I had administered the allocatur. It is entirely apparent that I had approved the acceptance by the Crown of the proffered plea and indeed that is made completely clear by the Crown's acceptance that the remaining three counts should be dealt with on the Form 1. 
    7   The procedure adopted was generally in accordance with that approved, for example, in Regina v. Ross (CCA, unreported 20 April 1994). It does not, however, precisely accord with s.91's requirements nor that of its predecessor, s.399A of the Crimes Act 1900 (see Regina v. Ress [2000] NSWCCA 224). In the circumstances, the verdicts of the jury were not necessary. I was satisfied of the offender's guilt on his plea and content with the Crown's acceptance of it. This underlay my acceding to the course proposed by the prosecutor and my convicting the offender (see Maxwell v. The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501). I shall proceed in accordance with the matter under s.91(2) on that basis. 
    8   The proceedings were adjourned on 1 May 2000 to permit both the Crown and the offender to prepare material for sentence. The offender was remanded in custody for sentence. The proceedings were adjourned from time to time to enable enquiries to be made in Ireland. 
    9   On the matter coming forward for sentence, there was admitted in evidence, without objection and marked Exhibit A, an extensive statement of facts prepared by the Crown which statement of facts was not challenged by the offender. That statement of facts summarised the matters opened by the learned Crown Prosecutor at the trial and of which a transcript has been prepared. 
    10   I take the following from that statement. 
     
      
     Count 1 
      
    11   On 15 February 1997, the offender shot Nagwa Gerges in the head with a bolt from a crossbow when she answered the door at her home in St. Ives. He had intended to kill her husband, Maher Nicola Gerges (a man who he later solicited another person to murder. This solicitation was the basis of one of the counts included on the Form 1). Mr. Gerges found his wife lying near the front door with the bolt in her head and, in panic, removed the bolt. 
     
      
       
        
       ""Mrs. Gerges suffered severe head and brain injury as a result of the shooting. She now suffers from permanent semi-paralysis of her right side with moderately severe weakness to her right upper limb and milder weakness to her right lower limb. She also suffers from lack of peripheral vision to her right side and slurred speech. Mrs. Gerges suffers from major depression, insomnia, alternating mood swings and impairment concentration (Dr. Salem)."" 
       
      
    12   When interviewed by police on 5 March 1997 about the shooting of Mrs. Gerges, the offender denied knowledge and asserted that he, his wife and their three young children had travelled to the Gold Coast the day prior. He denied ever possessing a crossbow and asserted that he had seen a crossbow at the Gerges' home some time earlier. 
    13   A week after the shooting, an anonymous caller had given information to Crime Stoppers that police would ""find what you're looking for"" at East Side Smash Repairs, a business run by Maher Gerges' brother, Sam. Those premises were searched on 26 February 1997 and four crossbows, two with metallic shafts with red and black vanes and two with fibreglass shafts with orange and yellow vanes marked with a brand Horton Fibre Strike were found in circumstances suggesting they had recently been placed in that position. 
    14   The bolt removed from Mrs. Gerges' head had a grey metallic shaft with red and black vanes. 
     
      
     Count 2 
      
    15   Mr. Mills, who worked as a marine electrician, lived alone in Allawah. At sometime between 8.00 and 9.00 pm on 27 September 1997, Mr. Mills' neighbours heard what sounded like a single gunshot and a car leaving. Mr. Mills' body was found on Tuesday 30 September 1997. Mr. Mills' had been shot in the head. 
     
      
       
       ""Police investigating the shooting of Mr. Mills discovered a connection between that shooting and that of Mrs. Gerges. Mr. Mills and Mr. Gerges, along with another man, Mr. Mark Chapman, were witnesses for the prosecution in court cases in which the offender had been charged. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender and Mr. Gerges had worked together and had been on friendly terms until there was a falling out. The offender operated a tow truck and Mr. Gerges operated a panel beating and spray painting business. The offender and his family had been visitors to the Gerges' home at St. Ives. After the falling out, there was considerable ill feeling between the offender and Mr. Gerges. This related to their business interests and Mr. Gerges giving evidence against the offender in two court cases. 
       
      
      
       
       On 17 October 1996, the offender was charged in relation to his possession of a stolen router and drill. His explanation for this possession was that he had purchased these tools from Mr. Gerges. Mr. Gerges denied this and gave a statement to the police, of which the offender was aware at the time Mrs. Gerges was shot. Mr. Gerges gave evidence in accordance with his statement on 28 February 1997 (the offender was convicted on this charge on 21 March 1997, but on appeal to the District Court the conviction was quashed on 14 September 1999). 
       
      
      
       
       On 28 February 1997, the offender was charged in relation to an alleged boat fraud (which has not been dealt with and must be ignored for the purposes of sentence). An alleged accomplice, Armand Scerri was also charged with the boat fraud on 1 February 1997. In relation to the alleged boat fraud, Maher Gerges, Ronald Mills and Mark Chapman made statements to the police and these statements were served upon the offender's legal representative. The offender obtained a copy of the police brief which included the statements. In the case of Mr. Gerges, the statement gave his business address (however his residential address was known to the offender). In the case of Mr. Mills, the statement gave his business address and telephone number but not his home address and telephone number. In the case of Mr. Chapman, the statement gave his business and home addresses. 
       
      
      
       
       On 30 May 1997, the committal proceedings relating to the boat fraud were listed for hearing commencing on 13 October 1997 (the significance of this hearing date later emerges). 
       
      
      
       
       The Crown alleges the motive for these offences was the offender's wish to eliminate witnesses who either had or were to give evidence for the prosecution relating to the charges concerning an alleged boat fraud and possession of stolen property. 
       
      
      
       
       When police discovered the apparent connection between the two shootings, they wished to speak to the offender. The offender, his wife and children had lived in Sydney until about April 1997 when they travelled north in their motor car and motor home. From about July 1997, they resided in their motor home at the Dress Circle Caravan Park at 8 Mile Plains, a suburb of Brisbane. 
       
      
      
       
       Police established that the offender was living at the caravan park and he was kept under observation for a few days until 15 October 1997, when he and his family packed their belongings and left the caravan park. The offender was stopped by police, who took possession of the Ford Falcon motor car and the motor home. The offender was asked, and agreed, to go with police to the CIB in Brisbane, where he was interviewed on video in relation to the murder of Mr. Mills. 
       
      
      
       
       In this interview, the offender denied any involvement in the murder of Mr. Mills and provided an alibi that he was at the caravan park on the weekend Mr. Mills was murdered. He told police that on Friday evening, 26 September 1997, he had a birthday party at the caravan park and said he could remember that because the caretaker fixed a problem with the barbecue they were to use at the birthday party. He told police that on the night, Saturday 27 September 1997 (the night Mr. Mills was murdered), he drove his wife to work at a hospital in Brisbane where she worked as a nurse. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender's alibi was investigated and found to be false through a number of pieces of evidence."" 
       
      
    16   It is not necessary to detail the particular pieces of evidence. 
     
      
       
       ""At his interview with police on 15 October 1997, the offender denied possession of any firearms or ammunition. He also denied knowing the deceased, Mr. Mills. 
       
      
      
       
       At the conclusion of the interview on 15 October 1997, the offender was allowed to leave. A preliminary search of the Ford Falcon began in the afternoon of 15 October 1997 and developed into an extensive search along with the motor home on 16 October 1997, on which day many incriminating items were found. 
       
      
      
       
       In the boot of the Ford Falcon, police found a silencer capable of being threaded onto a nine millimetre pistol, a gun-cleaning kit suitable for use on a nine millimetre pistol, a sawn-off shotgun, five crossbow bolts with metallic shafts and red and black vanes, a national shooting sports foundation brochure, a business card in the name of Mark Chapman from Chapman Marine and the address of Mr. Gerges' home at St. Ives written on a black card. 
       
      
      
       
       Bank records show the offender's credit card was used to purchase the gun-cleaning kit in Brisbane on 17 September 1997. 
       
      
      
       
       In the passenger's side external storage area of the motor home, police found black balaclava, a nine millimetre Luger pistol loaded with seven live rounds (nine millimetre Norinco brand) in a brown holster, nine live rounds of nine millimetre Norinco brand ammunition in a plastic bag, a laser sight (and instructions) suitable for attachment to a crossbow and documents establishing the offender's presence in Sydney on 8 and 9 October 1997 (as to which see the reference to Mr. Seaton later). 
       
      
      
       
       The nine millimetre Luger pistol was examined and found to be the murder weapon. 
       
      
      
       
       Inside the motor home police found a photograph of Mr. Gerges and his family, the home and business addresses of Mr. Gerges written on a piece of paper, documents relating to gun laws in Queensland and, two business cards in the name of Ronald Mills, Blakehurst Marina, an envelope on which was written the name of 'R. Mills', addresses and phone numbers in Sydney (but not the deceased), documents establishing the offender's presence in Sydney around 19 September 1997 (as to which see the reference to Mr. Seaton later) and a Visa card cash advance slip for $8,000 on 25 September 1997 (as to which see the reference to Mr. Seaton and listening device transcripts later). 
       
      
      
       
       In the driver's side external storage area of the motor home, police found 81 live rounds of nine millimetre Norinco brand ammunition wrapped in plastic, two boxes containing 97 live rounds of nine millimetre Chinese manufacture brand ammunition and a nine millimetre magazine containing seven live rounds of nine millimetre Norinco brand ammunition."" 
       
      
    17   Although the offender claimed he did not know Mr. Mills, he had made various attempts to find out where he lived and his mobile phone records show a series of calls to Mr. Mills' work and home as well as numerous calls to the Sydney numbers of persons named ""R. Mills"". 
     
      
       
       ""Following the discovery of the incriminating evidence in the boot of the Ford Falcon and in the motor home, the offender was arrested in Brisbane on 17 October 1997. The offender exercised his right to silence when arrested. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender was extradited to Sydney on 20 October 1997. The fact of his arrest and extradition received some publicity in Sydney."" 
       
      
    18   The counts on the Form 1 and context 
     
      
       
       ""On 21 October 1997, an article appearing in a Sydney newspaper was read by Mr. Alan Seaton, a friend of the offender who lived in Sydney and who had worked with the offender in the security industry some years previously. Mr. Seaton immediately rang Sandra Macdonald, who confirmed that her husband, the offender was the person referred to in the newspaper article. Mr. Seaton then realised the seriousness of a number of recent approached by the offender to Mr. Seaton about 'taking care of people', rang the police and reported these approaches. Mr. Seaton's telephone records confirm the phone calls made by him that day. 
       
      
      
       
       Around early September 1997, Mr. Seaton received the first of a number of phone calls from the offender after not hearing from him for five or six years. The offender told Mr. Seaton he was in trouble and needed some people looked after. Mr. Seaton never took seriously anything the offender said because he knew the offender to be a story-teller and they, with their work colleagues years previously, used to joke about taking care of people. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender told Mr. Seaton he would mail to him a list of names and addresses, which Mr. Seaton later received. Mr. Seaton threw away the letter but does remember the letter contained the names and addresses of three men, one with an Allawah address (Mr. Mills) and another with a Drummoyne address (Mr. Chapman). Mr. Seaton remembers being told by the offender the three men were witnesses in a boat fraud. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Seaton received a number of telephone calls from the offender and returned some of the offender's calls. The offender's mobile telephone records together with Mr. Seaton's mobile and landline telephone records confirm a series of telephone calls. Mr. Seaton recalls the offender offering him $10,000 to 'look after' these people. Mr. Seaton recalls the offender saying that he wanted Maher Gerges' looked after' because he had 'set him up' for the boat fraud. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Seaton did nothing in response to the offender's request and when the offender continued to ring him began to make excuses for doing nothing. 
       
      
      
       
       The first time Mr. Seaton saw the offender after these calls was a Friday night (which appears to be 19 September 1997) at the Bankstown Trotting Club. While at the club, Mr. Seaton received a phone call from the offender, who then met Mr. Seaton at the club. The offender told Mr. Seaton he was in trouble and needed help. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       The offender met Mr. Seaton next on 8 October 1997 at the Padstow RSL Club. Mr. Seaton was at the club and received a telephone call from the offender, who met him there. The offender said to Mr. Seaton that 'I've got one that I need fixed up desperately by the weekend'. The offender gave Mr. Seaton details of Maher Gerges, which Mr. Seaton wrote down on a piece of paper. The significance of the offender wanting Mr. Gerges fixed up desperately by the weekend was that Mr. Gerges was to give evidence for the prosecution in connection with the boat fraud charge, the committal hearing of which was to begin on Monday 13 October 1997. 
       
      
      
       
       When Mr. Seaton left the Padstow RSL Club with the offender, they got into a small red car which the offender had hired in Sydney for the period 8 October 1997 to 10 October 1997. Mr. Seaton saw a Luger pistol in a brown holster on the back seat of the car. Mr. Seaton removed the pistol from the holster and examined it. It had an empty magazine. The offender said it was his gun, took it from Mr. Seaton, put it on the floor of the car and covered it with a coat. This was the pistol used to shoot Mr. Mills and these events are confirmed on a listening device tape recording to which reference will shortly be made. 
       
      
      
       
       From the Padstow RSL Club they drove to another club then the offender drove Mr. Seaton to his home. 
       
      
      
       
       The next day the offender went to Mr. Seaton's home where he repeated his request to 'fix up' Maher Gerges by the weekend. The offender was again driving the red hire car and said he had to get back to Queensland. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       In the circumstances outlined above, Mr. Seaton went to police and disclosed the offender's approaches to him. At around this time the offender telephoned Mr. Seaton from gaol and asked him to visit him. The offender made reference in this phone call to Mr. Seaton's fingerprints being on the pistol (no doubt a reference to Mr. Seaton handling the pistol at the Padstow RSL Club on 8 October 1997). 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Seaton visited the offender at Silverwater Gaol on four occasions, 23 October, 27 October, 30 October and 5 November 1997. On each occasion he wore a listening device (authorised by warrant) which recorded his conversations with the offender. The conversations confirm Mr. Seaton's disclosure of the offender's attempt to persuade him to murder Mr. Mills, Mr. Gerges and Mr. Chapman and disclosed a continuing desire of the offender that Mr. Gerges and Mr. Chapman be killed. The offender confirmed he had sent down a list of the people he wanted Mr. Seaton to kill ('see I told you in the letter I need them three done'). He confirmed the offer to pay Mr. Seaton $10,000 by saying 'the money we were going to give you for the job is out of the fucking Visa account' (an amount of $8,000 was withdrawn from the offender's Citibank Visa account on 25 September 1997 and repaid on 29 September 1997). 
       
      
      
       
       The recorded conversations contain admissions by the offender that he shot Mr. Mills ('you kept putting me off so I took it into my own hands') and Mrs. Gerges ('the object that's in the storage right, was used on his Mrs. … she came to the door and she stepped in the way'). He admitted that police found the murder weapon ('they've got me, they've hot me with the fucking guns, they've got me with the shotty in the car'). He asked Mr. Seaton to go with Sandra Macdonald to his storage area and get rid of a package which the offender admitted he had used to shoot Mrs. Gerges (as to the location of the package see later). 
       
      
      
       
       The recorded conversations disclose that the offender, with the assistance of Sandra Macdonald, had set about creating a false alibi for the offender at the time of the murder, an alibi that the offender was in Brisbane. The offender asked Mr. Seaton to provide a false statement supporting this alibi. He gave Mr. Seaton false details to be able to give the alibi and handed him a document setting out a plan of the caravan park. He also asked Mr. Seaton to tell Sandra Macdonald to tell a Mrs. Fortunata Tonelli (Nella) what she had to say in the false alibi statement. (The offender had telephoned Mrs. Tonelli and asked her to provide a false alibi by saying she was in Brisbane and saw the offender on the weekend Mr. Mills was murdered. At first, Mrs. Tonelli agreed but later retracted her alibi statement which Sandra Macdonald had arranged to be collected by private enquiry agent and given to the offender's then barrister). The offender gave Mr. Seaton a document setting out the false details of the alibi Mrs. Tonelli was to give. 
       
      
      
       
       In the recorded conversations, the offender asked Mr. Seaton if he could find someone who would say that ""Maher Gerges is fucken' bragging that he planted the gun on fucken' Offer in his motor home' and that he needed 'at least two fuckers to stitch Maher up'. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender sought Mr. Seaton's assistance by saying that his (Mr. Seaton's) fingerprints were on the pistol (a reference to Mr. Seaton handling the pistol in the hire car at the Padstow RSL Club on 8 October 1997) and that the offender could tell the police that Mr. Seaton was the murderer. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Seaton pretended to the offender he would help him in the say the offender asked him to do and, as part of the pretence, Mr. Seaton told the offender he had a friend in Canberra who could also help the offender get out of gaol. On Mr. Seaton's fourth and last visit to the offender (5 November 1997) he introduced his 'friend' to the offender. The 'friend' was an undercover police officer (Albert Villa), who continued on the pretence of being able to help the offender."" 
       
      
    19   However, those calls were not tendered in evidence nor the content of them referred to in the statement of facts. 
     
      
       
       ""Albert had a number of conversations with the offender after Mr. Seaton ceased his visits to the offender but they are not relied upon by the Crown … Albert had a number of conversations with Sandra Macdonald which led (with the evidence of Mr. Seaton) to the arrest of Sandra Macdonald on 18 December 1997 in respect of her part in helping the offender to arrange false alibis for the shootings of Mr. Mills and Mrs. Gerges and attempting to destroy evidence (the crossbow). 
       
      
      
       
       On Mr. Seaton's third visit to the offender (30 October 1997), he was accompanied by Sandra Macdonald, who by this stage had come down from Brisbane. The offender discussed with them the false alibi for the murder of Mr. Mills and Mr. Seaton with Sandra Macdonald getting ride of the package in storage. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Seaton arranged to meet Sandra Macdonald at 10.00 am on 31 October 1997 at Kennards Hire at Kirrawee. That morning access was gained to a storage unit in the name of Sandra Macdonald. Sandra Macdonald used the code number to access the unit but did not have the key to unlock the padlock. Mr. Seaton did as the offender suggested and used bolt cutters to cut the chain with the padlock. Sandra Macdonald removed a large package from the unit and gave it to Mr. Seaton believing he would get rid of it. Instead, Mr. Seaton took the package to the police. 
       
      
      
       
       When police opened the package it was found to contain a Hortons Super Mag crossbow package, seven bolts with metallic shafts and red and black vanes and various crossbow accessories. With the crossbow package was a black balaclava. 
       
      
      
       
       While the offender was in custody, his cell was searched and incriminating evidence found, and further incriminating evidence was found when the offender's mail was intercepted. Various letters and statutory declarations written by the offender were sent to a friend, Mr. Colin Gibbons. This material established that the offender had fabricated evidence with a view to discrediting Mr. Seaton, Mr. Gerges, Mr. Mills and the police officer in charge of the case, Detective Sergeant Thompson. 
       
      
      
       
       When the offender became aware Mr. Seaton had co-operated with the police, the offender made many false allegations against Mr. Seaton with a view to discrediting him as a prospective Crown witness. The offender also made false allegations against Mr. Gerges and Detective Sergeant Thompson with a view to discrediting them. The offender also made false allegations against the deceased, Mr. Mills. The allegations were made in statutory declarations to the Commissioner of Police and the offender's then solicitor which the offender copies and sent to Mr. Colin Gibbons. The offender also alleged that a number of police officers not involved in the present matter were corrupt. This material included the following allegations:- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) Mr. Seaton was a professional hit man and assassin who worked for the police.

       (w) Mr. Seaton told the offender he shot Mr. John Nwman in the head and then threw the murder weapon into the water at Taren Point Bridge. 
       
      
      
       
       (x) Mr. Seaton had made corrupt payments to police officers. 
       
      
      
       
       (y) The offender drove Mr. Gerges to Cabramatta to see Mr. Ngo. 
       
      
      
       
       (z) Mr. Gerges and Mr. Mills were involved in drugs. 
       
      
      
       
       (aa) Mr. Seaton asked the offender to write down the names and addresses of Mr. Mills, which he did from the police brief. 
       
      
      
       
       (bb) Mr. Seaton made the offender admit to the killing. 
       
      
      
       
       This material discloses that the offender had abandoned his alibi that he was in Brisbane at the time of the murder of Mr. Mills. The offender stated that he was in Sydney at the time of the murder but at that time had been in the company of Maggie (McTaggert) at two hotels in Annandale. Maggie McTaggert denies this, although she did know the offender and worked at one of the hotels. 
       
      
      
       
       On 13 July 1999, gaol authorities intercepted the offender's mail. An envelope from a friend of the offender, Mrs. Sharyn Bishara, to the offender contained what purported to be an unsigned contract between the offender and Mr. Seaton dated 21 October 1997. Mrs. Bishara has admitted that she had typed this contract at the request of the offender. The contract purports to be an admission by Mr. Seaton that he had killed Mr. Mills and tried to kill Mrs. Gerges. It purports also to be an agreement that the offender falsely admitted to Mr. Seaton and Albert that he was responsible for the killing and attempted killing in return for which Mr. Seaton and Albert would help the offender to get out of gaol. 
       
      
      
       
       On 15 July 1999, a search warrant was executed upon the offender's property in his cell. Material found included:- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) What purported to be statutory declarations made by Mr. Seaton on 23 October 1997 and 30 October 1997 at Silverwater and witnessed by a Justice of the Peace. Neither Mr. Seaton nor the Justice of the Peace signed these documents. They were written by the offender and the signatures of Mr. Seaton were traced from his signature on the statement given by him to police and served upon the offender. The statutory declarations are in similar terms and purport to be admissions by Mr. Seaton that he had killed Mr. Mills and had attempted to kill Mrs. Gerges and that he had planted the murder weapon in the offender's motor home. 
       
      
      
       
       (b) What purported to be a letter written by the offender to Mr. Seaton on 23 September 1997 in which the offender recounts that Mr. Seaton left a briefcase in the offender's car and which the offender put into the storage unit at Kennards Hire at Kirrawee. The letter purports to give Mr. Seaton the key, code number and directions to the storage unit with a request that Mr. Seaton remove the briefcase from the unit. The letter purports that Mr. Seaton admitted to the offender he had murdered a woman in Rozelle. The letter requests Mr. Seaton to sign the letter as acknowledgment of its contents and return it to the offender. The letter purports to be signed by Mr. Seaton and dated 27 September 1997. Mr. Seaton's purported signature is traced. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       (c) Copies of pages from a street directory of the Annandale area and sketches of streets at Annandale where two hotels were situated. These documents with photographs were sent to the offender by a friend, John, as part of an attempt by the offender to create a false alibi that he was drinking at these hotels on the night Mr. Mills was murdered (see the earlier reference to Maggie). 
       
      
      
       
       During the months of October to December 1999, the offender discussed aspects of the shooting of Mr. Mills and Mrs. Gerges with prisoners (1) and (2). The offender asked prisoner (1) if he knew someone outside who could find Mr. Seaton, telling prisoner (1) that Mr. Seaton was a witness against him and had set him up. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender told prisoner (1) that Detective Sergeant Thompson was also setting him up and asked prisoner (1) to falsely inform Police Internal Affairs that Sergeant Thompson was a drug dealer. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender asked prisoner (1) if he knew anyone outside who could help him by burning down Mr. Gerges' house at St. Ives. The offender told prisoner (1) that Mr. Gerges was giving evidence against him on the boat fraud charge. The offender told prisoner (1) the details of the house and drew a sketch. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender asked prisoner (1) to help him with an alibi for the murder of Mr. Mills. The offender asked prisoner (1) to say he was with his brother and mates at the Annandale Hotel and saw the offender with Maggie. Prisoner (1) was asked to take a photograph in the hotel to support the alibi. The offender gave prisoner (1) a sketch of the details of the hotel, which prisoner (1) copies. 
       
      
      
       
       Prisoner (1) made notes of admissions made to him by the offender of shooting Mr. Mills and Mrs. Gerges. 
       
      
      
       
       Prisoner (2)'s brother had been murdered in Queensland in early 1999 and Queensland police spoke to prisoner (2) about this by telephone and in the gaol visit in November 1999. Prisoner (2) spoke to the offender about this. The offender asked prisoner (2) to tell the police that Mr. Seaton was linked to his brother's murder. The offender asked prisoner (2) to say he was present when his brother planted the Luger, holster, shotgun, silencer, balaclava and ammunition in the offender's motor home and that his brother was paid by Mr. Seaton to do it. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender showed prisoner (2) photographs and gave him a sketch of the caravan park as well as details to be able to fabricate this evidence. The offender gave prisoner (2) documents setting out details needed by prisoner (2) to fabricate the evidence and unbeknown to the offender, prisoner (2) took photocopies and gave them to the police. They are in the offender's handwriting. Prisoner (2) made notes of details given to him by the offender and the information (in part) in his notes correspond exactly with written material found in a search of the offender's cell on 16 December 1999. A document given by the offender to prisoner (2) bears the fingerprints of each. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender asked prisoner (2) to say he was present when his brother made a seven second phone call on 29 September 1997 from near the caravan park. 
       
      
      
       
       The offender gave prisoner (2) particulars relating to Mr. Gerges and asked him to falsely say that Mr. Gerges was involved in setting up the offender in the boat fraud allegation. 
       
      
      
       
       Prisoners (1) and (2) disclosed to police their dealings with the offender and did not do as the offender had asked. 
       
      
      
       
       On 16 December 1999, a further search warrant was executed upon the offender's property in his cell and material found included:- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) A page of a writing pad in which appear indentations of the offender's handwriting giving a description of Mr. Seaton (corresponding to information given by the offender to prisoner (2) and written down by prisoner (2)). 
       
      
      
       
       (b) Documents giving a description of Mr. Seaton and Mr. Gerges. 
       
      
      
       
       (c) Copies of pages from a street directory of the Annandale area and a sketch of the streets at Annandale where a hotel was located. The documents were sent to the offender by the person John as part of the attempt to create a false alibi. 
       
      
      
       
       (d) A document written by the offender accusing Mr. Seaton of murder, car theft and payroll robbery."" 
        
       
      
    20   This extensive recital of the facts necessarily refers to the offender's alleged involvement in many other offences than those charged, eg., offences under Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 relating to public justice, the boat fraud, possession of stolen property, the possession of various firearms and other illegal objects, etc.  
    21   Appreciative as I am of the principle in The Queen v. De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, I do not have regard to these matters as aggravating the offender's guilt insofar as he could have been separately charged with those offences. However, I do have regard to them as setting the context both to the offences charged and those included on the Form 1 (see Regina v. Vella (CCA, unreported 15 December 1995; Regina v. H (1980) 3 A. Crim. R. 53; Regina v. JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; Regina v. Hartikainen (CCA, unreported 8 June 1993). 
    22   I have regard also to the harm that was contemplated by the offender's actions towards Mr. Gerges and Mr. Chapman. In particular, in this regard, in my view, a substantial component in my sentence will arise from the inclusion on the Form 1 of the matters taken into account (see Regina v. Vougdis (1989) 41 A. Crim. R. 125;  Morgan v. The Queen (1993) 70 A. Crim. R. 368 ). 
    23   The offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to commit murder is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of 25 years. The offences on the Form 1 of soliciting to murder are each punishable by imprisonment of 25 years if prosecuted by way of substantive charge on indictment. 
    24   The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is that of life imprisonment under s.19A of the Crimes Act 1900. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life by reason of s.19A(2). No non-parole period is applicable to a life sentence, since Division 1 of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act) does not apply s.54. Section 21(1) of the Act gives power to the court to pass a sentence of less than life imprisonment in circumstances to which I shall turn shortly. Section 22 of the Act provides for the offender's guilty plea to be taken into account. I shall have regard to that in accordance with the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 which recently laid down guidelines for how courts should have regard to guilty pleas, I have regard to that plea and the circumstances in which it was entered. 
    25   Section 24 provides that the court must take into account the time in which the offender has been in custody. The offender has been in custody since 17 October 1997 and the sentence will date from that date. 
    26   Pursuant to s.61(1) of the Act, a court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. Section 61(3) provides that nothing in s.61(1) affects s.21(1). These provisions reproduce the provisions previously contained in other statutes. 
    27   In Regina v. Barac [1999] NSWSC 61, I discussed the predecessor to s.61, s.431B of the Crimes Act 1900 and its predecessor provisions at paras.39-42, 70, 77-81. Subsequently, in Regina v. Petrinovic [1999] NSWSC 1131, paras.21-49, I discussed the statutory criteria now expressed in s.61 for the exercise of the power to sentence to life imprisonment. 
    28   In that regard, consideration of Mitchell v. The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 333 is in my view apposite when, in considering the Western Australian provision empowering a court to order that a prisoner in question is not to be eligible for parole, the High Court remarked upon the power as reposed in the court conditioned upon a determination by the court that it considers the making of the order ""is appropriate"". 
    29   It appears to me that I am required, if I was satisfied of those matters to which the section relates, to exercise the power: see Mitchell (supra, paras.29-35). In my view, if I am not so satisfied, I do not have the power to pass a sentence of life imprisonment, in which case, by reason of s.61(3) and s.21(1), there is power to pass a lesser sentence, the quantum of which, however, must be determined with reference to the maximum of life imprisonment. A possible alternative construction of s.61(3) would suggest that there might be a discretion to pass a life sentence or to pass a sentence less than life, notwithstanding satisfaction of the matters referred to in s.61(1). Such a construction would suggest that the discretion was to be exercised on some basis not expressly enunciated, but presumably in accord with the ordinary principles governing sentencing discretion. In that case, the language and concept of s.61 would be barely necessary. What need, one asks, would there have been to replace the criteria of ""worst class of case"" as discussed by Badgery-Parker, J. in Regina v. Twala (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994) and which I have discussed in the context of s.61(1) and its predecessors in Barac (supra) and Petrinovic (supra)? 
    30   The terrible significance of the sentence of life imprisonment without hope of release mitigates against a construction which would permit the sentence to be passed unless driven to it by satisfaction of the matters referred to in Twala (supra) and Regina v. Garforth (CCA, unreported 23 May 1994). 
    31   Such a construction appears to fly in the face of the intended object of s.61. But even if there was such a discretion, a principle to be applied in its exercise would require the maximum sentence to be reserved for those cases in the ""worst class of case"": Ibbs v. The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447, although it does not follow that the maximum penalty will be appropriate for all or even most of such cases when all relevant sentencing considerations are balanced in the ""intuitive synthesis"" required. 
    32   Even in such cases, there is no mere application of the maximum or mere mathematical computation involved: Thomson & Houlton (supra). 
    33   In this case, as in Barac (supra) and Petrinovic (supra), my attention has been drawn by the Crown to decisions such as that of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Rose [1999] NSWCCA 327; Regina v. Street (unreported 19 July 1996); Garforth (supra) as enunciating principles from which is derived the proposition that it is open to me in this case to be satisfied of the matters to which s.61 relates. I discuss such cases in Barac (supra) and Petrinovic (supra). 
     
      
    34   Having regard to the matters to which I referred in those cases and to those identified by the sentencing judges in such cases as Regina v. Lo [2000] NSWSC 714; Regina v. Harris [2000] NSWSC 285 and Regina v. Mrish (Hidden, J., unreported 13 December 1996), it can be seen that in assessing the ""worst class of case"" and the ""level of culpability in the commission of the offence"" a court is not limited to the immediate circumstances of the crime of murder solely, even if, when assessing "" the level of the culpability in the commission of the offence"", the court is required to disregard matters totally unconnected with the commission of the crime (Regina v. Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466). 
    35   Indeed, Street (supra) and Rose (supra) involved multiple counts of murder, as did Mrish (supra) and Harris (supra). Barac (supra) and Lo (supra) both involved counts of murder in the context, in the case of Lo of other offences including conspiracy to murder and various drug offences, and Barac, a count of murder in the context of a previous offence of malicious wounding for which the offender was serving a sentence at the time of the commission of the murder charged. Plainly motive and matters affecting the intellect or appreciation of the offender as affecting his involvement in the crime are relevant, even though personal to the offender (see Regina v. Burke (1983) 2 NSWLR 93) and Harris (supra)). 
    36   Here the offender has intended three murders, has appallingly injured the spouse of one of his intended victims, mistaking her for the intended victim, and has committed those offences in the context of seeking to interfere with the criminal justice process. His motive was apparently to do away with those who might be witnesses against him. 
    37   It appears to me that these offences, when considered together, are offences of the very highest criminality. It was put to me by the Crown that his actions in this regard were entirely disproportionate to the circumstances in which he found himself placed. These crimes certainly fell well within the ""worst class of case"". They were themselves appalling instances of actual or intended violence and were committed for a reprehensible motive. Having regarding to that motive, the number of crimes and the period during which they were committed, they showed more than merely transient or sporadic criminality. 
    38   There was, except in the offences themselves, no matter adverted to such as is referred to in Veen v. The Queen (No. 2) (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 as might require on synthesising all the elements involved the passing of a maximum sentence, although the criteria referred to in that decision of the High Court are plainly relevant to, not only the question of what sentence might be passed in discretion, but to whether or not the criteria in s.61(1) are satisfied. 
    39   It was conceded by the Crown that the plea of guilty was of high utilitarian value since the trial was set down for some 14 weeks, and would have involved some 140 witnesses, including Mrs. Gerges. It was conceded that the offender pleaded at a time when the true nature of the offences against him were first explained clearly to him, this having arisen at such a late stage in consequence of a change of counsel. 
    40   The Crown accepted that the full picture, including the weight of the evidence available, was revealed to the offender in the Crown opening and that the plea could not be considered a late plea in that context. It was accepted by the learned Crown Prosecutor that the plea, entered as it was, might properly be regarded as containing some element of contrition, but was of great value on the utilitarian basis and my attention was drawn to paragraphs 151-156 of Thomson & Houlton (supra). 
     
      
       
       ""Although these practices, as variously expressed, are suggestive, they are of only limited assistance. This is particularly so if, as proposed, any identified range is limited to the utilitarian value of a plea. That utilitarian value will vary from time to time and from one criminal justice system to another. Obviously there are common elements but there are also differences. The task of this court is to identify a discount range which is appropriate and which will serve the public interests sought to be attained in New South Wales from encouraging early pleas of guilty. 
       
      
      
       
       In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10 to 25%. 
       
      
      
       
       The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. 
       
      
      
       
       There are however, two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case:- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
       
      
      
       
       (b) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length of complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
       
      
      
       
       The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, eg., on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. 
       
      
      
       
       Rare cases involving exceptional complexity and trial duration may justify a higher discount. In some cases no discount is appropriate at all. In some cases the 'discount' will be reflected in a step down in the hierarchy of sentencing options."" 
       
      
    41   However, the Crown further submitted that it was open to me to pass the sentence of life imprisonment and that in coming to the view of whether I was satisfied of the matters to which s.61 relates, I should have regard to what appears in paragraphs 157-158 in Thomson & Houlton (supra). 
     
      
       
       ""There are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate (see, eg.,  
       Regina v. Stabler 
        (1984) 6 Crim. App. R. (s) 129 at 131;  
       Regina v. Costen 
        (1989) 11 Crim. App. R. (S) 182 at 184). 
       
      
      
       
       There are crimes that so offend the public interest that the maximum sentence, without any discount for any purpose, is appropriate. This includes situations in which a life sentence can be and is imposed, notwithstanding the plea (see, eg.,  
       Regina v. Kalache 
        [2000] NSWCCA 2, per Sully, J. at paras.38-42).""  
       
      
    42   I turn to the offender's prior record and personal circumstances. It was put to me that the offender's prior record was effectively irrelevant to my determination. That record included offences of larceny and use false instrument with an offence of receiving taken into account, for which the offender received community service. I accept that this record has little bearing upon the task I must perform, and I note that otherwise the offender was of good character in Ireland as was evidenced by both his Police Certificate of Character and his Certificates of Discharge as a Seaman. 
    43   He has been the subject of psychological assessment and report by Alison O'Neil, clinical psychologist. It was common ground between the Crown and counsel for the offender that although the offender had not given evidence on his plea before me, I could have regard to that interview for the conclusions of the psychologist and also her account of the description given by him of his own subjective circumstances. The offender is a 35 year old married man who was born in Ireland and has Australian citizenship. He is married and has two children. 
    44   He described to her a very stable home environment and childhood in Ireland, leading to his education in marine engineering, which involved apprenticeships in some seven trades. 
    45   The offender apparently came to Australia some 12 years ago to work on boats involved in the America's Cup. He has, however, been the subject of a number of accidents, several of which have resulted in head injuries, loss of consciousness and subsequent periods of post-traumatic amnesia. In addition, during his career it appears that on a number of occasions he has sustained accidents whilst diving in which he has experienced the bends and twice been placed in decompression chambers. He asserts that he presently, frequently, experiences bleeding from the nose and ears. 
    46   The psychologist pointed out that such bleeding is suggestive of organic brain damage and that the offender reports several symptoms indicative of cognitive deficits including headaches, memory problems, difficulty finding words or comprehending meanings, difficulty organising, planning or making decisions. He claims to be dyslexic. Testing revealed scattered performance on the WAIS III with significant strengths and weaknesses. On the Wechsler Memory Scale there was great difficulty manipulating information, learning and recalling verbal and visual information. His ability to learn and remember verbal and visual material was equally poor and his ability to recall, worse. 
    47   There was discovered to be a weakness in oral generativity and in expressive language. Overall, he showed results supportive of cognitive deficits and indeed on some of the tests his performance was consistent with poor executive functioning which was consistent with the performance of a brain damaged individual. 
    48   Emotionally, it was clear to the psychologist that he suffered severely from depression and anxiety to the extent that his symptoms were commensurate with a mood disorder with symptoms of tearfulness, feelings of worthlessness, irritability, agitation, hopelessness, impaired sleep, suicidal ideation and anxiety.  
    49   He has apparently consulted prison psychiatrists and been prescribed anti-depressant medication. He had significantly elevated levels of depression and anxiety though with no psychotic disturbance noted. The psychologist was able to elicit beliefs which may have been paranoid. 
    50   There is nothing specific put to me to suggest that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are significantly affected. In the light of the discussion of the relevant applicable principles in such a case by Bell, J. in Harris (supra), this is a most material matter. 
    51   I was informed that his wife, children and whole family were now in Ireland and that since 1997, as a consequence of an attack on him by other prisoners, he has been held in strict non-association segregation custody amounting to strict isolation involving no contact with other prisoners, this for his own protection. 
    52   I was further informed that the authorities had been unable to ascertain the underlying basis for the attack on him and consequently they are unable to ascertain whether he might be further at risk within the gaol system, so that the arrangements for his detention in isolation are of indeterminate duration. 
    53   It may be the case that his isolation will continue for a most extensive period. The fact that an offender will be spending time in more restrictive conditions of protection, can be a most important circumstance to take into account when having regard to the severity of the punishment on that offender of a lengthy sentence: see Regina v. Astill (CCA, unreported 1 October 1992); Regina v. Bell (CCA, unreported 11 May 1993), particularly where it cannot be seen that this is due to the offender's own fault. 
    54   Having regard to the objective circumstances, it is quite apparent that the gravity of the crimes for which the offender must be sentenced are so great that even should I conclude that I am not satisfied of the matters which s.61 requires, that nonetheless the overall culpability, considerations of general and personal deterrence, particularly in the context of offences committed out of a motive to defeat the ends of justice, will require very heavy sentences indeed. It is necessary for crimes of this degree of gravity for the court to denounce the conduct and to have regard to the moral outrage of the community: see Regina v. Geddes (1936) 36 SR 554; Regina v. Nichols (1991) 57 A. Crim. R. 391. 
    55   It will be necessary for the sentence to reflect the total criminality and in particular, to have regard to the criminality involved in the two counts on the indictment, while allowing for a substantial component in the eventual sentence to reflect the culpability to be attached to those offences charged on the Form 1: Regina v. Pearce (1998) 104 CLR 610. I must also have regard to the principle of totality. 
    56   I have regard to those matters when considering the s.61 criteria and, on any exercise of discretion, I will take them into account. Further, I note that any sentence must reflect the appalling conduct of the offender and its context and that he contemplated the killing of three persons, achieved the killing of one and severely and terribly injured another. It is necessary that the sentence not be disproportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to all the circumstances.  
    57   Although there is most limited material to which I can have regard, it seems as though what occurred was a process of frantic, if not, panic stricken reaction by the offender to the prospect of being tried and punished for the alleged fraud, possibly influenced by a degree of paranoia. His thought processes did not appear at all organised. He seems to have resorted to drastic and fantastic expedients because of the intellectual and personality deficits described by the psychologist.  
    58   His criminality should be considered to be mitigated to some limited, but some, degree by these matters: Regina v. Letteri (CCA, unreported 18 March 1992). Considering the criteria, comparisons between individual cases are of no assistance. It is hard to find any guiding principle which might operate by way of gloss upon the section to afford any further assistance than is afforded by direct regard to the express words of the provision. It is of no assistance to consider categories of murder such as those applicable to contract killers, political assassinations, killing for profit or to consider particular examples of other persons, who other judges, in other circumstances, but for the same crime thought deserved the maximum sentence. 
    59   I have considered all matters relevant to culpability and particularly the gravity, multiplicity and frequency of the crimes in context and, particularly, the offender's psychological deficits as appear to have been involved in his criminality. Notwithstanding that his conduct has been appalling and reprehensible in the extreme, I have been unable, after anxious consideration, to conclude that I am satisfied that the level of culpability is so extreme that the community's interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a sentence which would require the confinement of the offender for the rest of his natural life. 
    60   I am, however, of the view, having regard to all those matters, that nonetheless, a very lengthy sentence which will include a most substantial non-parole period, must be passed. 
    61   In that regard, however, the very length of the sentence together with the matters I have earlier referred to in evidence from the psychologist's report and going to the offender's cognitive deficits and possible brain damage and his isolation are such as amount to special circumstances. I am firmly of the view that, having regard to the matters I referred to in Petrinovic (supra) at paras.64-66, the maximum opportunity should be afforded to the offender for supervision after release but under the sanction of a possible return to custody, and that should be catered for by varying the statutory proportions envisaged by s.44(2) of the Act to a limited extent. 
    62   In accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Thomson & Houlton (supra), I express the discount for the plea of guilty as allowed at 15%. 
    63   Mr. Offer, on the charge of murder, you are sentenced to a total sentence of 34 years. There will be a 25 year non-parole period. That sentence takes into account the three matters on the Form 1. On the charge of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, you are sentenced to 10 years imprisonment to be served concurrently with the sentence on the murder charge. I decline to set a non-parole period for that offence because of the other penalty imposed on you for the murder offence. 
    64   I direct that those sentences commence on 17 October 1997. I specify that the earliest date on which the offender will be eligible for release from custody or eligible to be released on parole is 16 October 2022.*******

       REGINA v Kenneth Emmanuel DYERS  
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    STEIN JA:  I agree with Ireland AJ. 
     
      
    2    SMART AJ: I agree with Ireland AJ. 
     
      
    3    IRELAND AJ: The appellant, Kenneth Emmanuel Dyers, was indicted before his Honour Judge Kinchington QC at the Sydney District Court on 5 July 1999 on a charge that he between 22 July 1988 and 6 August 1988 at Sydney did assault AP, a person then under the age of 16 years, namely 13 years, and at the time of such assault, did commit an act of indecency upon her, she then being under his authority. This offence is in contravention of s 61E(1A) of the Crimes Act, 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 6 years. 
     
      
    4    The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before Judge Kinchington QC and a jury of twelve. 
     
      
    5    On 16 July 1999, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    6    On 4 July 2000, the appellant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. A non-parole period of 4 months was fixed. The sentence commenced on 4 July 2000. On 10 July 2000, the appellant was granted bail pending this appeal. 
     
      
    7    The appellant in addition to his appeal seeks leave to appeal against the alleged severity of that sentence. 
     
      
    8    The Crown case may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    9    The complainant, AP, who was, at the time of giving her evidence on 7 July 1999, just four days short of her 24th birthday, said that in 1986, when she was 10 years old and residing in the Australian Capital Territory, she began attending meetings conducted by an organisation which was described as a ""communications group"" called Kenja. She was accompanied by her mother, MW, and her two sisters. She was informed that the activities of the organisation included sporting events and was told about energy centres and energy conversion or processing sessions which occupied thirty to forty minutes during which two people sat opposite each other and stared into each other's eyes. 
     
      
    10    Some four months after the complainant began attending Kenja, she met the appellant at a seminar in Canberra. Afterwards, they had a one-on-one session. On the appellant's instructions, the complainant sat opposite him on a chair with her legs on his chair on either side of his legs and they stared at each other for about forty minutes. 
     
      
    11    While the complainant lived in Canberra, she saw the appellant at monthly seminars held in Sydney. She travelled to Sydney by bus and stayed in the homes of other Kenja members. The complainant participated in group energy conversion sessions as well as one-on-one sessions with the appellant. 
     
      
    12    In July 1986, the complainant, her mother and sisters moved to Point Piper in Sydney. After school, she would be picked up by a minibus organised by Kenja and taken to a centre where she would do her homework and participate in classes before going home. 
     
      
    13    After living in Sydney for about three months, the complainant moved back to the Australian Capital Territory to live with her father and six months later they moved to the Gold Coast. At the end of 1987, when the complainant was aged 12, she went to live with her mother who was by then living in Melbourne and working as a co-director of Kenja in Melbourne. She began attending Kenja three times a week and would also attend monthly seminars in Sydney. 
     
      
    14    One such visit to Sydney took place on Friday, 29 July 1988. The complainant gave evidence that, on that occasion, she and her mother spoke to the appellant in his office after which the complainant had an energy conversion session with the appellant in a room off his office. Her mother was not present during this session. 
     
      
    15    The complainant gave evidence that, during this session, the appellant told her that she needed to 'clear' on certain energies, one of them being sex. They sat opposite each other and the complainant had her legs on the appellant's chair on either side of his legs. The appellant asked the complainant to remove her shirt because she needed to 'clear' on the energies on her stomach and chest. The appellant told her that it would be easier if there was nothing obstructing her energy centres. He then placed his hand on the complainant's stomach and also touched her breasts. He left his hand there for about five minutes. He then fondled her breasts and kissed her on the head and cheeks and then pulled her towards him by her arms. The appellant asked the complainant to remove her skirt, which she did, and also her underwear, which she declined to do. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant became abusive, pushed her chair back, swore at her and called her a ""bitch"". He told her to get dressed and stormed out of the room. The complainant stated that she was shaken and very upset at what had happened. The session had lasted about three hours. 
     
      
    16    The appellant thereafter had an acrimonious conversation with the complainant and her mother. The appellant later asked the complainant whether she wanted to have another session, which she declined. The appellant then told the complainant that she and her family could stay for the weekend and that she, her mother and sisters would then have to leave the Kenja organisation. 
     
      
    17    The complainant gave evidence that she did not tell anyone about the assault until 1993 because the appellant had told her not to discuss with anyone what occurred during energy conversion sessions. 
     
      
    18    The appellant made a statement from the dock in which he denied the allegations made against him. He said that he hardly knew the complainant because she was not a junior professional (being a rank within the Kenja organisation) and would thus have come under the jurisdiction of another person within the organisation. He said that he did not have energy conversion sessions with the complainant in Canberra or Sydney. 
     
      
    19    There was evidence given at the hearing which related to the affairs of the Kenja organisation, in particular in Melbourne, concerning the activities of the complainant's mother whilst acting as a co-director.  
     
      
    20    It is noteworthy that these matters were raised by the appellant in his unsworn statement and were the subject of evidence called in the defence case. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - The Trial Miscarried 
       
      
    21    In this regard, it is submitted that the trial got out of control and became an inquiry into the Kenja organisation and its finances coupled with an attempt on the part of the Crown to smear the appellant and his witnesses by suggesting an association with Scientology. 
     
      
    22    The mention of Scientology was a passing reference on two occasions in the evidence and not at all in the summing up. The jury was told that Kenja was not on trial and, in his summing up, the trial Judge endeavoured to make plain the purpose for which that evidence was called. 
     
      
    23    Insofar as this ground relates to a reference to Scientology, it is, in my view, not made out. Insofar as it relates to directions given generally, further consideration will be given shortly. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - The verdict of the jury was unreasonable and/or not supported by the evidence 
       
      
    24    It is submitted for the appellant that, on an independent assessment of the case, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt and there is a significant possibility that the appellant is an innocent person who has been convicted. 
     
      
    25    The first point made in this regard is the delay of eleven years in making complaint, with the explanation being advanced that this followed a directive given by the appellant to the complainant not to disclose anything that took place during the sessions. This, it is submitted, makes no sense when the complainant ceased to be a member of the organisation on the day on which the incident was alleged to have occurred. 
     
      
    26    Emphasis is further placed upon what are described as manifest discrepancies and contradictions between the evidence given by the complainant on the one hand and her mother on the other, many of which were brought to the jury's attention in the address made by counsel for the appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    27    Counsel for the appellant has listed in a schedule some of the matters said to be important areas of discrepancy which cast doubt on the complainant's credibility and reliability. 
     
      
    28    I have considered the matters referred to in the schedule. I am not persuaded that they are matters of significance but are readily explicable on the basis that the witnesses were doing their best in the circumstances to recall events which took place some eleven years before. 
     
      
    29    With regard to the item listed as number '4' under paragraph (b) on the second page of the schedule, I can find no justification in the evidence for the emphasised suggestion that the length of the vital session referred to in the complainant's evidence in chief is about five to ten minutes, whereas, in cross-examination, the session was said to be three hours in length. A fair reading of the evidence does not, to my mind, lead to this conclusion at all. 
     
      
    30    This was a case in which the question of guilt turned upon an acceptance by the jury of the evidence of the complainant.  
     
      
    31    The fact that this Court does not have the advantage of seeing the witnesses themselves, necessarily imposes a restriction on its ability to judge whether the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to guilt: see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493. In both Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and in M v The Queen, the High Court emphasised the need to give full regard to the fact that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence and that the jury has the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. 
     
      
    32    As pointed out by counsel for the respondent, the failure of the appellant to give sworn evidence contradicting the version of events given by the complainant represents a substantial impediment to the success of this ground of appeal: see R v Gordon and Gordon (1991) 57 ACrimR 413. See also R v Blade (NSWCCA, 1 May 1991, unreported). 
     
      
    33    In my view, once it is recognised that the essential question for the jury is whether or not they accept the evidence of the complainant unchallenged by sworn testimony on the part of the appellant, there is ample testimony upon which the jury could rely in establishing to the relevant standard the guilt of the appellant. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - The trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury in respect of prior inconsistent evidence 
       
      
    34    On behalf of the appellant, the submission is made that no direction was given to the jury at the time the trial Judge made reference to inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence generally. Counsel for the appellant recognises, however, the direction given by the trial Judge, at T 140, where his Honour said, ""If you think what she said then is inconsistent with what she said now use … it on the question of reliability or use it as evidence of the truth of the situation she was then talking about"". 
     
      
    35    In his summing up, at pp 56-58 inclusive, the inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant and her mother were set out extensively by his Honour citing ten separate incidences upon which reliance was placed by counsel for the defence. The suggestion that this review of the alleged deficiencies in the Crown case did not squarely place before the jury the issue of credibility on the part of both witnesses is captious in the extreme. No exception was taken by experienced counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial in this regard, although in other regards counsel had no hesitation taking issue with any deficiency perceived in the trial Judge's summing up. Leave is required to argue this ground, the point having not been taken at the trial below. I would refuse leave. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - The trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury to acquit because the evidence in the trial did not support the Crown opening 
       
       
      Ground 5 - The trial Judge erred in failing to discharge the jury 
       
       
      Ground 6 - The trial Judge erred in law in not directing the jury properly or adequately to:- 
       
      (a) confine the act said to constitute an indecent assault to that alleged by the Crown; and 
       
      (b) ignore any other allegation by the complainant 
       
      
    36    It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. 
     
      
    37    The appellant contends that the case which the Crown opened to the jury and set out to prove was one in which the indecent act relied upon to constitute the indecent assault was a kiss on the complainant's head followed by an attempt to pull down her underpants. The actual evidence that the complainant gave is to be found at T 60-63:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You went to a room with the accused, a room which ran off his office, is that right? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there a door separating his office from that room? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened to that door? 
         
        A. It was closed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened inside the room with the accused? 
         
        A. He said that I needed to clear on certain energies, one including sex. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened then? 
         
        A. Then we started having a processing session and he asked me to remove my shirt and said I needed to clear on certain energies on my stomach, on my chest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you said we started a processing session what position did you take up and what position did he take up prior to the commencement of that session? 
         
        A. Opposite each other with my legs exactly the same position straddled over his. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you've indicated what he told you. At the very commencement of the session how were you dressed? 
         
        A. Fully clothed with skirt and a top I think. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said something about the accused saying something in respect to your clothing? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say? 
         
        A. He asked me to remove my clothing. Firstly I removed my top. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say? 
         
        A. He said that it would be easier to clear the energy if I didn't have anything basically obstructing my energy centres. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he indicate what your energy centres were? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say? 
         
        A. Head energy centre, chest and stomach energy centre. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You removed your top, and after removing your top, what outer garments did you have still on - on your body? 
         
        A. A skirt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. A skirt? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you going to say something else? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he do something then? 
         
        A. Yes. He then placed his hand on my stomach that way (indicated) and he also touched my chest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have indicated with your right hand - your hand on your own stomach area, fingers parallel to the floor. Would that be right? 
         
        A. Yes, correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. With his thumb uppermost, pointing up towards your head? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long did he leave his hand there for? 
         
        A. Approximately five minutes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he do with your breast? 
         
        A. He then sort of fondled them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Then what happened? 
         
        A. Then he kissed me on my face. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now when he kissed you, just describe to the members of the jury how he did that? 
         
        A. Just basically kissed me on my head and my cheeks and pulled me towards him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did he pull you towards him? 
         
        A. By my arms (indicated). 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He was sitting directly opposite you at that stage? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened then? 
         
        A. He then asked me to remove my skirt, which I then did, and he asked me to remove my underwear. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you have on as underwear? 
         
        A. Myself? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. Just pants. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Your underpants? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When he asked you to remove your underwear, did you say anything? 
         
        A. I said no, I didn't want to. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you do anything? 
         
        A. I tried to move back."" 
        
       
      
    38    It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the case should not have been left to the jury and that the trial Judge should either have directed the jury to acquit or discharged the jury. 
     
      
    39    It was further put that a strong remedial direction was required directing the jury to put out of their minds the case opened by the Crown as to the attempt to pull down her underpants as compared to that given by the complainant in her evidence. 
     
      
    40    In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant contends that the trial Judge refused to direct an acquittal or to discharge the jury. This was not the situation. The trial Judge refused to direct an acquittal, however, an application to discharge the jury was specifically eschewed by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    41    The further complaint is made that, in summing up to the jury, the trial Judge said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Here the Crown alleges that on the day in question that  
        (AP)  
        was having a 'session' with the accused, an 'energy conversion session', and that during that 'session', and in the context of having asked her to take off her top and her skirt, leaving her dressed in her underpants, he kissed her and pulled her towards him. And the Crown says that in the context of those actions, bearing in mind her age, bearing in mind the accused, bearing in mind the purposes of that 'session', according to the Crown, that that constitutes an indecent assault.""  
        (S/U 17) 
        
       
      
    42    Words to similar effect were used by his Honour in his summing up at p 18. The inclusion of the words ""pulled her towards him"" is said not to form part of the Crown case. 
     
      
    43    That a complainant or any witness in a Crown case may not come completely up to proof is no novelty. For that reason, trial judges invariably direct juries that what counsel say in opening is not evidence in the case. That was done in this case and the trial Judge was at pains to tell the jury on two occasions from whence the evidence upon which they were to rely was to be derived. 
     
      
    44    In this case, where a 13 year old girl, at the request of the appellant, had removed her upper clothing, had experienced the fondling of her breasts and had been kissed on the face, i.e. head and cheeks, and then had complied with a request to remove her skirt, following which she was requested to remove her underwear but declined, there was no warrant for a directed verdict of acquittal. 
     
      
    45    Had any prejudice to the appellant been apparent in his less culpable actions, in pulling her towards him, than the act of attempting to pull down her underpants, as opened by the Crown, the remedy would have been in an application to discharge the jury. 
     
      
    46    Consideration of this course by counsel for the appellant resulted in emphatic declinature, on his part, to adopt such a course. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 - The trial Judge erred in law in misdirecting or failing to direct the jury adequately and properly as to the effect of delay in making a complaint 
       
       
      Ground 11 - The trial Judge's summing up lacked balance 
       
      
    47    It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together. 
     
      
    48    The offence upon which the appellant was indicted had occurred some eleven years prior to the trial. It is common ground that the first time the complainant is said to have told someone about the assault was in 1993. The first time the matter was raised with the appellant was in September of that year. 
     
      
    49    In his written submissions, Mr Ramage, Senior Counsel for the appellant, cites what was said by his Honour, in his summing up at pp 22-24, as being the only directions given in relation to delay and says that these directions were inadequate in that; (a) they did not bring home to the jury that the delay reflected adversely on the complainant's credit and; (b) they did not indicate that the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested and, also, that the directions given were used to explain the inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant and her mother, rather than the adverse affect upon the appellant. 
     
      
    50    These grounds of appeal, in my view, lack merit. In addition to those matters in the summing up to which counsel for the appellant has directed us, the respondent relies upon the following passage in the trial Judge's summing up at p 27: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… you may think that those facts place him in a very difficult and disadvantageous position in the sense that after the passage of five years, without an inkling that such an allegation would be made, it may be difficult for him to reflect back on what he was doing at that particular time to prepare material so that questions could be asked of  
        (AP) 
        , or to account for his actions on that day and what he was doing to rebut any assertion that he had been involved with  
        (AP) 
         in the way she described. Even bearing in mind there is no onus on him to prove anything, but still he is placed, you may think, at a disadvantage because five years have elapsed before he hears about the allegations made by  
        (AP) 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        That might affect the memory of people that might be able to support him as to what occurred at that time. It might affect him obtaining any information about the events of that day about which he could question  
        (AP) 
        , or her mother."" 
        
       
       
      These are, in my view, proper and adequate directions as to the disadvantages which may accrue to an accused person arising as a result of delay. 
       
      
    51    Mr Berman further refers to other aspects of the summing up. At p 23, his Honour stated that the absence of complaint ""does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed was false""; also, the reference in the summing up, at p 24, where his Honour notes that delay ""may indicate fabrication""; and the further extract from the summing up, at p 27, where his Honour said, ""the time that has elapsed without him becoming aware of these allegations is a factor for you to take into consideration, both on the issue of reliability of (AP's) evidence and also on this question of whether the accused has been disadvantaged in any way by such a delay in him receiving notice of (AP's) allegations"", - all being matters which properly and adequately emphasise the disadvantages of delayed complaint. 
     
      
    52    The further submission is made on behalf of the respondent that his Honour's imprimatur was added to the submission made by trial counsel for the appellant and reiterated by his Honour who said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""… that the absence of any such complaint to anyone to whom she might reasonably have been expected to complain, is inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted"" 
        , 
        
       
       
      and his Honour's concluding remark:- 
       
        
        ""That is a matter which you may consider …"". 
        
       
      
    53    A consideration of these matters makes it plain that the issue of delayed complaint was comprehensively and adequately dealt with by the trial Judge and that the necessary balance with which the jury should be directed to approach this aspect of the trial was adequately presented and complied with. These grounds are rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 - The trial Judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury in accordance with  
      Longman v The Queen 
       (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 108 
       
      
    54    Here it is submitted that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant and that a direction to closely scrutinise the evidence of the complainant was inadequate. 
     
      
    55    In his summing up, the trial Judge said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""As both counsel have referred to, the Crown relies solely upon the evidence of  
        (AP) 
         to prove its case against the accused in these proceedings. If you do not accept  
        (AP's) 
         evidence as being reliable, either wholly or in this particular issue as to what she says occurs there, well that of course would be the end of the matter because if you do not accept her as reliable on that evidence then it would not establish the essential element, that is that an indecent assault took place, or that any assault took place. 
        
       
       
        
        In these circumstances you must carefully scrutinise her evidence, both in general, and more particularly in so far as it relates to the charge. In order to determine whether you can act upon it, having decided that question, will depend on what you do thereafter. 
        
       
       
        
        If after the closer scrutiny you are satisfied it is reliable and safe to act upon then you go on to determine whether that evidence establishes the three essential elements to which I have referred in this case.""  
        (S/U 25) 
        
       
      
    56    His Honour further referred to this aspect of the jury's function, at S/U 30-31, where he said, concerning the evidence of the complainant:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""If you have a reasonable doubt about her evidence in that regard  
        (her version of events) 
         the accused is entitled to the benefit of it and it would almost inevitably follow that you would be duty bound to return a verdict of not guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        It is for those reasons that I told you earlier that you must scrutinise her evidence with the utmost of care, both from  
        (t) 
        he point of view of reliability and honesty, and determine firstly whether you are satisfied you can act upon it, and secondly if you can whether it establishes beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements that go to constitute the offence charged."" 
        
       
      
    57    In this regard, the respondent submits that there is respectable authority in this Court, and elsewhere, that not in every case is it necessary to say that it would be ""dangerous"" to convict on the uncorroborated allegations of a complainant. Cited is R v DJK (1997) 96 ACrimR 443 at 450. Further reliance is placed upon the passage in R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 375B, where the function of the trial judge was enunciated as being to ""… make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair"". The point being made that there are decisions in earlier authorities to the effect that it was not necessary in every case for the trial judge to say that it would be ""dangerous"" to convict on the uncorroborated allegations of a complainant. 
     
      
    58    In the present case, the caution with which the jury was directed to approach the uncorroborated aspects of the evidence of the complainant was adequately impressed upon the jury, and this ground of appeal, in my view, should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9 - The trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury equating  
      ""reliability"" 
       with  
      ""credibility"" 
       in respect to the complainant's evidence 
       
      
    59    The submission is made on behalf of the appellant that the real issue in the case was ""the complainant's credibility"". This, of course, is merely one way of putting the principal issue. Another way is to ask the question which, in my view, is more appropriate in a jury trial, that is - is the complainant telling the truth and is her (or his) evidence reliable. 
     
      
    60    In the context of this case, where the central issue in the trial, being the acceptance by the jury of the evidence of the complainant, was made crystal clear, the distinction sought to be drawn by the appellant between her credibility and her reliability is altogether too fine. I would reject this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10 - The trial Judge erred in law in directing the jury that they were entitled to draw an inference that witnesses not called by the defence would not have assisted the defence case. 
       
      
    61    The trial Judge gave the jury a Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 direction. The appellant complains of the following matters. First, it is said that this direction related to the failure of the appellant to call certain witnesses. This is only partly true. The direction given related, in a general sense, to both parties and did not single out the appellant. In fact, both counsel for the prosecution and the defence had made reference in their respective addresses to a failure on the part of the other party to call witnesses. Further complaint is made that the jury should have been told that the issue did not arise at all unless they were of the view that the named persons were potentially important witnesses. What his Honour said was:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where it appears to you, as judges of the fact, that there is a witness who could be expected to have been able to give relevant evidence on some aspect of the case, but that witness has not been called, you are not entitled to speculate upon what that witness might have said if the witness had been called."" 
         (S/U 59) 
        
       
      
    62    The further submission is made that, if the trial Judge was contemplating giving such a direction, it was incumbent upon him to raise the matter with counsel in the absence of the jury. This submission overlooks the exchange between the trial Judge and counsel, during the course of the summing up and in the absence of the jury, at pp 12 and 13 of the summing up. His Honour said, ""Now both counsel have addressed on this question of failure to call witnesses"". He identified three witnesses about whom counsel for the defence had commented in his address to the jury as being persons whom the Crown would have been expected to call. His Honour went on to discuss with the Crown the witnesses whom the Crown had commented upon as those which the jury may have expected the defence to call. No objection was taken to the clear intention of the trial Judge to give at least a bi-partisan Jones v Dunkel direction. 
     
      
    63    The dangers which attend the giving of a Jones v Dunkel direction in a criminal trial are well recognised: see R v Taufua [1999] NSWCCA 205. 
     
      
    64    In supplementary submissions we have been referred to R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279, a case in which the failure of the Crown Prosecutor to call a relevant and material eyewitness on the basis of an asserted unreliability, without undertaking appropriate steps to ascertain the willingness and capability of the witness to give relevant and truthful evidence, was held to constitute a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    65    In the present case, no issue as to the capability or the reliability of the persons who may have been called to give evidence arose. Whilst the Crown Prosecutor is obliged to present the Crown case with fairness to the accused, the duty to call witnesses does not extend in the present case to everyone present on any given occasion. There is no evidence as to why the witnesses in question, in the present case, were not called to give evidence. In this regard, R v Kneebone is to be distinguished. 
     
      
    66    In RPS v R 168 ALR 729 (a judgment handed down on 3 February 2000, after the trial in the present case), the High Court of Australia in considering the directions appropriate for a trial judge to give regarding the failure of an accused person to give evidence, Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [28]-[29] said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""[28] In a criminal trial, not only is an accused person not bound to give evidence, it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The observations by the court in  
        Jones v Dunkel 
         must not be applied in criminal cases without taking account of those considerations. 
        
       
       
        
        [29] If the question concerns the calling by the defence of a witness other than the accused, it will also be necessary to recall that the prosecutor 'has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused'  
        Richardson v R 
         (1974) 131 CLR 116 at 119;  
        [see] 
         also  
        R v Apostilides 
         (1984) 154 CLR 563 and in many cases would be expected to call the witness in question as part of the case for the prosecution. And, if the question concerns the failure of the prosecution to call a witness whom it might have been expected to call, the issue is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, the jury should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused."" 
        
       
      
    67    In the present case, a reading of the transcript makes plain that the witnesses referred to by the Crown Prosecutor in his address were not witnesses whom the Crown, in fairness, would be expected to call to give evidence. No complaint was made, nor could it have been, that the trial Judge did not make abundantly clear the onus which the Crown at all times bore. RPS v R does not proscribe the giving of a Jones v Dunkel direction in a criminal trial. What is, however, essential is that, consideration be given to questions of fairness, including the need to make clear to the jury that an accused person is not bound to give evidence and that it is for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    68    In the present case, the direction given was neither inappropriate nor unfair. There was no miscarriage of justice. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 12 - The trial Judge erred in limiting the way in which counsel for the accused was able to address 
       
      
    69    This ground relates to the refusal of the trial Judge to permit counsel for the appellant to use cards or placards as aids to establish or emphasise important points to the jury. The submission is made that this ruling placed a bar or impediment on the way in which defence counsel could address and make appropriate points to the jury. 
     
      
    70    The placards in question were described by Mr Ramage as approximately one metre square in dimension and to comprise the catchwords and phrases set out in the reduced scale photocopies, Exhibit B on appeal. The words used in the placards are not confined to aides-memoire but include comment obviously intended to persuade. The manner in which the trial was to be conducted was a discretionary matter for the trial Judge. I am not persuaded that the ruling to disallow use of the placards was such as to result in a miscarriage of justice. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    71    I would propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
     
      
    72    The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the alleged severity of his sentence. Firstly, on the basis that, in all the circumstances, the penalty imposed was unduly harsh and severe and, secondly, on the basis that the sentencing process was allegedly vitiated by error. 
     
      
    73    In support of the first ground, the submission is made by counsel for the appellant that there was no penetration, no touching of genitalia and that it was an isolated incident that lasted only seconds at the most. The appellant is an elderly man, now 78 years of age, who is frail and suffering chronic ill-health. I shall return to a consideration of this ground. 
     
      
    74    The second ground claims that the sentencing process miscarried in that the trial Judge took into account on sentence, facts and circumstances that were not elements of the offence. 
     
      
    75    Counsel for the appellant reiterates those aspects opened by the Crown to the jury relating to the complainant's underwear which were not made out in the evidence, as well as placing reliance upon the assertion that, in kissing the complainant, the appellant pulled her towards him as part of the indecent assault. The further submission is made that the expressions used by the learned sentencing Judge, in his remarks on sentence, constituted a gross exaggeration of the facts and were not capable of use as aggravating matters to justify imposing a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    76    The further submission is made that insufficient emphasis was placed upon the delay between when the offence occurred and the sentencing being undertaken, and that fairness to the offender in his situation at the time of sentencing required that he be given a degree of leniency which was not reflected in the sentence imposed. A comprehensive list of authorities has been included in the submissions placed before this Court, with reference also being made to the fact that the matter could have been dealt with as a summary offence, where a maximum 2 year sentence would have been applicable. Further emphasis is placed upon the appellant's prior good character, his community service including his war service, and the testimonials as to his character tendered on his behalf. 
     
      
    77    On behalf of the respondent, it is submitted that the sentencing Judge correctly identified the seriousness of the objective circumstances of the offence. Mr Berman makes the submission with force that it cannot be a mitigating factor as to one offence, that a more serious offence was not committed or charged. 
     
      
    78    On the issue of the sentencing process being vitiated by error, counsel for the respondent has submitted a comprehensive and helpful review of the principles and the authorities relevantly to be considered. 
     
      
    79    The learned sentencing Judge had before him a report of Dr Mark Hardy of 27 June 2000. This report, part of Exhibit 31, lists the medical conditions from which the appellant is suffering. 
     
      
    80    The exhibit includes a report of Dr David Malouf of 29 June 2000 which speaks of the need for surgery. 
     
      
    81    Admitted into evidence before us today is further medical material which, inter alia, relates to events occurring since the appellant has been sentenced, in particular, in the brief period when he was in custody. 
     
      
    82    For my part, I am not persuaded that the sentencing process was vitiated by error on the trial Judge's part. Nevertheless, on a consideration of the more recent medical material, I am of the view that the appellant should not be returned into custody. 
     
      
    83    I would propose the following orders:- 
     
      
      1. That the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
       
       
      2. That leave to appeal against severity of sentence be granted. 
       
       
      3. That the appeal against severity of sentence be upheld and the sentence quashed. 
       
       
      4. That the appellant be sentenced to 12 months imprisonment deemed to have commenced on 4 July 2000 expiring on 3 July 2001. 
       
       
      5. That pursuant to s 12 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 
      , the sentence be suspended subject to the offender entering into a bond to be of good behaviour during the remainder of the term of the sentence.

      REGINA v Chong Mun CHAI 
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     THE COURT 
     : The appellant, Chong Mun Chai, was indicted on 15 April 1998 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on four counts: (1) that he murdered Duck Huan Kim, (2) that (in the alternative) he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on that deceased, (3) that he murdered Doh Su Kim, and (4) that (in the alternative) he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm on that deceased. The statutory alternative charge of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act went to the jury in relation to each charge of murder. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The appellant was found not guilty of murder under counts (1) and (3) but guilty of manslaughter on each count. Accordingly, no verdict was taken on counts (2) and (4). 
      
       
      
     3     
     The appellant’s co-accused, Shang Hyan Bae, who was tried with him on identical charges, was found not guilty of both murder and manslaughter but guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on each of the deceased. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The crown case was that both deceased were beaten up by a group of several men at the Ehwa Karaoke Bar at Kings Cross (which was owned and managed by the appellant), and that they died as a result of the beating. The crown’s case was conducted on the basis that it could not prove which blow or blows caused the deaths of the respective deceased or (necessarily) who in the group had delivered the fatal blows. 
      
       
      
     5     
     There was no room for serious doubt on the evidence that the deceased were in fact savagely beaten in the confrontation which ensued and received the injuries from which they died.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The primary crown case was that the appellant and Mr Bae were active participants in the assault. However, there was an alternative basis, peculiar to the appellant, which did not require proof that the appellant was present and assisting in the beating. This basis asserted that the appellant procured the beating when he telephoned Sang Hoon Lee. The challenge to the directions relates to this aspect of the crown case. 
      
       
      
     7     
     Sang Hoon Lee gave evidence that the appellant summoned him and two companions to the bar in the course of a telephone conversation, saying, “The gangsters are here so come here quick”. He went on to say in his evidence that, once there, he with others, including the appellant and his co-accused, proceeded to give the deceased a severe beating. This was evidence on which (taken with the other material) it was open to the jury to find that the appellant had procured Mr Lee and his companions to beat up the deceased. On the other hand, it was also open to the jury to find that Mr Lee and his companions were summoned by the appellant to persuade the deceased to leave, if necessary by use of some unspecified degree of force but not involving a beating.  
      
       
      
     8     
     In his evidence, the appellant denied summoning Mr Lee and his companions to beat up the deceased or indeed summoning them at all. He also denied any personal involvement in the beatings. There was, however, a scenario which the jury could find - and might have found as the fact - partly by reference to the opening statement by counsel for the appellant which followed the crown prosecutor’s opening address. Counsel told the jury that the appellant’s case was that the deceased were seen in a vehicle outside the bar, that the appellant made contact with Mr Lee and that the appellant asked Mr Lee to come and tell the men to move on, but that he also told Mr Lee that there was to be no fighting. In the event, the appellant did not give evidence along those lines. He denied any such conversation. But the jury was entitled to reject his denial and to use the opening statement by counsel as evidencing an admission by the appellant that he asked Mr Lee to come and move the men on, but without getting into a fight. (Much time was spent in the appeal exploring a factual issue as to whether counsel’s instructions from the appellant permitted such an opening. We incline to the view that they did, but it is unnecessary to resolve this issue in light of what follows.)  
      
       
        
       The Law 
        
       
      
     9     
     It is necessary to be clear about terminology. The following terms have the following meanings ( 
     Osland v The Queen 
       
     (1998) 197 CLR 361, per McHugh J at 341-2): 
      
       
        
         
         “Principal in the first degree” means the person who actually performs the criminal act.  
          
          
         A person who is criminally responsible in some other way is referred to as a “secondary party”. Secondary parties are as follows. 
          
          
         “Principal in the second degree” means a person, present at the commission of the crime, who aids or assists in its commission. 
          
          
         “Accessory before the fact” means a person, not present when the crime is committed, who urges or contributes towards commission of the crime.  
          
          
         “Accessory after the fact” means a person who assists the perpetrator after the offence has been committed.  
         
        
       
      
     10     
     Along with these legal concepts, stands the doctrine of common purpose. This was explained in  
     McAuliffe v The Queen 
       
     (1995) 183 CLR 108, 113-4 as follows. We quote from the joint judgment of the court (emphasis added): 
      
       
        
         
         “The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms - common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise - are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime. The liability which attaches to the traditional classifications of accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree may be enough to establish the guilt of a secondary party: in the case of an accessory before the fact where that party counsels or procures the commission of the crime and in the case of a principal in the second degree where that party, being present at the scene, aids or abets its commission (See  
         Giorgianni v The Queen  
         (1985) 156 CLR 473). But the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises  
         where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. 
          The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission (cf  
         R v Lowery and King [No 2]  
         [1972] VR 560 at 560, per Smith J). 
         
        
        
         
         Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of  
         any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. 
          Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary object of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes were contemplated by the parties to that venture ( 
         Mansell and Herbert's Case 
          (1556) 2 Dyer 128b [73 ER 279];  
         Ashton's Case 
          (1698) 12 Mod 256 [88 ER 1304];  
         R v Radalyski 
          (1899) 24 VLR 687;  
         R v Kalinowski 
          (1930) 31 SR (NSW) 377. See generally  
         Smith, A Modern Treatise on the Law of Criminal Complicity 
          (1991), pp 209-214.) However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and  
         the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose 
          (See  
         R v Johns 
          [1978] 1 NSWLR 282 at 287-290, per Street CJ).”  
         
        
       
      
     11     
     The concepts in the two paragraphs quoted above were helpfully labelled by Hunt CJ at CL in  
     Tangye 
       
     (1997) 92 ACrimR 545 as “straight forward joint criminal enterprise” and “extended joint criminal enterprise”. His Honour observed in that case (at 556): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise only where - as in the present case - it cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who physically committed the offence charged. It needs to rely upon the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise, based upon common purpose, only where the offence charged is not the same as the enterprise agreed.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     12     
     In  
     Osland 
       
     (at 343), McHugh J approved the following statement by Hunt CJ at CL in  
     Tangye  
     (at 556): 
      
       
        
         
         “The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying on that enterprise.”  
         
        
        
       Thus, where legal responsibility for the act or acts of another arises from participation in a joint criminal enterprise, the secondary party is liable as a principal for the crime committed by the perpetrator. 
        
       
      
     13     
     In this judgment, we will use Hunt CJ at CL’s terminology of “straight forward joint criminal enterprise” and “extended joint criminal enterprise”. 
      
       
      
     14     
     Speaking generally, if a person procures another to commit an unlawful act and death ensues because the act inflicted was objectively dangerous, then the first person will be guilty of manslaughter. On this basis of liability, it is vital that the unlawful act be part of the common design or joint criminal enterprise. If the dangerous act done is within the scope of the joint enterprise both the principal offender and the accessory before the fact will be liable ( 
     Giorgianni v The Queen 
      (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 502-3). 
      
       
      
     15     
     Identification of the scope of a joint enterprise may be a difficult question of fact, because there will be situations where a particular act is no more than an unexpected incident of carrying out a common design. An accused need not see or authorise every detail of the principal offence. In  
     R v Anderson & Morris 
      [1966] 2 QB 110, the use of a knife was regarded as being beyond the scope of a joint enterprise to beat up the victims and on that basis a conviction for manslaughter against Morris was quashed. On the other hand, in  
     Varley v The Queen  
     (1977) 51 ALJR 243 the use of a cosh was regarded as within the scope of such a joint enterprise. It was said in  
     Varley 
       
     (at 247) that it could not reasonably be held that the use of such an instrument was not within the scope of the common design, the act done being no more (it was said) than an unexpected incident of carrying out the common design.  
     Varley 
       
     was a case of straight forward joint criminal enterprise.  
      
       
      
     16     
     It all depends on  
     “whether what was done was within the scope of the common design” 
      ( 
     Markby v The Queen 
      (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 112 per Gibbs ACJ). It is not sufficient that the principal offender has committed the same offence in law as that promoted by the secondary party. Rather, the execution of the offence by the principal offender must not differ materially in kind from that agreed (cf  
     Fisse, Howard’s Criminal Law 
      5th ed p343).  
      
       
      
     17     
     In  
     Duong 
      (1992) 61 A Crim R 140 Mathews J (with whom Handley JA and Sully J agreed) referred to  
     Anderson & Morris 
     ,  
     Varley 
      and  
     Markby 
      and continued (at 148-9, emphasis added): 
      
       
        
         
         It is this phrase, “an unexpected incident in carrying out the common design”  
         [ 
         Varley 
          at 246] 
          which has led to some confusion in this area of the law: see, eg,  
         Woolley 
          (1989) 42 A Crim R 418 at 438. Its meaning is central to the resolution of these appeals. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         We start with the proposition that the word “incident” means “incidental act” rather than “occurrence” or “event”. This is made clear both by its context and by its use in other authorities on the subject:  
         Johns; Varley; Woolley; Hui Chi-ming 
          [1992] 1 AC 34. 
         
        
        
         
         The first step in this as in all cases of accessorial liability, must be to determine the scope of the original agreement.  
         What was the extent of the common design? Was the  
         act 
          which caused death something which, although in fact uncontemplated and unexpected by the accessory, was nevertheless, viewed in retrospect, reasonably within the scope of the joint plan? 
         
        
        
         
         This will always be a question of fact, not law, and in many cases will be a matter of degree. So in  
         Varley 
          the use of a baton, although in fact unexpected, was held to be within the range of events which might reasonably be expected to occur during the “roughing up” of a large, strong man. On the other hand, the use of a knife as in  
         Anderson and Morris 
         , was entirely outside the scope of what could be expected to occur during the course of a minor assault. 
         
        
        
         
         It is clear from the terms of the Chief Justice’s judgment in  
         Varley 
          and the Acting Chief Justice’s judgment in  
         Markby 
          that their Honours were imposing an objective test upon this aspect of accessorial liability. And there is some logic in this. For when determining an accessory’s culpability for manslaughter in a situation where the principal is guilty of murder, one can assume that the act causing death was not within actual contemplation. If it had been, then in most cases the accessory would also be guilty of murder.  
         The issue in relation to manslaughter is whether, notwithstanding that the fatal  
         act 
          was not in fact foreseen or contemplated, it was nevertheless, from an objective point of view, within the scope of the common design. If it was then the accessory will be taken to have encouraged it, and he will be guilty of manslaughter. If it was not, then the principal will have gone so far outside the common purpose that the accessory will bear no criminal responsibility for his actions. 
         
        
       
      
     18     
     It is necessary in every case to decide whether the act done is materially different from the act agreed. If it is, contemplation of the act done is necessary to establish secondary responsibility and the principles relating to extended joint criminal enterprise would have to be engaged. 
      
       
        
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
      
     19     
     The grounds of appeal include the following: That his Honour gave directions as to the elements of manslaughter, including joint enterprise, which were erroneous and misleading. 
      
       
      
     20     
     In our view, the appeal should be allowed on this ground. Our reasons follow. It is unnecessary for us to consider the other grounds of appeal.  
      
       
        
       The case submitted to the jury  
        
       
      
     21     
     From beginning to end, the crown put its case on manslaughter as one of joint criminal enterprise. Conformably, the trial judge summed up on that basis.  
      
       
      
     22     
     The trial judge provided the jury with written directions. This was not done until towards the end of the summing up. The summing up anticipated the written directions, but with some qualification to which we will refer.  
      
       
      
     23     
     In the written directions, which we will now quote in full, we have emphasised passages for later reference:

         MURDER - JOINT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE 
          
         Elements 
         :- 
         
        
        
         
         1. An understanding or arrangement amounting to  
         an agreement  
         came into existence between the particular accused and other persons  
         to assault the particular victim, that is to apply physical force to the victim’s body, 
          and in the assault to inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim, that is really serious bodily injury. 
          
         2. In accordance with the agreement to assault the victim and to inflict grievous bodily harm on him and while the accused continued to be a party to the agreement, a party or parties to the agreement did an act or acts with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm that is to inflict really serious bodily injury, which in fact caused the death of the victim. 
          
         3. The accused participated in some way in the joint criminal enterprise to assault the victim and to inflict really serious bodily injury on him. 
          
           
           It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused participated in any one or more of the following ways:- 
           
          
          
           
           (i) The accused himself did the acts done with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm which in fact caused the death of the victim (“the fatal act or acts”) 
            
           or 
            
           (ii) At the time when the fatal act or acts were done by some other party or parties to the agreement, the accused was present and knowing that that party or those parties to the agreement intended to inflict really serious bodily injury on the victim, intentionally assisted or encouraged that other party or those other parties to inflict really serious bodily injury on the victim 
            
           or 
            
           (iii) In the case of Mr Chai, Mr Chai procured the party or parties to the agreement who did the fatal act or acts, to inflict really serious bodily injury on the victim 
            
           or 
            
           (iv) At some time before the fatal act or acts were done the accused, knowing that other parties to the agreement intended inflicting really serious bodily injury on the victim, had by words or acts assisted or encouraged parties to the agreement, including the party or parties who subsequently did the fatal act or acts, to inflict really serious bodily harm injury on the victim. 
            
           
          
         MURDER - EXTENDED JOINT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE 
          
         Elements:- 
         
        
        
         
         1. An understanding or arrangement amounting to  
         an agreement  
         came into existence between the particular accused and other persons  
         to assault the particular victim. 
          
         2. In the course of the carrying out of the agreement to assault the victim and while the accused continued to be a party to the agreement, a party or parties to the agreement did an act or acts with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, that is to inflict really serious bodily injury, which in fact caused the death of the victim. 
          
         3. Although the inflicting of really serious bodily injury on the victim was not within the agreement, nevertheless the accused contemplated that, in the course of the carrying out of the agreement to assault the victim, a party or parties to the agreement might do an act or acts with intent to inflict really serious bodily injury on the victim, but nevertheless the accused, having that contemplation, continued to be a party to the agreement up to and including the time when the act or acts done, with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm and causing death were done. 
          
         4. The accused participated in some way in the joint criminal enterprise to assault the victim. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused participated in any of the following ways:- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) The accused himself did an act or acts assaulting by way of participating in the assaulting of the victim. 
            
           or 
            
           (ii) At the time when the act or acts done with intent to cause really serious bodily injury and causing the death of the victim (“the fatal act or acts”) were done by some other party or parties to the agreement, the accused was present and knowing that that party or those parties intended to assault the victim and  
           contemplating that that party or those parties might do an act or acts with intent to inflict really serious bodily injury,  
           intentionally assisted or encouraged that party or those parties to assault the victim. 
            
           or 
            
           (iii) In the case of Mr Chai, he procured the party or parties to the agreement who did the fatal act or acts, to assault the victim. 
            
           or 
            
           (iv) At some time before the fatal act or acts were done the accused, knowing that the other parties to the agreement intended assaulting the victim and contemplating that a party or parties to the agreement might do an act or acts with intent to inflict really serious bodily injury on the victim, had by words or acts assisted or encouraged parties to the agreement, including the party or parties who subsequently did the fatal act or acts, to assault the victim. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         If the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of murder-joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise, they should find the accused guilty of murder. If the jury are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of either murder-joint criminal enterprise or murder-extended joint criminal enterprise, they should find the particular accused not guilty of the murder of the particular victim and they should proceed to consider manslaughter.  
         
        
        
         
         MANSLAUGHTER 
          
         Elements 
         
        
        
         
         1. An understanding or arrangement amounting to  
         an agreement  
         came into existence between the particular accused and other persons  
         to assault the particular victim. 
          
         2. In the course of the carrying out of the agreement to assault the victim and while the accused continued to be a party to the agreement,  
         a party or parties to the agreement did an act or acts which were unlawful and dangerous, and which in fact caused the death of the victim. 
          
         3. The accused participated in some way in the joint criminal enterprise to assault the victim. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused participated in any of the following ways:- 
          
          
           
           (i) The accused himself did an act or acts of assaulting by way of participating in the assaulting of the victim 
            
           or 
            
           (ii) At the time when the act or acts which were unlawful and dangerous and which caused death (“the fatal act or acts”) were done by some other party or parties to the agreement, the accused was present and knowing that that party or those parties intended to assault the victim, intentionally assisted or encouraged that party or those parties to assault the victim 
            
           or 
            
           (iii) In the case of Mr Chai, he procured the party or parties to the agreement who did the fatal act or acts, to assault the victim 
            
           or 
            
           (iv) At some time before the fatal act or acts were done, the accused, knowing that other parties to the agreement intended assaulting the victim, had by words or acts assisted or encouraged parties to the agreement, including the party or parties who subsequently did the fatal or acts, to assault the victim. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         If the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of manslaughter, they should find the accused guilty of manslaughter. If the jury are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of manslaughter, they should find the accused not guilty of manslaughter and should proceed to consider maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
         
        
        
         
         MALICIOUSLY INFLICTING GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM 
          
         Elements 
         
        
        
         
         1. An understanding or arrangement amounting to  
         an agreement  
         came into existence between the particular accused and other persons  
         to assault the victim and to cause some injury to the victim. 
          
         2. In the course of the carrying out of the agreement to assault the victim and to cause some injury to him and while the accused continued to be a party to the agreement, a party or parties to the agreement did an act or acts in assaulting the victim with intent to cause some injury to the victim, which in fact caused grievous bodily harm, that is really serious bodily injury, to the victim. 
          
         3. The accused participated in some way in the joint criminal enterprise to assault the victim and to cause him some injury. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that the accused participated in any one of the following ways:- 
          
          
           
           (i) The accused himself did an act or acts of assaulting with the intent to cause some injury, by way of participating in the assaulting of the victim. 
            
           (ii) At the time when the act or acts causing grievous bodily harm were done by some other party or parties to the agreement, the accused was present and knowing that that party or those parties intended to assault the victim and cause him some injury, intentionally assisted or encouraged that party or those parties to assault the victim and to cause him some injury 
            
           or 
            
           (iii) In the case of Mr Chai, he procured the party or parties to the agreement who did the act or acts causing really serious bodily harm, to assault the victim and cause the victim some injury. 
            
           or 
            
           (iv) At some time before the act or acts causing really serious bodily harm were done, the accused, knowing that the other parties to the agreement intended assaulting the victim and causing him some injury, had by words or acts assisted or encouraged other parties to the agreement, including the party or parties who subsequently did the act or acts causing really serious bodily injury, to assault the victim and cause him some injury. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         If the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, they should find the accused guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
         
        
        
         
         If the jury are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, they should find the accused guilty of that charge.” 
         
        
       
      
     24     
     The direction recorded in para 3(i) under the heading, “Murder-joint criminal enterprise” was withdrawn. That was because the crown did not assert that the jury should or could find that the appellant or Mr Bae had done the particular act or acts which caused death in relation to either of the deceased.  
      
       
      
     25     
     It may be noted that, in relation to the second basis for murder, the heading over that section included the words “Extended joint criminal enterprise”. The section also included, as an element in the case to be proved, that the appellant contemplated an act or acts done with intent to inflict really serious injury. The other sections in the written directions - relating to the first basis for murder, and to manslaughter and maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm - did not carry those words in the respective headings, and did not include the element of contemplating an act or acts which had a character different from that agreed upon as the subject of the joint enterprise.  
      
       
      
     26     
     The trial judge’s oral summing up concerning the elements in the crime of manslaughter, as those charges were left to the jury, was as follows (emphasis added): 
      
       
        
         
         “1.  
         The first element is the same as the first element in the extended joint criminal enterprise way of establishing guilt of murder.  
          The first element is that an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement came into existence between the particular accused you are considering and other persons to assault the victim. All that I said earlier about such an understanding or arrangement applies equally here.  
         It is sufficient that the object of the agreement was merely to assault the victim. 
          It is not necessary that the understanding or arrangement should have included the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm. 
         
        
        
         
          
         2. And this is the second element of manslaughter; in the course of carrying out the agreement to assault the victim and while the accused whose case you are considering continued to be a party to the agreement,  
         a party or parties to the agreement did an act or acts which were unlawful and dangerous and which in fact caused the death of the particular victim. 
          The crucial point with manslaughter is that it is not necessary that the act or acts which caused death should have been done with the intent either to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. It is sufficient that the act or acts were unlawful and dangerous. I direct you that an intentional application of force to the body of another person without that person’s consent and in the absence of any lawful excuse is unlawful. In this case there is no evidence of any lawful excuse and you might think it clear that neither victim consented.  
         An act is dangerous if a reasonable person in the position of the person doing the act would have realised that doing the act would expose another person to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
         
        
        
         
         I repeat that an act is dangerous if a reasonable person in the position of the person doing the act would have realised that doing the act would expose another person to an appreciable risk of serious injury. It is not necessary that the person doing the act should himself have realised that doing the act would expose another person to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
         
        
        
         
         In the present case the Crown submits that the acts which caused the head injuries from which the victims died were acts which were dangerous; that is, acts such as a reasonable person in the position of the person doing the acts would have realised would expose the person to which the acts were done to an appreciable risk of serious injury; 
         
        
        
         
         3. And this is the third element of manslaughter; the particular accused participated in some way in the criminal enterprise to assault the victim. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused participated in any one of the following ways which are similar to ways I have described earlier: The first alternative, the accused himself participated in the assaulting of the victim by doing an act or acts of assaulting; or, secondly, at the time when the act or acts causing death were done by some other party or parties to the agreement, the accused was present and, knowing that that other party or those other parties intended to assault the victim, intentionally assisted or encouraged that party or those parties to assault the victim: thirdly, in the case of Mr Chai, that he procured the person or persons who did the fatal act or acts to assault the victim; fourthly, even if the accused whose case you are considering was not present at the time when the act or acts causing death were done nevertheless at some time before those acts causing death were done the accused, knowing that other parties to the agreement intended assaulting the victim, had by words or acts assisted or encouraged other parties to the agreement to assault the victim including the party or parties who subsequently did the fatal act or acts. What I said earlier about the subject’s presence, knowledge, assisting or encouraging and procuring applies equally here as well. 
         
        
       
      
     27     
     A question arises as to what the jury understood or may have understood by this direction, with particular regard to the element of agreement “merely to assault”. Assuming the jury were not persuaded that the appellant joined in the beating, what would the jury have thought would be sufficient to establish an agreement to commit assault for the purposes of the alternative case based upon the appellant’s telephone call to Lee? 
      
       
      
     28     
     It is trite law that the crime of assault does not necessarily include physical force, let alone injury, nor even physical contact, although the crime may, of course, involve force and injury. There was, in fact, no definitive direction to the jury as to what they were to understand by the term “assault” for the purpose of the case, particularly the alternative case now under consideration. Herein lay the seeds of ambiguity as to the scope of the common design in the alternative, procurement scenario.  
      
       
      
     29     
     In relation to the charge of manslaughter, the jury were told in the oral part of the summing up which we have quoted that it was sufficient if the object of the agreement was merely to assault the victim. His Honour also said, however, in that part of the summing up, that what he had said in regard to assault, when dealing with murder by an extended joint criminal enterprise, applied. The written directions in that connection referred simply to an agreement to assault. However, the written directions relating to murder by a straight forward joint criminal enterprise, appearing immediately before, explained assault as meaning “to apply physical force to the victim’s body”. Furthermore, the oral directions, were in terms that the allegedly agreed crime was assault involving physical force to the body of the victim (summing up pp 38 and 45). The distinction between murder by a straight forward joint criminal enterprise and murder by an extended joint criminal enterprise was explained (summing up p 45) as being that, in the former case, there had also to be an agreement to inflict really serious injury whereas, in relation to murder by an extended joint criminal enterprise that was unnecessary. This left the trial judge’s reference back to what was said about murder by an extended joint criminal enterprise as meaning that, for the purpose of the charge of manslaughter, assault included some degree of force to the victim’s body. Injury or risk of injury was immaterial according to these directions. 
      
       
      
     30     
     In connection with the charges of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm, the jury asked a question after the written directions were provided. The question was as follows (Tr 260):  
      
       
        
         
         “Could you please explain in the simplest possible terms the difference of element 1 in manslaughter as opposed to element 1 maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm, in particular the word “assault”, if possible in writing.” 
         
        
       
      
     31     
     The trial judge answered the question as follows so far as is presently relevant: 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, the first element of manslaughter is set out at page 3 of the directions. An understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement came into existence between the particular accused and other persons to assault the particular victim. 
         
        
        
         
         The first element of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm is set out at the foot of page 4 and the top of page 5 of the directions. The first element of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm is the same as the first element of manslaughter except that the words “and to cause some injury to the victim” appear at the end of the first element of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. The reason for the inclusion of the words, “and to cause some injury to the victim” in the first element of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm is that it is an ingredient of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, that the inflicting of the grievous bodily harm was maliciously done and in the present circumstances that would require proof beyond reasonable doubt that an understanding or arrangement came into existence between the accused and other persons to assault the victim and to cause some injury to the victim. 
         
        
        
         
         It is the case that the first element of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm as compared with the first element of manslaughter requires proof of that further matter. That is, the agreement was not just to assault but to cause some injury to the victim.” 
         
        
       
      
     32     
     This direction conveyed to the jury that it was sufficient for the charge of manslaughter that the agreed crime was to assault without causing injury. That was consistent with the earlier directions that to establish an agreement to assault for the purpose of the manslaughter charges, it was sufficient that what was agreed was an assault involving some degree of force to the victim’s body. 
      
       
      
     33     
     Contrary to this reading of the summing up, the crown submits on appeal that the trial judge made it clear to the jury that procurement of a severe beating was an essential feature of the crown case. The crown relies on a passage in the summing up where the trial judge was reviewing the arguments put to the jury by the crown prosecutor and trial counsel in their final addresses. The trial judge said (summing up p 148): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown does not suggest that there was any pre-formed agreement to assault the two victims. The Crown accepts that the two victims turned up outside near the Ehwa uninvited and unwanted. The Crown suggested that it was decided by the accused to give the two men a beating to prevent or discourage them from interfering with the business of the Ehwa.” 
         
        
        
       This passage cannot be construed as a direction by the trial judge that it was an essential part of the crown case that the accused entered into an agreement to give the deceased a beating. The essential elements in the crown case were conveyed to the jury by the written directions and those parts of the oral summing up to which we have referred. Those directions fell short of any such direction. 
        
        
       Discussion 
       
      
     34     
     The directions relating to manslaughter were within the legal framework of joint criminal enterprise. Accordingly, they contained no instruction that it was necessary for the jury to find that the appellant contemplated what might be done beyond what was agreed. 
      
       
      
     35     
     So far as concerns agreement to do a criminal act, the trial judge directed the jury that the agreement asserted against the appellant was an agreement to assault the victims, meaning thereby (he said) the application of physical force to the body. An agreement to move the men away from the bar, if necessary by the application of physical force to the body but without injuring them, would have satisfied this element of the crown case as it was left to the jury. Such a finding as to what was agreed could well have been made by the jury on the basis of the evidence by Mr Lee that he was asked to come without more specific instructions as to what he and his companions were to do when they arrived or if the jury acted on the opening statement by counsel that the appellant asked Mr Lee to come and tell the men to move on but “no fighting”.  
      
       
      
     36     
     What was actually done was the severe and prolonged beating of the two men. That this happened was not seriously in dispute. The appellant’s presence and participation, were, however, in dispute. In these circumstances, the jury might have found that the appellant’s involvement was limited to summoning Mr Lee and his companions and that the appellant took no further part in what happened.  
      
       
      
     37     
     There is a significant difference between moving men on, if necessary by the application of bodily force but without injuring them, and the severe and prolonged beating which occurred. It could not be said that such a beating was a mere incident of what was agreed to be done, if the procurement was limited to the former category. In the context of this trial, reference to “an agreement … to assault” 
       
     in par 1 of the written directions on manslaughter was too general. Absent greater specificity, it embraced a situation where the appellant summoned Lee and his companions with instructions to move “the gangsters” 
       
     away by no more than threat of force as well as a situation where the instructions were to beat the gangsters if necessary. What is critical is that, in a summing up that avoided reference to  
     extended 
      joint criminal enterprise qua manslaughter, the scope of the former situation did not in fact embrace a beating, even as an unexpected incident. Unless Lee and his companions were summoned to administer that type of assault if necessary, the joint enterprise between them and the appellant did not involve the act that turned out to cause the death. 
      
       
      
     38     
     There is, therefore a serious possibility that the jury may have convicted the appellant on a basis which would not amount to criminal responsiblity according to law. That is a miscarriage of justice. Subject to Rule 4, the conviction should be quashed.  
      
       
      
     39     
     Although trial counsel for the appellant did ask for a further direction, he did not ask for the direction that mattered, namely, that, in the circumstances of the case, there had to be either an agreement to do what was done or contemplation that what was done might occur. Rule 4 therefore applies. However, the problem with the summing up is so fundamental that leave should be granted.  
      
       
      
     40     
     The following orders should be made: 
      
       
        
       1. Appeal allowed. 
        
       2. Conviction quashed. 
        
       3. Order a new trial.

      JUDGMENT 
      
       
      
       
      
     1     
     JAMES J 
     : I agree with the judgment of Sperling J. 
      
       
      
     2     
     SPERLING J 
     : On 28 May 1999 the applicant was sentenced by Woods DCJ, having pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) of not less than the commercial quantity, between 1 February 1997 and 30 November 1997, contrary to s 25(2) of the  
     Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 
      1985; and one count of manufacturing a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) of not less than the commercial quantity, contrary to s 24(2) of the  
     Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 
      1985. The maximum penalty for each such offence is 3,500 penalty units or twenty years imprisonment or both.  
      
       
      
     3     
     The applicant was involved in a large illicit drug business of which Leslie Kalache was the principal. As a result of a police operation called Operation Gymea, Mr Kalache and others involved in the business were arrested and charged. All those involved were sentenced by the same District Court judge. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Mr Kalache was initially sentenced, effectively, to ten years imprisonment, consisting of a minimum term of seven and a half years and an additional term of two and a half. On a crown appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, this was increased to an effective sentence of 23 years, consisting of a minimum term of 20 years and an additional term of 3 years. 
      
       
      
     5     
     On each count, Woods DCJ imposed a minimum term of four years imprisonment and an additional term of two years, taking into account an additional 16 offences relating to the illegal supply of body building drugs, the two sentences to be served concurrently. 
      
       
      
     6     
     His Honour found that Mr Kalache was a dominating and charismatic figure who had recruited the applicant at a time when the applicant had not previously been in any kind of trouble with the police. His Honour found that the applicant was particularly susceptible to the influence of such a man because of a sense of alienation to which the applicant was subject, convincingly described by Dr W Walker, psychologist, in a report tendered in evidence and in oral evidence given at the sentencing hearing.  
      
       
      
     7     
     Be that as it may, it is clear that the applicant threw himself into the business with gusto. He was closely involved in the operation. Both the incidence and the extent of his involvement was significant. The quantity and value of raw material and product which he handled was substantial. Documentary records found at his home demonstrated extensive transactions in which the applicant had been engaged, relating to the sale of large quantities of a variety of drugs. He continued with these illicit activities despite Mr Kalache’s arrest. He was a dealer in his own right. 
      
       
      
     8     
     In his favour, Woods DCJ noted that the applicant was a young man. He was born on 6 April 1972. At the time of the offences he was twenty seven years of age. When arrested in December 1997, he pleaded guilty to the principal offences at the earliest opportunity. The sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant was genuinely contrite. He was entitled to consideration for the plea of guilty, not only as evidence of contrition, but also because the public expense of a trial was avoided. He was also entitled to consideration for his prior good behaviour which was established by extensive evidence. His Honour found there were special circumstances warranting an adjustment of the provisional statutory formula governing the relationship between total sentence and minimum term. 
      
       
      
     9     
     In his remarks on sentence, his Honour made observations concerning the other offences taken into account. His Honour found that the applicant had been supplying body building substances to others at a gym which he attended. His Honour said that such drugs were extremely dangerous. He regarded the matters taken into account as having some considerable significance. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The sentence is impugned on four grounds: 
      
       
        
       (1) That the sentence is excessive in itself; 
        
        
       (2) That the sentence is excessive when compared to the sentences imposed on others involved in Operation Gymea; 
        
        
       (3) That the allowance for special circumstances was inadequate; 
        
        
       (4) That undue weight was or may have been given to the other offences taken into account. 
        
        
       Ground 1: That the sentence is excessive in itself 
        
       
      
     11     
     As an independent ground of appeal, this ground is unsustainable. The sentence was, in itself, plainly justified in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion, having regard to the objective features of the offence and notwithstanding the persuasive subjective considerations which his Honour recognised and took into account. As a general principle in relation to sentencing for drug trafficking in not less than the commercial quantity, general deterrence should be reflected in substantial sentences of full time custody:  
     Clark 
      (Unreported) NSWCCA 15 March 1980 at p 3. 
      and  
     Atkins 
      (Unreported) NSWCCA 3 November 1998. 
     . This principle is equally applicable to the manufacture of drugs. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2: That the sentence is excessive when compared to the sentences imposed on others involved in Operation Gymea 
        
       
      
     12     
     The crown submits that the principle of parity does not apply because it is not shown that the applicant and the other persons sentenced are “co-offenders”. It is unnecessary to decide whether the principle of parity applies to offenders convicted of participation in the same enterprise but not necessarily complicit in the same crimes. I am prepared to assume for the purposes of this appeal that the principle does so apply.  
      
       
      
     13     
     The crown cites authority for the proposition that the principle of parity is only relevant when the objective and subjective features associated with both offenders are equal. Reliance is placed on the decision in  
     Gibson 
     . 
      (1991) 56 ACrimR 1, 7. 
      This submission is inconsistent with the more recent decision of the High Court in  
     Postiglione 
      (1997) 189 CLR 295 
     . If sentences for offences committed in the course of the same operation are patently disproportionate relative to each other, there may be as acute and as justifiable a sense of grievance as in a case of different sentences for equal criminal responsibility.

      as authority for the proposition that, all things being equal, it does not follow that a person less exalted in an illicit drug organisation will necessarily receive a correspondingly less severe sentence. Middlemen and underlings are essential. That is not to be doubted. However, in the present class of offence, it is also to be expected that the weight of the sentence will bear a relationship to the role of the individual in the organisation. Where, as here, the offence is being knowingly concerned in the manufacture or supply of a prohibited drug in not less than the commercial quantity, it is to be expected that a person at the head of the organisation will receive a heavier sentence than a person who might have done no more than make the occasional delivery. The burden of the cases to which I have referred is that an underling cannot expect a light sentence for lending support to a large criminal organisation. That is important, but it goes no further than that. 
      
       
      
     15     
     When this application came on for hearing, the appeal against Mr Kalache’s sentence had not been decided. Whilst the present applicant had a strong argument that his sentence was disproportionately heavy relative to Mr Kalache’s initial sentence, there is no longer a basis for that argument. Other sentences relied upon are those imposed on other persons involved in the same illicit enterprise: Messrs Marskell, Losurdo, Bonney, Watkins and Bruce. 
      
       
      
     16     
     Three of the five other cases involve sentences heavier than that imposed on the applicant.  
      
       
      
     17     
     Mr L P Marskell pleaded guilty to two charges. The first was that between January and August 1997 at Booral he knowingly took part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) of not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. The second charge related to an earlier period. It charged that, between December 1995 and May 1996, at Woolombi, he knowingly took part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) of not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. Offences on Form 2 were taken into account. These consisted of supplying a prohibited drug (cocaine), supplying a prohibited drug (cannabis) and possessing an unlicensed firearm (a revolver). 
      
       
      
     18     
     Mr Marskell had learned how to manufacture amphetamines while in prison. He was actively engaged in the manufacturing side of the enterprise as well as the planning and operations of the organisation.  
      
       
      
     19     
     His Honour found that, generally speaking, Mr Marskell took his orders from Mr Kalache, and that Mr Kalache established the financial terms which would operate between them. Mr Kalache’s role in a wider drug enterprise was also more extensive than that of Mr Marskell.  
      
       
      
     20     
     Woods DCJ imposed an effective sentence of seven years and four months, with a minimum term of five and a half years.  
      
       
      
     21     
     The second case relied upon is that of Mr C Losurdo. He was sentenced by Woods DCJ on 2 counts. The first was knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), between December 1996 and December 1997. The second was knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (cocaine) during the same period. Other offences were taken into account, including goods in custody ($2,800 cash), supplying a prohibited drug (cocaine), possession of a prohibited drug (cocaine) and possession of a prohibited weapon (an electronic stun gun). 
      
       
      
     22     
     Mr Losurdo had an extensive criminal history including convictions for manslaughter, receiving and serious drug offences. He had spent something approaching twenty years in custody. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Mr Losurdo was a dealer who purchased his supplies from Mr Kalache. Such purchases included large quantities of methylamphetamine. His Honour described Mr Losurdo’s association with Mr Kalache’s operation as a substantial involvement. He found that Mr Losurdo was involved at a senior level of the enterprise with Mr Kalache and that he played a significant role as a large purchaser and onseller.  
      
       
      
     24     
     Woods DCJ imposed an effective sentence of eight years. He found special circumstances. He fixed a minimum term of five years. 
      
       
      
     25     
     The third case is Mr K Bonney. He pleaded guilty on three counts. The first was that, between May and September 1997, he knowingly took part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity. The second count was that between December 1996 and August 1997 he knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug (ecstasy) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity. The third charge was that, between January and September 1997, he knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity. 
      
       
      
     26     
     His Honour found that Mr Bonney was a helper, a loyal sergeant or corporal, working for a wage of $350 per week in cash. He ran messages. Carried money and parcels which contained drugs. He also ran domestic errands for Mr Kalache and members of his family. He became aware that Mr Kalache was engaged in extensive dealing in drugs. 
      
       
      
     27     
     Mr Bonney had a long criminal history. At the time of sentence he was about fifty years of age. He had spent significant periods of time in custody. There was no previous drug history. In his youth, he committed serious offences involving personal violence but that had petered out in more recent years. 
      
       
      
     28     
     Mr Bonney did not establish his own clientele for the sale of drugs independently of Mr Kalache. He was not an independent vendor. Everything he did was done as an employee of Mr Kalache. He turned up each day at Mr Kalache’s residence and spent his day fetching and carrying money and drugs.  
      
       
      
     29     
     His Honour imposed an effective sentence of five years imprisonment on each count. His Honour found special circumstances. The effective minimum term was two years and nine months.  
      
       
      
     30     
     Mr Watkins was charged with the following offences: knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity; and knowingly taking part in the supply of that drug and of cannabis and ecstasy, all in not less than the respective commercial quantities. 
      
       
      
     31     
     Mr Watkins had a long history of criminal misconduct, mainly property offences but including a conviction for rape. 
      
       
      
     32     
     This offender had been actively engaged in the acquisition of raw materials for the manufacturing process. He was described by Woods DCJ as being at the level of a foot soldier in that regard, although, a necessary one. He was actively engaged in the distribution of the illicit drugs. 
      
       
      
     33     
     Mr Watkins was sentenced effectively to five years imprisonment including a minimum term of three years. 
      
       
      
     34     
     The last case is that of Mr Bruce. He was charged with knowingly taking part in the supply of methylamphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy each in not less than the respective commercial quantities. He had prior convictions. 
      
       
      
     35     
     Mr Bruce was sentenced to five years imprisonment including a minimum term of three years and nine months.  
      
       
      
     36     
     Of these five cases, there has been only one appeal against sentence. That was by Mr Bruce. The appeal failed.  
      
       
      
     37     
     The applicant’s sentence was less than those imposed on Mr Marskell and Mr Losurdo. The applicant says the margin was patently insufficient to reflect the difference between his level of criminality and that of the other two men. 
      
       
      
     38     
     It has to be acknowledged that the sentences imposed on Mr Marskell and Mr Losurdo were lenient, particularly the former. However, when one has regard to the nature and extent of the applicant’s criminal activity, I am not persuaded that the sentences are so patently disproportionate as to warrant interference by this Court on the principles that apply. 
      
       
      
     39     
     As to the three lighter sentences, I see no foundation for the argument that there was anything patently disproportionate about the sentences imposed on the applicant relative to the sentences imposed on Messrs Bonney, Watkins and Bruce. The applicant’s sentence was somewhat heavier and properly so. 
      
       
        
        
       Ground 3: That the allowance for special circumstances was inadequate. 
        
       
      
     40     
     Having found special circumstances, the extent, if at all, that the provisional statutory formula should be adjusted was a matter for the sentencing judge’s discretion. An important consideration was that the additional term could not be increased at the expense of the minimum term to an extent which reduced the minimum term below what the sentencing judge reasonably regarded as necessary to reflect the objective criminality of the offence.  
      
       
      
     41     
     The statutory formula would have resulted in a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of one and a half years. No error is demonstrated in the adjustment which his Honour made.  
      
       
        
       Ground 4: That undue weight was or may have been given to the offences in Form 2. 
        
       
      
     42     
     Counsel for the applicant points out that all of the other matters taken into account would have been dealt with summarily if the applicant had so requested. Each of the offences carried a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment. Be that as it may, there were a large number of them. His Honour was right to say that these additional matters made a significant contribution to the overall criminality for which the applicant was to be punished. I see no reason to conclude that his Honour over emphasised that contribution.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
       
      
     43     
     I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

       REGINA v SHAYNE WALTER MARTIN 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    FITZGERALD JA: The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are set out in the reasons for judgment of Ireland AJ. 
     
      
    2    The only matter which I find it necessary to discuss concerns the evidence of Ms M which was, as the prosecution no doubt intended, highly prejudicial to the appellant. It helped to present him to the jury, correctly if Ms M and the complainant told the truth, as a menace to women. The sentence which he received for the offences of which he was convicted was extraordinarily lenient. 
     
      
    3    Each of the 3 offences with which the appellant was charged involved 2 elements, namely (a) penetration of the complainant’s genitalia (b) without her consent to the appellant doing so. The prosecution accepted that, in the circumstances, it was required to prove not only that the complainant did not consent but that the appellant did not believe that she was consenting. It was sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the appellant did not care whether the complainant consented, or knew that she might not be consenting, to him penetrating her genitalia in the ways which he did. 
     
      
    4    The complainant’s evidence was that, after earlier staring at her and her boyfriend as they lay on her bed, subsequently approaching the complainant at a social function and then an hotel, and later approaching her from behind and hugging her, the appellant entered her bed while she was asleep. She awoke to find the appellant (who she thought was her boyfriend) in the middle of her bed rubbing her upper thigh. Increased sexual activity followed, including acts of penetration with the appellant’s finger, then tongue, then penis. The complainant then became aware that the person engaging in such activity was not her boyfriend and ordered the appellant to leave. When he did not do so immediately, she left and, when he tried to follow her, slammed a door on his hand. 
     
      
    5    It was material to whether there was a rational possibility that the appellant might have believed that the complainant was consenting to him penetrating her genitalia that she appeared to be a willing participant in the sexual activity in which he engaged. Other circumstances which were relevant were the appellant’s knowledge that the complainant had a boyfriend with whom she had earlier had some sexual contact, her earlier rejections of the appellant and the fact that she was asleep when he entered her bed. 
     
      
    6    Ms M’s evidence was that, shortly before the appellant’s alleged sexual offences against the complainant, he made sexual advances towards Ms M and, later, after she was asleep, touched her inside her underwear between her legs in the area of her vagina. Subsequently, he exposed himself to her and, later still, returned to her room once, and perhaps twice, and endeavoured to persuade her to permit him to enter her bed but was rebuffed. 
     
      
    7    The trial judge admitted Ms M’s evidence because of his view that it had “.. substantial probative value on the question of the state of mind of the [appellant] with regard to his belief in [the complainant’s] consent.” The basis for that view was his Honour’s opinion that it was “.. highly probable that the [appellant’s] state of mind when he did the first act [to Ms M] was his state of mind when he did the second act [to the complainant]”. 
     
      
    8    The appellant has not complained about the trial judge’s directions to the jury if Ms M’s evidence was admissible but argued that her evidence should not have been admitted. As I understand the prosecution case, it accepted that Ms M’s evidence was inadmissible unless it was made admissible by either s 97 of s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 Cf R v Player 2000 NSWCCA 123. on the basis that it had “significant probative value” which substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect, as required by s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. Whether or not Ms M’s evidence had significant probative value depended on “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the existence of a fact in issue”. Evidence Act, 1995, s 3, Dictionary, Part 1 Definitions, “probative value”. 
     
      
    9    While I agree with the trial judge’s decision to admit Ms M’s evidence, his Honour’s reasons were too broadly stated. It is appropriate to insist on precision in this area because of the risk which evidence of other offences for which an accused person is not being tried presents to a fair trial. Ms M’s evidence had significant probative value because of the extent to which it could rationally affect a specific issue, namely, whether the appellant cared whether the complainant consented to him penetrating her genitalia. That probative value was sufficient in the circumstances to justify the admission of Ms M’s evidence despite its prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    10    Subject to the foregoing, I agree with the reasons for judgment of Ireland AJ. 
     
      
    11    I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    12    SMART AJ: I agree with Ireland AJ that the appeal should be dismissed. I also agree with his reasons in respect of grounds 1, 2 and 7. I appreciate the force of the observations of Fitzgerald JA. I agree that the evidence of Ms M was admissible. It had significant probative value as it could rationally affect to an appreciable extent the existence of a fact in issue, namely, whether the appellant knew (or perhaps more accurately, did not care) that the complainant was not consenting to intercourse with him. 
     
      
    13    There is one further comment which I wish to make. With Ms M the appellant never reached the stage of digital, oral or penile penetration as he did with the complainant. The similarity of the conduct lay in getting into or onto her bed in a state of undress and touching her in the area of the vagina when she was sleeping or “semi-sleeping”. Ms M stopped the appellant before he went further. With the appellant being naked in Ms M’s bed and having an erect penis it was well open to the jury to conclude that the appellant was well on the way to having intercourse with Ms M and intent on doing so without troubling about whether she consented. That conclusion being open, the evidence in question was admissible.  
     
      
    14    If that evidence had only supported the conclusion of an indecent assault I would probably not have regarded the evidence as admissible. 
     
      
    15    IRELAND AJ: Shane Walter Martin, the appellant, was indicted before his Honour Judge Ducker in the District Court at Lismore on 15 June 1998 on three charges of sexual intercourse without consent of the complainant knowing that she was not consenting in contravention of s 61I of the Crimes Act, 1900. 
     
      
    16    The three offences allegedly occurred in the same confrontation between the appellant and the complainant on 15 May 1997 in a dormitory of a backpacker lodge at Byron Bay. 
     
      
    17    The maximum penalty for an offence under s 61I is imprisonment for fourteen years. 
     
      
    18    The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried by his Honour Judge Ducker and a jury of twelve. The appellant was represented at trial by learned senior counsel of many years experience. He appeared without legal representation on his appeal.  
     
      
    19    On 22 June 1998, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to each count. The appellant was sentenced on the first count to a fixed term of three months imprisonment, on the second count to a fixed term of five months imprisonment and on the third count to a minimum term of six months imprisonment commencing on 22 June 1998 and expiring on 21 December 1998 with an additional term of two years and three months commencing on 22 December 1998 and expiring on 21 March 2001. As part of the sentence, conditions were imposed upon release on parole requiring the appellant to submit to and undergo such psychiatric, psychological and counselling or treatment as required by his parole officer, that upon release he reside with his mother and notify the District Court Registry of any change of address during the period of parole and that he not enter any backpacker’s lodge or other place where male and female persons may be permitted to sleep in the same dormitory. 
     
      
    20    Not surprisingly, no complaint is made by the appellant as to the severity of the concurrent sentences which were imposed or the conditions of parole. 
     
      
    21    The facts relied upon by the Crown as establishing the charges and which the jury, by its verdict, found to be established include the following. 
     
      
    22    The complainant was a backpacker from Canada who booked into the Cape Byron Lodge at Byron Bay on Friday, 9 May 1997. The appellant booked in on the following Tuesday. He occupied the upper double bunk above that occupied by the complainant in dormitory No. 2. The complainant’s boyfriend, a Mr Bedlow, had occupied a bunk in the staff dormitory which was No. 3. On the evening of Wednesday, 14 May, the complainant was lying on her bunk with her boyfriend when the appellant entered the room and, after some brief conversation, climbed onto his bunk saying that he was going to sleep. The appellant later got up and left the room but returned on a number of occasions putting his head around the door and then crouching down to look at the complainant and her boyfriend on the bed. At about 7.30pm, the complainant and her boyfriend got up, the complainant changed her clothes and they attended a social function at the Lodge. 
     
      
    23    At the function, the appellant approached the complainant on a number of occasions. The complainant said that she would walk away when this occurred. The appellant made several comments to the complainant during the evening and later the group moved to the Railway Hotel at Byron Bay. On one occasion, the appellant approached the complainant from behind and gave her a hug. She said that she gave him a look that showed him that she did not want him to be hugging her and she moved slightly away. 
     
      
    24    The complainant and her boyfriend went to a nightclub before returning to the Lodge where they went first to the boyfriend’s room and laid down on his bunk. They later moved to the complainant’s dormitory where she said they started kissing and “fooling around a little bit” but she said she felt awkward because there were other people in the room and so her boyfriend left so she could go to sleep. 
     
      
    25    The complainant changed into her leggings and a tank top, pulled her sleeping bag over her and fell asleep. She awoke to find someone (the appellant) sitting in the middle of her bed rubbing her upper thigh. The complainant said that she believed this to be her boyfriend but she did not look and nothing was said. The appellant then started rubbing her vagina on the outside of her underwear. The appellant then kissed her on the side of her mouth and put his hand inside her pants and put his fingers into her vagina. This is the offence alleged in count 1. 
     
      
    26    The complainant said the appellant then lifted up her tank top and started to kiss her breasts and her stomach. The appellant removed her leggings and underpants and then commenced to kiss the complainant’s vagina. The complainant said that she could feel the appellant’s tongue inside her vagina. This is the conduct alleged in count 2. The complainant said that she was beginning to wake up but was not yet fully awake. The complainant then said that the appellant moved and placed his penis in her vagina. This is the conduct alleged in count 3. 
     
      
    27    The complainant gave evidence that the appellant pushed himself inside her a few times but did not ejaculate. She then placed her hands on his bottom and became aware that the appellant was wearing briefs and not boxer shorts as worn by her boyfriend. She realised then that it was not her boyfriend, opened her eyes for the first time and saw that it was the appellant. The complainant ordered the appellant to get out of her bed and gave him a push. The appellant rolled over next to her. She told him once more to get out of her bed. The complainant gave evidence that she then panicked, grabbed her leggings and put them on as quickly as she could and ran out of the room. The appellant tried to follow her out of the room but she slammed the door on his hand. 
     
      
    28    The complainant went into the staff bedroom and sat on her boyfriend’s bed and started to cry. Some minutes later, Ms Nathasha Cartwright and Sven Berggren came into the room and attempted to speak to the complainant who said that she could not answer as she was still crying and feeling very panicked. She went into the bathroom where the complainant eventually told Ms Cartwright that the appellant had come into her bed and kissed her. Shortly after that, the complainant told Ms Cartwright that the appellant “came into my bed and I thought he was Simon and he kissed me and then he kissed me down further and he kissed the outside of my vagina and then he put himself in me”. The police were called and the complainant stayed in the bathroom until Senior Constable Murphy came to speak to her. 
     
      
    29    In her evidence, Ms Cartwright described events confirmatory of the complainant’s evidence and identified the appellant as being the person involved. 
     
      
    30    Ms Cartwright also gave evidence of seeing the appellant come out of the complainant’s bedroom at about 1.45am that morning wearing only his underpants. She went to the staff room to prepare for bed and it was then that she heard the complainant sobbing. 
     
      
    31    The appellant was confronted by Mr Berggren and at that time was asked by Ms Cartwright whether he knew what he had done was wrong to which he replied, “yeah, yeah” (T 109). The appellant, when asked what had happened, at first refused to answer but finally said to Mr Berggren, “I want to have sex with a girl and she said no and I don’t care I couldn’t be bothered” (T 123). 
     
      
    32    They were joined in the courtyard where this conversation had taken place by Mr Nathan Crosse who also said to the appellant that he was trying to find out what had happened in view of the fact that the complainant was very upset. The appellant responded to his enquiry, “Oh nothing happened man, nothing happened” (T 134). When told by Mr Crosse that the police would have to be called the appellant became angry and looked nervous and extremely uncomfortable. 
     
      
    33    Following his arrest and due warning, the appellant made a number of statements to police and also entered into an ERISP (Exhibit “B”). These statements and the ERISP give conflicting versions of events as to whether or not sexual intercourse had taken place between the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
    34    The appellant permitted a blood sample to be taken. The analyst's report tendered by the Crown established that the appellant’s DNA profile was not detected on any of the swabs taken from the complainant. 
     
      
    35    The appellant relied upon a twenty-six page written submission in which he identifies several grounds of appeal. At the hearing of the appeal he also made oral submissions. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - The evidence of Ms Beilby 
       
      
    36    The appellant contends that the evidence of the forensic scientist, Vivien Beilby, was withheld from the jury in that her statement was tendered and, it is said, “thus preventing the defence from rebutting the allegation that in fact there was no digital or penile penetration between the defendant and the complainant as alleged by the complainant” (sic). 
     
      
    37    The transcript discloses that the statement of Ms Beilby was tendered with the consent of experienced senior counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial. The thrust of Ms Beilby’s evidence was that the forensic samples forwarded to her, which included the blood sample of the appellant and the vaginal swabs from the complainant, disclosed that the DNA profile of the appellant did not match the analysis of the swabs. Accordingly, the evidence was favourable to the appellant. 
     
      
    38    It is clear that there was no further advantage to be gained by cross-examining Ms Beilby who could do no more than express her opinion based upon the material provided to her. 
     
      
    39    The further suggestion is made by the appellant that additional samplings from the appellant’s fingernails and penis may have been able to shed some light on the question of whether or not there was digital and penile penetration by him of the complainant. Such testing was not the subject of evidence at the trial and the possible efficacy of such samplings is, as has been submitted by the Crown, not common knowledge. No such procedures were contemplated by any witness at the trial and, had the matter been raised, it could only have led to impermissible speculation on the part of the jury. 
     
      
    40    The further complaint made under this ground is that the evidence of Senior Constable Murphy and Ms Matilda Alton was also “withheld”. This evidence was also not of a contentious nature but, in any event, the statements were read to the jury by consent. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - Counsel’s alleged incompetence 
       
      
    41    The appellant alleges that his counsel was grossly incompetent in failing to cross-examine the witnesses, Richard Stephen Laszlo and Cathrine Bugge Aaroe, on an important issue. 
     
      
    42    It is clear from a reading of the statement of Mr Laszlo that the passage relied upon by the appellant as indicating a disagreement between the complainant and her boyfriend, Mr Bedlow, is not borne out when the words “I believed” are reintroduced into the sentence. 
     
      
    43    It is plain enough that the evidence of Mr Laszlo was not critical to the Crown case and does no more than explain why he took no active interest in the events which he heard due to his mistaken belief that the conversation he overheard was taking place between the complainant and her boyfriend. 
     
      
    44    Ms Aaroe made a statement and also gave evidence in the trial. She was cross-examined by senior counsel for the appellant. It is not clear how any additional mileage could have been made out of the evidence of Ms Aaroe in favour of the appellant when the contents of her statement are considered. This ground is also not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 - Judge's frequent interjections 
       
      
    45    This ground was not developed in submissions or in oral argument. 
     
      
    46    A reading of the transcript makes plain that, during the giving of evidence, the extent to which his Honour participated was restrained and entirely appropriate. Legal argument in the absence of the jury was conducted in the usual way. There is no warrant for criticism of the conduct of the trial judge in any way whatsoever.  
     
      
    47    This ground is rejected. 
     
      
    48    During the course of the oral submissions on appeal, the appellant raised a further ground alleging that the evidence of the witness, Ms M, was highly prejudicial and should have been excluded from the trial. 
     
      
    49    Ms M gave evidence that she was a tourist from Holland who had arrived in Australia in about April/May 1997 with the intention of backpacking in this country for about a year. She was, at that time, aged 23 years. She checked into the Cape Byron Lodge on Wednesday, 14 May and was allocated a bunk in dormitory No. 6 which was also occupied by some five other girls. 
     
      
    50    On the evening of 14 May, Ms M said that she met and spoke to the appellant for about an hour and a half and that he was one of the group with whom she walked back to the hostel at about 1.00am. During the walk, the appellant tried to hold Ms M's hand and previously had touched her in a manner to which she objected. 
     
      
    51    The appellant made further advances to Ms M upon arriving back at the hostel, however, she again rebuffed him, retired to bed and went to sleep. Some time later, she awoke to an awareness that a male person was in bed with her touching her ""between the legs"". She described this touching as being in the area of her vagina. This male person was naked and had an erect penis. The touching she described was inside her underwear. 
     
      
    52    Ms M said that she got out of her bed and went to the toilet. She recognised the male person as the appellant, who followed her to the toilet. He was still naked and his penis was erect. He followed the witness back to her dormitory and sat on her bed. She told him to, ""Put your clothes on and go away"". He responded, ""I only want to lay in your bed"". The appellant put on some of his clothing and left the room, but returned on one or two occasions when Ms M was still awake. She said ""…he wanted to go - come in bed with me again"". He was wearing ""dark"", ""short"", ""close"" underpants. 
     
      
    53    The appellant was told by the witness to, ""Go on I don't want you here and just leave"". When another resident (who also gave evidence) came into the room, she also told the appellant to leave and when he did so she locked the door. 
     
      
    54    The admissibility of this evidence was considered and ruled upon by the trial judge prior to the commencement of the trial. In his reasons for judgment delivered on 15 June 1998, Judge Ducker said, at pp 1-2:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence which is sought to be adduced here is evidence relating to an earlier incident involving another girl in the hostel in which the accused and the complainant were both at the time staying. The incident in question occurred some approximately fifteen minutes to half an hour before the incidents which have given rise to the present charges, and consisted of the accused, whilst naked, getting into bed with a girl whom he had only met that night, and touching her between the legs. The particular proximity in terms of time and place I believe create a great deal of relevant similarity, and show a relevant tendency. It is highly probable that the accused's state of mind when he did the first act was his state of mind when he did the second act, in my view, based upon the evidence relied upon by the prosecution. 
         
         
        I am, of course, mindful that there will be a sharp issue of fact between the evidence of the complainant, as foreshadowed by the learned Crown Prosecutor and the defence, to be raised by the accused, as foreshadowed by his learned counsel. But it seems to me that this evidence does fall within s 98 of the Evidence Act of 1995. Insofar as the notice given does not comply with the provisions of reg 6(3), pursuant to subs 100(i) and (ii)  
        (sic) 
         of the Evidence Act I hold that the tendency rule and the coincidence rule are not to apply to evidence of the events involving the witness whom I have described, that is the other person who was touched by the accused shortly before. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that those events occurred in what I find to be substantially and relevantly similar circumstances at the same premises within a very short space of time. 
        
       
       
        
        I am of the view that this evidence has substantial probative value on the question of the state of mind of the accused with regard to his belief in consent, an issue in which an onus rests upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not have a belief in consent by the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that this is highly probative evidence on that important issue, which seems likely to be the most, if not the most, then certainly one of the two, principal issues in the case. The other of course being whether in fact the girl did consent.” 
        
       
      
    55    His Honour went on to find that there was no relevant prejudice to the accused, expressing his view that:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Looking at the situation realistically, it does, because of the proximity of place and time between the events in question seem to be able to be properly regarded as part and parcel of the same course of conduct on the part of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    56    His Honour concluded by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Pursuant to subs (101)(ii)  
        (sic) 
         I find that the aforesaid tendency evidence and coincidence evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that it may have upon the accused.” 
        
       
      
    57    Section 97 of the Evidence Act, 1995 relevantly provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        97 The tendency rule 
        
       
       
        
         
         (1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or  
            
            
           (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (2) ... 
         
        
       
      
    58    Section 98 relevantly provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        98 The coincidence rule 
        
       
       
        
         
         (1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 
            
            
           (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (3) ... 
         
        
       
      
    59    The tendency and coincidence provisions of the Evidence Act are intended to cover the field previously occupied by the common law relating to propensity and similar fact evidence. However, it is permissible to turn for guidance to the pre-existing case law when applying the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act: see Zaknic Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 171. 
     
      
    60    Effectively, s 97 (""the tendency rule"") and s 98 (""the coincidence rule"") followed the common law approach in that each section has a general exclusion of evidence of the kind mentioned but permits such evidence to be adduced if the specified conditions are fulfilled. There is necessarily an overlapping between the evidence covered by the two rules. 
     
      
    61    The tendency rule applies to evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, in order to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of his or her character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind. 
     
      
    62    The coincidence rule, however, applies to evidence that two or more related events occurred in order to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. Subsection (2) of s 98 requires that events are related events only if they are substantially and relevantly similar and the circumstances in which they occur are substantially similar: see Perry v The Queen (1982) 150 CLR 580. 
     
      
    63    Under both rules, reasonable notice must be given of the intention to adduce such evidence. In the present case, notice was given and no point was taken by learned senior counsel for the appellant at the trial that the notice given was inadequate. 
     
      
    64    What may be said to be the acid test for the admission of evidence under each of the rules is that the Court must be satisfied that the proposed evidence would, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value (s 97(1)(b); s 98(1)(b)). 
     
      
    65    In Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461, the High Court, at pp 482-483, said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Because propensity evidence is a special class of circumstantial evidence, its probative force is to be gauged in the light of its character as such. But because it has a prejudicial capacity of a high order, the trial judge must apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused ... Here ‘rational’ must be taken to mean ‘reasonable’ … and the trial judge must ask himself or herself the question in the context of the prosecution case; that is to say, he or she must regard the evidence as a step in the proof of that case. Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. And, unless the tension between probative force and prejudicial effect is governed by such a principle, striking the balance will continue to resemble the exercise of a discretion rather than the application of a principle.”

      Hoch v The Queen 
        
      (1988) 165 CLR 292. 
       
      
    66    Probative value of evidence is defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act as meaning, “… the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”. 
     
      
    67    In R v Lockyer (1996) 89 ACrimR 457 at 459, it was held that “'significant' probative value must mean something more than mere relevance but something less than a 'substantial' degree of relevance”. The use of the word ""significant"" in the sections mandates that the evidence must be of importance or of consequence.  
     
      
    68    Learned counsel for the Crown submitted that the evidence in question had added relevance in that it could be relied upon to meet the contention of the appellant in his video taped record of interview that he did not intend that night to have sexual intercourse with anyone, in particular the complainant, but merely sought some company. Hence the evidence of Ms M went directly to his state of mind in adopting, within a very short space of time, the identical modus operandi of getting into bed with a sleeping young woman, who had earlier rebuffed his advances, intent upon sexual gratification to the extent experienced by the complainant, albeit in her state of mistaken belief as to his identity, his state of mind being at least recklessly indifferent as to whether she was consenting, these considerations having precise application to both the complainant and the witness Ms M. I accept the force of this submission. 
     
      
    69    The trial judge in his reasons for judgment makes it sufficiently plain that he took into account the relevant principles of law and applied the appropriate tests. His decision to admit the evidence of the witness, Ms M, was correct. 
     
      
    70    This ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
    71    I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JMonday, 28 August 200070017/98 - REGINA v Rafal POLANSKINOMINATION OF LIMITING TERM1   HIS HONOUR: The offender, Rafal Polanski, was charged that on 18 October 1997 at Ashfield he murdered Jozef Zimmer. He was found unfit to be tried and the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that he would not within twelve months become fit to be tried. Accordingly the Attorney General directed that there be a special hearing into the matter. At the special hearing the jury returned a verdict that on the limited evidence available the offender committed murder. If the hearing had been a normal trial resulting in a verdict of guilty of murder I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment. I am therefore required to nominate a limiting term which is my best estimate of the sentence I would have considered appropriate. 
     
      
    2   The offender is Polish by birth. He is now twenty-five years old and was twenty-two years old when he killed the deceased, Jozef Zimmer. He has been addicted to alcohol for a number of years now. He is a single man. Polish is his first language and he is inclined to seek out the company of Polish speaking people. 
     
      
    3   In October 1997 he was living in Cabramatta and on the night of the deceased’s death he found himself at Ashfield. He had far too much to drink during the day and the evening and eventually found himself at the Polish Club in that suburb. His behaviour drew him to the attention of the management of the club. He was not a member of the club and was required to sign the register as a visitor. When he was asked to do he refused, and I think that that was because of the effect of alcohol upon him. He was eventually required to leave the premises. He was also ejected from a nearby restaurant. His response was to go to a discotheque in another part of the club, and eventually he was thrown out of that part of the premises as well. By that time it was so late that he had missed the last train to Cabramatta and he had spent most of his money on alcohol and could not afford a taxi. He began to think about where he might spend the night. 
     
      
    4   The deceased was employed as a barman at the club and noticed the offender during the evening. The deceased was homosexual and had a room at the next-door premises, which was known as the Polish House. He was in the habit of inviting young men back to his room and there having sexual relations with them. He invited the offender back to his room and offered him a bed for the night, intending, I think, to propose sexual relations with him. The offender accepted but was not homosexual and was not sexually attracted towards the deceased. He accepted the offer of a bed at face value. 
     
      
    5   It becomes necessary now to say something about the offender’s history. He lived in Poland until he was nineteen years old, and then came to Australia, where he has remained. His early years were unhappy because of the cruelty of his father, who married his mother only because he had raped her and made her pregnant. The offender was the resulting child and was always known among his peers as a bastard. At that time and place to be a bastard was to be the subject of contempt, and the offender’s peers taunted him. He completed elementary school, having learned to read and write in Polish, and commenced but failed to complete a carpentry course. He began to do casual labouring jobs such as fruit picking. He came to Australia with his parents but his father remained and his mother returned to Poland. He has no time for his father and their relations are poor. He has much more regard for his mother. 
     
      
    6   When he was eighteen he presented himself to a psychiatric hospital in Poland. He knew that his problems were related to his overindulgence in alcohol but might have suspected that something else was wrong as well. As it was, no psychosis was diagnosed. For reasons which I shall explain, I think that he was then in the stage of developing a chronic psychotic illness. 
     
      
    7   In Australia he continued to do unskilled jobs, spending some time fruit picking and then a substantial period house painting. He had a number of jobs for a number of people in that occupation. That is what he was doing at the time of these events. His workmates did not see him as a normal person and he did not act and mix normally. Some of them noticed him doing or saying things which seemed strange to them. 
     
      
    8   He had a settled conviction from an early age that his sexual parts were small. He had had no sexual relations with women and on one occasion asked a workmate how one went about sexual intercourse with a woman. He was later diagnosed as being psycho-sexually repressed. 
     
      
    9   When they arrived in the deceased’s room the deceased invited the offender to sit on the bed, and he did so. The deceased put on a pornographic video which featured two men and a woman. The deceased sat next to the offender and started kissing and touching him. He said that he had lost money on the horses and wanted to relieve himself for fifty dollars. He proposed that for that sum of money he might suck the offender’s penis. 
     
      
    10   The offender did not know what to do. He found the unexpected advance revolting. He left the room and went to the bathroom, hoping that the deceased might stop behaving in that manner. He returned to the room but again the deceased sat next to him and began to resume his sexual advances. The offender told him to wait and left the room a second time. The room was on the first floor of the house, not far from the staircase by which one could leave the premises. The offender went to the bathroom a second time, the while intending to leave the premises. Then he saw a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall and got the idea of teaching the deceased a lesson or playing a trick on him. He believed that the fire extinguisher would squirt foam and intended to direct it at the deceased. He took it back to the deceased’s room. The deceased was bending down towards the wardrobe and the offender pointed the extinguisher at him and turned it on. To his surprise water, not foam, came out and wet the deceased. He swore at the offender and asked what was going on. At these unexpected events the offender became afraid. He did not know what to do. He simply wanted the deceased to leave him alone and let him sleep. He became petrified. He raised the fire extinguisher and hit the deceased on the head a number of times, causing very serious bony damage and injury to the brain. The pattern of blood that splashed onto the wall or objects at those blows shows that the deceased’s head was at or close to floor level when the blows were delivered. The offender took a long-bladed knife and stabbed the deceased in the back with it, causing a wound several centimetres deep. However, I am satisfied that the deceased was already dead by the time that blow was delivered. The offender told the police that the delivery of the knife wound was accidental, the knife having glanced off the wardrobe, but I do not believe that account. 
     
      
    11   The very serious nature of the attack with the fire extinguisher, with repeated blows to the head, followed by the blow with the knife which might well have killed if the deceased had not already been dead satisfies me that the offender intended to kill the deceased. 
     
      
    12   Some indication of the anger of the offender is given by the fact that after he killed the deceased he set about throwing objects all over the room, emptying drawers, tearing posters off the walls, smashing light fittings, smashing video cassettes, so that the bedroom was scarcely recognisable as such. In addition, the offender took a bag that he found there and filled it with things, notably the video cassette recorder which had been playing the pornographic video, a compact disc player, coin collections of some value and other items of value. Having done so he left the premises, got a taxi and went home. He borrowed from a flatmate money to pay the taxi driver and concealed the bag of booty under his house. That is where the bag and its contents still were when the police spoke to him three weeks later. I think that he acted as he did in order to punish the deceased not to obtain for himself the use of his possessions. 
     
      
    13   The issues at the special hearing were whether the offender acted in self-defence, whether he intended at least to do really serious injury, whether he acted under provocation and whether his mental responsibility for his act was mitigated by his abnormality of mind. The only substantial issue, however, was the last-mentioned one of diminished responsibility. 
     
      
    14   The Crown was able to disprove provocation because the deceased’s conduct could not have induced an ordinary person in his position so to have lost control as to have formed the relevant intent. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that the grossly offensive advances of the deceased constituted a serious provocation of the offender, affected as he was by his underlying psychotic illness, by his psycho-sexual repression and by the alcohol he had had to drink. 
     
      
    15   There was a lively issue at the hearing about the precise state of the offender’s mental illness. Three psychiatrists gave evidence, Dr Strum and Dr Thompson for the Crown and Dr Canaris for the defence. All agreed that the offender was suffering at the time from an illness which constituted an abnormality of mind. 
     
      
    16   Dr Canaris was always of the view that the offender was suffering from psychosis, probably low-grade schizophrenia. Although he lacked the more florid symptoms of that condition such as delusions, hallucinations and ideas of reference, he suffered from thought disorder and a number of other symptoms. 
     
      
    17   Dr Thompson knew the offender better than any other psychiatrist, having seen him a number of times in prison and having treated him. She initially doubted whether he was psychotic but eventually, having seen the opinion of Dr Canaris, came to the view that he was psychotic and began treating him with anti-psychotic drugs. She expressed the view, however, that his psychosis would not have produced in him a reaction so strong as one involving an intent to kill unless he had also been affected by alcohol. 
     
      
    18   Dr Strum took the view that the offender was not psychotic but was suffering from a personality disorder. He agreed with Dr Thompson that but for the effects upon him of the alcohol he had consumed the offender would not have reacted as he did. 
     
      
    19   I think that the offender was suffering from a low-grade psychosis and in that respect I accept the evidence of Drs Canaris and Thompson. However, I do not think that the abnormality of mind from which he was suffering at the time would have produced such a gross reaction unless he had been affected by alcohol. That is consistent with the jury’s failure to be satisfied that the offender had established the defence of diminished responsibility. 
     
      
    20   I think that I should nominate a limiting term upon the basis that although the offender’s intention was to kill, he did not go to the deceased’s room with that intention but only to obtain accommodation for the night. His intent to kill arose suddenly in the face of the gross provocative conduct of the deceased. The offence would not have happened if the offender had not been badly affected by alcohol. I do not regard alcohol in those circumstances as mitigating his criminality. 
     
      
    21   I think that the fact that the offender was suffering from low-grade schizophrenia, however, predisposing him to the unexpected effects of alcohol in the face of provocation, makes him a less suitable subject than most for a heavily deterrent sentence. 
     
      
    22   The question of dangerousness arises. It might be thought that if the mental condition of the offender continues as it is and if he continues to resort to large amounts of alcohol, then a repeat of the provocation might produce a repeat of the result. That is certainly possible, though I think unlikely in view of the treatment and assistance the offender is likely to receive. I propose to order that he be kept in a hospital and I expect that he will continue to be treated as he has during his period of incarceration awaiting the special hearing, by a psychiatrist using appropriate drugs. 
     
      
    23   Because of the restricted conditions in which he has been kept the offender has been denied the ordinary range of counselling, drug and alcohol courses and the like, but there seems to be no reason why his addiction to alcohol may not also now be treated and I see no reason why he cannot receive whatever assistance is available to help him overcome it. 
     
      
    24   In the result, I think it probable that the combination of circumstances which led to his loss of control are unlikely to arise again, and I do not think that he can properly be characterised as dangerous so as to deny him the benefits in the nomination of a limiting term to which he would otherwise be entitled. 
     
      
    25   The offender has progressed well under treatment and is well regarded by those who have had the care of him. He has been given and has accepted responsibility and has worked well. Every indication is that that state of affairs will continue. 
     
      
    26   The offender was arrested on 14 November 1997 and has been held in custody on this matter alone ever since. It is therefore appropriate to commence the limiting term that I shall impose from that day. 
     
      
    27   Rafal Polanski, I nominate a limiting term of thirteen years, commencing on 14 November 1997 and expiring on 13 November 2010. I refer you to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and I direct that you be detained in a hospital.

      SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Barrie Alan Hodge, stands for sentence today having been found guilty by the jury of the murder of Leo Leslie Press at Harbord on 13 February 1988.  
    2    The prisoner who was then aged 18 years, attended a party at Chatswood on the evening of Friday 12 February. Whilst there he drank some beer and inhaled one line of what he believed to be speed or amphetamines. After getting a lift with a friend to the Manly area where he dropped off his then girlfriend, Karen Rudall, at her home, he was intending to hitch a ride to where he was living at Beacon Hill. It appears that the deceased stopped in his car and offered the prisoner a lift which the latter accepted, and then invited him to go to his house at Harbord for a few more drinks.  
    3    The deceased was discovered in the hallway near the front door of his home at about 4 am the following morning by his brother when the latter returned home after his work at the bakery which they jointly owned. He died at about 9 o'clock that morning, as a result of multiple head injuries predominantly to the rear right hand side of the skull consistently with having been struck by a stonemason's mallet, found approximately four to five inches from where he was lying.  
    4    In the mean time, the prisoner returned to his girlfriend's house at Manly. He was shaking and crying, and had blood on his clothes. He told her that he thought that he had killed someone. He then got a taxi back to his home at Beacon Hill, changed his clothes and went to the home of another friend of his, Peter Somers, at whose house the party had been the previous evening. He told him that when hitchhiking home from his girlfriend's place he met a person who asked him back for a few beers, he went to sleep, and later the person came up behind him and grabbed him in a sexual sort of way, as a result of which he had hit him and he thought he had killed him. A few weeks later, at a party in Manly, another friend, David Watts, saw the prisoner distressed and crying and when pressed, the prisoner told him that he had gone to this person's place to have a couple of beers, that he was tired, he crashed out and whilst sleeping he felt someone fondling him and he had hit him. He was not sure whether he had hurt him badly or not, but he had left him. 
    5    Although the discovery of the deceased dead in his home received publicity in the media, none of these friends of the prisoner informed the police of what he had told them. 
    6    When police went to the premises they found blood stains upstairs in the deceased's bedroom and a massive amount of blood near the deceased's body in the hallway on the lower floor near the front door. They also saw the stonemason's mallet near the deceased and evidence from the brother of the deceased established that this hammer belonged to the deceased and was normally kept in his toolbox.  
    7    His death was attributed to multiple head injuries, predominantly to the rear right hand side of the skull consistently with having been struck by the mallet which was found near the body, and the pathology evidence established that there had been between ten and twelve blows to the head with the mallet, resulting in two or three fractures of the skull, indicating a frenzied attack.  
    8    Police enquires established that although the deceased maintained an air of respectability, he was an active homosexual who was in the habit of going out driving between 11 pm and midnight, picking up young male hitchhikers to whom he made propositions of a sexual nature, returning a few hours later, and also bringing young men to the house at those times. 
    9    The only evidence tending to identify the deceased's assailant were finger prints on two of four mostly empty beer cans located on a table in the upstairs office of the deceased's premises. The police were unable to match those fingerprints with those of any person on their records, and so the investigation was closed; but following the Police Royal Commission it was reopened in about 1998, by which time the prisoner, who at the time of the killing had no adult convictions, had been convicted for a number of minor offences, including being carried in a stolen conveyance and driving with more than the prescribed content of alcohol, as a result of which his fingerprints were on record and they matched those on the beer cans. Further inquiries were made and ultimately the prisoner was arrested on 9 October 1998, interviewed and charged with murder. 
    10    At the trial, the prisoner who pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter, relied on the partial defence of provocation and claimed that he was provoked into doing what he did by a homosexual approach to him by the deceased.  
    11    He gave evidence and said that after dropping Miss Rudall at or near her house he endeavoured to hitch a ride back to his home in Beacon Hill, that a car stopped and the driver gave him a lift and then offered him a few more beers at his home, an offer which he accepted. He said that he cannot remember arriving at the deceased's house or getting out of the car, but remembers sitting in a soft chair. He said that he had some more beer and smoked some cigarettes, he was quite drunk, got tired and ""crashed out"" on a bed in the deceased's premises.  
    12    When he woke up he became aware that the deceased was touching him in the genital area in a sexual manner, he lashed out and got up, the next thing he remembers is being downstairs near the front door where the deceased again approached him, he saw the mallet, picked it up and hit the deceased twice. The next thing he remembers is being outside the premises disposing of the keys, hailing a taxi and going to his girlfriend's place where he told her he thought he had killed somebody. He denied any recollection of hitting the deceased ten to twelve times and denied that he hit him in a violent manner upstairs, although blood stains on the stairway indicated otherwise.  
    13    Having regard to the questions asked by the jury during their deliberations and making my own independent assessment of the evidence consistently with the findings of the jury, I am satisfied that the prisoner did form the intention to at least cause the deceased grievous bodily harm, and that he did so when he lost his self control as a result of provocation by the deceased in the form of an unwanted sexual advance, and at a time when he was affected to a degree by alcohol and possibly by drugs, but that the approach by the deceased was not such as would have caused an ordinary person of the prisoner's sex, age and maturity, unaffected by alcohol or drugs, to have so lost his self control to that degree.  
    14    The case is a tragic one, not only for the deceased who, whatever his shortcomings did not deserve to die in the manner in which he did, but it is also a tragedy for the prisoner and for his family. Whilst I appreciate the well known trait of the Australian character not to ""dob"" on another person, I am shocked and amazed that none of the persons to whom the accused confided that he believed he had killed someone reported such matters to the police. Loyalty to one's friends and a dislike of dobbers can be carried too far, as it was in this case which concerned a murder investigation. The result is that many years after the events the prisoner now stands to be sentenced for this tragic incident. 
    15    He was born on 19 September 1969 and at the time of the offence he was 18 years old. He is now almost 31. He grew up and was educated in Sydney and after leaving school has been in generally regular employment. At the time of his trial he and his wife were running a carpet cleaning business and a golf buggy repair business. He has been in a relationship with his wife for 7 years and they were married a year ago. They have a son aged 2 years, with another child expected in March next year. 
    16    He was at the time of the deceased's death a person of good character with no adult convictions and, except for the minor offences to which I have referred which are not relevant for the purposes of this case except in so far as they were the cause of him being identified as the killer, he is apart from this matter still a person of good character, and has been a worthwhile member of the community. In this regard I accept the bundle of character testimonials which have been tendered and which I have read. All the referees speak of his gentle non aggressive nature, honesty, trustworthiness and devotion to his wife and child.  
    17    Although the jury rejected the defence of provocation apparently for the reason I have indicated and with which conclusion I agree, I am satisfied that this offence was completely out of character and would not have been committed if the prisoner had not been affected by alcohol and/or drugs and if the deceased had not made the approach to him which I am satisfied he did make. Indeed the evidence of the drugs taken by the prisoner at the party he attended on the Friday evening is somewhat vague and it may be that he does not really know what such drugs contained. Although there is no evidence of it, there is also the possibility that the beers he consumed at the deceased's house contained some foreign substances. The killing was totally unpremeditated and unplanned. When he set out to hitch hike his way home after dropping off Miss Rudall, the prisoner had no intention of killing or hurting anyone, least of all the deceased, a person he had never met.  
    18    Whilst murder, which involves the killing of another human being with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, is always a most serious offence and involves a high degree of criminality, these circumstances place this offence in the lower range of criminality for this particular crime. 
    19    Mr Ierace SC for the prisoner quite properly tendered a memorandum which I ordered to be kept confidential (Ex. 4). I have read it but it is totally irrelevant for sentencing purposes. I have also read the Victim Impact Statement of Miss Bernadette Press who shows herself to be a person of remarkable compassion and forgiveness, and I have taken her attitude into account. She also records that the prisoner has apologised to her for her uncle's death. I am satisfied of his contrition and remorse. 
    20    The prisoner was initially arrested and charged on 9 October 1998 and subsequently discharged at committal proceedings on 16 December 1998. After further investigations by police, he was re-arrested and re-charged on 22 January 1999 and committed for trial on 30 August 1999. Although this cannot be described as, or compared to, double jeopardy, it is a factor entitling the prisoner to some additional consideration. He was on bail at all times before and during the trial and went into custody on the date of the jury's verdict, 11 July 2000. 
    21    By pleading guilty to manslaughter he admitted liability for the killing and at the trial he did not dispute any of the substance of the Crown case, relying only on the defence of provocation, thereby considerably shortening the trial. 
    22    I have been referred by Mr Ierace SC to the sentences imposed in an number of other murder cases said to be at the lower end of the range; some of them have been of limited assistance, but each case is different and some of those cases involved much younger persons or persons with much more deprived backgrounds than this prisoner. I have also had regard to the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission, but they also are of only limited value in a case such as the present. 
    23    Sentencing in this case is complicated by a number of considerations, particularly the circumstances of the offence (which I have already observed place it in the lower range of criminality for cases of murder), the comparative youth of the prisoner at the time, and the staleness of the offence. 
    24    It is well established that in the case of young offenders general deterrence is of less, and rehabilitation of more, importance, but the cases refer specifically to juveniles (under 18) being dealt with as adults, rather than to persons aged 18 and over; in respect of whom the principle, though still relevant, is of less significance. 
    25    Delay in sentencing has been considered in a number of cases, the leading one of which is R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, where Street CJ referred to the necessity in such cases for flexibility and fairness to the prisoner which may often result in what might otherwise be considered an undue degree of leniency. However, most of the cases dealing with the topic have concerned delays due to the court process or due to the prisoners being extradited from another state after serving sentences in that state for other offences, and not to cases where the delay has been due to police being unable to identify a suspect. See also Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64-6. 
    26    The extent to which, if at all, the principle is to be applied in a particular case, depends on the circumstances of such case, see for example R v V (1998) 99 A Crim R 297 (sexual assault on a young child), R v King (CCA - 24 February 1998) (delay due to a successful appeal and retrial in a murder case), R v Carter [1999] NSWCCA 376 (delay substantially due to the applicant), R v Thomson (CCA - 18 June 1996) (sexual assault). 
    27    R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121 was a case of a delay of over 4 years in the arrest in a drug importation case. Wood CJ at CL at [16] said: -  
     
      
       
       ""The reason why delay is to be taken into account in sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, that sentencing for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach."" 
       
      
      
    28    In the present case the prisoner must have been very apprehensive in the period immediately following the killing, but as time went by without him being charged and in circumstances where he had no reason to believe he could become a suspect unless one of his friends told the police of his admission to them, it would seem the matter preyed less and less on his mind and he was able to get on with his life, maintain employment, marry and have a family. Rehabilitation is hardly an issue in this case as, apart from this offence committed in the peculiar circumstances I have described, he was before, and remains otherwise, a person of good character; so that the first two considerations referred to by Wood CJ at CL have little application. 
    29    What is relevant however it seems to me is that he was a young man when the offence was committed and since then has built a life for himself which must now be disrupted many years later whilst he serves his sentence, and because of his age, background and the life style which he has achieved, largely through his own efforts, he will find conditions in gaol more onerous and difficult to accommodate than would the majority of other prisoners. In addition, this is a case where it is almost impossible to conceive of him committing a similar type of offence in the future, so that personal deterrence is not a significant consideration. 
    30    These factors I am satisfied constitute ""special circumstances"" and whilst the elements of retribution and general deterrence call for a comparatively lengthy head sentence, the matters to which I have referred justify a reduced non parole period.  
     
      
      
      
      
    31    Barrie Allan Hodge for the murder of Leo Leslie Press, I sentence you to imprisonment for 15 years and fix a non parole period of 7 years. The sentence will be deemed to have commenced on 11 July 2000 and the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 10 July 2007. 
    32    Exhibits may be returned.

Section 19 does not require a report to encompass use which is capable of being made of information obtained using a listening device. Section 22 does not require the destruction of all information except that concerning the offence for which the warrant authorising use of the listening device was originally obtained.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
       
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: On 18 November 1994 there was an armed robbery of the character of a home invasion at premises at 1 Carol Crescent, Roselands in Sydney. A series of such home invasions were under investigation by a special police task force. Another police task force, under the code name “Acacia”, was investigating the murder of a man, Andre Rahme. 
     
      
    2    The Respondents Tony Haddad and Johnny Treglia were charged with the armed robbery offence. They were also suspects in the murder of Rahme. Police investigating the murder became aware that Haddad and Treglia were remanded to appear at Bankstown Local Court on 14 December 1994 with respect to the armed robbery offence. Those police sought a warrant to install a listening device into a cell at Bankstown Police Station, in order to record conversation between the two suspects. This occurred. 
     
      
    3    Subsequently Haddad and Treglia were tried for the offence of armed robbery. Identification evidence was adduced in the trial. The defence was alibi. In a judge alone trial they were acquitted. 
     
      
    4    Subsequently, in circumstances which I will hereinafter set out more fully, the police associated with the armed robbery investigation became aware that there may have been material in the tape recorded conversations which was relevant to the armed robbery charges. Nothing relevant to the murder investigation had been said. In the present proceedings it was common ground that the tape recordings of the conversations recorded admissions on the part of each of the present Respondents with respect to their involvement in the armed robbery. The Crown presented an indictment asserting perjury against each of the Respondents with respect to the alibi evidence that they had given at their earlier trial. 
     
      
    5    The indictment came before his Honour Judge Luland in the District Court on 25 October 1999. Counsel appearing for each of Haddad and Treglia indicated that they would object to the admissibility of the recorded conversations on the basis of illegality. Luland DCJ conducted a voir dire examination on this issue. His Honour held, pursuant to the discretion conferred upon him by s138 of the Evidence Act 1995, that the evidence should be rejected. The Crown has appealed to this Court pursuant to s5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the basis that his Honour’s decision constituted an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of that section. 
     
      
    6    It was common ground before Luland DCJ that, in the absence of the evidence of the taped conversations, the Crown had no case with respect to the charges before his Honour. No attempt was made by either side to tender any aspect of the Crown brief on the voir dire. His Honour, accordingly, made a finding in his reasons for judgment on the admissibility of the evidence to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case against each accused in the present proceedings depends upon the evidence resulting from a conversation between the two accused and, at some stage, their barrister Mr John Punch, which occurred in the Bankstown Police Station cells on 14 December 1994 and was recorded pursuant by what the Crown argues was a lawfully organised listening device.” 
        
       
      
    7    In this Court, counsel for the Respondents sought to resile from the concession they had made before his Honour and, necessarily, sought to impugn his Honour’s finding of fact as set out in the above passage. In order to do so counsel sought leave to adduce evidence on the appeal, namely statements of the two women who were subjected to the home invasion and who had given evidence of identification at the trial in accordance with their statements. This was for the purpose of submitting that the Crown had available to it evidence on the substantive proceedings which, if believed, could lead the Court to make a finding on the perjury charges. 
     
      
    8    On this basis the Respondent submitted that what the Court had before it was a mere ruling on evidence which, on the authorities, would not constitute an “interlocutory judgment or order” within the meaning of s5F(2). (See R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633). 
     
      
    9    The Crown relied on R v Bozatsis & Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 in which the Court held that a ruling on evidence which had the effect of refusing to permit the Crown to make a case was a judgment or order within s5F. This authority has been applied most relevantly in this Court in R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364 and referred to in R v Cheng [1999] NSWCCA 373. 
     
      
    10    Luland DCJ delivered his judgment in this matter on 27 October 1999. He did so immediately after empanelling a jury. The Crown indicated an intention to appeal to this Court under s5F(2) from his Honour’s decision to exclude the evidence and sought a discharge of the jury to enable that to be done. Before his Honour the Crown referred to the decision in Bozatsis & Spanakakis to indicate the basis of the s5F appeal. The application for discharge of the jury was contested by the Respondents and additional material was tendered before his Honour with respect to this application. On 28 October 1999 his Honour did discharge the jury and in the course of giving reasons for that decision said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was argued on behalf of the accused that I should refuse the application and proceed with the trial. The effect of doing that would be to inevitably lead to a verdict by direction because it is conceded by the Crown that without the evidence I have ruled to be inadmissible, they have no case against either accused.”  
        
       
       
      After referring to  
      Bozatsis & Spanakakis 
       his Honour said: 
       
       
        
        “… it seems to me that the effect and character of my decision, has been to withdraw the only evidence upon which the Crown can rely in this case.” 
        
       
      
    11    In these remarks his Honour was reflecting the concession made before him on the previous application with respect to the admission of evidence, even though on the application to discharge the jury submissions had been made to him to the effect that the other evidence to which I have referred above was available to the Crown, even on the perjury charges.  
     
      
    12    In Bozatsis & Spanakakis Gleeson CJ said at 303-304: 
     
      
       
        
        “Bellear DCJ, in a passage quoted above, dealt with para 2 of the Notice of Motion by saying he was making an order excluding ‘all prosecution evidence’ against the respondents. What is important is not his Honour’s use of the word ‘order’, but the character and effect of the decision he was making. He was not merely deciding that some particular piece of evidence was admissible or inadmissible. He was making a discretionary decision not to receive any evidence tending to prove the guilt of the respondents of the offences charged. He was, in substance, refusing to permit the Crown to seek to make a case against the appellants. Such a decision is properly characterised as a judgment or order.” 
        
       
      
    13    As I indicated in Cheng supra at [14]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[Gleeson CJ] focused on the substance and effect of the decision in order to characterise it as a ‘judgment or order’. In this his Honour emphasised that the effect was to refuse to permit the Crown ‘to seek to make a case’ at all.” 
        
       
      
    14    To similar effect, the judgment of the Court in Lisoff supra concluded with respect to the DNA evidence rejected by Golding DCJ in that case (at [38]): 
     
      
       
        
        “… the substance of what Golding DCJ has done is to destroy, in every real and practical sense, any prospect of the Crown’s presenting to the jury the substance of a case available to it and tending, if accepted, to the proof beyond reasonable doubt of the Respondent’s guilt as charged.” 
        
       
       
      The Court went on to refer to the extract from  
      Bozatsis & Spanakakis 
       quoted in par [12] hereof and concluded: 
       
       
        
        “As the Chief Justice emphasised, the issue is one of substance rather than form. The substance of the order made by his Honour in the circumstances of the present case was the rejection of the entire Crown case.” 
        
       
      
    15    In my opinion the same conclusion should be reached in the present case. The evidence that the Respondents referred to as being otherwise available to the Crown is, of course, the evidence available to the Crown in the armed robbery proceedings at which the Respondents were acquitted. An issue of abuse of process could very well arise if the Crown sought to pursue a perjury case on the basis of the same evidence, without any addition, that had led to the earlier acquittal. 
     
      
    16    No occasion arises for permitting the Respondents to resile from the position they took before his Honour on the application from which the appeal under s5F is brought. In any event, the substance of the decision by his Honour was to prevent the Crown presenting a case on the indictment then before the Court. 
     
      
       
      The Statutory Scheme 
       
      
    17    The relevant provisions of the Listening Devices Act 1984 are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “5(1) A person shall not use, or cause to be used, a listening device: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to record or listen to a private conversation to which the person is not a party, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to record a private conversation to which the person is a party. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the use of a listening device pursuant to a warrant granted under Part 4; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
          
         
        10 A person who contravenes any provision of this Part, whether by act or omission, is guilty of an offence. 
         
          
         
        … 
         
          
         
        12 In this Part, a reference to the giving of evidence of a private conversation that has come to the knowledge of a person as a result of the use of a listening device includes a reference to the production of a record of such a private conversation. 
         
          
         
        13(1) Where a private conversation has come to the knowledge of a person as a result, direct or indirect, of the use of a listening device in contravention of section 5: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) evidence of the conversation, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) evidence obtained as a direct consequence of the conversation so coming the knowledge of that person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        may not be given by that person in any civil or criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not render any evidence inadmissible: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) in proceedings for: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) an offence punishable by penal servitude for life or for twenty years or more, or 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the serious narcotics offence, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          if the Court considers that the evidence should be admissible.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18    It is pertinent to note that the offences with which each of the Respondents were charged were one charge each of perverting the course of justice, under s319 of the Crimes Act 1900 and of perjury with the intent to procure an acquittal, under s328 of the Crimes Act. In each case the maximum penalty is imprisonment for fourteen years. Accordingly, the exception found in subs 13(2)(d) of the Listening Devices Act does not apply and therefore, the regime for determining whether to admit evidence pursuant to this paragraph set out in subs 13(3) is also not material to the present proceedings. 
     
      
    19    On this basis the prohibition in s13(1) would apply in the present circumstances subject, however, to the separate provision in s14. 
     
      
    20    Section 14 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “14(1) Where a private conversation has inadvertently or unexpectedly come to the knowledge of a person as a result, direct or indirect, of the use of a listening device pursuant to a warrant granted under Part 4: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) evidence of the conversation, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) evidence obtained as a consequence of the conversation so coming to the knowledge of that person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        may be given by that person in any criminal proceedings notwithstanding that the warrant was not granted for the purpose of allowing that evidence to be obtained. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not render any evidence admissible if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the evidence relates to an offence in respect of which a warrant could not be granted under Part 4, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the application upon which the warrant was granted was not, in the opinion of the court, made in good faith.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    21    The scheme for the grant of warrants, which qualifies the prohibition in s5(1), is found in Part 4 of the Act. 
     
      
    22    Section 15 contains the following definition: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        prescribed offence 
         means an offence (including an offence under a law of the Commonwealth or of another State or Territory) that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) is punishable on indictment, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) is of a class or description prescribed for the purposes of this Part (whether or not it is punishable on indictment).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    23    Section 16 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “16(1) Upon application made by a person that the person suspects or believes: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that a prescribed offence has been, is about to be or is likely to be committed, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that, for the purpose of an investigation into that offence or of enabling evidence to be obtained of the commission of the offence or the identity of the offender, the use of a listening device is necessary, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        an eligible Judge may, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion or belief, authorise, by warrant, the use of the listening device. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) In determining whether a warrant should be granted under this section, the eligible Judge shall have regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the nature of the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is sought, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the extent to which the privacy of any person is likely to be affected, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) alternative means of obtaining the evidence or information sought to be obtained, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the evidentiary value of any evidence sought to be obtained, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) any previous warrant sought or granted under this Part in connection with the same prescribed offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Where a warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section authorises the installation of a listening device on any premises, the eligible Judge shall, by the warrant: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) authorise and require the retrieval of the listening device, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) authorise entry onto those premises for the purpose of that installation and retrieval. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) A warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section shall specify: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is granted, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) where practicable, the name of any person whose private conversation may be recorded or listened to by the use of a listening device pursuant to the warrant, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the period (being a period not exceeding 21 days) during which the warrant is in force, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the name of any person who may use a listening device pursuant to the warrant and the persons who may use the device on behalf of that person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) where practicable, the premises on which a listening device is to be installed, or the place at which a listening device is to be used, pursuant to the warrant, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) any conditions subject to which premises may be entered, or a listening device may be used, pursuant to the warrant, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the time within which the person authorised to use a listening device pursuant to the warrant is required to report pursuant to section 19 to an eligible Judge and the Attorney General.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    24    Subsection 16(6A) permits a warrant to be in the form of Schedule 2. That schedule provides for a form which was followed in the present case, including par 7 fixing the period as the period within which a s19 report is required. 
     
      
    25    Section 17 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “17 A person seeking a warrant under section 16 shall cause to be served on the Attorney General or a prescribed officer notice of the following particulars: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is sought, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) where practicable, the type of listening device intended to be used, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) where practicable, the name of any person whose private conversation is intended to be recorded or listened to by the use of the listening device, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) where practicable, the premises on which the listening device is intended to be installed or the place at which the listening device is intended to be used, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) whether any attempt has been made to obtain by alternative means the evidence or information sought and, if so, the result of any such attempt, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) any other alternative means of obtaining the evidence or information sought to be obtained, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the period during which the listening device is intended to be used, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) the name of the person who is to use the listening device, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) details of any previous warrant sought or granted under this Part in connection with the same prescribed offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A warrant shall not be granted under section 16 unless the eligible Judge is satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a notice in respect of the warrant has been served in accordance with this section, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the Attorney General has had an opportunity to be heard in relation to the granting of the warrant.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    26    Sections 19 and 20 are: 
     
      
       
        
        “19(1) A person to whom a warrant has been granted under this Part authorising the use of a listening device shall, within the time specified therefor in the warrant, furnish a report, in writing, to an eligible Judge and to the Attorney General: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) stating whether or not a listening device was used pursuant to the warrant, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if a listening device was so used: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) specifying the name, if known, of any person whose private conversation was recorded or listened to by the use of the device, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) specifying the period during which the device was used, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (iii) containing particulars of any premises on which the device was installed or any place at which the device was used, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (iv) containing particulars of the general use made or to be made of any evidence or information obtained by the use of the device, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (v) containing particulars of any previous use of a listening device in connection with the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant was granted. 
            
           
          
         
         
        (2) Where a report is given to an eligible Judge under subsection (1), an eligible Judge may direct that any record of evidence or information obtained by the use of the listening device to which the report relates be brought into the Court, and a person to whom any such direction is given shall comply with the direction. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A record brought into the Court pursuant to subsection (2) shall be kept in the custody of the Court and may, by order of the Court, be made available to any person. 
        
       
       
        
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 12 months, or both. 
        
       
       
        
        20(1) Where, pursuant to a warrant granted under this Part, a listening device has been used to record or listen to the private conversation of a person, an eligible Judge may direct the person authorised to use the device to supply to that person, within a period specified by the eligible Judge, such information regarding the warrant and the use of the device as the eligible Judge may specify. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) An eligible Judge shall not give a direction under subsection (1) unless the eligible Judge is satisfied that, having regard to the evidence or information obtained by the use of the listening device and to any other relevant matter, the use of the listening device was not justified and was an unnecessary interference with the privacy of the person concerned. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Before giving a direction under subsection (1), the eligible Judge shall give the person to whom the warrant was granted an opportunity to be heard in relation to the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A person to whom a direction is given under subsection (1) shall comply with the direction. 
        
       
       
        
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 12 months, or both. 
        
       
      
    27    In Part 5, s22 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “22(1) This section applies to the use of a listening device: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) pursuant to a warrant granted under Part 4, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) in the circumstances referred to in section 5(2)(c). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person shall, as soon as practicable after it has been made, cause to be destroyed so much of any record, whether in writing or otherwise, of any evidence or information obtained by the person by the use of a listening device to which this section applies as does not relate directly or indirectly to the commission of a prescribed offence within the meaning of Part 4. 
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 12 months, or both.” 
        
       
       
      The Exclusion of the Evidence 
       
      
    28    His Honour excluded the evidence in the exercise of the power in s138 of the Evidence Act 1995: 
     
      
       
        
        “138(1) Evidence that was obtained: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.” 
        
       
      
    29    His Honour determined that the evidence had been obtained in contravention of s19. His Honour’s reasons were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Listening Devices Act (1984) codifies the procedure for obtaining a warrant. On the fact of it, Justice Spender lawfully authorised the warrant and had the matter been confined to the murder matter there could, in my view, have been no infringement of the law. However, under s19 of the Act, Detective Gordon was required to report to an eligible judge and the Attorney General dealing with the matters enumerated in that section. An important reason for so reporting is that the Judge may direct any records be obtained and placed in the custody of the Courts. In his second reading speech the Attorney General said this was to enable efficient monitoring of the use made of listening devices. 
        
       
       
        
        A report was made by Detective Gordon in accordance with the Act and the report was tendered before me. Superficially the report accords with the requirements of s19. However, s19(b)(4) requires the report to give particulars of the general use made of or to be made of any evidence or information obtained by the use of the device. Gordon’s report was limited to the statement that a determination would be made whether there is now sufficient evidence to warrant any further action. He was, no doubt, restricting himself to the murder inquiry. 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to Detective Gordon’s knowledge of the armed robbery matter and given that Detective Crandell at all times monitored the conversation it must be assumed that he, Detective Gordon, had knowledge of the conversations regarding the armed robbery, Crandell’s log certainly details aspects of it. The fact that s14 of the Act allows for inadvertent or unexpected evidence of other matters to be admissible in certain circumstances, I am of the view that such material is required to be reported under the s19 requirements. Such was not reported. 
        
       
       
        
        An important reason for full reporting under s19 is to allow an eligible judge to exercise a discretion he has under s20 of the Act to direct the person to whom the authority has been given to record the conversation an to supply a person recorded such information obtained as the judge may direct. Unless there be full and proper reporting then the judge is unable, in my view, to exercise fully or indeed at all his discretion. 
        
       
       
        
        A failure to report in accordance with s19 is an offence under the Act with penal provision such is the importance placed upon the procedure by Parliament in the safeguard of individual freedom. It was argued by the Crown that the listening device was lawfully obtained and used. It is in my view that the codification of the Act embraces not just the obtaining of the warrant but compliance with all of its safeguards. Breaches of the Act subsequent to the obtaining of the warrant, in my view, taints the acquisition of the evidence will illegality. I am satisfied that the accused have proven that illegality.” 
        
       
       
       
      Contravention of Law 
       
      
    30    The contravention relied upon before his Honour, and in this Court, was the alleged failure to comply with the requirements of a report pursuant to s19 of the Listening Devices Act 1984. In this Court, reliance was also placed on an alleged contravention of s22(2) of the Act, which imposes an obligation to destroy material in the circumstances there set out. 
     
      
    31    It was not suggested that there had been a contravention of s5(1) of the Act. The Respondents accepted that s5(2)(a) applied to the warrant in this case. No submission was made that the alleged contravention of s19(1)(b)(iv) meant that the use of the listening device was other than “pursuant to a warrant granted under Part 4” within s5(2)(a). No reliance was placed, by way of analogy, on the approach of the Court with respect to the Search Warrants Act 1985 in Carroll v Mijovich (1991) 25 NSWLR 441. 
     
      
    32    The material tendered before his Honour on the voir dire was limited. Some material, including the affidavit in support of a warrant under the Listening Devices Act was not formally tendered in evidence before his Honour, but he plainly had regard to it and referred to its contents in his judgment. This Court was invited by both parties to similarly have regard to that document and other documents which were not formally tendered before his Honour during the course of the voir dire, but which were tendered in the subsequent application to discharge the jury. It is, accordingly, possible to outline the chronology of events with respect to the use of the listening device. 
     
      
    33    By affidavit of 12 December 1994, Detective Senior Constable Gordon sought the issue of a warrant. He indicated that he was investigating the murder of Andre Rahme and that for that purpose of investigating that offence “it is considered that the use of listening devices is necessary”. He referred to the circumstances of the murder and indicated that he suspected certain persons, including Haddad and Treglia, were involved in it. He outlined the basis of his suspicions. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Both Haddad and Treglia have been arrested and charged in respect to an unrelated armed robbery committed at Roselands on the 18 November, 1994. Haddad is currently on remand at Long Bay Jail, whilst Treglia is currently on remand at Parklea Gaol. Both Haddad and Treglia have been remanded to appear at Bankstown Local Court on the 14 December, 1994.” 
        
       
      
    34    Detective Senior Constable Gordon asserted that on the facts outlined he had reasonable grounds to believe that Haddad and Treglia were implicated in the murder offence. He proposed to install the listening device in a cell at Bankstown Police Station and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “On Wednesday, 14 December, 1994, Haddad and Treglia will be transferred to cell complex of the Bankstown Police Station whilst they await their court appearances at the Bankstown Local Court. It is intended that Treglia and Haddad will be placed ……………and that Haddad and Treglia will converse with each other in relation to the details of events surrounding Rahme’s death.” (Deletion in original). 
         
        
       
      
    35    He went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Investigating police seek the use of the listening device for the purpose of gaining information and evidence in relation to the murder of Andre Rahme. It is not the intention of investigating police to obtain information or evidence in respect to the armed robbery offences that Haddad and Treglia are presently charged with.” 
        
       
      
    36    He went on to specifically seek authority for installing the device in the cell for the purpose of recording or listening to the private conversations of Haddad and Treglia and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “The privacy of Tony Haddad and Giovanni Treglia and any other person or persons, will be affected only to an extent necessary to gain evidence or information in relation to the prescribed offence.” 
        
       
      
    37    He added that there were no alternative means or methods to obtain this information. 
     
      
    38    On 13 December 1994, a s17 certificate was forwarded. No complaint is made as to its contents. The notice under s17 repeated many of the facts and matters contained in the affidavit, including the references to the murder investigation, to the arrests of Haddad and Treglia on the armed robbery charge and to their presence at Bankstown Local Court for that purpose. That notice also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Investigating police seek the use of the listening device for the purpose of getting information and evidence in relation to the murder of Andre Rahme. It is not the intention of investigating police to obtain information or evidence in respect to the armed robbery offences that Haddad and Treglia are presently charged with.” 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        “The privacy of Tony Haddad and Giovanni Treglia or any other person or persons, will be affected only to an extent necessary to gain evidence or information in relation to the prescribed offence.” 
        
       
      
    39    On 13 December 1994, Acting Justice Spender issued the warrant. His Honour specified as the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is granted the offence of murder, authorised the installation and use and retrieval of the listening device and also authorised entry into Cell No. 1 at Bankstown Police Station for that purpose. His Honour fixed the period of 5.30pm on 13 December 1994 until 5.30pm on 22 December 1994 as the period during which the warrant would be enforced. His Honour also fixed: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 5 January, 1995 as the day by which the person authorised to use the listening device pursuant to this warrant is required to report pursuant to Section 19 of the Listening Devices Act 1984, to the Court and the Attorney General.” 
        
       
      
    40    A s19 report was signed by Detective Senior Constable Gordon on 1 January 1995. He indicated that a listening device was used. Pursuant to s19(1)(b), he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b)(i) The private conversations of Tony Haddad born 1.5.1976 and Giovanni Treglia born 23.3.1974 were listened to and recorded. Also recorded was the conversation between them and John Punch. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The listening device was used continually between 09.15 hrs on 14.12.1994 and 19.06 hrs on 14.12.1994. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The listening device was placed into Cell 1 at the Bankstown Police Station. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) As a result of the use of the listening device, conversations between Haddad and Treglia are to be accessed with other evidence available, and a determination made whether there is now sufficient evidence to warrant any further action. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) There has been no previous use of a listening device in connection with the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant was granted.” 
        
       
      
    41    John Punch who is referred to as having a conversation that was recorded, was the barrister appearing for the Respondents in the Bankstown Local Court on that day. 
     
      
    42    It may be that the word “accessed” in para (b)(iv) was intended to be “assessed”. But as that is not clear, the Court should proceed on the basis that the terminology used was intended.  
     
      
    43    During the course of the recording, the conversations in the cell were listened to by a Detective Crandle who maintained a monitoring log which included some reference to the armed robbery charges. 
     
      
    44    Detective Sergeant Pagano did become aware at some point of the installation of the listening device. He was told that no relevant product regarding the armed robbery had resulted. 
     
      
    45    The trial of the Respondents for the armed robbery offence occurred in late June. The evidence which became the basis of the later perjury charges was given on 21 June 1995. The Respondents were acquitted of the charges before Judge Nash in the District Court on 26 July 1995. 
     
      
    46    Detective Sergeant Pagano indicated that it was in late July that he had a conversation which led him to contact Constable Crandle with a view to discovering whether any material on the tape recordings did relate to the armed robbery. It was on the very day of the acquittal, namely 26 July 1995 that he attended Campsie Police Station and took possession of the relevant tapes and the written log. He said that after the verdict had been given, he played the tapes. He had conversations about the possibility of having some of the conversations enhanced and that occurred. Subsequent enhancement revealed admissions with respect to the commission of the armed robbery offence by each of the Respondents. 
     
      
       
      Section 19(1)(b)(iv) 
       
      
    47    Section 19(1) imposes an obligation upon any “person to whom a warrant has been granted” to provide a report. Failure to comply with this obligation is itself punishable. The fact that an offence is committed by the author of the report is a relevant factor in determining the scope of the obligation. 
     
      
    48    Luland DCJ identified the relevant omission as the absence of any reference to the conversations regarding the armed robbery. His Honour referred to the fact that s14 of the Act permitted the use of inadvertent or unexpected evidence as relevant to this conclusion. 
     
      
    49    Section 14 is permissive in its terms. Knowledge obtained “inadvertently or unexpectedly” within the meaning of that section “may be given” in any criminal proceedings “notwithstanding that the warrant was not granted for the purpose of allowing that evidence to be obtained”.  
     
      
    50    Section 19(1)(b)(iv) does not, however, extend the obligation to report to any use to which the relevant evidence or information is capable of being put. The terminology in that subparagraph is: “The general use made or to be made of any evidence or information …”. This formulation does not extend to use which is merely possible. It applies to actual use, by the word “made”, and to likely or intended (for present purposes it is not necessary to determine which) use, by the words “to be made”.  
     
      
    51    As noted above the relevant s19 report stated that the conversations “are to be accessed with other evidence available and determination made whether there is now sufficient evidence to warrant any further action.” His Honour found as a fact that in this comment Detective Gordon was restricting himself to the murder inquiry. That finding was not challenged in this appeal. There was no evidence before his Honour that any actual use with respect to any aspect of the armed robbery had in fact been made. Nor was there any evidence that any use with respect to the charges relating to the armed robbery was likely or intended. Nor, of course, could there ever have been any such intent to, or likelihood of, use with respect to the charge of perjury, as the evidence constituting the offence of perjury had not even been given at that time. 
     
      
    52    In my opinion, his Honour misconstrued s19(1)(b)(iv) by construing the obligation therein contained to encompass use to which the evidence or information was merely capable of being made. 
     
      
    53    His Honour made particular reference to s20 of the Act, which I have set out above, empowering the judge to direct that information be supplied to a person whose conversation has been recorded. His Honour was correct to identify this provision as emphasising the significance of the evidence or information obtained. By s20(2) a judge must have regard to the evidence or information obtained by the use of the device before making a direction under s20 that certain specified information be given to a person, whose private conversation has been recorded. His Honour was correct to identify that this particular provision required punctilious compliance with the specific requirements of s19. That does not, however, require the person obliged to prepare a s19 report to speculate about use that could be made of the evidence or information obtained.  
     
      
    54    The obligation to prepare and file a full s19 report is an important safeguard of the system which authorises intrusion into the privacy of personal conversations. Nevertheless that safeguard does not require consideration of every possible use of the taped conversations, whether then in contemplation or not. Perhaps it was foreseeable that some use might be made of the conversations with respect to the armed robbery offences. However, at the time of the preparation of the s19 report on the material before the primary judge, no such use was either likely or intended. Indeed, no such use was made of the recorded conversations when those charges were heard. 
     
      
    55    In my opinion there was no contravention of s19(1)(b)(iv). 
     
      
       
      Section 22 
       
      
    56    The Respondents raised an alternative basis for illegality, namely the obligation to destroy records under s22. That submission was not made before his Honour and accordingly his Honour did not consider it. His Honour never purported to exercise the power in s138 of the Evidence Act on the basis of any such illegality. 
     
      
    57    Section 22 is set out above. It imposes an obligation to destroy “so much of any record … of any evidence or information … as does not relate directly or indirectly to the commission of a prescribed offence”. The term “prescribed offence” is defined in s15 to mean an offence punishable on indictment or an offence within a class which is prescribed for purposes of the Act.  
     
      
    58    The issue turns on the use of the indefinite article in s22(2). The obligation to destroy, as I have indicated, extends to information that does not relate to “a prescribed offence”. It is not directed to “the prescribed offence” for the purposes of which the use of the listening device was originally sought.  
     
      
    59    Section 16(1)(a) requires an applicant for a warrant to state a suspicion or belief - in respect of which a judge must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds - that “a prescribed offence” has been, is about to be or is likely to be committed. Further, the suspicion or belief must extend to a proposition that use of a listening device is necessary for purposes of investigation into “that offence” or of enabling evidence to be obtained from the commission of “the offence” or the identity of “the offender”. Plainly, specificity is required at this initial phase.  
     
      
    60    This specificity is continued in par 16(2)(a) which refers to “the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is sought”. Further, s16(4)(a) imposes an obligation for the warrant to specify “the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is granted”. In addition there is the obligation to serve a s17 notice on the Attorney General, which by s17(1) must particularise “the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is sought”.  
     
      
    61    The possibility of the use of information beyond the original purpose is confirmed in s14, which permits, in criminal proceedings, evidence of a conversation that has “inadvertently or unexpectedly come to the knowledge of a person”, and that is so “notwithstanding that the warrant was not granted for the purpose of allowing that evidence to be obtained”. 
     
      
    62    These express references in the legislation to the particular offence with respect to which the warrant was originally sought and issued, indicates that the use of the indefinite article in s22 was deliberate. The obligation to destroy under s22 does not extend to all information, except that concerning the offence for which the warrant was originally obtained. Information about any prescribed offence, within the meaning of s15, can be retained. 
     
      
    63    Similar issues arose in R v Karageorge (1998) 103 A Crim R 157. In that case the relevant exemption was s5(2)(b) of the Act, with respect to authority to use a listening device pursuant to a law of the Commonwealth. The relevant law was s12G(4) of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth). A warrant had been issued subject to a condition that included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Only those conversations which are taking place … [certain persons were named] … and which related to the alleged offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, shall be recorded pursuant to this warrant.” 
        
       
      
    64    On the material before the Court that condition was not shown to have been satisfied. Accordingly there had been a contravention of s5(1), because the exemption in s5(2)(b) had not been established. By s13 of the Act the evidence was not admissible. (In that case unlike this case, s13 was relied upon).  
     
      
    65    In the course of her reasons Simpson J referred to the structure of the legislative scheme of the Listening Devices Act and concluded that it did not prevent the use of evidence obtained for the purpose other than that which actuated the original application. Her Honour said at 181: 
     
      
       
        
        “What s13 does is to render inadmissible evidence obtained by the use of listening device in contravention of s5. It does not render inadmissible evidence obtained by the use of a listening device that is authorised by a warrant validly obtained and used under the  
        Australian Federal Police Act 
        , even if the information or evidence obtained is incidental to the purpose for which the warrant was issued and the listening device used. The question is not the nature of the information or evidence obtained, but the purpose for, and the circumstances in which, the listening device was used. That the valid use of a listening device produces evidence of an offence other than that in relation to which it was issued does not make that evidence inadmissible. If the listening device is used pursuant to the warrant authorising its use, then evidence of offences other than that which provided the foundation of the issue of the warrant will not be rendered inadmissible by s13. A simple and obvious example will serve to illustrate the point. If an AFP officer, exercising the rights conferred by a warrant validly issued under the  
        Australian Federal Police Act 
        , for the purpose of obtaining evidence in relation to, for example, a narcotics offence, and properly used for that purpose, incidentally hears an admission of murder, s13 does not preclude the use of that evidence in relation to the murder charge, notwithstanding that that was not the purpose for which, or the suspected offence in relation to which, the warrant was issued. The underlying question is directed to the proprietary of the use of the listening device, and not to any collateral benefit or advantage that may accrue by reason of the use of the listening device.” 
        
       
      
    66    I agree with her Honour’s approach. For present purposes her Honour’s analysis reinforces the construction of s22(2) which I have advanced above. 
     
      
    67    In an analogous area, the common law has long accepted that a police officer executing a warrant may seize goods and evidence reasonably believed to relate to a criminal offence, even though the offence is not that for which the warrant was granted. (Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd v Jones [1968] 2 QB 299 at 313; Ghani v Jones [1970] 1 QB 693 at 706; G.H. Photography Pty Ltd v McGarrigle [1972] 2 NSWLR 635 at 645; Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1980] 1 QB 49 at 58; Inland Revenue Commissioner v Rossminster Ltd [1980] AC 952 at 1010; Reynolds v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1985] QB 881 at 896; R v Applebee (1995) 79 A Crim R 554 at 556; Cowan v Condon [2000] 1 WLR 254 at 261-262). 
     
      
    68    On the basis of the above analysis there is no contravention of the law within the meaning of s138 of the Evidence Act. The Respondents did not rely on any impropriety, other than insofar as a contravention of s19 or s22 would constitute such. In my opinion, the precondition for the operation of s138 did not arise.  
     
      
       
      A Causal Link? 
       
      
    69    The Crown submitted that s138(1) did not apply by reason of the fact that there was no contravention of law in existence at the time that the evidence was obtained. It was common ground that the warrant was valid. The Crown submitted that the subsequent failure in reporting under s19, if there be any such failure, did not have a retrospective effect for purposes of s138(1). Any failure to comply with s19 or s22 occurred after the evidence had been “obtained”. 
     
      
    70    Section 138 is quoted above. 
     
      
    71    For the section to operate, the evidence sought to be admitted must have been “obtained”, relevantly, either “in contravention of an Australian law” or “in consequence” of such a contravention. (The Respondents relied on a “contravention”, not an “impropriety”). 
     
      
    72    If there had been a contravention of s5 of the Listening Devices Act, then the precondition for the operation of s138 of the Evidence Act would have been clearly established. However, as I have indicated above, the Respondents did not contend that there was any contravention of this section. They accepted that the exception in s5(2)(a) applied. On this basis, the Crown submitted there was no contravention as at the time of the “obtaining” of the evidence. Such contravention as there may have been of s19 or s22 of the Act, if any, did not have the requisite causal connection with the “obtaining” of the evidence. 
     
      
    73    The formulations “obtained improperly” and “obtained in contravention” are not terms of art. The nature of the causal relationship between an “impropriety” or “contravention” and the evidence said to have been “obtained” either directly or “in consequence of” an “impropriety” or “contravention” is not the subject of any authoritative decision. 
     
      
    74    The Crown’s basic premise is that the requisite causal relationship cannot exist if the “evidence” - relevantly a tape recording of a conversation - has been brought into physical existence at a time prior to any contravention or impropriety. It is by no means clear that s138 must be given so restrictive an ambit. 
     
      
    75    Section 19 and s22 form part of an integrated scheme for controlling infringements of privacy. (The authorities have recently been reviewed by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Nicholas [2000] VSCA 49 at [79]ff). It is at least arguable that the formulation “obtained in contravention” should be construed so as to encompass the entirety of an integrated scheme, particularly a scheme designed to protect fundamental freedoms. The formulation “obtained improperly”, not presently relied upon, may well be even broader. 
     
      
    76    The Court did not hear full argument on these matters. The issue should be reserved for a case in which it is necessary to decide it. 
     
      
       
      Balancing Exercise 
       
      
    77    The Appellant challenged his Honour’s determination of the balancing process required by s138. Particular attention was directed to his Honour’s failure to refer to the matters he was obliged to take into account by s138(3). In view of the conclusion I have come to above, it is not necessary to deal with these submissions. 
     
      
       
       
      Orders 
       
      
    78    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2 Ruling that the evidence be rejected set aside. 
       
       
       
      
    79    NEWMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft form, the reasons and orders of the Chief Justice and I agree with both the reasons and the orders he proposes. 
     
      
       
       
      
    80    GREG JAMES J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: By notice of motion filed on 24 August 2000, the Crown seeks a number of orders relating to the conduct of the trial, namely, 
     
     1. That access to the public and press galleries be restricted to persons approved by the Court.  
      
     2. That the Sheriff provide transportation for the jurors to and from court in a manner deemed appropriate by the Sheriff.  
      
     3. That from the time the jury retire to consider their verdicts until the time of the verdicts being returned, the jury are to be sequestered.  
      
     4. That this application be heard in camera.  
      
    2    In relation to the fourth order sought, without objection from any party, I made an order for non publication relating to the hearing of all matters relating to this application. That order remains in force.  
    3    In relation to access to the public and press galleries during the course of the trial, I would not be prepared to make such an order on the evidence presently available to me, having regard to the general principle that the administration of justice should be conducted in courts open to the public: Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417. 
    4    There was evidence filed in support of the application to the effect that a number of the witnesses were scared of giving evidence for various reasons. A lot of that evidence was objected to but, without the necessity to rule on the admissibility of the evidence, the fact that a number of proposed witnesses were scared of giving evidence would not of itself be sufficient to limit access to the public and press galleries to only accredited persons. As I say, I am not prepared to make any such order at the present time.  
    5    If circumstances change and later justify some form of restriction, I may make an order requiring those entering the public gallery to give their names and addresses to the court officers. But at this stage no cause has been shown for even an order of that nature.  
    6    The second order sought, relating to the transportation of the jurors to and from the court, is opposed by counsel on behalf of the accused Ngo and Dinh, but not opposed on behalf of the accused Dao. 
    7    I find the opposition to an order of this nature rather surprising. I would have thought that accused persons would be just as anxious as the Crown to preserve the integrity and security of the jury, particularly if they are innocent. 
    8    The main objection appears to be that the making of special arrangements will lead the jury to be biased against the accused, because they may believe that they have particular records, or have made threats, or something of that nature. I shall deal with this aspect in due course. 
    9    The application for the transport arrangements was initially supported by evidence relating to what happened to the jury in the previous trial of the accused Ngo and Dao, where the jury was unable to agree. That evidence, which was of a hearsay nature, was to the effect that after the trial a number of jurors approached Detective Superintendent Kaldas, who was the senior investigator in the investigation resulting in the arrest of the accused persons, and requested a meeting. Subsequently, those jurors met with him and, purporting to speak on behalf of themselves and all the other jurors except one, told him that during the first few days of the commencement of the trial, the other juror had commenced asserting the innocence of the accused Ngo and Dao, and as soon as the jury retired, requested a vote to be taken immediately, and said that it would be impossible for them to reach a unanimous verdict. 
    10    They also told him that on one occasion he attempted to take home his trial notebook, although they had been told this was not to be done, and he refused to accept the truth or weight of any of the evidence, and that on several occasions whilst being driven home after court, he asked the driver to drop him off in the city, although the driver had been told to take them directly home. 
    11    The admissibility of the evidence was objected to by Mr Nicholson SC on behalf of the accused Ngo, and by Mr Hoenig on behalf of the accused Dinh. I was referred to a number of cases, including Ellis v Deheer [1922] 2 KB 113, R v Renaldi (1993) 68 A Crim R 284, R v Emmett (1988) 14 NSWLR 327, where the courts have consistently refused to accept evidence of what has transpired in the course of the jury deliberations on the ground of public policy in order to preserve the secrecy, anonymity and integrity of the jury deliberations. 
    12    A number of the cases are distinguishable; for example, what was being sought in Ellis v Deheer and in a number of other cases, was to set aside the verdict which had been announced by the foreman of the jury, on the ground that it did not represent the unanimous view of the jury, or on the ground that some of the jurors did not understand the effect of the verdict which had been given. That is a different situation to the situation which applies here, where there was no verdict. 
    13    Nevertheless, the principle has been expressed in general terms. A case which is much closer to the present situation, and which was referred to with approval in R v Emmett, is R v Brown (1907) 7 SR 290. In that case, Mr Brown appears to have taken an attitude very similar to that taken by the minority juror in the earlier trial. The proceedings were in the nature of a motion to attach him for contempt for failing to fulfil his duty as a juror, to attend to the evidence and return a verdict according to the evidence. There were affidavits from a number of the jurors which the Full Court was prepared to accept were true. However, the court refused to admit the evidence and Darley CJ said at 299: 
     
      
       
       "" … I have come to the conclusion that the authorities are all one way, and that the Court cannot look at the affidavits of jurymen for any purpose, whether it is for the purpose of granting a new trial, or for the purpose of establishing the misconduct of a juryman. We cannot look at the affidavits of jurors, or act upon them. The more I think of the matter, the more I feel the extreme danger that would follow if it were decided generally that affidavits of what occurred in the jury room might be considered. In the first place, jurymen themselves would enter the jury room with fear existing in their minds as to what might take place between themselves and their jurymen. There might be an extreme case where, after hearing the evidence, 11 jurymen were for a conviction, and one juryman might stand out for an acquittal, and properly so, and then this one, being afraid of what might be done by his fellow-jurymen, who were willing and anxious that there should be a conviction, might be tempted, under the threat of exposure, although he had acted perfectly correctly, and within his constitutional rights, to yield to other jurymen, and in this way an innocent man might be found guilty."" 
       
      
      
    14    It may be argued that even this case is distinguishable in the present case, where the purpose of the evidence is not to set aside a verdict, or to punish the minority juror, but to ensure the integrity of a jury in a future trial, but the principle, is stated in absolute terms in a decision of the Full Court of this state, by which I am bound, and I do not feel that sitting as a judge at first instance I should depart from it. I make the point that in the present case there is no evidence from any of the jurors, but there is hearsay evidence from the Detective Inspector admissible on an interlocutory application of this nature of what he and his fellow officers were told by the jurors. However, the public policy considerations must be the same, and for this reason, I reject the affidavit evidence of what occurred in the course of the jury's deliberations. 
    15    There is of course an exception recognised in R v Emmett at p 334 relating to evidence of jurors on matters which are extrinsic to the deliberations of the jury. Therefore, the evidence of the taking home of the notebook, and of the juror being dropped off in the city would be admissible. But these matters are of no significance, unless one adds the ingredient that they were the actions of the juror who did not agree with the other jurors in their deliberations. 
    16    There are however, in my view, other reasons for taking reasonable steps to secure the security of the jury, and the integrity of its deliberations. The victim of this killing was a member of parliament. The Crown allegation is that he was killed for political purposes. The matter can therefore be described as a high profile trial, although let me hasten to add, this is not because the accused are in any different position, or have different or lesser rights than any other accused, but because of the profile of the deceased, there can be expected to be a higher than normal public interest in the outcome of the proceedings. 
    17    There has, in respect of two of the accused, already been a jury unable to agree. That second trial, where the jury were unable to agree, took in excess of three and a half months. With an additional accused, it cannot be expected that the new trial will take any less. In these circumstances, I regard it as proper and desirable to take all reasonable steps to ensure the security and integrity of the jury and its deliberations.  
    18    It must be born in mind that until the mid 1960's, in a trial of this nature the jury would have been sequestered from the first day of the trial until its conclusion. There is still power, for proper reason, to make such an order under the Jury Act 1977, s 54 (a). 
    19    Indeed, it is only since 1988 that jurors have been permitted to separate after they have retired to consider their verdict. That is also subject to the order of the trial judge. 
    20    Having the jurors collected from their homes and delivered back to their homes every evening is a much lesser restriction than having them sequestered for the whole of a three month trial. The combination of factors to which I refer make it important to ensure that all reasonable steps be taken to secure their integrity. Causing them to be picked up and delivered home is, I believe, a reasonable precaution in this regard. 
    21    It was submitted, however, that there is an apprehension that this process would result in the jury being biased against the accused. Mr Nicholson SC expressed it this way; ""An element of hysteria will be permeated to the jury, which may well understand that in this case their security has to be secured because they are in danger, or the system cannot cope with these people - that is the accused - who must be heinous beyond belief."" 
    22    I consider this is a gross exaggeration of anything that the jury could possibly believe or suspect. Put more mildly, the submission can be formulated by saying that members of the jury who have sat on previous trials, particularly long trials, where such precautions were not taken, may have a suspicion that the special precautions are being taken because of the bad character or other characteristics of the accused. 
    23    In R v Richards (1999) 107 A Crim R 318, an appeal was brought against the making of various orders, including an order for transport of the jury similar to that proposed in the present case, by a District Court trial judge, in respect of an impending fourth trial of two accused, where one jury had disagreed because of the recalcitrance of one juror, and in another trial an approach had been made to one of the jurors. 
    24    One of the objections to the orders was similar to the present, it was expressed (at p 322) as being that the special treatment of the jurors would derogate from the fair trial to which the accused were entitled as a matter of law. In that case there was also the question of added publicity and the cumulative effect of that publicity, as well as the special order for transport of the jurors. 
    25    The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected the submission, and noted that the trial judge had in mind giving a specific direction that no adverse inference should be drawn with respect to the accused, in order to minimize any adverse consequences that may flow, but do not necessarily flow. Whilst one can suggest that some jurors may possibly speculate as to the reason for the special arrangements, and may possibly infer that it is because of some matter adverse to one or more of the accused, these matters are, I believe, mere speculation. 
    26    The jury are going to be engaged in a long trial. For them to be driven to and from their homes each day does not of itself suggest to any reasonable minded person that there is in that anything adverse to any of the accused. 
    27    I do not see, as a matter of reasonable practicality, that it would give rise to any bias against the accused. It may be preferable to say nothing, or merely to say that the transport arrangements are being made for their convenience. But, if requested, I would be prepared to give a direction that they should not attribute it in any way to any wrongful conduct or fear of the defendants. I would also be prepared to consider any alternative formulation of a direction that counsel may suggest. I am prepared to make order 2. 
    28    For similar reasons, I am inclined to make order 3. Although it is no longer the norm, it is not unique these days for juries, in long trials, to be sequestered during their deliberations. As I said earlier, it is only since 1988 that they have been permitted to separate during such time. 
    29    It is not necessary to make order 3 at this stage, but I indicate that subject to what happens at the trial, it would be my present intention to do so when the time comes. I therefore repeat the non publication order and make order 2 as in the notice of motion filed on 24 August 2000.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      (Re application for joint trial for Accused Dinh with trial of Accused Ngo and Accused Dao.) 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: Phuong Ngo, Quang Dao and David Dinh are each charged with the murder of John Newman on 5 September 1994. 
    2    On 15 December 1999 Wood CJ at CL ordered that Ngo and Dao be tried together, but that there be a separate trial in relation to Dinh. The trial of Ngo and Dao commenced in February of this year, and concluded in May, when the jury was discharged after failing to reach agreement. Their new trial has been set down to commence on 29 January 2001. Meanwhile, the separate trial of Dinh has also been set down for that same day. 
    3    The Crown now applies to have Dinh tried jointly with Ngo and Dao. This application is opposed on behalf of Dinh, while Ngo takes a neutral position, and Dao does not consent, but his counsel did not make any submissions. 
    4    There was an earlier trial in July 1999 in which an accomplice TVT was also an accused, but that trial was aborted and subsequently TVT indicated that he wished to plead guilty, provided additional information and agreed to give evidence for the Crown. It was as a result of that additional information that Dinh was charged. 
    5    In order to consider the matter, it is first necessary to summarise the Crown case against the accused. It is alleged that Ngo and Newman were political adversaries, although both members of the Australian Labor Party. Newman was the member for the state seat of Cabramatta, and it is alleged that Ngo wanted a seat in parliament, preferably the Cabramatta seat. 
    6    A preselection ballot for the seat was held early in 1994, but at that time Ngo did not have the numbers to win that preselection, apparently because, although he had caused a number of new members to be recruited to the party, they had not satisfied the qualifying period to enable them to vote in the preselection ballot. Accordingly, Ngo did not stand for preselection, which was won again by the sitting member, Newman. 
    7    On the day of the shooting, 5 September 1995, Ngo had lunch with Mr John Della Bosca, a prominent ALP official, and it is suggested that it was indicated to him that he had found favour at the head office of the party for a future vacancy. 
    8    The Crown alleges that over the six months preceding that day, Ngo made a number of attempts to find a person to kill John Newman, and also involved a number of people in the purchase of firearms for use in the killing. 
    9    It is alleged that in March or April 1994 he approached another former accomplice TDN and asked him if he was willing to kill Newman. When TDN refused, he asked TDN to find someone else to do the killing, preferably someone who was not Asian. 
    10    It appears that TDN approached a man CC, who asked for a photograph of the proposed victim, but later told TDN that the intended victim was high profile, and he would not do it. 
    11    About the same time it is alleged Ngo asked TVT to make inquiries about obtaining a firearm. On an occasion, apparently in about April, TVT, TDN, Dao and another person MP went to Botany in Dao's green Ford sedan and purchased a sawn-off .22 rifle. The following day TVT told Ngo about the purchase of the gun, and Ngo told him to hold on to it. 
    12    About the same time it is alleged Ngo asked TDN to get him a gun. TDN went to Wollongong with Dao in Dao's green Ford, spoke to a man named Ly, but no gun was in fact purchased. 
    13    Subsequently, he spoke to Nguc Van Le, and a Beretta .32 calibre pistol was purchased for about $1,500. The Crown alleges this is the actual gun used in the shooting. 
    14    It is alleged TDN subsequently told Ngo that he had a gun, and Ngo told him to give it to TVT, which he did. But in the meantime, Ngo told TVT that TDN would pass something on to him, and when TDN gave the gun to TVT, it was wrapped in a rag. TVT unwrapped it in the manager's office, in the presence of one Robert Zervos, and later that night he gave it to Ngo. 
    15    There followed three so called attempts by TVT and/or TDN at the instruction of Ngo to kill John Newman. One at the Thien Hong Restaurant, one at the Greyhound Club at Yagoona, and one outside John Newman's house. 
    16    The .32 calibre Beretta was present on each of the occasions. It appears that these so-called attempts failed because of the lack of resolve or nervousness of TVT and TDN. 
    17    A couple of days after the third attempt, Ngo told TVT that TDN had pulled out. TDN left the Mekong Club, where he had formerly been employed for about two months, although he later returned. The Crown alleges that after this, there were two further plans to kill Newman, hatched at the instigation of Ngo, but they did not result in actual attempts. 
    18    Subsequently it is alleged Ngo asked TVT to ask the head of security at the Mekong Club - a person who gave evidence in the previous trial under the alias of Morris - whether he could put a silencer in the .32 Beretta. Morris gave it to another person, but that person's contact was unable to have the silencer fitted. The gun was returned to Morris, who returned it to TVT, who returned it to Ngo. 
    19    At some time after the three alleged attempts on Newman's life, but some months prior to the actual shooting, there is an occasion when it is alleged Ngo unexpectedly picked up TDN late at night and took him to the Mekong Club; and when there, Ngo spoke to TVT and Dinh, and then took TDN home without explanation. This is the first reference in the evidence to the accused Dinh, and the only reference to him in the evidence, prior to the evening of the shooting. It is, of course, extremely vague, and does not implicate him in the shooting. 
    20    About a month before the shooting Ngo took TDN and drove past Newman's home. On one of these occasions he also asked TDN on a couple of occasions to loan him his car, but TDN refused. There is also evidence that about two days before the actual shooting Ngo's car, a white Camry, was seen in the vicinity of Newman's house. 
    21    The Crown case is that on the evening of 5 September, following a staff meeting at the Mekong Club - of which Ngo was the founder and honorary president, and in respect of which he had access to the petty cash funds which it is alleged were used to purchase the various guns, including the Beretta allegedly used in the shooting - Ngo asked one Trung Duong to relieve Dinh, who worked at the club as a barman. Trung Duong did so. 
    22    Four persons were allegedly seen by the doorman to leave the club at about 8.30 pm, namely Ngo, Dao, TVT and Dinh. The doorman described Dinh as wearing an army type jacket. Although in an earlier statement the doorman said that TVT left a little later, his evidence in both trials was that they all left at about 8.30. 
    23    There followed what has been described as a flurry of phone calls involving three mobile phones. It is not necessary for present purposes to describe who had which phone, or the purpose of all of the calls. But TVT's evidence in effect was that in due course he and Dinh were seated in Dao's green Ford motor vehicle, which was driven by Dao. 
    24    The car drove to the vicinity of Newman's house, where it stopped and parked. TVT then claims that he saw Dinh take out of a bag a pair of gloves and a .32 calibre pistol. The vehicle waited there about half an hour until John Newman arrived home in his car, at which time Dao, according to TVT, slowly drove the green Ford up the street, Dinh got out of the car, ran up to the driveway, and whilst Newman and his fiancee, Lucy Wang, were putting a cover on the car, Dinh fired four shots, three of which hit Newman, fatally injuring him. Dinh then jumped in, and they drove off. 
    25    Lucy Wang gave evidence that she saw a man dressed in an army type jacket and army jacket hood firing the shots, and she also saw the green Ford. 
    26    As the green Ford was driving off, a white Camry came down the street going in the other direction. The Crown claims that this was a vehicle driven by Ngo. TVT says he saw the Camry coming in the opposite direction, but could not say who was driving. 
    27    The green Ford then drove to Cabramatta Road. According to TVT, a phone call was made from the car by Dinh, speaking to Ngo, asking where he was. The green Ford drove to a nearby service station. Dinh put the gun and jacket into a bag, got out of the car, and a couple of minutes later returned without the bag, whereupon Dao drove Dinh and TVT back to the Mekong Club, where they arrived at about 9.40 pm. 
    28    The subsequent movements of Ngo that evening can, it is claimed, be traced through mobile telephone calls. It appears that he went to a place called Voyager Point, which I understand is near Heathcote, or at least along Heathcote Road. 
    29    Some four years later a search was made by police divers at Voyager Point, and they found a .32 calibre Beretta pistol. Tests on the firing pin with the cartridges used in the shooting indicate that that was the gun used in the shooting. 
    30    At the second trial, although Ngo denied being in the vicinity of Newman's home that evening, he admitted being in the Voyager Point area, but gave an explanation as to how he came to be there, relating to delivering a press release to a Vietnamese newspaper, and being diverted by road closures. He subsequently returned to the Mekong Club, where he is alleged to have said to TDN, ""We did it."" 
    31    The Crown can therefore only point to Dinh's involvement on the day of the shooting, but claims that Dinh used the same weapon as that used in at least one of the previous attempts to shoot Newman at his home, and which it is claimed was purchased on Ngo's instructions and which it is claimed disposed of at Voyager Point after the shooting.  
    32    The Crown also claims that Dao was used in the purchase of the gun, and was used in two of the earlier attempts as the driver, and also in the successful attempt. TVT was involved in all firearms purchases, and all three earlier attempts, and in the two previous plans which did not result in attempts. 
    33    The Crown alleges that the reason that he was manoeuvred into the car was to involve him on the actual night of the shooting, so that he was implicated, and therefore to discourage him from telling anyone about what he knew about the earlier attempts. The same firearm as was used in the previous attempts, and the same car as was used in two of the three previous attempts were also used. 
    34    The case, therefore, that the Crown seeks to present, is that Ngo was the instigator and procurer of the killing, that Dinh was the shooter, Dao the driver of the getaway car; and TVT was an accomplice present in the car, as I say, possibly put in that position so as to minimize the risk of him reporting to the police what he knew of Ngo's involvement in the earlier attempts. 
    35    The principles relating to separate trials have recently been reviewed and summarised in two decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal; R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66, and R v Georgio [1999] NSWCCA 125. In Fernando, reference was made to a number of cases to the effect that where two or more persons are engaged in a common enterprise, it is generally proper that they be tried together: for example, R v Grondkowski [1946] 1 KB 369, R v Beavan (1952) 69 WN(NSW) 140, Webb and Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41, particularly at 89 per Toohey J. The reasons in favour of joint trials are set out in the judgments, and it is not necessary for me to repeat them now. 
    36    However, both cases acknowledge an exceptional case of the nature referred to in R v Midis, (CCA - 27 March 1991) and R v Baartman (CCA - 6 October 1994), namely: 
     
      
       
       ""1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another, or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and 
        
         
        
       2. Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant, although not admissible against him; and 
        
         
        
       3. Where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,  
       
      
      
       
       a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial."" 
       
      
      
    37    In his judgment of 15 December 1999, Wood CJ at CL said at para [64] and following: 
     
      
       
       ""In these circumstances I have reached the conclusion that there is sufficient evidence of Dao's participation in a [sic] concert with Ngo, TVT and TDN from early 1994 ... The position, is however, otherwise in relation to Dinh. The case against him depends almost exclusively on TVT's evidence. The extent to which there is corroboration is minimal, and TVT alone, at this stage, fixes him with direct participation in the murder. 
        
         
        
       The risk of prejudice is substantial so far as the evidence of the earlier events might be seen by the jury as reinforcing TVT's credibility on this issue central to Dinh's case - a use that while potentially compelling for a lay jury, is not one permissible under the law. I do not consider it possible to overcome the resulting prejudice by directions to the jury."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    38    His Honour was concerned whether the enterprise which Dinh allegedly joined on 5 September was the same enterprise that Ngo, Dao, TVT and TDN had been involved in since early 1994, and went on: 
     
      
       
       ""The case is one where I am not, at this stage, persuaded, for the reasons outlined, that the evidence of events earlier than 5 September 1994, can clearly be shown to be admissible against Dinh."". 
       
      
      
    39    Now that the evidence in the joint trial of Ngo and Dao has been completed, it can, in my view, reasonably be asserted that on the Crown case the enterprise which Dinh allegedly joined on 5 September was the same enterprise in which Ngo, Dao, TVT and TDN had been engaged for some months; namely the killing of Newman at the behest of Ngo. 
    40    It follows that the acts and declarations of the other alleged participants in the common enterprise are admissible to prove the nature of the enterprise, though not the accused Dinh's participation in it:  R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 461, R v Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153 at 191, R v Louden (1995) 37 NSWLR 683, R v TDN (CCA - 23 September 1998). 
    41    Not only is the evidence admissible against Dinh on this basis, but although some of it may be excluded under ss 135 and 137, or its use limited under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995, a lot of it will be necessary to enable the Crown to paint a complete picture of what it claims is its case against Dinh, including motive or reason for his involvement, the purchase by TVT and/or TDN of the weapon used in the shooting at the behest of Ngo, and with funds to which Ngo had access through the Mekong Club, the presence of Ngo in the Camry near the scene at the time of the shooting, his involvement in the relevant telephone calls on mobiles at the time, including the call by Dinh to Ngo shortly after the shooting, and Ngo's alleged subsequent disposal of the murder weapon; also the botched previous attempts explain the need to recruit another shooter. These are all surrounding circumstances which it would appear are admissible in the trial against Dinh. 
    42    It appears that the position as it appeared to Wood CJ at CL in December 1999 no longer applies, in that a large amount of the evidence of events prior to 5 September is admissible against Dinh, and it is accordingly appropriate to reconsider the question of a separate trial:  R v Saunders (1994) 72 A Crim R 347. 
    43    Prima facie they should all be tried together, that is the alleged shooter, the alleged instigator / procurer, and the alleged driver of the getaway car should all be tried together for the reasons set out in the authorities to which I have referred. 
    44    There still remains the exceptional cases referred to in Midis and Baartman. It is to be noted that the requirements to fulfil that exception are cumulative, not alternative. 
    45    I accept that the case against Dinh is significantly weaker than the case against the others, and that some of the evidence is inadmissible against him, though not to the same extent as previously thought. But I do not see it as a case where the evidence admissible against the other accused and not admissible against him contains material highly prejudicial to Dinh. 
    46    The jury will be instructed, and I believe will clearly understand, that the Crown case against Dinh is considerably different to that against the others, because of his late alleged involvement. I do not consider that there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against him will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of any material not admissible against him, or that any positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial. 
    47    It was submitted on Dinh's behalf that if he gets caught in a joint trial, there is a lot of evidence from TVT relating to the earlier events, which is corroborated, and that this may tend to strengthen the credibility of TVT's evidence in respect of matters relating to Dinh, where there is no corroboration, particularly the events of what took place outside Newman's house on the evening of 5 September. 
    48    This is true, but I do not consider it as a ground for a separate trial. If the evidence of TVT in relation to the earlier events is corroborated, it may bolster TVT's credibility generally, and therefore in relation to his version of what was in the car, and what parts they played on the relevant evening; and provided the evidence is admissible against Dinh, as I believe most of it is, there can be no objection to this as a general principle.  
    49    There is, however, one particular danger: that TVT being an accomplice, and being in the car on 5 September, may seek to minimize his own part by implicating another, Dinh, or by exaggerating the part played by Dinh. 
    50    Indeed, it may be suggested that TVT was the shooter himself, but that he implicates Dinh as such and seeks to bolster his credit on that point - on which there is little or no corroboration - by relying on the evidence which corroborates him in relation to the earlier events. This, I accept, is a real possibility. But, I believe it is a possibility which can be explained to, and understood by the jury, and one which they will be readily able to appreciate. 
    51    It follows that grounds for departing from the general rule have not been established, and accordingly it is appropriate that those charged with the killing of Newman as a joint enterprise should be tried jointly. 
    52    Another relevant consideration, although of significantly less importance, is that Mr Newman was killed on 5 September 1994. Now six years have elapsed, and the trials are still pending. This is an undesirable delay, particularly as it involves the killing of a public figure, and therefore gives rise to more than usual public interest. If separate trials are maintained, it would be appropriate for Ngo to be tried first as the alleged instigator and mastermind, along with Dao. There would then need to be a further delay before the trial of Dinh, to enable adverse publicity to die down. 
    53    In practical terms, that would mean a delay of at least a further year before the trial of Dinh. Such further delay is undesirable. As I say, it is a relevant consideration, but would not be significant if a joint trial would cause unfair prejudice, or other form of injustice to Dinh. For the reasons given, I do not consider that it will. 
    54    I revoke the order directing a separate trial in relation to Dinh, and grant leave to the Crown, if it so desires, to present a joint indictment against Ngo, Dao and Dinh.

     REGINA v G W B 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Newman J. 
     
      
       
      
    2    NEWMAN J: This is an appeal against a conviction of carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of ten years. 
     
      
    3    The appellant had been indicted before the District Court at Wollongong on four counts of carnal knowledge of a girl under ten years and one count of carnal knowledge of a girl over ten years. 
     
      
    4    The jury found the appellant not guilty in relation to counts one, two, three and five but found him guilty on count four. The appellant had pleaded not guilty to each count. The five offences were said to have taken place between 1 January 1977 and 31 December 1983. 
     
      
       
      The evidence for the prosecution 
       
      
    5    The complainant was born on 28 March 1972. When she was about three and a half years old she lived at suburb I. The complainant lived with her stepfather, the appellant, her mother and her sister AP, who was two years younger than the complainant. Her brother W was born in 1976. 
     
      
    6    The complainant gave evidence that when she was about three and a half years old the appellant told her that it was bath time. She said that it was raining at the time as there were buckets and things around the living area to catch the leaking water from the roof. The complainant thought that there was a baby’s bath in the lounge room. The appellant put her in the bath and started washing her. The complainant gave evidence that he washed her for few moments and then began fondling her genitals. She said that he tried to insert his finger into her vagina. The complainant gave evidence that it hurt a lot but that he did this for a few moments. The complainant said that something similar to this incident happened quite a few times. 
     
      
    7    The complainant also gave evidence that she recalled living in a flat in suburb I. She remembered an incident at bath time when her mother was in hospital having given birth to the complainant’s brother. She said it would have been January 1976, as it was just before she turned four years of age. The appellant after a few minutes of washing her began tickling her around the genital area. The complainant said that he continued this for a few moments and then tried to put his finger insider her vagina. She said that she believed he inserted his finger as she experienced pain. The complainant gave evidence that after he had finished he put her to bed in the bedroom she shared with her sister, shut the door or turned out the light. She said that her parents never usually did that and so she thought she had been naughty. The complainant said that there were several other instances involving the appellant fondling her genitals while the family lived at that address. 
     
      
    8    In November 1976 the family moved to an address in suburb II. It was at this address that the offences the subject of the indictment, were alleged to have taken place. 
     
      
    9    Count 1: The complainant gave evidence that on the day after her brother’s first birthday the appellant came home drunk late at night. The complainant’s mother came into her bedroom and lifted the complainant out of her bed and put her into her parents’ bed. The reason for this was that the appellant snored when he was drunk. The complainant said that her mother put her on the right side of the bed. The complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… after a few minutes my dad started trying to kiss me on the mouth and over the body. He began fondling my genitals, after a few moments he removed my pyjama pants and pulled me on top of him. He was rubbing his penis against my vagina. He tried to insert his penis into my vagina but it wouldn’t go in, so he spat onto his hand and lubricated his penis with the spit and then he spat onto his hand again and rubbed it against my vagina … After maybe two or three more attempts it finally went in, it hurt a lot … He was moving his body up and down, rubbing his penis against my vagina or inside my vagina. He did this for … probably only a few minutes. He made a funny noise and then he stopped sort of moving and then he sort of pushed me back onto the bed.” 
        
       
      
    10    The complainant said she then put her pyjama pants on and went to the toilet. She gave evidence that when she went to the toilet there was blood everywhere, on her pyjama pants, on the toilet bowl and on the paper. The complainant thought she had been naughty and worried about getting into trouble so she scrunched her pyjamas into a ball and put them in the kitchen bin. She got another pair of pyjama pants and a blanket and slept on the lounge. She said that her vaginal area hurt and that she had a really bad stomach ache. 
     
      
    11    Count 2: On the day before the complainant turned five years of age the complainant’s mother was in hospital. It was evening and the complainant was lying on the lounge watching a child’s movie. The appellant had put her brother and sister to bed. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant came out of the kitchen and sat on the lounge next to her and started cuddling her. The complainant stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “He fondled my genitals, he laid down on the lounge, he took his shorts off … he lifted up my nightie and put me on top of him again and inserted his penis …into my vagina. Once again he lubricated his hand with spit and then his penis and my vagina. He … continued his penis inside my vagina for a few moments. And then he stopped.” 
        
       
      
    12    The complainant gave evidence that the appellant put his shorts back on and then asked her if she wanted to go to bed or if she wanted to go on watching the movie. 
     
      
    13    Count 3: The complainant gave evidence that another incident took place about June 1977 when her mother was still in hospital. The complainant said that she was in bed when the appellant came in, picked her up out of the bed and took her into his bed. 
     
      
       
        
        “He started kissing me … on the body ….He, once again he fondled my genitals…. He laid down on the bed, he pulled me on top of him, once again he lubricated his hand and penis with spit, he inserted his, his penis into my vagina, again. He was holding me by the shoulders so I couldn’t move. He was moving his body up and down for a few minutes and it went on for a couple of minutes … .” 
        
       
      
    14    The complainant said that when he let her go she went to the toilet. She said that there was blood again but not as much as the first time. 
     
      
    15    The complainant said that there were other incidents involving intercourse in 1977, but did not particularise any. She gave evidence that in that year the appellant was working at a coal mine. 
     
      
    16    Count 4: When the complainant was about seven or eight years of age (probably 1978) she shared a bedroom with her sister in the first bedroom at the top of the stairs. The appellant returned home from work early and told his wife that a body had been found on the railway tracks and that he thought it had been his brother-in-law. The appellant left the house to tell his sister what was happening and returned a couple of hours later. The complainant knew that he was drunk because her mother always made him sleep in the lounge when he was in this state. On this occasion she could hear the appellant making his bed in the lounge room. 
     
      
       
        
        “About ten minutes after he got home he came into the bedroom, he picked me up out of my bed, he carried me out to the lounge room, he removed his pyjama pants, he was naked, he laid down on the mattress, he pulled me on top of him again. He inserted his penis into my vagina, he was moving up and down. I said to him, ‘daddy I need to go to the toilet’, he said, ‘hang on a minute’ or something like that. He kept going, a few minutes later I said, ‘I need to go to the toilet’, again. He didn’t pay any attention to that. When he’d finished I said I had to go to the toilet again ….” 
        
       
      
    17    The complainant also gave evidence that when the appellant allowed her to go to the toilet her mother saw her as she walked past the bedroom door. She said that her mother asked her where her pyjama pants were. The complainant said that when she went to the toilet there was a little blood. She then went and got another pair of pyjama pants and got into bed. The complainant said that there were more incidents after this particular occasion. 
     
      
    18    Count 5: The last occasion when an act of intercourse took place was when the complainant was in year 6 and was eleven years old. The complainant said that she used to wedge her mother’s crutches under her bedroom door handle so that the appellant could not get in. On this occasion the appellant knocked at her door at about 9.30 pm and asked the complainant if she could look after her brother and sister while he went to the hotel. The complainant was not sure where her mother was at the time. The complainant gave evidence that she was sitting watching late night television in the lounge room when the appellant came home. She described the appellant as being “really drunk”. She said that the appellant came over to her and started kissing and fondling her. She said by this time they were on the lounge room floor. The complainant said that the appellant removed her tracksuit pants and underwear and pinned her to the floor by the shoulders. 
     
      
       
        
        “He pulled down his shorts, he inserted his penis into my vagina, he was really aggro, really aggressive. He, he kept - he was moving his body up and down, but he was on top of me. I asked him to stop which - and I was crying and he was just getting aggroo’er and aggroo’er and then he finished and he just got up and pulled up his shorts … walked away, just left me there.” 
        
       
      
    19    The complainant gave evidence that during this incident she was on her back on the floor, a position that he had not used before. She also said that on this occasion the appellant bit her under the collarbone. 
     
      
    20    The complainant said that this was the last time any acts occurred. She said that she told her mother about the assaults when she was twelve. She gave evidence that her mother raised the incidents with the appellant on 14 August 1986. She said that she remembered that date because it was the day that her mother bought her a drum kit. She said the appellant replied “if she says so it must be true.” 
     
      
    21    The complainant gave evidence that the family doctor, Dr Blaxendale, referred her for counselling to Dr Kaplan, whom she saw once. The complainant also said that she discussed the assaults with the appellant on one occasion. She said he told her that “… he had sold his soul to the devil in 1971 … when he was tripping on acid.” She also said that he told her that it was because he was drunk and that it had happened to him when he was a child. He also told her that she had thought the complainant was her mother. 
     
      
    22    The complainant’s mother, LB, gave evidence about the various places the family resided, the sleeping arrangements, the employment history of the appellant and her periods of hospitalisation. LB gave evidence of seeing the complainant without her pyjama pants on. The complainant had been sleeping on a mattress on the floor of the lounge room. When she questioned the complainant, the complainant responded that she had wet them. She also confirmed that she would put the complainant in bed with the appellant so that she did not have to sleep with the appellant when he was intoxicated. 
     
      
    23    LB said her daughter disclosed the assaults to her on 13 February 1984. She gave evidence of confronting the appellant and of his admissions in a sarcastic tone. LB said that some time after the disclosure she took the complainant to Dr Blaxendale and that there were several follow up visits and several conversations between her and the doctor. She also detailed a visit with the appellant to a Dr Lyons about the appellant’s drinking problem. 
     
      
    24    Dr Blaxendale, the family’s medical practitioner, gave evidence. He confirmed the visits to him by the complainant and her mother and the referrals he wrote for counselling. 
     
      
    25    Det Snr Const Pearson gave evidence of taking the complainant’s statement and interviewing the appellant in his home. She said that the appellant told her: 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s her mother’s fault, she was the one who used to put her in bed with me. I didn’t know who it was, I thought it was her mother. I don’t feel guilty about this, I can’t believe she has gone to the police.” 
        
       
      
    26    Det Snr Const Pearson conducted an ERISP with the appellant. The appellant said that he would come home sometimes completely intoxicated and his wife would get out of bed and put the complainant in the bed instead. The appellant said that he would wake up in the morning or some hour at night and knew that he had touched her. He said that he knew that he remembered waking and fondling the complainant but that he realised it was his daughter so he stopped. He also said that he probably did lay naked on top of her. The appellant however, denied having sexual intercourse with the complainant. He said that he molested the complainant when she was about eight or nine years of age. The appellant said that he could remember at least five instances when he fondled her. He remembered fondling her and having her lay face down on his stomach. He said that he would fondle her between the legs and then he would wake up and think “what the hell am I doing”. He said that he could just remember doing it and then realising that it wasn’t LB (his wife). When asked if he put his fingers in the complainant’s vagina he replied “he hoped not.” 
     
      
       
      The evidence for the appellant. 
       
      
    27    The appellant in sworn evidence said that everything he had said in the ERISP was true. He said that what he meant by “fondling” the complainant was that he had just put his hand on her shoulder or on her. He said that he meant by the word “molest” fondling or putting a hand on the stomach or shoulder. He gave evidence that when he told the police that he fondled the complainant between the legs he was in shock and that is not what he meant by fondling. 
     
      
    28    WB, the appellant’s son, gave evidence that he often heard the complainant and their mother talking about the allegations, the appellant and how they were going to get money from him. 
     
      
    29    The appellant has raised five grounds of appeal. In view of the conclusion which I have reached as to his third and fourth grounds of appeal, it is not necessary to consider the first and second grounds. The fifth ground of appeal which challenged the judge’s direction on the meaning of reasonable doubt is a matter which I believe this Court should deal with and accordingly I shall. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The verdict was inconsistent with the verdicts of acquittal on the four other counts in the indictment. 
       
       
      Ground 4: The verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and there was, in all the circumstances a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    30    It may be seen from the above narration of the Crown case that in relation to the first and fourth counts the complainant stated that her mother was present in the home when the offences took place. 
     
      
    31    In relation to all counts on the indictment it is plain from the narrative of the evidence above that there was no corroboration of the complainant’s allegations. It is true that in relation to count four, the complainant’s mother gave evidence of recollecting an occasion where she saw her daughter not wearing her pyjama pants. However, the mother in evidence did not give a specific date and as counsel for the appellant rightly submitted, the sight of a seven or eight year old girl in a domestic situation moving around without her pyjama pants on is quite a mundane event. 
     
      
    32    The Crown submitted that in relation to this count, unlike the others, significant support exists at least as to the nature of the allegations made against the appellant. It was also put that the admissions made during the course of the video interview with police were available in relation to count 4 to allow the jury to eliminate any reasonable doubt. In my view that latter comment could apply to all counts on the indictment. As to the former, none of the material adduced constituted corroboration of the complainant’s evidence relating to count four. 
     
      
    33    The High Court in Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439 reviewed the law relating to the test where a verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory. In so doing they confirmed the test adumbrated by the majority of the High Court in M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
     
      
    34    In M at 494 the majority said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    35    Again in Jones at 453: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of the events which were said to give rise to that count.” 
        
       
      
    36    Later, at 453: 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, two other factors made it necessary for a reasonable jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with considerable care - (1) her delay in making the complaint; and (2) the lack of any corroborative evidence, in particular, the absence of any medical evidence.” 
        
       
      
    37    In my view this case involves identical considerations to those dealt with by the High Court in Jones. Again the jury’s finding on the first, second, third and fifth counts did not make it open to them on the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the fourth count. 
     
      
    38    There is nothing in my view, in the complainant’s evidence for concluding that the quality of her evidence was higher in respect of the fourth count than it was in respect of the other counts on the indictment. 
     
      
    39    To adopt what the High Court said in Jones - “when the credibility factor is combined with the uncorroborated nature … “ the conviction on the fourth count can only be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory. That conclusion should result in this Court quashing the conviction and directing a verdict of acquittal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The learned trial judge misdirected the jury as to reasonable doubt. 
       
      
    40    His Honour during the course of his summing up said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you have a reasonable doubt at the end of the day, then you are bound to give the benefit of that doubt to the accused. On the other hand, if you are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt, in other words you have no doubt that is reasonable about his guilt, then you must return a verdict of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        That is a high standard of proof. If you have a reasonable doubt, you must acquit. If you are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt, such that you have no doubt that is reasonable, then you must convict. And it is said that it is such a high standard of proof because of the wish of the law to ensure that the innocent are not wrongly convicted. In other words, the law would rather see ten people who are possibly guilty go free, than to have a person who is innocent who is the subject of a guilty verdict.” 
        
       
      
    41    Later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if you thought that the complainant was more than likely telling the truth but the accused’s denial of the specific conduct, the subject of these charges, remained a reasonable possibility, in other words whilst you were inclined to accept what the complainant was saying but a doubt existed in your mind - in other words you thought that the accused’s denial represented a reasonable possibility - then you would have to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused.” 
        
       
      
    42    In Green v R [1971] 126 CLR 28 the High Court dealt with the direction given in a sexual assault case on onus of proof. At 32 the court stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the second place, the direction was in our opinion fundamentally erroneous. A reasonable doubt is a doubt which the particular jury entertain in the circumstances. Jurymen themselves set the standard of what is reasonable in the circumstances. It is that ability which is attributed to them which is one of the virtues of our mode of trial: to their task of deciding facts they bring to bear their experience and judgment. They are both unaccustomed and not required to submit their processes of mind to objective analysis of the kind proposed in the language of the judge in this case. ‘It is not their task to analyse their own mental processes’: Windeyer J, Thomas v The Queen (1960) 102 CLR at p 606. A reasonable doubt which a jury may entertain is not to be confined to a ‘rational doubt’, or a ‘doubt founded on reason’ in the analytical sense or by such detailed processes as those proposed by the passage we have quoted from the summing up. Yet that is what they were directed to do in this case.” 
        
       
      
    43    His Honour’s direction here suffers from a similar difficulty. The High Court in Green confirmed what had fallen from the court in Dawson v The Queen (1961) 106 CLR 1 at 18; Thomas v The Queen (1960) 102 CLR 584 and Brown v The King (1913) 17 CLR 570 at 584. 
     
      
    44    In short in directing juries in criminal cases judges should not depart from the time honoured formula that the words “beyond reasonable doubt” are words in the ordinary English usage and mean exactly what they say. 
     
      
    45    If this was the only ground of appeal to succeed the correct order of the court would be to quash the conviction and order a new trial. However, this is of course not the case. 
     
      
    46    In the circumstances, it is not necessary for the court to deal with grounds one and two of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    47    I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal upheld. 
       
       
      2. Conviction quashed. 
       
       
      3. A verdict of acquittal be entered. 
       
       
      
    48    ADAMS J: I agree with the judgment of Newman J and with the orders he proposes.

     SIMPSON J HIDDEN J  Wednesday 18 October 2000 
     
     Regina v Richard Hoskins 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
    1     SIMPSON J: I agree with Hidden J.  
     
      
       
      
    2     HIDDEN J: In the District Court at Coffs Harbour the applicant, Richard Barry Hoskins, adhered to a plea of guilty which he had entered in a local court to a charge of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing therein a felony, that is, assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This is an offence under s112(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment. He asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 2 a further offence of being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner. Taking that offence into account, his Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for six years, comprising a minimum term of three years to commence on 12 July 1999, the date he was taken into custody, and an additional term of three years. 
     
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
      
    3     The facts of the offence for which the applicant was committed to the District Court for sentence may be stated briefly. The applicant had been in a relationship with the complainant, Nerrida Kate Few, and they had a three year-old son. That relationship had come to an end and Ms Few retained custody of the child. 
     
      
       
      
    4     In the early evening of 12 July 1999 the applicant went to the home unit where Ms Few lived. He knocked on the front door but Ms Few, knowing that it was he, did not answer it. The applicant climbed onto a balcony and banged on a glass sliding door. Ms Few telephoned a neighbour, and then ran to a bedroom and locked herself inside. The applicant returned to the front door and kicked it in. He forced open the bedroom door and questioned Ms Few about the whereabouts of the child. She replied that he was at her father’s house. The applicant punched her on her mouth and pushed her head against the wall. Her bottom lip was cut and was bleeding and she later complained of headache. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The neighbour whom Ms Few had telephoned arrived and demanded that the applicant leave the unit. The applicant pushed him in the chest, saying, “I’ll wait for you. I’ll finish this inside gaol.” Before he left the unit, he kicked out at a table, breaking the glass in several picture frames. As he left the building he smashed a glass panel in a lower front door.  
     
      
       
      
    6     Police attended the unit and then went to the applicant’s home, but he was not there. However, some hours later he handed himself in to police. He expressed no remorse for what he had done, saying of Ms Few that “she causes it all the time”. He was observed to be extremely agitated, and was aggressive and abusive towards the officers in the charge room at the police station. He taunted police to fight him and he had to be physically restrained. 
     
      
       
      
    7     He gave evidence, which his Honour accepted, that he was very intoxicated that night. He explained that the incident arose from the breakdown of his relationship with Ms Few and his desire to see his son, although his Honour was satisfied that Ms Few was not refusing him access to the child at the time.  
     
      
       
      
    8     The offence taken into account on the Form 2 occurred on 1 July 1999. His Honour was not supplied with any particulars of it and no more need be said about it.  
     
      
       
        
       Subjective case 
        
       
      
    9     The applicant is an Aboriginal man who was twenty years old at the time of the offences, and is now twenty-one. He has a lengthy criminal record for someone of his age, commencing at the age of eleven. Most of his appearances were in Children’s Courts, mainly for offences of dishonesty. However, he has some entries for offences of violence, for which control orders were imposed. It seems that they were also incidents of domestic violence, in two of which Ms Few was again the victim. 
     
      
       
      
    10     A pre-sentence report reveals that the applicant had a disturbed upbringing. Parental care and control was inadequate, and he spent significant periods of time in the care of others. He was committed to wardship in 1991. He left school in Year 9, at the age of sixteen, and engaged in seasonal labouring work. 
     
      
       
      
    11     He had been what the author of the pre-sentence report described as “a binge drinker”. He used marijuana from time to time and he told the Probation and Parole officer that he used heroin for the first time on the day of the offence. In evidence, he acknowledged that he had a significant problem with alcohol, although he said that his lifestyle improved for a brief period when he undertook the study of Christianity (influenced, apparently, by the neighbour who came to the assistance of Ms Few on the night of the offence). 
     
      
       
      
    12     His Honour took all these matters into account and, in the light of the applicant’s youth and in the hope of fostering his rehabilitation, found special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between minimum and additional terms. 
     
      
       
        
       The application 
        
       
      
    13     Mr Stratton of counsel, who appeared for the applicant in this Court but not in the District Court, argued that the learned sentencing judge fell into error in a number of respects in his reasons for sentence and that, in any event, the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      
    14     In the course of his remarks on sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         I can imagine the terror that his conduct caused the victims, all of them, Miss Thew (sic), the neighbour, Mr Voss, who entered unsuccessfully into the premises, and the police, properly seeking to do their duty, when this wild man wants to fight them and resist arrest and cause them harm. 
         
        
       
      
    15     Evidence of what occurred at the police station was admitted without objection, and it was relevant to demonstrate the applicant’s emotional state on that night and his lack of remorse for the violence he had inflicted upon Ms Few. Nevertheless, I consider there is force in Mr Stratton’s argument that his Honour’s characterisation of the police officers as “victims” suggests that he saw some continuity between the applicant’s conduct at Miss Few’s home unit and at the police station, so as to treat his behaviour at the police station as a factor aggravating the offence for which he stood for sentence. In fact, as I have said, the incident at the police station took place some hours later. It may have given rise to other charges, but it could not bear upon the proper assessment of the criminality of the applicant’s conduct at Miss Few’s home unit. 
     
      
       
      
    16     In his remarks, his Honour said that Miss Few “was treated for the punch to the mouth”. This was a factual error. I have earlier referred to her cut lip and her complaint of headache, but there was no evidence that she sought any medical treatment. 
     
      
       
      
    17     Mr Stratton argued that his Honour gave undue weight to the applicant’s criminal record, which he summarised in the remarks on sentence, describing it as “appalling” for one so young. One might question the use of that epithet but there is no doubt that it is disturbing. Of more significance, however, is his Honour’s assertion that the applicant was “sent to a gaol sentence” for one of the prior offences of violence involving Miss Few. That is not so. As I have said, each of those offences of violence led to the imposition of a control order in a Children’s Court. The sentence passed by his Honour is the first gaol sentence ever to have been imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    18     I am persuaded by the combination of these errors that the sentencing judge’s discretion miscarried, and that this Court should intervene. It is unnecessary, then, to consider Mr Stratton’s final submission that the sentence is manifestly excessive. However, the Crown Prosecutor in this Court acknowledged that the sentence is severe and, having decided that it is vitiated by error, I am of the opinion that a lesser sentence should be passed: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In so saying, I have regard to all the material that was before his Honour and, in addition, to an affidavit of the applicant received in this Court. From that affidavit, and its annexures, it appears that he has sought to further his general education and employment skills, as well as to pursue an anger management course, while in custody. 
     
      
       
      
    19     His Honour passed sentence under the Sentencing Act 1989, since repealed. The sentence I propose should be framed in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Clearly, there are special circumstances, within the meaning of s44(2) of that Act, calling for a non-parole period less than three quarters of the term of the sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    20     I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and quash the sentence passed in the District Court. In lieu, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for five years, to date from 12 July 1999, with a non-parole period of two years and three months. He would be eligible for release on parole on 12 October, 2001.

       SOUTHERN HEALTH SERVICE & ORS. V. SMITH 
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 POWELL JA: As the essential facts which have given rise to this appeal are set out in the Judgment which has been prepared by Hodgson JA, which Judgment I have read in draft, it is not necessary for me to repeat them here. 
     2 I regret to say that I regard William DCJ’s Judgments, insofar as they deal with the matters which have been debated on the hearing of the appeal, as unsatisfactory. 
      
       
      Past Economic Loss 
     3 Australia 
      
      Save that, in his first Judgment Williams DCJ recorded (RAB 54) that that loss “(had) been assessed in round figures at $6,0000.00”, and, later (RAB 58), that that sum “(had) not been mathematically disputed”, his Honour did not record his reasons for adopting that sum as the appropriate sum to be allowed. 
       
     4 The only evidence directed to past economic loss in Australia which was given on the hearing was as follows: 
      
      a. the Respondent’s evidence that, although continuing to work as a lodge liaison officer, he was not able to continue to work as a ski instructor in Australia; 
       
      b. the Respondent’s evidence that this caused a loss of $400.00 per week before tax; 
       
      c. the Respondent’s income tax assessment for the financial year 1996-1997 (Black AB 190) and a “Tax Calculation” for the financial year 1997-1998 (Black AB 186) which revealed a taxable income in the former year of $15,897.00 and in the latter year of $13,064.00, and tax assessed in the former year of $2,099.40 and tax calculated in the latter year of $1,532.80, a difference in the nett income after tax for those two years of $2,266.40. No figures for the financial year 1998-1999 or for the period from 1 July 1990 to the date of hearing were tendered. 
       
     5 This evidence, in my view, provided a very flimsy basis for an assessment of $6,000.00 for past economic loss. 
     6 United States 
      
      In his second Judgment, Williams DCJ wrote (RAB 62): 
       
        
        Past Economic Loss 97/97 USA Ski Season 
         
        Averaging out the last 3 years prior to the operations, adding the component for tips, the nett economic loss for that year appears to be in the order of AUD$20,000.00 and I allow that amount.” 
        
       
       
      However, as, in the course of his Judgments, his Honour did not carry out any calculation to “average out” the Respondent’s United States income – other than gratuities – in the three tax years prior to the operations – the United States tax year is a calendar year – although he did in his second Judgment calculate an average figure for gratuities (RAB 61-62) I find it quite impossible to understand how his Honour calculated the sum of $20,000.00. 
       
     7 The Respondent’s United States tax returns – both Federal and State – for the tax years 1994, 1995 and 1996 – the accuracy of which returns is, to say the least, suspect – reveal the following – work related deductions not including the Respondent’s costs of return air travel to the United States. 
      
       
        
        Year Gross Income Work Related Deductions 
        
       
       
       1994 11981 1292 10689 
       
       
       1995 12967 1990 10977 
       
       
       1996 15343 ? ? 
       
       
      If, as recorded by Williams DCJ in his Judgment, Federal tax in the United States is a flat 20%, this would suggest that, in those years the Respondent’s income after tax was in the order of US$8551, US$8716 and something less than US$12274, respectively. Those figures, if converted at the rate – AUD$1.00:US$0.65 – adopted by his Honour would represent AUD$13,155, AUD$13,409 and something less than AUD$18,883, a total of something less than AUD$45,447 and an average of AUD$15,149 yearly. 
       
     8 If to the figure of AUD$15,149 thus produced one adds the “annualised income loss of $139.00 per week” calculated by Williams DCJ (RAB 61-62) as representing the value of gratuities, one obtains a figure of $22,377, which figure, of course, exceeds the amount allowed by his Honour for the past economic loss in the United States, a fact which casts more than a shadow of doubt over the validity of the whole exercise. 
      
       
      Future Economic Loss 
     9 Australia 
      
      There are several unsatisfactory features of this aspect of Williams DCJ’s Judgment: 
       
      a. although, in his first Judgment, Williams DCJ recorded (RAB 54-55) that “ 
      there (was) a claim for continuing economic loss of $138.00 for 15 weeks each year 
      ”, the amount of which claim he adopted before “annualising” it, he nowhere records the basis for calculating that amount, nor his reasons for adopting it; 
       
      b. although recording (RAB 53) the Respondent’s evidence that he would have remained a ski instructor all his life, and that a ski instructor at Perisher Valley had recently celebrated his 70th birthday, Williams DCJ did not – at least, did not expressly – record his acceptance of that evidence or express his view that, if things had been different, there would have been a reasonable prospect that the Respondent would have continued as a ski instructor until 70 years of age; far from his having done so, the choicer of the multipliers which he adopted for this purpose – but, curiously, not for the purpose of calculating United States future loss – would suggest that Williams DCJ thought it unlikely that the Respondent would have continued as a ski instructor beyond the age of 65 years; 
       
      c. as Hodgson JA has noted, Williams DCJ did not – at least did not expressly – make any allowance – whether the conventional 15% or a higher percentage – for contingencies; the failure to deal with that aspect of the matter involved error on the part of his Honour, and the suggestion made by Mr. Cranitch, in the course of argument, that the multiplier adopted by Williams DCJ represented a discount of about 15% upon the multiplier which would have represented a loss calculated to age 70 years is not to the point. 
       
     10 United States 
      
      In his first Judgment, Williams DCJ wrote (RAB 578) that “with reference to the taxation evidence,  
      without 
       gratuities, (he) would calculate the (Respondent’s) future economic loss from activities in the USA on the basis of a nett income of about AUD$304 per week”, while in his second Judgment he wrote (RAB 61) that “at page 28 (he) indicated the (Respondent) was entitled to a nett income of AUD$304.00. This (was) AUD$15,808.00 nett per annum for his losses in the US in the US where his gross income in Australian dollars would have been about $23,500.00 bearing in mind that the income (he had) to assess (was) his gross income after tax not the nett income after taxable deductions”. 
       
     11 This is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons: 
      
      a. as I have previously (para. 8 (above)) recorded, the Respondent’s average nett yearly income after tax over 3 years in the United States was  
      not 
       AUD$15,808.00 but, at best, AUD$15,149.00; 
       
      b. although the Respondent’s Federal income tax return for the year 1996 records a “gross income” of US$15,343 that sum is made of “Wages salaries tips etc” of US$14,871 and “Taxable refunds, credits, or offsets of state and local income taxes”; 
       
      c. the same return records “Itemised deductions” of US$10,891 made up of State income taxes of US$665, gifts to charities US$50 and unreimbursed employee expenses of US$10,483, a figure made up of “Travel expenses” of US$6778, “Business expenses” – which appear to be work related expenses – of US$1292 and “Meals and entertainment expenses” of US$1500; 
       
      d. the same return, after recording “Exemptions” of US$2550 records a “Taxable Income” of US$1902; 
       
      e. if one adopts the conversion rate adopted by Williams DCJ – AUD$1.00:US$0.65 – the Respondent’s gross United States income was AUD$23605, while the nett income after tax of AUD$15808 which he accepted was US$10275. Allowing tax of US$0.20, the Respondent’s taxable income would thus have been US$12844, a figure which cannot be reconciled with any of the figures which I have earlier recorded; 
       
      f. nor is the position made any clearer if one has regard to the Respondent’s Federal income tax return for the tax year 1998, a year in respect of which, if any claim for past economic loss was made, no damages were awarded. In that year the Respondent’s gross income was US$13540 (US$20831), itemised deductions US$8894 (AUS$13683) and exemptions US$2700 (AUD$4154) leaving a taxable income of US$1946 ($AUD$2994). And to confuse the matter further, “expenses” were itemised as totalling US$9710 (AUD$14938) made up of “flight cost” US$2400, “rent cost” US$3460, “food cost” US$2100, “equipment cost” US$1500, “telephone and internet cost” US$140, “parking” US$100, and “health club dues” US$200. Even if one deducts only “rent cost” and “food cost” (US$5560-AUD$8554) one is left with a “nett income” before tax of US$7980 (AUD$12277) or $223.20 per week “annualised”. 
       
     12 Quite apart from the fact that the multiplicand adopted by Williams DCJ is, to say the least, suspect, the multiplier adopted by his Honour – 665.2, or that appropriate for 16 years – is open to question. 
     13 While, in his first Judgment, his Honour (RAB 56) expressed the view that “realistically, in (his view) whilst (the Respondent) may do one or two more seasons at Vail … the pressure on him in regard to that source of income is such that he is unlikely to continue it for any appreciable period”, the allowance of 16 years would seem to suggest that it was Williams DCJ’s view that, in the ordinary course, it would have been improbable that the Respondent would have continued as a ski instructor beyond the age of 62 years, a view which cannot be reconciled with the view apparently taken by his Honour when calculating future Australian economic loss and one which cannot be reconciled with the Respondent’s evidence as to his intention to work as a ski instructor for the rest of his life. I have been unable to discover in Williams DCJ’s Judgment any basis for reconciling this apparent inconsistency. 
      
       
      Conclusion 
     14 Although, during the course of the hearing of the appeal, I had hoped (T.3.25) that, although it seemed to me that the trial had miscarried – because one could not work out, on the basis of supportable evidence, how Williams DCJ had calculated the amount of the damages which he awarded – it might be possible for this Court to calculate, for itself, the appropriate amount of damages, in the event I have regrettably concluded that, as his Honour’s Judgment is, in my view, fundamentally flawed, it is not possible for this Court to avoid the matter being remitted to the District Court for the new trial limited to damages. 
      
       
      Orders 
     15 I propose the following Orders: 
      
      1.  
      ORDER 
       that the appeal be upheld. 
       
      2.  
      ORDER 
       that the verdict found by Williams DCJ and the Judgment entered pursuant thereto be set aside. 
       
      3.  
      ORDER 
       that the proceedings be remitted to the District Court for a new trial limited to damages. 
       
      4.  
      ORDER 
       that the Respondent pay the Appellant’s costs of the appeal but that, if qualified, he have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act. 
       
      5.  
      ORDER 
       that the costs of the first trial abide the determination of the Judge on the retrial. 
       
     16 HODGSON JA: In October 1996, the respondent underwent radical surgery to deal with cancer associated with a lump in his neck, and this was followed by radiotherapy in December 1996 and January 1997. His life and earning capacity were substantially affected. He brought proceedings against the appellants, claiming that they should have diagnosed the cancer in about October 1995, and that, had they done so, it would have been successfully treated by far less invasive and detrimental procedures. Judge Williams awarded him damages of $595,456.48. 
     17 Before this Court, the appellants challenged certain aspects of that award. 
     18 The damages included $130,000.00 for general damages, $5,100.00 interest on past general damages, $75,000.00 for future dental care, $17,500.00 for other future medical expenses, $6,000.00 for past economic loss in Australia, $7,406.48 for past out-of-pocket expenses, and $3,000.00 superannuation loss. These amounts, totalling $244,006.48, are not challenged. 
     19 The aspects of the damages award that are challenged on appeal are $31,364.00 awarded for future economic loss in Australia, $20,000.00 awarded for past economic loss in the USA, $5,413.00 interest on past economic loss, and $294,682.00 awarded for future economic loss in the USA. 
      
       
      BACKGROUND AND PRIMARY JUDGE’S DECISION 
     20 The respondent was born on 2nd May 1995. In 1974, he set up business with two others as a panel beater and smash repairer. The business was successful, but the respondent left it in 1979 to devote himself to skiing. He continued to do some panel beating work; and from 1984, he ran a panel beating business in Queensland in the summer months, while in the winter months he managed a ski lodge at Perisher Valley. 
     21 In 1986, he obtained full certification as a ski instructor. In 1990, his panel beating business wound up, and thereafter he worked during the summer months as a ski instructor at Vail in the USA, while in the winter months he was employed by Perisher Blue.  
     22 In 1993, he ceased to be a lodge manager at Perisher Valley, and thereafter was employed as a lodge liaison officer, in which position he was able to spend approximately four to five hours per day as a ski instructor. He continued to go to Vail each summer as a ski instructor. He also exercised his panel beating skills by purchasing cars, doing them up, and selling them. 
     23 Dealing with economic loss, the primary judge noted the respondent’s evidence that, but for the effects of the treatment, he would have remained a ski instructor all his life; and the primary judge found that the respondent was highly regarded as a ski instructor and had the capacity to continue as such. 
     24 As regards future economic loss in Australia, the primary judge found that there was a difference between the amount he was previously able to earn in Australia and the amount he is now able to earn in Australia, and he noted that the respondent claimed a continuing economic loss of $138.00 per week for fifteen weeks each year. The primary judge averaged this over the year (multiplying by 15 and dividing by 52), and multiplied the result by the multiplier 787.9, giving $31,364.00. 
     25 As regards economic loss in the USA, the primary judge noted that taxation records revealed that the respondent was resident in the USA for the following periods: 153 days in 1992, 92 days in 1993, 142 days in 1994, 166 days in 1995, 124 days in 1996, 28 days in 1997 and 143 days in 1998. The primary judge was satisfied that the respondent lost the benefit of the 1996/97 American ski season by reason of the treatment, and was not persuaded that he would have lost a s ea son in any event. He noted the respondent’s evidence that he had difficulties in carrying out work in Vail after the treatment, and that he worked only 89 of the 143 days in the USA in 1998, as compared with at least 100 days prior to treatment and usually 120 to 130 days. 
     26 The primary judge was of the view that the respondent’s tiredness would continue and was likely to get worse as he got older. The trial judge considered that the respondent might do one or two more seasons at Vail, but was unlikely to continue this for any appreciable period. The respondent had sold his apartment in Vail because he could not keep up the mortgage payments while he was ill, and the cost of travel and renting accommodation would be substantial economic disincentives to continue. 
     27 Leaving aside the question of gratuities, to which I will come, the primary judge calculated the respondent’s future economic loss from activities in the USA on the basis of a net income of A$304.00 per week for sixteen years, using the multiplier 665.2, giving a result of A$202,220.00. 
     28 The primary judge gave no award for loss of potentiality to work as a panel beater/spray painter, because he understood this to be brought as an alternative to the claim for loss as a ski instructor. 
     29 On the question of gratuities, the respondent had sought to claim an amount of US$100.00 per day by way of gratuities. This claim was not included in the respondent’s particulars of economic loss, nor was it notified to the appellants until the case was opened. These amounts had not been included in the respondent’s USA tax records because, according to the respondent, he was not required to declare that aspect of his income. The respondent applied to amend the particulars of economic loss, and this was objected to. The primary judge reserved the question whether the amendment ought to be allowed, to enable the appellants to make what investigations they could during the course of the trial. They were unable to complete the investigations during the trial, but the respondent continued to rely on this claim in closing addresses. No final ruling on the application to amend was made when the case concluded on 20th January 2000. 
     30 In his primary judgment in the case, delivered on 28th January 200, the primary judge said this: 
      
       
        
        In a document setting out calculations of economic loss the plaintiff's counsel has relied heavily on the inclusion of between $5,000.00 and $10,000.00 per annum US in tips. This has the potential to add significantly to the claim for economic loss. Whilst I am reluctant to decide the matter without taking that aspect into account, I think in all fairness the defendant should be allowed to investigate the position. Because of the view I have taken in regard to other matters, I propose to allow the plaintiff leave to amend their particulars to make that claim and stand the matter over part-heard to enable the defendant to meet the amendments. However, that should not preclude me dealing with most other aspects of the claim presently before me. 
        
       
     31 In a further judgment given on 13th March 2000, the primary judge said this: 
      
       
        
        For the purpose of finalising the judgement, the parties have agreed on one unresolved aspect and that is that a ski instructor, of the calibre of the plaintiff, could expect to earn between US$40-$100 per day in gratuities. The parties have agreed that a figure of US$70 per day would not be unreasonable. I am informed that such gratuities are subject to 20% tax, which is contrary to what the plaintiff said in evidence that he believed that such earnings were not tax deductible. The defendants say that they have been deprived of the opportunity of cross-examining the plaintiff as to credit on this issue. In my view that would hardly be likely to change the situation. The plaintiff did not complete his US tax returns - he gave them to a friend to do. He said in cross-examination on this point that he thought there was a distinction between waiting staff and other persons and was not aware, until pointed out to him, that part of the US tax form (Q8) required disclosure of gratuities, in which case he said he would have disclosed the tips he had received. He noted that restaurants added tips to the bill but this was not the case with ski instructors. If there is a credit issue here it is not one that, in all the circumstances, was likely to have affected the eventual outcome. As it is, the plaintiff s contention that he was getting up to US$l00.00 per day in tips has now been shown to be correct.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        At page 28 I indicated the plaintiff was entitled to a nett income of about AUD$304.00. This is AUD$15,808.00 nett per annum for his losses in the US, where his gross income in Australian dollars would have been about $23,500.00 bearing, in mind that the income I have to assess is his gross nett income after tax not the nett income after taxable deductions. 
         
         
        Apparently the 20% rate of tax, as far as it affects Mr. Smith, is a flat rate for all his income. That being so the nett Australian dollar amount of his US tips would be approximately AUD$86.00 per day. His evidence was that in 1998 he worked about 89 out of 143 days. Except for 1997 the number of days he was in the USA from 1992 to 1996 was 153, 92, 142, 166 and 124. Obviously he would not earn tips on days he was not working. Averaging out the above figures and taking roughly 62% as the proportion of days worked per annum, multiplied by $86.00 per day and divided by 52 weeks per year, there is an additional annualised income loss of about $139.00 per week. 
         
         
        Using the 665.2 multiplier this comes to $92,462.00. This figure should be added to the figure reached at page 28 of the judgment of $AUD$202,220.00 making a total of $294,682.00. 
         
         
        Past Economic Loss 97/97 USA Ski Season 
         
        Averaging out the last 3 years prior to the operations, adding the component for tips, the nett economic loss for that year appears to be in the order of AUD$20,000.00 and I allow that amount. 
        
       
       
      ISSUES ON APPEAL 
     32 The Amended Notice of Appeal included the following grounds: 
      
       
        
        1.His Honour erred in failing to make a reduction in damages against the possibility that had the respondent been diagnosed at an appropriate time more conservative treatment would have been undertaken. 
         
        2. His Honour erred in allowing the respondent to claim past and future lost United States gratuities. 
         
         
        3. His Honour erred in giving the appellants an adjournment after close of submissions. 
         
         
        4. His Honour erred in failing to make a deduction for residual earning capacity. 
         
         
        5. His Honour erred in failing to deduct outgoings necessary for the realisation of the respondent's earning capacity in the calculation of past and future economic loss in relation to the respondent's United States income (and consequentially an error occurred in the calculation of interest on the past loss). 
         
         
        6. His Honour erred in failing to make any deduction for vicissitudes in relation to future economic loss. 
         
         
        7. His Honour erred in allowing interest, on the paid portion of the judgment, from 13 March 2000. 
        
       
     33 The respondent raised the following contentions, being grounds on which the respondent intended to support the judgment apart from those relied on by the primary judge: 
      
       
        
        Having found that the respondent was a qualified panel beater who had managed his own panel beating business, and having found that the respondent effectively had lost the capacity to work in his trade as a panel beater, his Honour ought to have made an allowance for this diminished earning capacity. 
         
         
        Having found that the respondent had the capacity to work as a ski instructor for at the most two more seasons, his Honour ought to have allowed him more than 16 years with respect to future economic loss when the evidence was that he was 44 years of age at the time of trial and, if had he not been injured, he could have worked as a ski instructor beyond the age of 70 years. 
        
       
     34 At the hearing, the appellant abandoned Grounds 1, 2 and 4 in the Amended Notice of Appeal. In relation to Ground 7, the respondent conceded that the correct date for accrual of interest on the judgment should have been 19th April 2000. Accordingly, the Court heard argument only in relation to Grounds 5 and 6 of the Amended Notice of Appeal, and in relation to the respondent’s contentions. 
      
       
      Submissions 
     35 In relation to future economic loss, concerning activities in Australia, Mr. Walmsley SC for the appellant submitted that the trial judge should have deducted the conventional figure of 15 per cent for vicissitudes from the amount of $31,364.00. He referred to Wynn v. NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 485. He submitted that the circumstance that the judgment contained no mention of allowance for vicissitudes was indicative of error. A possible explanation for this could be found in the Black Book p.89, recording an exchange which could have left his Honour under the misapprehension that vicissitudes had already been taken into account in arriving at the relevant multiplier. 
     36 In relation to economic loss concerning activities in the USA, Mr. Walmsley submitted that the trial judge’s calculations were based on a weekly figure of A$304.00, arrived at without deducting expenses necessary to earn that income: see James Hardie & Co. Limited v. Roberts (1999) 47 NSWLR 425 at 440. He submitted that the full deductions claimed in the USA tax returns should have been taken off as expenses; but alternatively, if the claimed deductions in respect of rent and food were not treated as expenses, then at least the deductions in relation to air fares, equipment, costs, and other expenses such as telephone expenses and health club dues, should have been taken off. If one took those expenses as amounting to about US$3,500.00 per annum, this would reduce the weekly figure from A$304.00 to about A$200.00. Taking the trial judge’s multiplier of 665.2, this would give a figure of $132,040.00. 
     37 Furthermore, Mr. Walmsley submitted, the trial judge failed to take into account vicissitudes in relation to future economic loss from activities in the USA. Accordingly, 15 per cent should be deducted from the figure of $132,040.00, and also from the gratuities figure of $92,462.00 adopted by the trial judge. 
     38 In relation to past USA economic loss, expenses of about $5,000.00 should be deducted from the $20,000.00 awarded in relation to the year lost from USA activities, giving a figure of $15,000.00. 
     39 For the respondent, Mr. Cranitch SC pointed out, in relation to future economic loss concerning activities in Australia, that the trial judge’s multiplier 787.9 was that appropriate in relation to earnings to age sixty-five, whereas the respondent had given evidence that he had calculated at forty, before the incident occurred, that he had a good thirty years ahead of him. That evidence was not challenged, and was apparently accepted by the trial judge. The appropriate multiplier for working to age seventy would be 922.2, and 15 per cent from that would give 783.87, approximating to the figure adopted by the trial judge. No error in the result was shown. 
     40 Mr. Cranitch submitted, in relation to future economic loss concerning USA activities, that it was not shown that A$304.00 per week was arrived at without deductions for expenses. In any event, he submitted, this Court could not find that this was not a reasonable estimate of the respondent’s earning capacity. 
     41 In relation to vicissitudes, Mr. Cranitch pointed out that the multiplier 665.2 adopted by the trial judge was that appropriate in relation to earnings to age sixty. Even if the trial judge had allowed only to age sixty-five for the USA earnings, the multiplier would be 787.9; and 15 per cent from 787.9 would give 669.7, again approximating to the figure adopted by the trial judge. Furthermore, if it were assumed that the respondent stopped going to the USA at age sixty, there would be an unused earning capacity from age sixty onwards in respect of that part of the year when the respondent otherwise would have gone to the USA. That could have been used for his panel beating skills; and there was uncontested evidence that a manager of a panel beating concern could earn about $1,300.00 per week. 
      
       
      Decision 
     42 During the hearing of the case, I was of the tentative view that error had been shown in failure to adopt expenses from USA earnings. This was based partly on my understanding of the actual figures for USA earnings, and also partly on that part of the second judgment of the trial judge quoted above where his Honour said he had to assess “gross net income after tax not the net income after taxable deductions”. I had taken that to mean that his Honour took the gross USA income and deducted the tax payable in the USA, but not the “taxable deductions” claimed in the USA tax returns. 
     43 However, on a closer consideration of the figures, I now think this tentative view was incorrect. Just before the passage I have quoted, the trial judge said that the respondent’s gross income would have been about A$23,500.00. I note that the respondent’s gross income in the USAS in 1996, the last year before he was affected by the problems the subject of these proceedings, as shown in the USA tax returns, was US$15,343.00 (Blue Book p.221), which, at the 65¢ rate adopted at the hearing, converts to A$23,605.00, closely approximating to the trial judge’s gross figure of A$23,500.00. The USA tax actually payable on the taxable income in that year appears to have been US$390.00 (Federal US$287.00, shown at Blue Book p.221, and State US$103.00, shown at Blue Book p.250), that is A$600.00. To arrive at A$15,808.00 (equivalent to A$304.00 per week), one would need to take from the gross figure less USA tax a further A$7,197.00, or US$4,678.00. 
     44 The evidence does not appear to contain itemised deductions for the 1996 USA tax return; but deductions shown in 1998 (apart from rent and food) amounted to US$4,350.00, out of a total, including rent and food, of US$9,710.00. In my opinion, it would not be appropriate to treat rent and food costs as expenses incurred in earning the USA income, where it is not shown or suggested that they were in excess of ordinary living expenses. I note that the total deductions as between rent and food and other deductions were the same in 1996 and 1998, that would give deductions other than rent and food for 1996 of US$4,897.00. It appears from these figures that the trial judge did adopt something like US$4,700.00 as expenses necessarily incurred in earning the USA income, and on the calculations I have made this would seem appropriate. 
     45 During oral submissions in this case, I reached the tentative view that it might be reasonable to take a different figure of around US$3,500.00 as an appropriate figure for expenses necessary to earn the income in the USA, the difference from US$4,700.00 being on the basis that some of the deductions, other than for rent and food, might be considered as living expenses or as giving the respondent valuable assets such as ski equipment and clothing. I note that, if one applied expenses of US$3,500.00 to the earnings in the two years 1995 and 1996, and averaged the results, one would by this route also reach a figure very close to that adopted by the trial judge. The gross earnings in 1995 were shown at US$12,682.00, and if one deducts from this the tax of US$215.00 and expenses of US$3,500.00, one reaches a figure of US$8,967.00. If one takes the gross figure of US$15,343 for 1996, deducts tax of US$390.00 and expenses of US$3,500.00, one reaches a figure of US$11,453.00. The average of those two years in then US$10,210.00, which at a 65¢ exchange rate gives A$15,708.00. 
     46 Accordingly, it now seems to me that the figure adopted by the trial judge of $A304.00 per week was a reasonable figure, albeit not adequately explained in the judgment. 
     47 In relation to past economic USA loss, one would add to A$304.00 per week the A$139.00 per week for gratuities, so that $20,000.00 for the loss of the 1996/97 American ski season appears to be justified. 
     48 As regards future economic loss in the USA and Australia, and as submitted by Mr. Walmsley, the trial judge made no mention of or explicit allowance for vicissitudes; and the passage in the transcript to which Mr. Walmsley referred does support the inference that his Honour did not allow for vicissitudes. The multipliers which the trial judge used do take into account vicissitudes concerning life spans, but not other vicissitudes such as illness and unemployment: the latter vicissitudes are the matters supposed to be covered by the conventional deduction of 15 per cent. In my opinion, the trial judge should have explicitly dealt with this matter, and prima facie error is shown in this regard, in relation to economic loss concerning both Australian and USA activities. 
     49 However, as submitted by Mr. Cranitch, there are balancing considerations. First, the adopted of age sixty-five for Australian activities in selecting the multiplier involves the rejection of age seventy as the most likely scenario, without any reasons being given. Secondly, the adoption of age sixty for selection of the multiplier in relation to USA activities involves both rejection of age seventy or age sixty-five for USA activities without reasons, and also no allowance for unused income earning capacity between stopping work in the USA and ultimate retirement. 
     50 In the light of these considerations, this Court is faced with the alternatives of sending the matter back for re-trial, or doing its best to determine the matter on the material it has. Both parties supported the latter course.  
     51 Doing the best I can, I think any error involved in not deducting 15 per cent for vicissitudes is balanced by the other considerations, so that no error is shown in the ultimate result. 
     52 It is common ground that interest on the judgment should accrue as from 19th April 2000, rather than 13th March 2000 as directed by the trial judge. This is a matter of so little moment that in my opinion the appellant should pay the costs of the appeal. 
     53 The orders that I propose are: 
      
      1. Order that interest on the judgment of $595,465.48 accrue as from 19th April 2000. 
       
      2. Otherwise, appeal dismissed with costs. 
       
     54 GREG JAMES, J: I have had the benefit of seeing the judgment which has been prepared by Hodgson, JA. in draft. I am grateful to his Honour for his setting out of the nature of the appeal and the circumstances which give rise to it. I respectfully adopt what his Honour says in that regard. 
     55 I have also had the benefit of seeing the draft judgment of Powell, JA. I share his views that there are features of the learned trial judge's assessment of the damages which, at first blush, give rise to disquiet. However, there is more to be said. 
     56 The trial judge refers to the assessment of past economic loss in Australia ""in round figures at $6,000"". Although Powell, JA. is of the view that the evidence to which he refers provided a very flimsy basis for that assessment, the trial judge's remark that that sum ""(had) not been mathematically disputed"" is supported in that that figure does not appear to be the subject of any dispute at trial and was not challenged on appeal. Indeed by letter of 18 April 2000, annexure B to the affidavit of Kerry Chambers sworn 28 May 2001, the appellants expressly took no objection to the figure shown for past economic loss (Australian season) as set out in the table of such matters in the letter as $6,000. 
     57 I note that the weekly figure of $138 to which Powell, JA. refers at paragraph 9(a) of his judgment dealing with future economic loss in Australia and which is the subject of the learned District Court judge's remark ""there (was) a claim for continuing economic loss of $138 for 15 weeks each year"" which is treated by Powell, JA. as unsupported, was also not challenged on appeal. 
     58 I do not consider in those circumstances there is any error in these respects. 
     59 Before us the challenge to the assessment of damages was concerned in particular with the loss of earnings in Australia and in America. As to the latter, issues were raised as to the extent of the liability in the United States for taxation, the expectation for gratuities in the United States and, thus, the past and future economic loss in the United States. As far as the assessment of damages for loss of earnings in Australia, there were raised the questions of the proper application of a deduction for vicissitudes and the appropriate multiplier considering the expected working life. 
     60 Before us, error was submitted to have been shown in a failure to deduct certain expenses from the USA earnings. I share the view of Hodgson, JA. that it would not be appropriate to treat rent and food costs as expenses incurred in earning the USA income where it is not shown or suggested they were in excess of ordinary living expenses, particularly in the absence of some evidence that they should be treated as expenses by reason of USA legislation. I note that airfares and accommodation were apparently allowed as deductions in the USA. I share Hodgson, JA.'s conclusion that the figure adopted for expenses was not shown to be inappropriate. 
     61 Although there are at least infelicities of expression, it does not seem to me that the figure allowed as representing the USA earnings A$304 per week was unreasonable if one takes the approach of Hodgson, JA., which to me provides a valid basis of support for that conclusion, although I share the views of Powell and Hodgson, JJA. that the acceptance of that figure does not seem to have been adequately explained by the trial judge. 
     62 The learned trial judge did not make a finding in express terms that the respondent would have continued as a ski instructor until 65 or 70 years, although there was, apparently, unchallenged evidence that a ski instructor had recently celebrated his 70th birthday. The trial judge's choice of the multiplier which he adopted for the purpose of ascertaining future economic loss, as Hodgson, JA. points out, might have been chosen as appropriate to a termination of ski instructing activity at 65 years or as allowing for some of the contingencies for which the customary 15% allowance for vicissitudes makes provision. 
     63 I agree with Powell and Hodgson, JJA. that his Honour erred in failing to make an explicit finding in respect of these matters and that that error affects the way in which he went about calculating economic loss in both Australia and the United States. 
     64 I have come to the conclusion, however, that I share the view of Hodgson, JA. that these errors do not necessitate that the appeal should be allowed. I do not share the view that his Honour's judgment was, as expressed by Powell, JA., to be so ""fundamentally flawed"" that it was not possible for the court to avoid the matter being remitted for a new trial as to damages. 
     65 Both parties supported this court determining the matter as best it could on the evidence before it on the analysis of Hodgson, JA. The errors exposed on the appeal are essentially errors of reasoning and procedure in the sense of the lack of expression of reasons which might have supported the conclusion challenged. 
     66 I accept the view of Hodgson, JA. that the errors are adequately enough balanced by the other considerations to which he refers so that the damages as awarded by the trial judge on our appreciation of the evidence cannot be said to be in error in the ultimate result. 
     67 I therefore agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson, JA. and as I have set out with his reasons.

     IN THE COURT OF  CRIMINAL APPEAL 60578/00 MASON P HEYDON JA WOOD CJ at CL  Wednesday, 18 October 2000 
     
      
     REGINA v NORMAN LEE JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1    HEYDON JA: This is an application pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal against an order made by Woods ADCJ on 18 August 2000 having the effect of relieving the recipient of a subpoena issued by the defendant in criminal proceedings from complying with it. 2    The subpoena was addressed to ""The Proper Officer/Secretary"" of ""Mission Australia"". It ordered production of the following documents: 
     
      
       
        
        ""All records, notes, reports and documents including but not limited to counselling notes or reports with respect to (the complainant), date of birth: 20 July 1979."" 
        
       
      
    3    The subpoena was issued in proceedings in which the accused was charged, on 12 November 1999, with five counts of indecent assault on a person under the age of sixteen years, namely, the complainant, by a person in authority. The offences charged are alleged to have taken place at various times in 1989-1990, when the complainant was a primary school pupil of the defendant's. The charges followed a statement to the police made by the complainant on 24 July 1999. 4    The procedural history is that the subpoena was returnable on 11 August 2000. On that day Mission Australia produced seventy-three pages of documents. The presiding judge, Sidis DCJ, was handed a letter by the Crown which the complainant had sent to the Crown. In that letter the complainant claimed that the documents in question contained ""protected confidences"" and said that she did not consent to their production. Sidis DCJ refused an application for access and decided that the complainant should be heard in respect of her claim.5    On 14 August 2000 the complainant attended without legal representation before the primary judge but said she would have it on 16 August 2000. On 16 August the matter was argued.6    The reasoning of the primary judge can be summarised as follows:  
     
      
      (a) the material caught by the subpoena comprised seventy-three pages, being copy handwritten notes of telephone and face-to-face communications between the complainant and officers of Mission Australia; 
       
      (b) the officers of Mission Australia were ""counsellors"" and were persons falling within paragraph (a) of the definition of ""counselling communication"" in that they were ""counselling, giving therapy to or treating the [complainant] for [an] emotional or psychological condition"" within the meaning of these words in s 148(4)(a) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986; 
       
      (c) therefore the documents were ""counselling communications""; 
      
     (d) therefore, since they were counselling communications made by or to an alleged victim of a sexual assault offence, they were ""protected confidences"": s 148(1); 
     
      
      (e) therefore Mission Australia, being a person who objected to production of the documents recording protected confidences, could not be required by subpoena to produce the documents unless the exceptions set out in s 150(1) applied; 
      
     (f) those exceptions did not apply, first, because the documents lacked ""substantial probative value"" (s 150(1)(b)(i)) and, secondly, because the public interest in preserving confidentiality was not substantially outweighed by the public interest in allowing inspection; (g) accordingly, Mission Australia was not obliged to produce the documents for inspection.7    On 1 September 2000 the defendant brought this application for leave to appeal against the primary judge's order and argument took place today. In view of the fact that the defendant's trial is fixed to commence on 23 October 2000, these reasons for judgment are delivered ex tempore. 
     
      
       
      Scope of the application 
      
    8    The defendant takes two points.9    The first point is that the primary judge erred in concluding that the documents caught by the subpoena recorded protected confidences. 10    The second point is that the primary judge erred in concluding that the documents did not have substantial probative value. 
     
      
       
       
      An initial difficulty 
       
      
    11    It seems that the primary judge had nothing before him apart from the subpoena and the documents which the subpoena caught. Neither the Crown nor the defendant had access to those documents and the solicitor appearing for the complainant and the complainant had access to them only briefly. Counsel for the defendant did, in the argument before the primary judge, quote from the complainant's statement to the police on 24 July 1999, but no evidence was formally tendered.12    The reasons for judgment of the primary judge indicate that in part his conclusions were based on his perusal of the documents. He was entitled to inspect them: s 156 of the Act. Thus he described them as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The material is 73 pages of copies of handwritten notes of private phone and face communications of Ms Wheeler with officers of Mission Australia with comments from those officers relating to those communications covering various dates during the period from 20-6-97 to 18-4-2000."" 
        
       
      
     He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Here we have notes of phone conversations and face-to-face meetings of the confider with persons who were in a position of taking confidences, helping the confider with her day-to-day life, providing counselling and therapy and generally being a sounding board for day-to-day problems."" 
        
       
      
    13    His conclusion that the Mission Australia officers were within the concluding words of s 148(4)(a) appears to rest on a reading of that material. So does his conclusion that the documents were not of substantial probative value.14    Plainly, the primary judge could not have proceeded as he did, given the lack of evidence before him, without inspecting the documents. This Court has had to adopt the same course. It is unsatisfactory but inevitable that the Court lacks full assistance from counsel for the defendant in these circumstances. Before this Court, however, an affidavit of Carolyn Lisa Bradley dated 12 October 2000 was read. Apart from setting out matters of procedural history, it annexes the statement of the complainant to the police dated 24 July 1999. 15    The relevant provisions in Pt 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which confer a sexual assault communications privilege, are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""148

          counselling communication means a communication 
          
         
        
       
       
       (a) made in confidence by a person (the counselled person) to another person (the counsellor) in the course of a relationship in which the counsellor is counselling, giving therapy to or treating the counselled person for any emotional or psychological condition, or  
       
       
       (b) made in confident to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that relationship, or 
       
       
       (c) made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or  
       
       
       (d) made in confidence by or to the counsellor by another counsellor or by a person who is or had counselled or otherwise treated the counselled person for any emotional or psychological condition of the person.

       (a) the document is first produced for inspection by the court for the purposes of ruling on the objection, and 
       
       
       (b) the court is satisfied (whether on inspection of the document or at some later stage in the proceedings) that: 
       
       
       (i) the contents of the document will, either by themselves or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduce by the party seeking production of the document, have substantial probative value, and  
       
       
       (ii) other evidence of the protected confidence or the contents of the document is not available, and 
       
       
       (iii) the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in allowing inspection of the document.  
       
       
       (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1)(b)(iii), the court must take into account the likelihood, and the nature or extent, of harm that would be caused to the principal protected confider if the document is produced for inspection."" 
       
       
      
    16    On the first issue, namely, whether the persons to whom the complainant was speaking were ""counsellors"", the relevant passages in the primary judge's reasons for judgment on this issue, apart from those quoted above, are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""While I have been able to peruse the material in order to make my determination I cannot give examples here of the type of material and references that it contains s that in itself could be a breach of what are private conversations however innocuous, as even the daily round of life may be a matter of personal comments not meant for the public arena.  
        
       
       
        
        Whilst the current legislation was not in existence at the time I note the references in the case of  
        R v Young 
         (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 in the judgment of James J to the fact that there is an underlying concern that in a counselling relationship built on confidentiality, privacy and trust, which enables a victim to explore major issues concerning her sense of safety, privacy and self-esteem, the knowledge that details of a victim's conversations with her therapist may be used against her in subsequent criminal proceedings can inhibit the counselling process and undermine its efficacy. His Honour also referred to the argument that allowing an accused and defence counsel to have access to all the victim's thoughts, feelings, insecurities and the recounting of painful past experiences as revealed in counselling sessions may exacerbate this trauma. 
        
       
       
        
        I feel that the above are relevant in this context before me now in applying the legislation and considering the objection to the production of the Mission Australia material before me now. 
        
       
       
        
        It could also be a matter for argument as to the qualifications or status of the persons to whom the confidences are given. The legislation clearly does not limit the qualifications of the person confided to such as to a medical or suchlike practitioner or even a certified counsellor or social worker. The provision uses the words 'to another person .. in the course of a relationship in which the counsellor is counselling, giving therapy to or treating the counselled person for any emotional or psychological condition'. I am satisfied that this description is sufficient to cover the officers of Mission Australia who were communicating with Ms Wheeler in these notes. 
        
       
       
        
        I consider that they are clearly private confidences given to persons who are giving counsel and therapy in the course of a relationship of counselling for emotional or psychological conditions."" 
        
       
      
    17    There are difficulties in these passages. First, if the material contained ""private conversations"" which were ""innocuous"" taking place as ""part of the daily round of life"", they might well not be communications made in the course of a relationship in which the counselled person was being counselled, receiving therapy or receiving treatment for an emotional or psychological condition. 18    Secondly, the reference to James J's judgment is a reference to a quotation he made (46 NSWLR 681 at 736 [297]) from the Attorney General's Second Reading Speech in introducing the Evidence Amendment (Confidential Communications) Bill on 22 October 1997. That Bill, when enacted, inserted Pt 3.10 Div 1B into the Evidence Act. That legislation excluded evidence of ""protected confidences"". ""Protected confidence"" was defined as meaning a protected counselling communication made by a person against whom the sexual assault offence had been or had been alleged to have been committed. ""Protected counselling communication"" was defined as meaning a communication made by a person in confidence to another person (""the counsellor"") in the course of a relationship in which the counsellor was treating the person for any emotional or psychological condition suffered by the person. The Attorney General's words were not directed to the meaning of ""treating"" or ""emotional or psychological condition"" in the definition of ""protected counselling communication"". They throw even less light on s 148(4)(a) in the instant legislation. 19    The first argument propounded on behalf of the defendant was that the primary judge should not have upheld the claim which the complainant made in the absence of proof by evidence tendered in open court of the conditions set out in s 148(4)(a). I would reject that argument. While counsel for the defendant is correct in saying that to claim the privilege without evidence led in open court is unsatisfactory, the fact is that the primary judge was entitled to look at the documents and in an appropriate case the documents subpoenaed by themselves could establish the pre-conditions for the operation of s 148, at least where, as here, their authenticity was accepted.20    The second argument propounded on behalf of the defendant was as follows. It was submitted that the legislation requires that there be a diagnosis, a client relationship, and a communication for the purpose of providing treatment or therapy. It was submitted that there must be a nexus between the diagnosis, the treatment and the therapy on the one hand and the relationship on the other. A person who is merely a sounding board or is merely offering a sympathetic ear is not enough. If it were enough, every person to whom a sexual complaint is made would fall within the section.21    The solicitor appearing for the complainant answered that argument in the following way. He contended that the subpoenaed material spoke for itself, it was lengthy, it was said to be deep and it was said to go into the complainant's life and background to a substantial degree. The submission rejected the proposition that there needs to be a diagnosis, it was sufficient that there be observable an emotional problem which might well be distinct from a medical problem. The submission concentrated in particular on the word ""counselling"" which, it was submitted, should be broadly defined as an act or a series of items of conduct designed to help someone through a crisis. 22    A third controversy was raised before this Court between the parties. It was raised by the solicitor appearing for the complainant. He submitted that even if this Court concluded that the privilege did not exist or the conditions for its claim had not been made out, inspection should be refused on the ground that the material lacked substantial probative value. This was not argued below and in my opinion the argument should not be entertained in this Court. Related to it was a contention that if the Court concluded that the privilege had not been made out, the matter should be remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which inspection of the material should be permitted. I would reject that for the same reason, namely, that the contention, if to be made at all, should have been made before the primary judge.23    Turning then to the difference between the defendant and the complainant in relation to the second argument propounded by the defendant, it seems to me that the meaning of ""counselling, giving therapy to or treating the counselled person for any emotional or psychological condition"" must depend significantly on the meaning of ""any emotional or psychological condition"". An emotional condition is a state of consciousness turning on emotions like pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, surprise, hope, joy, sorrow, fear or hate (as distinct from cognitive and volitional states of consciousness) which reveals or reflects some defect or illness or disease or abnormality. Similarly, a psychological condition refers to a particular condition of health - a state of health which is poor or abnormal or diseased or otherwise defective from the emotional or psychological point of view. Psychology is the science of mind and of mental states and processes; a psychological condition is a state of mind in which there is some defect or illness or disease or abnormality in the victim's mental states and processes. Therapy is the curative medical or psychiatric treatment of diseases, disorders and defects and is administered by a therapist, being a person trained to give therapy by physical, psychological or psychiatric methods. To treat an emotional or psychological condition is to deal with it by examination, diagnosis, application of remedies, care and otherwise in order to relieve or cure it. While ""counselling"" can have quite wide meanings, and the argument propounded on behalf of the complainant appealed to them, in this context the word means advising with a view to relieving or curing an emotional or psychological condition from which the counselled person is suffering. In this sense a counsellor must possess some substantial skill acquired by training or experience. Accordingly, the expression ""counselling, giving therapy to or treating the counselled person for any emotional or psychological condition"" refers to the provision of expert advice and procedures by persons skilled, by training or experience, in the treatment of mental or emotional disease or trouble. The expression does not include persons who merely seek to assist others suffering from an emotional or psychological condition. A confidante or friend or relative does not, by reason of those circumstances alone, fall within s 148(4)(a). 24    The argument for the complainant involved reading the words ""counselling"" and ""emotional condition"" very broadly. While in some contexts those words can be so read, in the present context I do not think they bear a sufficiently wide meaning for the complainant's purposes.25    The evidence establishes no more than the following. After leaving home on 20 June 1997, the complainant has been residing in premises supplied by Mission Australia as part of what is known as a “Sydney City Mission Supported Living Program"", sometimes called ""SLP"", which is a ""program that provides accommodation for persons who cannot live at home or have nowhere to stay"" (complainant's 24 July 1999 statement to the police, paragraphs 3 and 4). The complainant has had a social worker allocated to her. She ""is a youth support worker who is there for support for the kids in the program if required (she does not actually provide counselling as such, but she can assist in obtaining the services of qualified counsellors if required)"" (complainant's 24 July 1999 statement, paragraph 6). That social worker appears to be the author of many of the notes produced on subpoena. Those notes reveal a constant pattern from June 1997 to April 2000 of the social worker and other persons discussing the complainant's problems and, in the light of what she said, making suggestions for their solution. When medical problems arose, they suggested that she see doctors of various kinds for various purposes. When issues of reconciliation between her and her family arose, they proposed and arranged for family counselling at Family Therapy Clinics. When the question of whether the complainant should receive individual counselling arose, there was discussion about how the Mission Australia officers would arrange for it to take place. There were also discussions about her visits to anxiety clinics conducted by mental health teams. 26    The point is that even assuming that the relevant communications were made in confidence (which is questionable) and even assuming that the complainant was suffering from ""any emotional or psychological condition"", it was not the persons to whom she spoke at Mission Australia who were giving her counselling, therapy or treatment, but other persons. The officers at Mission Australia merely arranged for those other persons to give the counselling, the therapy or the treatment, or listened to the complainant's accounts of her visits to those other persons. 27    The relationship between the complainant and the persons at Mission Australia to whom she spoke was that they were providing her with accommodation - she could not live at home and she could not afford other accommodation. They looked after her in a general way, but not in a way which fell within s 148(4)(a).28    It is not necessary in the present case to consider the extent to which the ""counsellor"" must be relevantly trained or experienced. In Jaffee v Redmond 518 US 1 (1996), the Supreme Court of the United States recognised a privilege between therapist and patient. The majority (Stevens J, with whom O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsberg and Breyer JJ agreed) said at 15-17 that the privilege applied to confidential communications made to licensed psychiatrists and psychologists. They also said that it applied to communications to licensed social workers - but only ""in the course of psychotherapy"". Social workers may well provide mental health treatment. But in my judgment the social worker or workers involved here did not provide treatment to the complainant: rather, they made arrangements for others to do so, or listened to the complainant's accounts of that treatment. 29    Accordingly, in my judgment, the complainant has not discharged the burden which rests on her of demonstrating that the relevant documents contain ""protected confidences"".30    In due course I will propose that inspection be ordered. It is important to note that this has no implication for what use may be made of the material at the trial. Whether the material is admissible in evidence at the trial will be a matter for the trial judge. What use can be made of it in cross-examination will also be a matter for the trial judge. It would be wrong for defence counsel to use the material to harass or humiliate the complainant, though I stress that I am not making any suggestion that Mr McClintock intends to do any such thing or would do any such thing. The point is simply that no case has been made out to prevent inspection of the material. What happens at a later stage will depend on different criteria. 
     
      
       
      Second issue: application of s 150 
        
      
    31    In view of the conclusion arrived at on the first issue, the second issue does not arise. In relation to this issue, it is the defendant who bears the burden of proving the matters set out in s 150(1), particularly those described in s 150(1)(b). It is not necessary to say anything more than that the primary judge's conclusion that the contents of the document lacked ""substantial probative value"" is questionable. However, it has not been demonstrated that s 150(1)(b)(ii) was satisfied. Nor does the defendant complain of the primary judge's finding that preservation of confidentiality was in the public interest. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
      
    32    I propose the following orders:  1. That the application for leave to appeal be granted. 2. That the appeal be allowed.  3. That the declaration and order of Woods ADCJ be set aside. 4. That Mission Australia be ordered to produce the documents to the Court. 5. That leave be granted to the parties to inspect the documents when produced on subpoena by Mission Australia.  6. I would direct the defendant to communicate speedily with Mission Australia so that they can be informed of their obligations and can comply with them in sufficient time for proper preparation of the trial.33    MASON P: I agree.34    WOOD CJ at CL: I also agree. McCLINTOCK: Could I just clarify, when the reference is made to the production to the Court, is that this Court? HEYDON JA: No, I think to the District Court. Is this the position, that the documents, the originals of them, are actually in the hands of Mission Australia? McCLINTOCK: That is as I understand the position. HEYDON JA: Evidently no one in this room has even photocopies of the documents except the Bench. McCLINTOCK: That again is as I understand the position. HEYDON JA: Do you think there will be any difficulty in getting Mission Australia to produce the documents to the Court tomorrow? McCLINTOCK: I do not know that I will need the originals. So long as photocopies are produced, we would be asking for access to the documents in this Court. HEYDON JA: Who sent to the Court yesterday the photocopies? McCLINTOCK: Mission Australia. We contacted Mission Australia and asked them to produce the documents. HEYDON JA: The General Manager, New South Wales, sent a letter to the Registry, Court of Criminal Appeal dated 17 October which says, ""As per the request of Campbelltown Court, copy letter attached, please find enclosed the above documents.""  WOOD CJ at CL: The original subpoena has not been set aside. McCLINTOCK: As I understand his Honour Acting Judge Woods, it was set aside.  HEYDON JA: Was it formally set aside? McCLINTOCK: I think he ordered the return of the documents to Mission Australia.  MASON P: He did not set it aside, he just upheld a privilege in relation to production.  HEYDON JA: He said, ""Mission Australia is not required to produce these documents for inspection by any party."" WOOD CJ at CL: They are, on one view, required to produce them. Another answer is if you seek short leave to issue another subpoena - but I don't think we can do that so far as the District Court is concerned. McCLINTOCK: We will contact the District Court. WOOD CJ at CL: You may find there is no problem. I think the Court will also grant you leave to serve it by fax or some other way.  MASON P: I have not marked my copy of the documents. Accordingly, I think it would be in order if I made it available to the Crown Prosecutor and, under his supervision, access and/or copying can take place on a condition that you inform the trial judge that this is what has happened.  McCLINTOCK: I will do that.  WOOD CJ at CL: It probably also should be subject to at least an undertaking the distribution or access will be confined to those who are assisting the parties, that is, the legal representatives. McCLINTOCK: We can make that undertaking generally. MASON P: My copy of the document will be produced now to the Crown on that condition and subject to that undertaking, which is noted, and the Court makes the orders proposed by Heydon JA in his reasons.  BOWE: Does that mean the defendant cannot see the documents? MASON P: That seems to be the condition which has been accepted, access is limited to legal representatives.  HEYDON JA: You do not want the defendant to see the documents? BOWE: Yes. HEYDON JA: Yes, that is covered by the limited terms of the undertaking given by Mr McClintock. BOWE: That is what I understood. I just wanted it clarified.  WOOD CJ at CL: There seems to be no reason for him to personally see them. That does not mean they cannot be used for cross-examination.  McCLINTOCK: Nor their contents discussed. If there are matters that arise that I need instructions in respect of, I need to discuss those. The undertaking would be limited to him perusing the actual documents themselves. MASON P: Speaking for myself, and I assume for the Court, it would be subject to whatever orders the trial judge may think fit to make in the course of the trial.

     REGINA v CHRISTOPHER ANDREW ROBINSON 
      
       
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
     
    1    HIS HONOUR: An application has been made on behalf of the offender that I should not make an order under s 11(4B) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. The occasion for making such an order arises only in the event that s 11(1) applies to prohibit publication or broadcast of the offender's name. Section 11 (1) reads -  
     
      
       
       ""The name of any child- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) who appears as a witness before a court in any criminal proceedings; 
        
       (b) to whom any criminal proceedings relate; or 
        
       (c) who is mentioned or otherwise involved in any criminal proceedings, shall not be published or broadcast, whether before or after the proceedings are disposed of."" 
       
      
    2    It appears to me that it does not apply to an offender, though a child at the time of the crime, who is not a child when any criminal proceedings are on foot or, at least, when they commenced. However, even if s 11 applied, this is a case in which I would authorise the publication or broadcasting of the offender's name. The public interest in the publicity of proceedings is a profoundly important one, even though it permits the hysterical and melodramatic publication of the circumstances of a crime. 
    3    There are at least two bases for this interest. The first is that it has always been a function of punishment that a crime is denounced. That denunciation is significantly incomplete if the person to whom it is directed remains anonymous. The second important element is that proceedings should take place in public unless there is an overwhelming countervailing consideration. It is part of that public character that requires, to my mind, the authorisation of the publication or broadcasting of the name of an offender, even when a child, where the crime renders that appropriate. 
    4    Here the offender is no longer a child and is over the age of twenty, though he has not yet reached the age of twenty-one. Consequently the considerations to which Mr Molomby has rightly referred concerning the difficulties this offender will face in prison will not, in my opinion, be ameliorated by any non-publication order. The fact of the matter is that it is inevitable that his identity with this crime will become known. Furthermore, those problems in the gaol system to which Mr Molomby made implicit reference do not, in a case of this kind, significantly arise out of the crime which has been committed but out of other matters to which it is unnecessary that I should refer. 
    5    Accordingly, on the assumption that I have power under section 11(4B) to authorise publication or broadcasting of the offender's name, I would exercise it in this case and I have no doubt that the making of such an order is in the interests of justice and that the prejudice to the offender does not out-weigh those interests. However, as I have already said, such an authorisation is unnecessary since I take the view that s 11 does not apply.

2737661,REGINA v. ELPHICK [2000] NSWSC 977,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender has pleaded guilty to the murder of his partner.
	
	
	The facts may be stated in short compass. They had been involved in a domestic relationship for over two years. She was a drug addict. He was a bricklayer. They had a relationship which the psychiatric reports provided to me described, and which I accept, was a relationship of co-dependency.
	
	
	It was a highly volatile relationship. She was dependent upon him for support, for money, for drugs. He was dependent upon her, a woman he described as ""beautiful"" and whom he clearly loved. She took money from him. He provided money to her. She resorted to prostitution. It was a relationship fraught with volatile exchanges.
	
	
	He had tried, by resort to hospitalisation, rehabilitation and medical practitioners, to wean her from the drugs she refused to give up.
	
	
	She had followed him to work, and when they had attempted to separate had resumed the relationship; she had come to his premises; she had taken goods of his and sold or pawned them. He says she had stolen money from him, from his pockets, destroyed his car in an accident. The relationship also appears to have been characterised by a degree of physical violence.
	
	
	He sought to take her to Albury, from which country area he had originally come, to see his family at Christmas. He provided her with the money and the ticket but she did not come. On his return he, having left Albury, believing something awful had happened to her, went to King Cross where he met up with her again. He became agitated on learning that she had continued to use illicit drugs and work as a prostitute.
	
	
	He had resorted to alcohol during the relationship and he had attempted to drink himself insensible.
	
	
	On this occasion he checked his motor bike, which he had garaged some considerable distance away from where they lived, returned to their home, drank some small quantity of alcohol, obtained a boning knife and went looking for her.
	
	
	The events that I just described in such terse manner are set forth in very great detail in the recorded interview he provided to the police immediately after the killing by him of the deceased.
	
	
	In a paroxysm of frustration and rage he stabbed her to death in the presence of other persons while she was apologising to him and asking him not to do it. He apparently was concerned at that point to cut her throat having determined prior to catching up with her to do exactly that.
	
	
	His reasoning was disordered and confused at the time. He had taken the knife, I find, thinking he would use it to kill her, contemplating possible self-harm and contemplating some acting out display followed by his own running away, all in the context of what he described as a life of hell or misery, he was suffering because of his association with her and her association with drugs and prostitution.
	
	
	He described his motive for the killing as arising from his very great frustration and anger at his inability to have her conform to the course he wished her to take with her life. He said he was scared and still does not know why he did it.
	
	
	The objective evidence certainly is that a major motivating factor in why he did it was because she did not accord with what he wanted her to be like.
	
	
	In the Regina v. Cheung (CCA, unreported 11 December 1995), Allen, J. added a passage to the remarks made by the other judges in the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is apposite to this case. He said:-
	


""There are those within the community whose approach to the relationship between a man and a woman is that if the man has what might be called a grand passion for the woman, which completely overwhelms him, there is somehow a degree of respectability in him giving vent to that grand passion by seeking to control the life of the woman against her will - indeed, even in an extreme case, taking her life if he believes that is what ought to be done.

There is no respectability in that at all. It is arrogance. I do accept that having such a grand passion, if it can be so called, can diminish, for sentencing, the importance of the element of personal deterrence. But it certainly does not diminish the importance of the element of general deterrence. Indeed, the very misconception that such a grand passion affords a degree of respectability to what otherwise is abhorrent makes it all the more important that, for the purpose of general deterrence, it be made perfectly clear that such an approach will not be tolerated in this civilised society.""


	
	After the events, the offender expressed a view to the police he had achieved his purpose. He was satisfied with what he had done and on a number of occasions said words to the effect that:-
	


""I have solved my problem. I am not ashamed of what I have done"".


	
	Before me he has given evidence. He has emphasised what he had done to get her off drugs. He has emphasised what he regarded as his responsibility to provide what she should do in her life. His evidence impressed me as being entirely egocentric. It did not reflect contrition in the sense of him being sorry for what he did to her. It did reflect contrition in the sense that he was sorry he had broken the law, but he obviously feels he was driven to take that course so as to relieve himself of what he felt was the hell of associating with her and her drug problem.
	
	
	The intensity of his feelings is not to be understated. He said, ""I have killed the woman I love"". He plainly did, in an egocentric way, love her, going to the extent of having his back tattooed with a large sign describing him as ""The property of K. A. Church"", the deceased, which sign he later had amended, showing the depth of his feeling, to provide ""If found return dead"". She too had been tattooed to evidence her association with him.
	
	
	Objectively, this was an appalling and abominable crime. This is a crime of vicious violence arising out of what I have described as a paroxysm of rage. It is the deliberate taking, albeit while under the influence of emotion and confused thought, of the life of another human being.
	
	
	The courts have always set their face against those who claim some higher law or higher emotional desire compels them to kill others in order to impose their will.
	
	
	Subjectively, he has some prior record but has obviously been an obsessively conscientious workman of considerable diligence.
	
	
	His antecedents show minor offences of, in particular, dishonesty and in relation to motor vehicles. There are matters of firearms which appear not inconsistent with those that might have been committed by many in country areas at that time.
	
	
	There have been tendered two psychiatric reports, the first being the assessment of Dr. Susan Hayes, the second that of Dr. Olav Nielssen. Those reports indicate the offender suffers from some deficits and they indicate also that he had had considerable problems with alcohol as he has himself referred to in his record of interview and in his evidence before me. They point out that on the basis of a future abstinence from alcohol this is a man whom, bearing in mind previous stable relationships and previous stable employment, with the benefit of counselling has some hope for rehabilitation. That accords well with his crime having occurred in the context of his focus on one particular woman. I find no basis to conclude that the offender might more generally be dangerous.
	
	
	The report from the Manager of Industries, Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, Exhibit 4, confirms his industry and enthusiasm at his work tasks in gaol.
	
	
	He has been in custody since his arrest on 29 December 1999. He pleaded guilty when arraigned to the alternative charge of manslaughter pending investigation by his legal advisers of whether any mental state defence should properly be asserted. The psychiatric reports to which I have referred make it clear there was an entirely reasonable basis to investigate that very matter.
	
	
	Following the investigation of that matter, he pleaded guilty to murder as charged.
	
	
	When he gave his interview to the Police he admitted fully the necessary intellectual states and what he had done. Having regard to what was said by the Chief Justice in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 there seems no reason he should not be accorded the full benefit of an early plea, and that having regard to the utilitarian basis for providing a discount for early plea, as expressed in that case, he should receive the full benefit of the discount referred to in that case, ie., 25%. However, having regard to what I have earlier said concerning the nature of his contrition, it is not possible properly to accord him a discount such that full contrition might have attracted.
	
	
	On examination of a number of cases that might provide guidance on a range of sentence particular, reference has been made to the Regina v. Nixon (CCA, unreported 31 October 1995) and to the Cheung (supra). In Nixon (supra), in the judgment of Badgery-Parker, J., some examination was made of a number of cases to consider any relevant tariff, as it was there referred to, for what is there termed ""relationship murders"" and a bench mark was noted in the Regina v. MacDonald (CCA unreported 18 August 1994). The examination of those relationship cases show an average length minimum term of 13.94 years with an average length additional term of 5.33 years.
	
	
	The court there also looked particularly at the purpose of sentencing and the various criteria in regard to minimum and additional terms as they had existed under the Sentencing Acts by reference to what the High Court said in the Queen v. Buckley (1990) 169 CLR 425. These criteria are applicable also to sentencing under the present regime, notwithstanding the differences and the requirement of the present legislation that I impose a total sentence which includes a non-parole period.
	
	
	Having regard to the discounts to which I have referred and all the circumstances, I am of the view that an appropriate total sentence of 15 years to date from the date of arrest, 29 December 1999 with a non-parole period of 12 years to date from that day should be imposed.
	
	
	Mr. Elphick, would you please rise.
	
	
	Mr. Elphick, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 15 years to date from 29 December 1999. The term of that sentence is to include a non-parole period of 12 years to expire on 28 December 2011. The earliest date at which you will be eligible for release is 28 December 2011.

      THE APPLICATION OF RAYMOND GRANT PEDRANA 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The applicant, Raymond Grant Pedrana, stood trial before the District Court at Penrith on 21 May 1990 charged that on 12 May 1988 at Bharruk, armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, did rob Glenda Norris and Edward Pracey of a television receiver, a cassette recorder and the sum of $100. He was found guilty of that crime and his Honour Judge Urquhart, QC. imposed a sentence of penal servitude for a minimum term of five years and an additional term of one year and eight months. 
    2   As a consequence of other sentences, the applicant is not eligible for parole until 8 January 2001. 
    3   The applicant appealed his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal. He now seeks a reference of his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal or an enquiry into it under the provisions of Part 13 A of the Crimes Act 1900. 
    4   At trial, in summary, it was the Crown case that the applicant and other male person, both armed with flick knives and wearing black balaclavas, entered the home of the victims where they then were with a friend. The female victim was in the shower. The male victim and his male friend were assaulted and a wallet demanded. One of the offenders, allegedly the appellant, dressed in a white padded sloppy joe, went to the bathroom and put a knife to the throat of the female victim, hit her, threatened her children and demanded money from her. She gave that person money. 
    5   It was alleged that the co-offender, after the appellant had left, also hit her, demanded money, made threats towards her children and sexually assaulted her by placing his fingers inside her vagina whilst holding a knife to her throat. 
    6   She was taken to the loungeroom and made to lie on the floor with the male victim and a friend. Money was removed from a money tin, a portable television and a video cassette recorder were taken, together with the wallet that had been obtained from the male victim and the money obtained from the female victim. 
    7   She gave evidence that after the robbery she had observed a tin of coins was missing, though it was observed by Abadee, J. in the Court of Criminal Appeal, to whose judgment I am indebted for this short summary, that there was some confusion in relation to the evidence concerning money tins as there was reference to two tins. But there was evidence from the female victim that she had thought both tins had been in her bedroom on the night of the robbery. She also gave evidence that after the robbery, the appellant had visited her at her home. When he had done so, he had asserted he was not the one who robbed her. 
    8   The female victim gave conflicting evidence on the issue of whether the appellant had or had not been to her home before the robbery, however, both versions were put to the jury. 
    9   The evidence tendered against the appellant included evidence of the fingerprints of the appellant asserted to have been located on one of the money tins, that is a silver coffee tin which had been used to keep coins. 
    10   After about a fortnight, the appellant was arrested at a motel where he had been, so it was asserted, since two or three days after the alleged robbery. At Mt. Druitt Police Station he was questioned by Detectives Fluke and Mainstone and it was alleged that he had made an oral admission and subsequently provided a handwritten statement admitting his involvement. 
    11   The evidence at the trial of the obtaining of the fingerprint from the coffee tin was not challenged and indeed there was an admission at trial that the print on the tin was that of the applicant. 
    12   Although there was evidence of the applicant having a white sloppy joe, his sloppy joe was not identified as being consistent with the one worn by the assailant, which had a distinctive pattern. Abadee, J. remarked that the Crown case was not advanced by the evidence relating to the sloppy joe. The male victim gave evidence that the appellant had been to the premises on a number of occasions including a day or two before the robbery, but had not been into the female victim's bedroom. He too had been approached after the event by the appellant who had denied the robbery. 
    13   The defence case was made by an unsworn statement denying involvement and asserting an alibi. The applicant claimed that on 12 May 1990 he was in Queensland with his sister and her family. He denied making the admissions and asserted he had been assaulted by the police, causing him to write the handwritten note which was tendered in evidence. He asserted that what he had said in that note was untrue and that the fingerprints on the money tin arose from his prior visits to the premises. 
    14   His sister and father confirmed his alibi in evidence. But there was evidence from Detective Fluke that he had been in Queensland on 9 May and 11 May, when Detective Fluke asserted the applicant had told him that he was ""leaving for Sydney today to be in court tomorrow"" and would drive straight through. It was put to Detective Fluke in cross-examination that the conversation was a fabrication. 
    15   The evidence of Detective Fluke as to the applicant's admissions notably contained reference to a statement made by the applicant evidencing knowledge that the female victim had been sexually assaulted. Detective Fluke gave evidence the applicant said he would not sign the statement because he hadn't sexually assaulted anyone. Such a reason seems peculiar as Allen, J. noted on the appeal, since the statement did not contain any assertion that anybody had been sexually assaulted. The statement was in the shortest possible form containing almost no potentially verifiable detail. It refers to the taking of the television, video and a small piggy bank. It refers to having a knife and black ""bellaclava's"" (sic). In essence, the applicant at his trial denied that he made an admission by writing the statement claiming he only did so at the direction of the police. 
    16   Detective O'Connell gave evidence of the usual kind of the adoption of the statement by the applicant and his lack of complaint about the police interview. 
    17   On appeal, Allen, J., having regard to the High Court's decision in Regina v. McKinney & Judge (1990-91) 171 CLR 468 was of the view that more assistance might have been given to the jury on the issue between the applicant and the police concerning the oral admissions and the unsigned statement. His Honour was of the view that the matter came close to crossing the borderline of a successful ground of appeal. His Honour was of the view that the presence of the fingerprints was not incompatible with the innocent explanation and that there was evidence which was not inherently incredible which pointed to the innocence of the accused. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""This was a case in which, in my assessment, there was cause to be suspicious of the reliability of the police evidence as to what the accused said in relation to the confession and what they said to him and suspicious also of the reliability of the other remarkably convenient evidence of the police witness from Queensland as to what the accused told him about his intended trip to Sydney. The evidence tending to suggest positively that the accused is innocent was a material factor giving that cause for suspicion."" 
       
      
    18   His Honour speculated that a question that arose was whether the finding of the fingerprints led the investigating police to jump to the conclusion they had found the offender, a known criminal, ""and make them feel justified in 'stitching him up'"". 
    19   His Honour was of the view, however, that the trial judge's instructions to the jury were adequate in accordance with the law as it then stood and that the conviction should be allowed to stand in the light of the trial judge's appreciation of the atmosphere at trial. 
    20   Abadee, J. with whom Clarke, JA. agreed, was of the view that as the law stood at the time of the trial, the directions as given were sufficient. The appeal was dismissed. No fresh evidence ground concerning matters which might go to the credibility of the police or any of them was advanced, although an unsafe and unsatisfactory ground was advanced but dealt with in the light of the High Court's then recent decision in Chidiac & Asfour v. The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 432. 
    21   In the Crown evidence against the applicant on the issue of admissions, it is to be noted that Detectives Fluke and Mainstone arrested the applicant and both gave evidence of the asserted oral admissions. Detective Michael O'Connell, as I have said, referred to the applicant's oral adoption of the unsigned handwritten statement and his alleged disclaimer of any complaints. 
    22   Subsequently, that detective, in 1996, was sentenced on seven counts of giving false evidence before the Independent Commission Against Corruption and two counts of conspiracy to bribe, to a minimum term of nine months imprisonment and an additional term of 15 months. It was disclosed that the former detective had been selling confidential information to private enquiry agents for money in breach of his obligation as a police officer for a considerable period of time, pre-dating the events of the applicant's arrest. He had also subsequently lied to the ICAC concerning those matters. 
    23   It is common ground on this application that Detectives Fluke and Mainstone had been the subject of a number of serious allegations but after investigation no adverse finding had been recorded against them. 
    24   The nature of those allegations, however, is quite important. In relation to Detective Fluke, it has been confirmed that he has been subject to allegations for assault, fabrication of evidence, improper association, conspiracy, dealing in drugs, accepting bribes and wrongful arrest. Detective Mainstone has been alleged to have been involved in assault, conspiracy, dealing in drugs, accepting bribes, failing to take appropriate action and failing to follow correct procedures in giving evidence. 
    25   No other information is forthcoming as to the timing, detail or circumstances giving rise to these allegations or the extent of the investigation. The general nature of the allegations are plainly such as might well have founded cross-examination at the trial subject to those matters to which I have referred being sufficiently established. 
    26   Following the Royal Commission into Police Services in New South Wales, there had been a number of matters come before the court in which fresh evidence concerning corrupt activities of police has founded a successful appeal where allegations of, in particular, oral confessions have been challenged at trial, as they were here on the evidence, and are supported only on the evidence of officers whose credit might be impugned. 
    27   A line of jurisprudence exemplified by the decision of the court in The Queen v. Vastag (CCA, unreported 20 June 1997) which poses a test as to the admissibility of such evidence and the course the court should take in regard to it on an appeal has grown up: see The Queen v. Johns [1999] NSWCCA 206; The Queen v. Hasenkamp (CCA, unreported 24 February 1998). 
    28   Under s.474D of the Crimes Act 1900, the court may direct an enquiry or refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The test for reference of a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal is not the same as that which applies on the hearing of that appeal and which is set out in Vastag (supra) and Johns (supra). Section 474E(2) provides that a referral to the court may only be made ""if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"". The case law establishes the test for reference of the case or the directing of an enquiry. It is necessary merely that the new material raise ""a sense of disquiet"" or ""unease"" in allowing the conviction to stand: The application of Bernard Lewis Moore [2000] NSWSC 364. 
    29   If an enquiry is directed, on completion, the person conducting the enquiry must cause a report on the results of the enquiry to be sent to the Chief Justice in the case of an enquiry held on the direction of the Supreme Court. That person, under s.474H(2), may also refer the matter, together with a copy of the report, to the Court of Criminal Appeal:- 
     
      
       
       ""(a) for consideration of the question of whether the conviction should be quashed (in any case in which the prescribed person is of the opinion that there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the convicted person)."" 
       
      
    30   On such consideration the fresh or new evidence ascertained at such an enquiry may be considered applying the Vastag (supra) principles. An enquiry may be necessary to ascertain what substance or evidence there might be to which, on appeal, the Vastag principle might apply. 
    31   The submissions by the Crown Solicitor concede that if there were substance or evidence in support of the allegations, those matters might have been put to the police officers in cross-examination and that any evidence so obtained as a consequence would be likely to have substantial probative value. 
    32   If there is ""a sense of unease or disquiet"" in allowing the conviction to stand, one might expect an enquiry may be directed to see if there is evidence or substance to warrant the Court of Criminal Appeal acting.  
    33   It is submitted, however, that evidence of allegations which have been investigated and found not to be proved do not meet the requisite test. The Crown submissions contend the matter may only be dealt with on ""the material presently available"" for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is a sense of ""unease"" and that the material presently available does not, particularly in the light of the fingerprint evidence, have such significance as would warrant the Court of Criminal Appeal on the fresh evidence test acting on it. 
    34   I am, however, of the view that, having regard to the issues agitated at the trial, having regard to the issue having been submitted to the jury in the way in which it was, and having regard to the possibility that an enquiry will be able to ascertain the substance of and evidence for the allegations and what value they might be when considered on appeal, there is a doubt in the sense described in the case law to which I have referred as to the question of the applicant's guilt such that there should be an enquiry in this matter. 
    35   I therefore direct that an enquiry be conducted by a prescribed person into the conviction of the applicant.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL No. 60270 of 1998 
     CORAM: FITZGERALD, JA. 
     
      NEWMAN, J. 
      
      GREG JAMES, J. 
     FRIDAY 27 OCTOBER 2000 
     
     REGINA v. PETER ANDREW QUINN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   FITZGERALD, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
    2   NEWMAN, J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft form, the reasons and orders of Greg James, J. I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he proposes. 
    3   GREG JAMES, J: Peter Andrew Quinn appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal in respect of the sentence imposed upon him on a charge of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. He was tried in the District Court at Penrith before Acting Judge Cantrill. 
    4   His Honour sentenced the appellant to a minimum term of nine years penal servitude to commence on 14 May 1998 and an additional term of two years. The appellant had been admitted to bail prior to conviction. 
    5   The appellant was represented at the trial but before us appeared for himself on the appeal although counsel appeared for him on his application for leave to appeal. 
    6   In summary, the case alleged against the appellant was that he had followed a 15 year old girl into a ladies' toilet on the train platform at Lithgow, threatened her and digitally penetrated her vagina. She had fled the toilet and by her actions identified him as he left the scene to passengers and railway personnel. He had denied the offence to police and asserted a mistaken identification. 
    7   The appeal had been listed some time ago but was stood out of the list since a question arose as to the factual foundation of a submission put on appeal that the conviction should be overturned on a fresh evidence basis. It is contended that the complainant had, subsequent to the trial, written to the appellant a letter which it was claimed should be admitted as fresh evidence and would cast an adverse light upon her assertions against him at trial. The appellant contends the letter and telephone calls he asserts she made to him at the gaol show the complainant lied at trial, wrongly accusing him and did so, probably to get victim's compensation. 
    8   The proceedings were stood out of the list to permit an investigation of those matters and to enable affidavits to be prepared concerning the material it was sought to provide in support of the appeal. That material has now been put before us, without objection, to consider its admissibility and, if admissible, its effect on the appeal in accordance with the principles which are set out by the High Court in The Queen v. Mickelberg (1989) 167 CLR 259. 
    9   That material not only included the letter to which I have referred, which is conveniently to be found copied as annexure A to the affidavit of Detective Senior Constable Brian Fitzpatrick, but the appellant's oral and written assertions of the telephone calls. The Crown has filed material including an affidavit of the complainant in which she denied writing the letter and provided samples of handwriting. 
    10   The handwriting evidence provided on affidavit by Mr. Mesker of the Police Document Examination Section is to the effect that, in the deponent's view, the complainant had not written the letter in question. No identifiable finger or palm prints were found on the document such as would have assisted. 
    11   Before us in argument, the appellant drew our attention to his assertion in argument of his provision of the letter in question and its accompanying envelope to officers of the Legal Aid Commission where the envelope which might have, he asserted, on testing established authorship, unfortunately went missing. The circumstances of the envelope having gone missing are referred to in the affidavit of Miss Maureen Fanning of the Legal Aid Commission. In all the circumstances, the court was content to entertain the appellant's assertions orally from the bar table for the purpose of evaluating them. 
     
      
    12   In addition to those matters, in oral argument before us, in his written submissions and in further written submissions provided by him shortly after the hearing, which I consider we should read for that purpose, the appellant has made a number of complaints. Those include a complaint of the inadequacy of his representation, in particular, that his counsel was distracted by the birth of the counsel's child during the trial (see Regina v. Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 and Regina v. Ignjatic (1993) 68 A. Crim. R. 333). 
    13   He has made a number of factual assertions of matters he says his counsel should have put or explored, including that there should have been an identification parade and that his physical particulars and clothing differed greatly from the description given by the witnesses. He asserted that the appellant had had a conversation after his arrest with a police officer in which he had deliberately ascribed to himself inaccurate particulars of his height and distinctive marks and clothing which inaccurate description was, he says, given by the identifying witnesses to the police. He submits that it was open for it to be accepted that the police officer had taken that description and provided it to the witnesses who had adopted it. This, he says, exposes the falsity of the witness' evidence and that the identification was erroneous. 
    14   His Honour embarked on an enquiry into whether identification evidence should have been allowed in the absence of a parade and gave a judgment allowing the evidence. The assertion of the giving of the inaccurate description was not raised on that enquiry or at trial and it is not sought to explain that it was not raised at trial by any reference to counsel having been informed of it at the time of trial. I see no error in the trial judge's decision having regard to the identification evidence I will later set out. 
    15   In addition, the appellant seeks to draw our attention to asserted conversations with his counsel advising him not to raise matters; conversations with police officers and magistrates during the pre-trial committal process; an occasion on which he says police officers brought two ladies to the holding cell and both declared him not to be the person in respect of whom they were examining him; advice from a police officer to tell his solicitor to get hold of railway security cameras, the tape from which it was asserted would ""clear you"". He has further asserted that the absence of evidence from an Asian woman he contends he spoke to and the absence of evidence from a female train passenger, although the content of that evidence is not clear, would have cleared him also. None of the material that might have supported these assertions was put before us in a way that would have enabled it to be properly considered. No original statement was provided to us and there was no sworn evidence of these matters except of the letter and there seems no basis to accept that as genuine. 
    16   For my part, I do not consider that any of this meets the relevant tests posed by the High Court in Mickelberg (supra). I do not regard it as cogent nor do I regard there as being any real or sufficient explanation of why such factual material as is suggested to have been involved in it was not available for use at the trial. The identification issue was plainly raised and agitated at the trial. 
    17   Nonetheless, having regard to the fact that the appellant was unrepresented and was raising matters which might have revealed an important ground of appeal, I agreed in the decision made at trial that regard should be had to that material in order to seek to ascertain whether it might support any other ground or alternatively supply relevant context to the other grounds the appellant sought to argue or, whether there might have been, for any reason, a procedural or substantive miscarriage of justice. In particular, I have considered it on the issue whether the conviction should not be allowed to stand as not supported by the evidence or whether otherwise there might be some evidentiary defect in the identification process: see s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Regina v. Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379; Regina v. Gipp (1998) 194 CLR 106.  
    18   As best I can analyse his oral and written submissions, the appellant asserted as the grounds of his appeal against conviction:- 
     
      
       
       1. That his counsel had failed to adduce evidence from a female train passenger that she had seen him in the police station and had made a positive rejection of him as the perpetrator. 
       
      
      
       
       2. That the judge was biased. 
       
      
      
       
       3. That the descriptions given by the complainant and other witnesses were entirely inconsistent with a correct identification of him in their detail, both as to his physical attributes and his clothing. 
       
      
      
       
       4. That the police investigation was entirely inadequate as failing to provide a line up and failing to fingerprint the bag of white powder thrown away by him and the women's toilet on the railway station. 
       
      
      
       
       5. That his counsel failed to bring out or mention adequately or call one of two young girls to whom he had spoken who was Asian. 
       
      
      
       
       6. That his counsel was forensically inadequate by comparison with the Crown Prosecutor. 
       
      
      
       
       7. That the complainant's distress in court and the assistance furnished to her by a support person was such as to cause the trial to miscarry. 
       
      
      
       
       8. That the identification of him by the complainant had been tainted by her being allowed to see a video monitor in the police station showing him in custody in the cells and apparently engaged in some sexual act. 
       
      
    19   The evidence can be summarised shortly. It was the complainant's evidence that on 23 December 1995, she, aged 15 years, was waiting at the Lithgow railway station for her boyfriend to arrive by train. She had gone to the station in company with a girl named Milly who had left her at the station after the complainant had purchased chips and a drink. She went to the ladies' toilets at the station carrying the coke bottle. A man followed her into the toilets and into the cubicle and locked the door. He offered her ""goey"" (apparently a reference to drugs of some sort) and ""smoko"". She refused. He said, ""show us your tits"". She told him to ""piss off"". He then grabbed her, ""on the tit"". She said, ""what do you think you're fuckin' doing?"", and pushed his hands away. He said, ""you do that and I'll fuckin' hit you"". She said, ""don't do this, don't do this to me, it's happened before"". He laughed and said, ""you scream and I'll you, you scream and I'll hit you"". He then said, ""show us your cunt"", and started to pull down her tracksuit pants and underwear and put his finger inside her vagina. 
    20   She heard a train come and she said, ""you want to let me go, you want to let me out now, here comes people, here comes people"" and an old lady walked into a cubicle. The complainant reached over the top and said, ""help me, help me"". She said, ""she wouldn't help me"". She said, ""the old lady turned around and walked out"" and she heard the appellant undo his zipper saying ""here you want to see this, I've got something to show you"". The complainant, when the old lady would not help her, pulled herself over the top of the cubicle and shouted to her and then walked out of the toilet and yelled out ""somebody tried to rape me, somebody tried to rape me"". A lady from the railway station came walking down and she said that the appellant came walking out of the other side of the cubicle and she threw her coke bottle at him but missed him, nearly hitting the lady, and she went with the train lady, ""he just kept walking, walking, walking"". 
    21   She complained to the train lady who was wearing a uniform that ""somebody tried to rape me, that bloke, that bloke"" and pointed to the appellant who was ""walking out, was walking out around"". 
    22   She confirmed in evidence that the person she had pointed to on the railway station was the same person that was in the toilet cubicle with her. She was taken up the stairs from the railway station by other women who were then present and saw the man walking up the stairs. He sat up at the top of the stairs at a bus stop. When she walked out, she saw him down near a police wagon and yelled out and abused him. This was a short time later. At that point the man was down from the bus stop getting into the police wagon. 
    23   At trial she gave a description of what the man was wearing comprising shabby blue jeans and a flannelette shirt. She gave evidence that at the police station she had made a statement and that when she was walking out of the police station, after she had made the statement and after she had been to the hospital, she had seen the appellant in the cells on what appears to be a security monitor screen. 
    24   She was unable to recall at trial any other of the clothing the man was wearing. She was permitted to make an in-court identification of the accused without objection (no doubt as a consequence of his Honour's ruling on the voir dire to which I have already referred) and confirmed that she had not known him before that occasion. 
    25   In cross-examination her evidence was tested as to the lighting in the toilet. She recalled that the flannelette shirt was blue, that he had an earing and a ""crater"" on his face. It was put to her that she was totally mistaken as to the person who did this. She denied it. It was suggested that the man who had raped her had mingled with the train passengers and that she had made a mistaken identification. But again, she said she saw him walk out of the toilets and up the stairs. She adamantly resisted the suggestion of mistake. 
    26   She agreed that she had screamed on the platform to the police, ""where is that cunt, where is that cunt, I'm going to kill him"", and said that that was immediately prior to her throwing the bottle at him. 
    27   The cross-examiner challenged identification but did not put to the witness any prior inconsistent description. In re-examination she referred to the word ""crater"" as referring to pock marks or pimples. 
    28   Other evidence included that of Mr. Bruce King, a railway passenger, who saw two girls, one blonde and one Asian, and that the blonde one went into the railway tunnel. He saw a relatively tall, scruffy looking male person wearing a hat, a denim jacket and blue denim jeans who bumped into him and appeared to follow the blonde girl who walked into the rest room or toilet. He went back out into the arcade from the platform and sat. He then walked down onto the platform where a train had pulled in, sitting on the platform. He then heard a girl screaming. He heard her say, ""fucking cunt, fucking cunt, I'll kill him, I'll kill him"". He identified the person screaming as the blonde girl who had apparently just come out of the toilet ""back towards me"". He identified that blonde girl as the complainant. 
    29   He saw the scruffy looking man come out of the other side of the building, coming from around the other side, not out of the same door that they went in. The complainant told him to go after that man. She indicated the scruffy bloke to him. He followed that man up the stairs until he sat on a bus stop. Mr. King noticed that man take off his jacket and a green MASH hat, of a floppy cotton type. The man walked away from the bus stop seat and was pursued by State Rail personnel including a uniformed woman State Rail officer. 
    30   He confirmed that the man he had seen follow the girl into the ladies' toilet was the same man that had walked up the stairs later, sat on the bus seat and crossed the road. 
    31   In cross-examination, he confirmed that man had been wearing the hat until the time at which he saw him sitting on the bus seat, that the man had appeared to him to be about six foot in height. His evidence did not suggest that he had seen the complainant throw the bottle. He confirmed that the complainant had come out of the toilet shortly after an older woman had walked in. 
    32   He also confirmed that the complainant had indicated the scruffy man, that is, the man to whom he had been referring. 
    33   Suzanne Sharp gave evidence that she had been working at the Lithgow railway station that day as the station assistant. She described the geography of the station and the platform and, in particular, the location and access to the women's toilet. She said that she was about half way down the platform, about 10 or 12 feet or so from the men's toilet, when she noticed a young girl come out of the ladies' waiting room, screaming hysterically and waving her arms about. She now knows that that girl was the complainant. 
    34   The girl said, ""stop him, stop him, he tried to rape me in the toilets"" and she pointed to the appellant who was heading up the stairs, walking at a normal pace or just a little bit quicker. She apparently threw a coke bottle at him and it smashed against the wall. She was still screaming, ""stop him, stop him, he tried to rape me in the toilet"". At that point, the man would have been about 10 feet or so away from her, only a couple of feet from the men's toilets. 
    35   Miss Sharp sat the girl down on a seat under the awning and arranged for a couple of ladies, who had been passengers on the train which had arrived, to comfort her and then started to follow the appellant. As she passed the station master's office, she asked the acting station master to contact the police, then followed the man out to the bus interchange, seeing him seated on a seat some two seats from the end of the walkway. 
    36   She returned to the platform to attend to the welfare of the complainant and then returned again to the vicinity of the bus seats where the man was still sitting on the seats. She described him as wearing a green t-shirt, jeans and a cap, she thought a baseball cap but she was not sure. 
    37   The man spoke to certain of the station attendants, got up off the seat and started to walk across the road and down a laneway. Miss Sharp followed him. The man she followed, whilst she was following him in company with the train driver, threw a small white object away. She and the train driver kept following him until she saw the police car at which point she left the train driver to keep on following him whilst she went to get the police. The police then drove up and apprehended him. He had, by this time, started running. 
    38   The man the police apprehended, she said, was the same man that the girl had thrown the coke bottle at. The police put him in the back of a police vehicle. She saw the girl come running down the road, screaming hysterically, so she stopped her just before she got to where the police and the police vehicle and the appellant had been. 
    39   Later she accompanied Sergeant Madgwick to where she had seen the man throw the white object away and a small sachet bag. A little sealable white envelope made of plastic was located. It was a transparent plastic bag with white powder in it. She identified a photograph of it. She gave evidence of the construction of the toilet cubicles and how the dividers did not extend to the ceiling. 
    40   In cross-examination, she revealed some considerable doubt as to the precision of her description of the man's clothing, but rejected the suggestion she might be mistaken in identifying the man as the accused. She accepted that the man might have been wearing a jacket at some point of time. She denied the suggestion that the man she had been following did not throw away the white object. She confirmed that the man that was in the police car taken from the scene was the accused. 
    41   The train driver, Donald Charles Spice, gave an account to similar effect of seeing the man on the bus seat and following him thereafter. He contended that he had never lost sight of him. He too noticed that the man was ""a little bit poxy"", by which he apparently meant that the man suffered from acne. 
    42   Sergeant Madgwick gave evidence of having had a conversation with the complainant, with Miss Sharp and then seeing a man followed by the train driver, Don Spice. He gave evidence that the man was the accused and that when he arrested the accused, the accused said, ""I don't know what you're talking about"". 
    43   When he was in the police vehicle, he saw the young girl running from the railway station towards the police vehicle in which the accused was and she was yelling and appeared to be upset. He gave evidence confirmatory of Miss Sharp's account of the finding of the plastic bag containing white powder. He gave evidence that on arrest the accused was wearing a t-shirt, jeans and had a jacket with him. 
    44   Detective Cottee gave evidence of speaking to the accused, who asserted that he knew nothing about the allegation, but was unwilling to participate in a record of interview. In that interview, the appellant, as to each allegation put, said that he did not know anything about that but agreed he had been at the platform on the railway station earlier on when he had gone to the toilet. He agreed that at the time he was wearing a green t-shirt, faded blue jeans and had a jacket which was blue denim. He denied any knowledge of the plastic bag of white powder or that he had seen anybody throw a bottle of coke. He had never seen anybody following him anywhere, he said. He denied that he had thrown the plastic resealable bag away and gave an account of his movements, describing himself as having gone to a friend's place, a friend whom he hadn't seen, ""for 15 years or maybe even longer than that, about 20 years probably"". 
    45   Although the description given by the complainant originally to police had not been put to her as inconsistent, her statement to the police, in the evidence of this detective, was marked for identification and evidence was led that it contained the description of the person she said had assaulted her. 
    46   After objection was taken by the defence to that description being given in evidence, there was some discussion in the absence of the jury and a description was tendered in evidence before the jury thereafter. That description was as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""I would describe the man that followed me into the toilets and attacked me as being about 40 years old, a bit shorter than six feet tall, medium build, brown hair with grey in it. He had like pock marks on his face. He was wearing a hat, he had on blue jeans, I would recognise the man if I saw him again."" 
       
      
    47   That description was entirely inconsistent with that the appellant asserted in argument before us the complainant had given, but it was not challenged at trial. 
    48   Detective Cottee asserted that he had not had the small plastic bag tested for fingerprints as, in his experience, fingerprints were rarely recovered on items of that nature. He had not taken any fingerprint evidence around the toilet and said that might have been perhaps an oversight on his part. He agreed that the accused, having denied being the person involved, wished to participate in an identification parade and that he had offered the accused the opportunity of taking part in an identification parade, but that he was unable to find enough people in the area with a moustache to conduct an impartial identification parade at that time. In addition, there was a problem of the situation arising late on a Saturday night. 
    49   I interpolate that his evidence in this regard appears to have been accepted by the trial judge on the voir dire when he gave his decision on the application to exclude identification evidence, to which I have earlier referred. 
    50   Detective Cottee agreed that he had been unable to find a hat the accused might have been wearing, and had not questioned him in the interview about whether or not he had a hat. Thereafter the Crown case closed. 
    51   The appellant gave evidence that he had come from Bathurst to Lithgow to visit his mother in hospital and that after having stayed a couple of hours with her, went to hotels to have a couple of beers and something to eat. He then went to the railway station to buy a ticket to go back to Bathurst but the bus was all sold out. He hung around in the hope that someone who had booked a seat would not turn up so that he might buy a ticket, went to the toilet, went back upstairs, had a cigarette, sat on a seat and waited for a while. When it was apparent that all booked passengers had arrived, he went looking for a friend to get a lift home. This was a friend that he had not spoken to for some 15 or 20 years. 
    52   While he was looking for the friend's home, ""some bloke come up to me and said to me, 'you'll have to come with me' or something like that"". The accused ""probably did tell him to piss off because I didn't know who he was"". He did not remember what had been said to him by Mr. Spice, the train driver or of anybody actually following him. He was pulled up by the police, put in a police car and taken to the station. At no time was he running, he was merely walking, he said. 
    53   He did not take any issue with the police account of the conversations with him. He denied sexually assaulting the complainant in any way or having ever had a coke bottle thrown at him. He denied wearing a hat and specifically a green MASH type hat or cap. He denied wearing, on that day, a blue flannelette checked shirt. He said, ""I never threw no plastic bag away"". He admitting having had a jacket, ""a sort of denim jacket, a light coloured denim jacket, white to light blue"", he thought it was, by memory but said he had not worn it that day. 
    54   In cross-examination he confirmed that the jeans he was wearing had a zipper, that his facial skin was pock marked with some acne on his face and that there had been no need for him, if using the gents' toilet, to walk past where the gents' toilet was situated away from the stairs on the platform so that he might be observed walking from a position further away from the stairs than the gents' toilets towards the stairs. 
    55   He denied bumping into Mr. King, seeing a blonde girl and asserted that he went into the gents' toilet, thereafter going up and sitting on a seat near the bus interchange. He denied running or walking briskly when being followed by Mr. Spicer and confirmed the last time he had spoken to Mr. Northey, his Lithgow friend, was when he was at school or shortly after. He said, however, on a couple of hundred occasions people had sent messages to him to the effect that ""Darryl said to say hello"". He said he had seen Darryl in Bathurst a few days before in a car and thought that Darryl might have been able to drive him home to Bathurst from Lithgow. He denied hearing a girl screaming or a bottle breaking that day and did not see a young girl acting hysterically. He certainly did not hear a girl screaming out words to the effect of ""stop him, stop him, don't let him get away"". He did not hear anyone scream out words like ""he tried to rape me"". He didn't see anyone acting strangely while he was on the platform. On his account, the breaking of the coke bottle and the complainant's screaming could not have occurred whilst he was on the platform. 
    56   There was no application to recall the complainant to cross-examine her concerning the description which had been given in evidence. 
    57   Whatever was the appropriateness at trial of that description being given in that way, on this appeal, the appellant seems to have contended that the original description should have been before the jury so that they might compare it with the account given by the complainant and the identification in evidence. 
    58   The summing up was detailed and extensive. In particular, his Honour gave clear and precise directions that it was essential for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence and identification of the accused by the complainant and that therefore, the jury should examine and scrutinise her evidence with great care. He gave directions concerning the prospect of her evidence being unreliable, the danger of convicting on her evidence unless it was corroborated and gave impeccable directions as to the dangers of identification and the onus and standard of proof. No complaint can or has been made concerning those directions. 
    59   I turn then to consider the grounds of appeal to which I have referred. 
     
      
     Ground 1 
      
    60   Insofar as this ground refers to the woman who entered the toilet block at about the time of the assault, there was no evidence at the trial to indicate a sufficient basis upon which she could have been located by either the Crown or the defence. There was no evidence at the trial, nor is there any evidence in form such as it might be permissible for us to act on before us, to suggest she had come to the police station and rejected the appellant as the perpetrator. 
     
      
     Ground 2 
      
    61   There is no possible basis for any contention that the judge exhibited any such conduct as was in any way unfavourable to the proper determination of the appellant's trial. No reasonable observer could have apprehended in any way that his Honour was less than entirely impartial and indeed tender towards the fairness of the trial as far as the appellant was concerned. 
    62   There is no substance in this ground. 
     
      
     Ground 3 
      
    63   There was no evidence at trial of any other description of the appellant than that which I have related. That description, whilst it was not entirely consistent with the account given by the appellant, was a description that the jury could test by observing the appellant himself during the trial, and by his own admissions as to his own clothing, height, build, pock marked face, etc. 
    64   These were matters to be evaluated by the jury. I do not see that any matter is raised which causes me to any apprehension on this ground. Further, in my view, the verdict was entirely open to the jury on the evidence at it was before them and I would see no basis to disturb it. 
     
      
     Ground 4 
      
    65   Whatever might be said as to whether a more perfect investigation might have been done had the facilities been available at Lithgow at the day in question to provide the line-up, to arrange for fingerprinting of the plastic bag and fingerprinting of the toilet, these deficits in investigation (as far as they were deficits) were brought to the attention of the jury and in the context of the case, no doubt, taken into account by them to evaluate whether they were or were not satisfied on the relevant factual issues. 
    66   I see no basis on which this ground can be other than rejected. 
     
      
      
     Grounds 5 and 6 
      
    67   Upon an analysis of the evidence, it would appear that the young girl to whom the appellant referred was Milly. She was apparently the Asian girl who had accompanied the complainant towards the station. She was not otherwise involved in events. There would seem little reason why the absence of her testimony could assist the accused's case. Indeed, it might have gone some way to contradict his evidence that he had not seen the blonde girl or followed her to the station. I do not see that his counsel, in any way, failed in his duty by not calling her, nor indeed, more generally, do I detect in counsel's conduct of the case, particularly having regard to his objection to the identification evidence and his objection to the description evidence, any such forensic imbalance by comparison with the Crown Prosecutor or forensic inadequacy as would fall within the tests in Birks (supra) and Ignjatic (supra). These grounds, too, fail. 
     
      
     Ground 7 
      
    68   There was simply no basis for the asserted contention that the complainant's distress in court caused the trial to miscarry. It was plain from the transcript that she was distressed. It was plain, also, that her choice of language at times left a great deal to be desired and appeared to indicate a considerable degree of upset on her part. Notwithstanding these matters, his Honour gave clear directions to the jury not to be swayed by sympathy and to consider her evidence with great care.  
    69   There is, in my view, nothing in this ground. 
     
      
     Ground 8 
      
    70   It is entirely regrettable that the complainant should have had the opportunity to see the accused on the video monitor as she was leaving the police station. Nonetheless, the acts of identification which were of substance in this matter, were those that long pre-dated that event, that is, the identification on the station platform, the throwing of the coca cola bottle and the identification by running towards the man in custody. 
    71   The evidence clearly establishes a continuity of observation of the same person from the times at which the complainant indicated him on the platform and in the vicinity of the toilets to the time of arrest. 
    72   I see no risk that any mistake occurred and, in any event, these issues were put before the jury and resolved by them. Specific cross-examination was directed to the question that at some point there had been a mistake such that an innocent man had been identified. It was to that issue that courtroom identification was permitted. 
    73   I see no prospect of error. Further, in my view, after reviewing the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that the verdict was soundly based. I do not consider that any question arises such as to suggest otherwise than that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: M v. The Queen (1994)181 CLR 487; Jones v. The Queen (1997) 149 ALR 598. 
    74   In my view, not only was there a sufficiency of evidence, but, upon a consideration of the transcript and having regard to the favourable position of the jury in assessing the witnesses at trial, I consider that the conviction is not attended with doubt. 
    75   I would propose the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
    76   I now turn to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
    77   The appellant had either just completed or was not far from completing, depending on whether his opinion was accepted or that of the official record, a parole period following sentence for a sexual assault of a very similar nature, for which he had been convicted in 1989. 
    78   His Honour, the trial judge, referred to that matter and that so far as the sparse information before him indicated, it involved an attempt to sexually interfere with and indeed an actual interference with, a young girl on a train between Lithgow and Bathurst. He had been sentenced to five years penal servitude on that charge and was serving the unexpired portion of the total sentence at the time this offence occurred. 
    79   The offender had, his Honour noted, 31 prior convictions for various types of offences, including offences for which he had been sentenced to penal servitude, one of which involved the office I have referred to of indecent assault on a female. 
    80   His Honour expressed the view that there was very little to his credit to which his Honour could have regard in reducing any sentence which might otherwise have been appropriate. His Honour found against the benefit for any remorse being extended to the appellant. 
    81   A number of grounds were asserted in the helpful submissions of counsel as to his Honour's sentence. In particular they included that his Honour treated the applicant's plea and conduct of the trial as an aggravating circumstance. In that regard, our attention was drawn to the decision in The Queen v. Siganto (1999) 159 ALR 94. 
    82   It was submitted that the stress occasioned to the complainant by having to give evidence was wrongly treated by his Honour as an aggravating circumstance for sentencing purposes. It was submitted that his Honour's remarks that the appellant had shaken his head and altered his appearance to attempt to avoid apprehension while remaining close by so as to put some psychological pressure on the complainant not to press the allegations in a blatant attempt to coerce somebody to not pressing the allegation, were in error and that his Honour had erred in coming to this conclusion as the evidence did not provide an adequate basis for it. Further, it was asserted, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
    83   Despite the matters to which counsel has drawn our attention in support of the first three grounds, and in particular statements by his Honour as to the difficulty of avoiding emotional involvement in the matter, of his having to take into account on penalty: the highly emotional state of the complainant; that the appellant had chosen to deny the offence, in his Honour's view, in a most blatant way; that the appellant's maintenance of his denial of the events was reprehensible in the circumstances, I consider this appeal may be disposed of by turning to an examination of the sentence in the light of the last ground submitted notwithstanding his Honour's comment that the sentence he imposed:- 
     
      
       
       ""… may seem an exceptionally high sentence, however I might point out that the maximum sentence is 20 years and that there are, in my mind, aggravating circumstances in the extreme in this particular case. Most particularly, that the girl was put through a highly traumatic experience in respect of which she still suffers problems. She said in evidence that she still sees his face - that is the face of the accused - every time she closes her eyes."" 
       
      
    84   Whatever be the reason for his Honour imposing a sentence as severe as he did, in my view, this sentence exceeds the bounds of that which fell within an acceptable range of the exercise of a sound discretion. 
    85   Accepting that his Honour was concerned with questions of personal deterrence and general deterrence and that his Honour was concerned with those matters particularly in the context of the necessity that young girls should be entitled to use public toilet facilities without fear of being molested or attacked in any way, nonetheless it seems to me that whether because of his Honour having impermissible regard to the matters referred to in the earlier grounds, despite what had been said by the court in Siganto (supra) or for any other reason, his Honour fell into error in imposing a sentence that severe. I remain of this view notwithstanding the prisoner's evidence on his plea that he was unable to remember the circumstances for which he had been convicted of the indecent assault upon the girl in 1989. 
    86   The circumstance of aggravation alleged was that the complainant was under 16 years of age. At the time of the offence, she was only some months under that age. Although there was a threat of violence involved, there was a limited display of violence. The penetration in question, whilst abhorrent, was not penile penetration. Notwithstanding their limited utility, it is of significance that the Judicial Commission statistics for the period January 1990 to July 1998 reveal that a minimum term of nine years is well towards the top of the range of all sentences imposed for offences under the section in question, notwithstanding that the circumstances of aggravation available for such offences embrace matters of considerably greater culpability than here. 
    87   I would set aside his Honour's sentence and, having regard to the necessity for the court to sentence now in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: see Regina v. Carrion [2000] NSWCCA 191, in my view the appellant should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for nine years commencing on 14 May 1998 and expiring on 13 May 2007. 
    88   Notwithstanding counsel's submissions, I see no basis for any finding here of special circumstances and consequently, s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 constrains the setting of a non-parole period not less than three quarters of the term of the sentence. 
    89   I would set, in respect of that sentence, a non-parole period of seven years which will expire on 13 May 2005. 
    90   The orders I propose are - appeal against conviction dismissed; leave to appeal against sentence granted and the appeal against sentence upheld; sentence quashed and in lieu thereof the offender be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for nine years commencing 14 May 1998 and expiring 13 May 2007 with a non-parole period of seven years which will expire on 13 May 2005. The earliest date on which the offender will be eligible for release will be 13 May 2005.

    The Marine Pollution Act 1987 (NSW) (“the Act”) is part of the co-operative scheme by which Australia implemented its obligations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (“the Convention”). Section 8(2) of the Act implements Regulation 11 of Annex I of the Convention. By application of s7, the words used in s8(2) of the Act must be given the meaning they have in Regulation 11.The first Respondent was the master and the second Respondent the owner of a ship. While cargo was being unloaded from the ship using a crane, a hydraulic hose fitted to the crane ruptured causing oil to discharge, some of which escaped into the water. The Respondents were prosecuted for contravening s8(1) of the Act. The Respondents relied on the defence under s8(2)(b). In the Land and Environment Court, Pearlman J dismissed the charges. Following an application by the Appellant, Pearlman J submitted four questions to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.Held(per Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Barr J agreeing).Question (i)(a) As a matter of law can the wear and tear in consequence of which oil escapes come within the word ‘damage’ under s8 of the Marine Pollution Act 1987?1 Nothing in the text to be construed suggests that the word “damage” in Regulation 11 should be read down by reference to the different causes of a physical effect that can be described as “damage”. Morrison v Spliethoffs Bevrachtingscantoor BV (1996) 91 LGERA 318; Billericay Rural District Council v Guardians of the Poor of the Popular Poor Law Union [1911] 2 KB 801, Morrison v Dilmun Navigation Co Pty Ltd (1995) 78 A Crim R 576 and Morrison v ANL, Leighton and Turner (1996) 88 A Crim R 122 discussed.2 An objective to eliminate or to minimise some consequence does not permit a general word like “damage” to be given a narrow interpretation where no relevant restriction was intended. Rodriguez v United States 480 US 522 (1987) and Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996-1997) 190 CLR 225 approved.Question (i)(b) Can the particular wear and tear in the circumstances of this case come within the word ‘damage’ in s8 of the said Act?3 No question of law arises under this question and therefore, it is not appropriate to answer it.Question (ii)(a) As a matter of law, in order to determine whether a person acted ‘recklessly’ for the purposes of s8(3)(b) of the Marine Pollution Act, is it appropriate to apply a subjective or objective test?4 The express qualification of “recklessly” by “knowledge that damage would probably result” points to the conclusion that actual advertence to the risk of damage by the owner or master involved in the incident is required. It is not material to inquire what a prudent person would consider might happen. Goldman v Thai Airways International Ltd [1983] 1 WLR 1186, SS Pharmaceutical Co Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 288 and Nugent v Michael Goss Aviation Ltd (Court of Appeal Civil Division, 14 April 2000, unreported) approved; Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Caldwell [1982] AC 341 and R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510 discussed.Question (ii)(b) Whether on the evidence, it can properly have been found that the defendant did not act ‘recklessly’.”5 Pearlman J expressly referred to facts and matters which her Honour was entitled to take into account and which constituted evidence from which her Honour could infer that the Respondents were not acting “recklessly”. It cannot be said that as a matter of law, only one finding was open on the facts.Discussion 6 A treaty must be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its words and in the light of its object and purpose, not so as to achieve its object or purpose. Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996-1997) 190 CLR 225 applied.AnswersQuestion (i)(a): Yes. 
     
      
    Question (i)(b): Decline to answer. 
     
      
    Question (ii)(a): In order to determine whether a person acted “recklessly” for the purposes of s8(3)(b) it is not appropriate to inquire what a prudent person would consider might happen. 
     
      
    Question (ii)(b): Yes.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: On 1 December 1996 the vessel Sitka II was tied up to the jetty at Lord Howe Island unloading a cargo by means of a crane on the ship. A hydraulic hose fitted to the crane ruptured causing hydraulic oil to discharge under pressure. Fifteen litres of oil escaped, of which some five litres was discharged into the water. The first named Respondent, Harold Anthony Peacock, was the master of the ship and the second named Respondent was the owner of the ship. Both were prosecuted for a contravention of s8(1) of the Marine Pollution Act 1987. The Respondents relied on a statutory defence pursuant to s8(2)(b) of the Act. 
     
      
    2    On 6 August 1999 her Honour Pearlman J found that the Respondents had made out each of the elements of the statutory defence and accordingly dismissed the charges against them. On 2 March 2000 her Honour acceded to an application by the Prosecutor to submit questions to this Court pursuant to s5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Those questions were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i)  
        Wear and Tear 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) As a matter of law can the wear and tear in consequence of which oil escapes come within the word ‘ 
          damage 
          ’ under s8 of the  
          Marine Pollution Act 
           1997? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Can the particular wear and tear in the circumstances of this case come within the word ‘ 
          damage 
          ’ in s8 of the said Act? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (ii)  
        Findings Relevant to the Question of ‘Recklessly’ Under Section 8 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) As a matter of law, in order to determine whether a person acted ‘ 
          recklessly 
          ’ for the purposes of s8(3)(b) of the  
          Marine Pollution Act 
          , is it appropriate to apply a subjective or objective test? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Whether on the evidence, it can properly have been found that the defendant did not act ‘ 
          recklessly 
          ’.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The Statutory Scheme 
       
      
    3    Section 8 of the Marine Pollution Act 1987 (“the Act”) relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “8(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (4), if any discharge of oil or of an oily mixture occurs from a ship into State waters, the master and the owner of the ship, and any other person whose act caused the discharge, are each guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if the offender is a natural person - 
           
          2 000 penalty units, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the offender is a body corporate - 
           
          10 000 penalty units. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the discharge of oil or of an oily mixture from a ship: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) for the purpose of securing the safety of a ship or saving life at sea, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the oil or oily mixture, as the case may be, escaped from the ship in consequence of damage, other than intentional damage, to the ship or its equipment, and all reasonable precautions were taken after the occurrence of the damage or the discovery of the discharge for the purpose of preventing or minimising the escape of oil or oily mixture, as the case may be, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) in the case of an oily mixture, if the discharge was for the purpose of combating specific pollution incidents in order to minimise the damage from pollution and was approved by a prescribed officer, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) if the discharge was authorised by the Minister for training purposes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), damage to a ship or to its equipment shall be taken to be intentional damage if, and only if, the damage arose in circumstances in which the master or owner of the ship: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) acted with intent to cause the damage, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) acted recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (6) In proceedings for an offence against subsection (1) in relation to a ship, it is sufficient for the prosecution to allege and prove that a discharge of oil or of an oily mixture occurred from the ship into State waters, but it is a defence if it is proved that, by virtue of subsection (2) or (4), subsection (1) does not apply in relation to the discharge.” 
        
       
      
    4    This section is part of a co-operative scheme between the Commonwealth and the States by which identical legislation, save in one immaterial respect, was passed by all States (other than s26 of the Queensland Act) and by the Commonwealth. By reason of a specific case in New South Wales under predecessor legislation, the New South Wales Act extends the obligation beyond a master or owner to “any other person whose act causes the discharge”. (See Hansard Parliament of New South Wales Legislative Assembly 29 October 1987 at 15471). The Commonwealth Act is the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 (Cth). The other State acts are: Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995 (Qld), Pollution of Waters by Oil and Noxious Substances Act 1987 (SA), Pollution of Waters by Oil and Noxious Substances Act 1987 (Tas), Pollution of Waters by Oil and Noxious Substances Act 1986 (Vic) and Pollution of Waters by Oil and Noxious Substances Act 1987 (WA). This co-operative scheme was the means by which Australia implemented its obligations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (hereinafter “the 1973 Convention”). Apart from certain specific immaterial Annexes, the 1973 Convention is annexed as Schedule 1 to the Marine Pollution Act 1987 (NSW).

        “ 
        THE PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION, 
        
       
       
        
        BEING CONSCIOUS 
         of the need to preserve the human environment in general and the marine environment in particular, 
        
       
       
        
        RECOGNIZING 
         that deliberate, negligent or accidental release of oil and other harmful substances from ships constitutes a serious source of pollution, 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        DESIRING 
         to achieve the complete elimination of intentional pollution of the marine environment by oil and other harmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such substances, 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    6    Section 7 of the Act, which appears in the same Part of the Act as s8, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Except in so far as the contrary intention appears, an expression that is used in this Part or in Part 6 and in Annex I to the Convention (whether or not a particular meaning is assigned to it by that Annex) has, in this Part and in Part 6, the same meaning as in that Annex.” 
        
       
      
    7    Annex I of the 1973 Convention is entitled “Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil”. Regulation 1 of that Annex contains a number of definitions none of which are material for the present proceedings. 
     
      
    8    Regulation 9 of Annex I provides inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Subject to the provisions of Regulations 10 and 11 of this Annex and paragraph (2) of this Regulation, any discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixtures from ships to which this Annex applies shall be prohibited except …” 
        
       
       
      The Regulation goes on to provide for detailed exceptions which are not material for present purposes. Regulation 10 is not material. 
       
      
    9    Regulation 11 is headed “Exceptions” and provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Regulations 9 and 10 of this Annex shall not apply to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of a ship or saving life at sea; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture resulting from damage to a ship or its equipment: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) provided that all reasonable precautions have been taken after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the discharge for the purpose of preventing or minimizing the discharge; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) except if the owner or the Master acted either with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the discharge into the sea of substances containing oil, approved by the Administration, when being used for the purpose of combating specific pollution incidents in order to minimize the damage from pollution. Any such discharge shall be subject to the approval of any Government in whose jurisdiction it is contemplated the discharge will occur.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10    By Article 1 of the 1973 Convention: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The Parties to the Convention undertake to give effect to the provisions of the present Convention and those Annexes thereto by which they are bound, in order to prevent the pollution of the marine environment by the discharge of harmful substances or effluents containing such substances in contravention of the present Convention. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Unless expressly provided otherwise, a reference to the present Convention constitutes at the same time a reference to its Protocols and to the Annexes.” 
        
       
      
    11    Pursuant to the international obligation assumed by Australia under Article 1, Regulation 9(1) is given effect by s8(1) of the Act and equivalent sections of the parallel Commonwealth and State acts, and the defence in Regulation 11 is implemented by s8(2) of the Act and equivalent sections of the parallel acts. By force of s7 of the Act, words used in the Act - relevantly “damage” and “recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result” - must be given the meaning they have in Regulation 11 - no contrary intention being discernible or, indeed, having been suggested. 
     
      
    12    An international treaty is to be interpreted in Australia in accordance with the requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969. Article 31 of that Convention, under the heading “General rule of interpretation”, provides in its first two paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    13    The application of Article 31 was considered by the High Court in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996-1997) 190 CLR 225. At 252-253, McHugh J said (references omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “The first paragraph of the article contains three separate but related principles. First, an interpretation must be in good faith, which flows directly from the rule pacta sunt servanda. Second, the ordinary meaning of the words of the treaty are presumed to be an authentic representation of the parties’ intentions. This principle has been described as the ‘very essence’ of the textual approach to treaty interpretation. Third, the ordinary meaning of the words are not to be determined in a vacuum removed from the context of the treaty or its object or purpose.” 
        
       
      
    14    His Honour went on, at 253, to identify a difference of opinion that had been expressed “as to whether Art 31 requires or merely allows recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty in interpreting one of its terms”. One of the views that had been expressed was that resort to context, object and purpose was only permissible if the natural and ordinary meaning did not give a clear result. McHugh J agreed with the opinion that a “single combined operation” had to be given to Article 31, which his Honour described at 254 as “an ordered yet holistic approach”. McHugh J explained this approach at 254: 
     
      
       
        
        “Primacy is to be given to the written text of the Convention but the context, object and purpose of the treaty must also be considered.” 
        
       
      
    15    His Honour went on, at 255, to describe the process as giving “the text primacy in interpretation” and referred to “the mandatory requirement that courts look to the context, object and purpose of treaty provisions as well as the text”. His Honour concluded, at 256: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in my opinion, Art 31 of the Vienna Convention requires the courts of this country when faced with a question of treaty interpretation to examine both the ‘ordinary meaning’ and the ‘context … object and purpose’ of a treaty.” 
        
       
      
    16    Similarly, the Australian law of statutory interpretation requires a court to consider context in the first instance, not merely after “ambiguity” is identified: See R v Wilson; Ex parte Kisch (1934) 52 CLR 234 at 244; Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Commonwealth) (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 304, 319-320; K & S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon & Gotch Ltd (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 312, 315, 321; CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 335 at 381. 
     
      
    17    To similar effect is the reasoning of Brennan CJ in Applicant A at 231: 
     
      
       
        
        “In interpreting a treaty, it is erroneous to adopt a rigid priority in the application of interpretive rules. The political processes by which a treaty is negotiated to a conclusion preclude such an approach. Rather, for the reasons given by McHugh J, it is necessary to adopt an holistic but ordered approach. The holistic approach to interpretation may require a consideration of both the text and the object and purpose of the treaty in order to ascertain its true meaning. Although the text of a treaty may itself reveal its object and purpose or at least assist in ascertaining its object and purpose, assistance may also be obtained from extrinsic sources. The form in which a treaty is drafted, the subject to which it relates, the mischief that it addresses, the history of its negotiation and comparison with earlier or amending instruments relating to the same subject may warrant consideration in arriving at the true interpretation of its text.”  
        
       
      
    18    Dawson J referred to Article 31 and said, at 240: 
     
      
       
        
        “Under that rule, the starting point must be the text of the treaty. Of course, the text of a treaty is often couched in fairly general terms due to differences in language and legal conceptions among those to whom it is to be addressed and as part of an attempt to reach agreement among diverse nations. Accordingly, technical principles of common law construction are to be disregarded in construing the text. As Lord Wilberforce said in  
        Buchanan & Co v Babco Ltd 
         [[1978] AC 141 at 152]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I think that the correct approach is to interpret the English text … in a normal manner, appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention, unconstrained by technical rules of English law, or by English legal precedent, but on broad principles of general acceptation.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Article 31(1) also allows, indeed requires, recourse to the context, object and purpose of a treaty. Article 31(2) states that the context includes, inter alia, the text of the treaty including its preamble and annexures. Article 31 plainly precludes the adoption of a literal construction which would defeat the object or purpose of a treaty and be inconsistent with the context in which the words being construed appear. To say as much is, perhaps, to state no more than the accepted canon of construction that an instrument is to be construed as a whole and that words are not to be divorced from their context or construed in a manner that would defeat the character of the instrument.” 
        
       
      
    19    Gummow J said, at 277: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is necessary to begin with the construction of the definition as it appears in the Convention and Protocol. Regard primarily is to be had to the ordinary meaning of the terms used therein, albeit in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the Convention. Recourse may also be had to the preparatory work for the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, whether to confirm the meaning derived by the above means or to determine a meaning so as to avoid obscurity, ambiguity or manifestly absurd or unreasonable results. However, as McHugh J demonstrates by the analysis of the subject in his reasons for judgment, with which I agree, it is important to appreciate the primacy to be given to the text of the treaty.” 
        
       
       
      See also per Kirby J at 294. 
       
      
    20    Article 31 of the Vienna Convention does not state that a treaty should be interpreted “so as to achieve its object or purpose”. It must be interpreted “in accordance with the ordinary meaning” and “in the light of its object and purpose”. The distinction between the two emphasised phrases accords with what McHugh J referred to in Applicant A as giving “primacy” to the text. 
     
      
       
      Question (i)(a): Is Wear and Tear ‘Damage’? 
       
      
    21    The defence under s8(2)(b) of the Act requires that the oil escape “in consequence of damage, other than intentional damage, to the ship or its equipment”. The Appellant submitted, unsuccessfully, before Pearlman J that the proper construction of the word “damage” in this context did not extend to “wear and tear”. 
     
      
    22    The central finding of fact by Pearlman J was expressed by her Honour in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the relevant damage was the rupture of the hose because that is the damage which caused the discharge of oil. But for the purpose of considering the defence under s8(2)(b), it is relevant to consider the cause of that damage, that is, what caused the rupture of the hose.” 
        
       
      
    23    Pearlman J went on to refer to expert evidence adduced in the proceedings before her Honour, evidence which she accepted, to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the hose failed because of abrasion and chafing at the base of the steel sleeve in the crane column near the point where the crane sat at the top of the plinth.” 
        
       
      
    24    The column of hoses, one of which ruptured, was able to turn in excess of 400 degrees at the base of the sleeve, in accordance with the movement of the crane. It was this sawing motion that resulted in the abrasion and chafing and, eventually, the rupture of a hose. It was this abrasion and chafing which the Appellant sought to characterise as “wear and tear”, arising from the normal operation of the crane. 
     
      
    25    The proper construction of s8(2)(b) has led to a difference of view in the Land and Environment Court.  
     
      
    26    In Morrison v Spliethoffs Bevrachtingscantoor BV (1996) 91 LGERA 318, Bannon J expressed the opinion that the word “damage” did not extend to “fair wear and tear” (at 320). His Honour adopted the observations of Fletcher Moulton LJ in Billericay Rural District Council v Guardians of the Poor of the Poplar Poor Law Union [1911] 2 KB 801 at 813. In that case his Lordship had concluded that in the section then before the Court, the word “damage” did not mean “fair wear and tear”. However, that case involved the construction of a statutory provision in which damage to a road had been caused “by excessive weight passing along the same, or extraordinary traffic thereon”. It was understandable why, in such a context, his Lordship should find that ordinary traffic on a road did not cause “damage” within meaning of the statute. Section 8(2)(b) is far removed from the statutory context in Billericay. 
     
      
    27    In Morrison v Dilmun Navigation Co Pty Ltd (1995) 78 ACrimR 576, an earlier judgment to which it appears Bannon J was not referred, Bignold J had come to a different conclusion and refused to read down the phrase “damage to the ship or its equipment” by reason of the references in the Second Reading Speech to the statutory offence extending to discharge “caused by accidental damage to a ship” (at 581). Bignold J repeated his approach to the construction of the section in Morrison v ANL, Leighton and Turner (1996) 91 LGERA 437. His Honour there rejected a submission that the word “damage” did not extend to damage in the nature of wear and tear (at 447) and declined to follow the reasoning of Bannon J in Morrison v Spliethoffs (at 448-449). In the present proceedings Pearlman J followed Bignold J. 
     
      
    28    Applying Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the word “damage” must be given its ordinary meaning in its context. The Appellant submitted in this Court that the word “damage” in Regulation 11 and, therefore, s8(2)(b), requires an external factor which has impacted upon the ship or its equipment. There is no such external factor, it was submitted, where the physical effect on the ship or equipment - which physical effect may in another context fall within the word “damage” - has been occasioned by the causal mechanism of wear and tear. 
     
      
    29    General words are sometimes read down so that a statutory formulation does not extend to the full scope of its dictionary meaning. (See eg R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at [25]). However, nothing in the text to be construed suggests that the word “damage” in Regulation 11 should be read down by reference to the different causes of a physical effect that can be described as “damage”. On the contrary, Regulation 11(b)(ii) excepts from the scope of the word “damage” a specific causal mechanism, namely intent or recklessness, reflected in s8(2)(b) of the Act in the exception of “intentional damage” as defined in s8(3) in the very terms of Regulation 11. The parties to the Convention did not, in my opinion, intend to exclude any other causal mechanism. 
     
      
    30    Mr Ellicott QC, for the Appellant, submitted that the purpose of the Convention was the prevention of pollution of waters and that this purpose would be best served by giving the defence a narrower rather than a broader meaning. However, the object of the Convention is not expressed in this way. The relevant recital, fully quoted above, states: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        DESIRING 
         to achieve the complete elimination of intentional pollution … and the minimization of accidental discharge …” 
        
       
      
    31    It is not clear whether the drafter of the treaty equated “recklessness” with “intent” - as did the drafters of s8(2)(b) and s8(3). However, nothing turns on that consideration. 
     
      
    32    An objective to “eliminate” or to “minimize” some consequence, does not permit a general word like “damage” to be given a narrow interpretation where nothing suggests any relevant restriction was intended. It is the intention of the drafters of the Convention which must be ascertained. The intention is not necessarily ascertained by asking what interpretation will best, or better, attain a desirable objective. 
     
      
    33    As the Supreme Court of the United States said in Rodriguez v United States 480 US 522 (1987) at 525-526: 
     
      
       
        
        “[N]o legislature pursues its purposes at all costs. Deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice - and it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that  
        whatever 
         furthers the statute’s primary objective must be the law.” (Emphasis in original) 
        
       
       
      (Quoted with approval by Gummow J in  
      Brennan v Comcare 
       (1994) 50 FCR 555 at 574. See also  
      Byrne & Frew v Australian Airlines Ltd 
       (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 459 per McHugh and Gummow JJ). 
       
      
    34    In Applicant A, Dawson J also referred with approval to Rodriguez in the context of construing the word “refugee” in the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. His Honour said, at 248: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the Convention, like many international and municipal instruments, does not necessarily pursue its primary purpose at all costs. The purpose of an instrument may instead by pursued in a limited way, reflecting the accommodation of differing viewpoints, the desire for limited achievement of objectives, or the constraints imposed by limited resources.” 
        
       
      
    35    Whether or not “damage” has caused discharge of oil is a matter capable of ready ascertainment. No inquiry into the cause of such damage is called for, save in the one category for which Regulation 11 makes explicit provision - intent or recklessness. It would be the experience of all legal systems in which the Convention was intended to operate, that inquiry into blameworthiness is often problematic and always capable of invoking a wide variety of standards. Nothing in the text, context or purpose suggests that a test of “external” cause is more appropriate or adapted to achieve the object or purpose, than a variety of other possible expressions of causal mechanisms that may be understood by some to reflect blameworthiness. 
     
      
    36    The drafters identified a particular causal mechanism of damage - intent or recklessness - which would exclude damage of that character from the defence. There is no warrant for excluding any other causal mechanism by restricting the ordinary meaning of the word “damage”. 
     
      
    37    The Appellant’s submissions drew on a contrast with the predecessor International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 (hereinafter “the 1954 Convention”). Mr Ellicott submitted that the provision equivalent to Regulation 11 of the 1973 Convention, was Article IV of the 1954 Convention, which provided an exception from liability in the case of: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the escape of oil or of oily mixture resulting from damage to a ship or unavoidable leakage …” 
        
       
      
    38    The change between the 1954 Convention and the 1973 Convention was that the words “damage to” which had hitherto qualified the word ship were extended to qualify “equipment” and the exception for “unavoidable leakage”, which would have applied both to equipment and the ship, was deleted. It was submitted that wear and tear was a foreseeable phenomenon and accordingly would not have been excluded on the basis that it was “unavoidable”. 
     
      
    39    The 1954 Convention was implemented in New South Wales by the Prevention of Oil Pollution of Navigable Waters Act 1960. Subsection 7(1) provided for a defence in the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “7(1)(b) that the oil or mixture containing oil escaped - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) in consequence of damage to the ship …; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) in consequence of leakage which could not have been avoided, foreseen or anticipated …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    40    Mr Ellicott submitted that it was not the intention of the nations developing the 1973 Convention, nor of the legislatures of Australia in adopting it, to broaden the scope of protection. Accordingly, the scope of the word “damage” should be read down so as not to encompass matters internal to the ship or equipment. This submission was made by way of assertion. No information of any character concerning the process by which the 1973 Convention was developed was presented to the Court. 
     
      
    41    I accept that the historical development of a treaty by which one form of words replaces another may be of assistance in interpreting the later provision. I do not find any such assistance from the change identified here. 
     
      
    42    It is by no means clear that the crane fixed to the ship, as this crane was, would not have been regarded as part of the “ship” and accordingly, within the words “damage to a ship”, within Article IV of the 1954 Convention. On that basis there is no change by reason of the omission of the words “unavoidable leakage”.  
     
      
    43    It appears that the omission of those words did, on any view, narrow the scope of protection by removing the protection in the case of discharge which was unavoidable, but not occasioned by damage. If, as part of that process, protection was extended to leakage caused by damage to equipment which may hitherto have been regarded as “avoidable”, that may well have been part of the process of adjustment between conflicting considerations designed, perhaps, to eliminate one level of potential disputation. In the absence of any materials which assist in determining the reasons for the change, I am not prepared to speculate that they must all be interpreted to operate in only one direction. 
     
      
    44    In my opinion, question (i)(a) should be answered “Yes”. 
     
      
       
      Question (i)(b): The Particular Wear and Tear 
       
      
    45    The jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is restricted in its terms to the power in the first instance court to: “submit any question of law arising at or in reference to the proceedings”. 
     
      
    46    Although there is some ambiguity by reason of the use of the word “can” as the introductory word of this purported question of law, nothing in the submissions made suggested that, in fact, a question of law arose under question (i)(b). Specifically there was no submission of the nature that the rupture to the hoses, caused by wear and tear, was not, as a matter of law, capable of answering the description of “damage” in s8(1) of the Act. It is not appropriate to answer this question. 
     
      
       
       
      Question (ii)(a): Is the Test of Recklessness Objective or Subjective? 
       
      
    47    As set out above, the defence in s8(2)(b) does not extend to a discharge of oil in consequence of damage to a ship or equipment, if the damage is “intentional damage”. That term is defined in s8(3), also set out above, to encompass circumstances in which the master or owner of the ship “acted recklessly”. The Appellant contended before her Honour and in this Court that the test of recklessness was an objective one. 
     
      
    48    As noted above, by force of s7 of the Act, the word “recklessly” has the same meaning as it has in Regulation 11(b)(ii) of Annex I to the 1973 Convention. 
     
      
    49    The actual question asked in (2)(a) is concerned with whether a subjective or objective test applies in the particular circumstances identified in the question: “in order to determine whether a person acted ‘recklessly’ for the purposes of s8(3)(b) of the Marine Pollution Act”. However, the word “recklessly” does not appear on its own. It appears as part of the phrase “recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result”.  
     
      
    50    As formulated, the question is concerned with only one part of a two-fold condition, both parts of which have to exist before a defence of “escape in consequence of damage” is unavailable. Accordingly, irrespective of whether the conduct of the owner and/or master was “reckless”, the defence would still be made out if the master and/or owner established that he or she and/or it did not act “with knowledge that damage would probably result”. Nevertheless, for whatever practical significance it may have, the question posed focuses only on the word “recklessly”. 
     
      
    51    In Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Caldwell [1982] AC 341, the authority primarily relied on by the Appellant, Lord Diplock described the classification of a test for “recklessness” in a statutory formulation in terms of “subjective” or “objective”, as an “obsessive question” (352G), as a “current vogue for classifying all tests of legal liability” (353E) and as a manifestation of “current legal jargon” (354F). His Lordship noted judicial statements that tests of legal liability “are not easily assignable to one of those categories rather than the other” (353F) and concluded at 354: “Questions of criminal liability are seldom solved by simply asking whether the test is subjective or objective”. In the other authority relied upon, R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510 at 526E, Lord Diplock described the distinction as “simplistic”. 
     
      
    52    To similar effect is the comment by Gleeson CJ and Handley JA in SS Pharmaceutical Co Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 288 at 290. Their Honours referred to a distinction between an “objective” and “subjective” test for knowledge in Article 25 of the Warsaw Convention and added “whatever exactly that might mean”. 
     
      
    53    The submissions in this Court adapted some of the terminology of Lord Diplock in Caldwell supra at 354. The Appellant submitted that “recklessness” in s8(3)(b) should be determined by asking “what a prudent person would consider might happen”. In view of the imprecision of the words “subjective” and “objective”, that is the question which ought be answered in the present case. 
     
      
    54    As indicated above, in submissions before her Honour, and in this Court, the Appellant relied on some observations of Lord Diplock in Caldwell supra esp at 352-354 and Lawrence supra esp at 526-527 and by Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in the latter at 520-521. Lord Diplock adopted an objective test with respect to the use of the word “reckless” in the context of the two statutory provisions under consideration in the respective cases, by giving consideration to the mind of an “ordinary prudent individual” (eg Caldwell at 354B-C and Lawrence at 526F, see also Lord Hailsham at 520H-521A). 
     
      
    55    This approach of Lord Diplock has been the subject of considerable criticism and has not generally been adopted in Australia (c/f R v Tolmie (1995) 37 NSWLR 660 at 670-672 per Kirby P). More recent English authorities have refused to apply the approach to other statutory provisions invoking a test of recklessness. (A range of materials is collected in Clarkson and Keating Criminal Law: Texts and Materials (4th ed 1998) at 154-184; see also R v Reid [1992] 1 WLR 793 at 805H, 817H). 
     
      
    56    The Lord Chancellor has recently traced the divergence and subsequent realignment of Australian and English jurisprudence on the issue of intention and recklessness in “The Mental Element in Crime: A Comparative Analysis of Australian and English Law” a speech by the Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom, Lord Irvine of Lairg, delivered at the University of Sydney’s Faculty of Law on 6 September 2000.  
     
      
    57    On the subject of Caldwell his Lordship described the decision in the following way at p6: 
     
      
       
        
        “The ruling was a radical departure from the traditional understanding of recklessness.” 
        
       
      
    58    His Lordship went on to note, at 7: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the time,  
        Caldwell 
         was criticised quite forcefully by Australian academic lawyers, whereas the Australian courts seem to have regarded it as going only to the interpretation of a specific statute, and so of no general significance. 
        
       
       
        
        The High Court has ignored  
        Caldwell 
         almost entirely. Exceptionally McHugh J’s judgment in  
        Royall v R 
         [(1991) 172 CLR 378 at 455] mentions  
        Caldwell 
         when considering the  
        mens rea 
         element of “reckless indifference to death” contained in s18 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW). However, like the rest of the High Court, he went on to reject an objective interpretation, ruling that the section requires foresight of the probability or likelihood of death.” 
        
       
      
    59    His Lordship went on to identify cases in which the word “reckless” may have been used in an objective sense but concluded at p7: 
     
      
       
        
        “Despite these divergent authorities, however, it is right to say that by the time of  
        Caldwell 
         the subjective meaning of recklessness was predominant in Australia. It had already been endorsed in a series of cases at State level and blessed by the High Court in such cases as  
        Vallance v R 
         [(1961) 108 CLR 56 at 64] and  
        Pemble v R 
         [(1971) 124 CLR 107 at 119].  
        Caldwell 
         elicited no change in this position.” 
        
       
      
    60    His Lordship concluded at p8: 
     
      
       
        
        “If  
        Caldwell 
         failed to take hold within the Commonwealth, its roots have proved shallow even in England. Although the decision exercised considerable influence during the 1980s, its importance has diminished. For example, it no longer governs the English law of manslaughter, rape, or assault. In effect, its application is now restricted to the offence in  
        Caldwell 
         itself (criminal damage), and to a few other statutory offences. Professor Ashworth has observed rightly, that ‘the  
        Caldwell 
         definition is now of little practical significance’. Subjective recklessness of the variety found in  
        Cunningham 
         and  
        Royall  
        now predominates and, once more, English law is aligned with Australian.” 
        
       
      
    61    The fate of Lord Diplock’s reasoning, as summarised by the Lord Chancellor in these passages, indicates that the Appellant’s reliance upon it, as such, was not auspicious. In the normal course, an Australian court will approach the construction of terminology of “recklessness” in a criminal statute on the basis that Parliament intended a subjective test to be applied. (See eg the authorities collected in Fisse “Howard’s Criminal Law” (5th ed) 1990 pp486-487 esp at fn14; Gillies Criminal Law (4th ed) 1997 at 59, 63-65, 66-67). Nevertheless each statutory formulation must be construed in its own context, having regard to the purpose of the particular legislative scheme. No different considerations arise in the process of construing a treaty. 
     
      
    62    In the present case, the relevant intention of Parliament is to implement Australia’s treaty obligations. The word “reckless” is found in Regulation 11 of Annex I of the Convention and its meaning in that Convention is what the Parliament of New South Wales intended to adopt. As noted above, pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the word “recklessly” in Regulation 11(b)(ii) must be given its ordinary meaning in its context and in the light of its object and purpose.  
     
      
    63    The most important textual indicator with respect to the proper construction of the word “recklessly” is that it is combined with an express qualification that it be accompanied by “knowledge that damage would probably result”, the “damage” here referred to being to the ship or its equipment, not the damage caused by any discharge of oil. This aspect of the context points, in my opinion, to the conclusion that actual advertence to the risk of damage by the owner or master involved in the incident is required. It is not material to inquire what a prudent person would consider might happen. 
     
      
    64    Assistance can be obtained from the case law on Article 25 of the Warsaw Convention concerning International Carriage by Air, as amended by the Hague Protocol of 1955. This Article provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result …” 
        
       
      
    65    As can be seen, the clause employs the same terminology as Regulation 11 of the 1973 Convention with which these proceedings are concerned, and may very well have been the source of the terminology for the drafters of the 1973 Convention. 
     
      
    66    At a time when Lord Diplock’s approach to the construction of the word “recklessly” in criminal statutes was more generally accepted in England, the Court of Appeal had to determine the proper meaning of the composite phrase in Article 25 of the Warsaw-Hague text in Goldman v Thai Airways International Ltd [1983] 1 WLR 1186. Eveleigh LJ referred to the observations of Lord Diplock in Caldwell and Lawrence (and to the supporting observations of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in Lawrence at 520), and said at 1194: 
     
      
       
        
        “One cannot therefore decide whether or not an act or omission is done recklessly without considering the nature of the risk involved. In the present case the omission relied upon was the failure to order seat belts to be fastened. The risk with which we are concerned, therefore, is the risk of injury to the passenger whose belt should have been fastened. If the article had stopped at the word ‘recklessly’, I would have been prepared to say that, on the judge’s findings, the plaintiff had proved his case. … However, the doing of the act or omission is not only qualified by the adverb ‘recklessly,’ but also by the adverbial phrase, ‘with knowledge that damage would probably result.’ If the pilot did not know that damage would probably result from his omission, I cannot see that we are entitled to attribute to him knowledge which another pilot might have possessed or which he himself should have possessed.” 
        
       
      
    67    It is not clear that his Lordship was intending to attribute a subjective meaning to the element “recklessly” alone ie in isolation from the subsequent reference to knowledge. However, that is suggested at 1196 when his Lordship said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the pilot’s omission to amount to recklessness, it is in my opinion necessary to show that he knew that prudent flying required him to illuminate the seat belt sign …” 
        
       
      
    68    Furthermore at p1199, his Lordship said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I understand article 25, it is not sufficient to show that he deliberately broke a regulation, even one which is designed for safety, unless it is also shown that he had knowledge that injury would probably result. While it is not necessary for my decision in this case, I would go further and say that it is in relation to that knowledge (and not to regulations themselves) that his conduct is to be judged in order to determine whether or not it was reckless.” 
        
       
      
    69    Purchas LJ said at 1202: 
     
      
       
        
        “I agree that the true interpretation of article 25 when it is read as a whole involves the proof of actual knowledge in the mind of the pilot at the moment at which the omission occurs, that the omission is taking place and that it does not involve probable damage of the sort contemplated in the article.” 
        
       
      
    70    Although not adopting the terminology of “subjective” and “objective” tests with respect to recklessness, terminology which had at that stage been criticised in the House of Lords, the reasoning and conclusion of the court in Goldman v Thai Airways supports a subjective test for the combined clause “recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result”.  
     
      
    71    This was how the decision was interpreted by Rogers CJ Comm D in SS Pharmaceutical Co Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (1988) 22 NSWLR 734 at 749-750. Rogers CJ Comm D noted that a divergence of approach had appeared with respect to this provision of the Warsaw Convention. His Honour referred to decisions of the French courts which applied an objective test, contrasting them with the subjective test applied in Belgium and Switzerland. Such divergence continues to exist (see Shawcross & Beaumont: Air Law (4th ed 1977-) Vol 1 at par 447). 
     
      
    72    In the appeal to this Court (SS Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Limited [1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 288), both the majority, Gleeson CJ and Handley JA, and the dissentient on the facts, Kirby P, adopted the reasoning in Goldman v Thai Airways. Gleeson CJ and Handley JA at 291 referred with approval to the passage from the judgment of Purchas LJ I have quoted above. The issue now before the Court - whether the test is objective or subjective - was raised in SS Pharmaceutical but not pressed at the hearing. (See 290 and 302). 
     
      
    73    In SS Pharmaceutical, Gleeson CJ and Handley JA referred to the submissions on Article 25 of the Warsaw Convention that were pressed and said, at 291: 
     
      
       
        
        “The submission was, in essence that what the respondent had to prove in the present case was both recklessness and actual subjective knowledge of the kind referred to in art. 25. That is, without doubt, a stringent requirement. It was described in argument as ‘a standard of highly reprehensible conduct’. We would not disagree with that, provided the more colourful description is not permitted to replace the language of the article as the test to be applied. Reference was also made to the juxtaposition in art. 25 of the concept of intent to cause damage and the concept which is of present relevance, the latter being said to take some of its colour from its relationship with the former. Again, so much may be accepted, provided the argument is not pressed beyond its proper limits. Plainly the second concept is different from the first, otherwise its presence would add nothing to the content of the article. Nevertheless it helps to reinforce the valid points that the state of mind involved goes beyond mere carelessness and that actual, as distinct from merely imputed, knowledge must be shown.” 
        
       
      
    74    The English Court of Appeal has subsequently affirmed the reasoning in Goldman v Thai Airways and SS Pharmaceutical, in Gurtner v Beaton [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 369 at 386-387 and Nugent v Michael Goss Aviation Ltd (Court of Appeal Civil Division, 15 April 2000, unreported). In Gurtner at 386 Neill LJ referred to Goldman v Thai Airways as finding that the test was “subjective”. In Nugent at p4 Auld LJ also interpreted Goldman v Thai Airways as “holding that the test of recklessness was subjective” and, at pp4 and 10, approved the passage from Purchas LJ which I have quote above. 
     
      
    75    This line of authority suggests that there is usually no point in treating separately the two elements of the formulation, as is done in the question posed for this Court. As Auld LJ said in Nugent: 
     
      
       
        
        “As a matter of proof the two will often stand or fall together, as happened in  
        Goldman;  
         see in particular per Eveleigh LJ at 1199F and 1200E and in  
        SS Pharmaceutical 
         per Gleeson CJ and Handley JA at 293. As so often, practical considerations of what a tribunal is prepared to infer as to a defendant’s state of mind may be more determinative than fine matters of principle of what one legal concept adds to another.” 
        
       
      
    76    It may have been practical considerations of this character that Kirby P had in mind when he said in SS Pharmaceutical at 302 that the phrase “recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result” involved “one composite concept”. Pearlman J correctly proceeded to assess the facts of the case which went to awareness of risk and awareness of probability of damage together. Her Honour was correct to do so in circumstances, which will almost invariably be the case, where there is no practical differentiation between facts going to one and facts going to another. 
     
      
    77    This Court is asked to differentiate the issues. Although it is possible to do this as a matter of analysis, it is unlikely that any practical consequence will follow. Nevertheless, question (ii)(a) should be answered as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to determine whether a person acted ‘recklessly’ for the purposes of s8(3)(b) it is not appropriate to inquire what a prudent person would consider might happen.” 
        
       
       
      Question ii(b): Did the Respondents Act Recklessly? 
       
      
    78    The Appellant submitted that it was not open for the trial judge to find, even on a subjective test, that the Respondents did not act “recklessly”. The Appellant contended that a question of law did arise in this regard. It relied in this respect on the evidence of an expert called by the Respondents and submitted that on the basis of that evidence Pearlman J should, as a matter of law, have concluded that the Defendants were reckless. It was submitted that her Honour could have come to no other conclusion. 
     
      
    79    The Appellants submitted that, by force of s8(6), the Respondents bore the onus of establishing all of the facts and matters required by way of defence under s8(2), including the proof that they did not fall within the exception to the defence, namely, that the damage to the ship or equipment was not “intentional damage” as defined in s8(3). It is appropriate to approach these proceedings on the assumption that the submission as to onus is correct.  
     
      
    80    The Appellant submitted that there was no evidence of an acceptable character in this respect. Specifically there was no evidence from the chief engineer as to his state of knowledge with respect to the issue of whether or not damage would probably result to the crane by reason of some omission or another. It was submitted that the evidence relevant to this issue from the captain of the ship did not discharge the relevant onus. (It must, of course, do so in the proceedings against him personally.) Furthermore, it was submitted by the Appellant that the evidence adduced on behalf of the Respondents that third parties had inspected and certified the operations of the crane was irrelevant. 
     
      
    81    These issues involve factual findings. It is possible to identify a question of law based on the proposition that no other finding was open. (See for example Attorney General (NSW) v X [2000] NSWCA 199 esp [56]-[63] and [118]-[128]). The issue in my opinion is whether or not only one finding was open. 
     
      
    82    The Appellant placed considerable reliance on the fact that the Respondents’ expert evidence supported the Appellant’s case in certain respects. That is not a determinative consideration. Merely because her Honour determined the matter in favour of the Respondents does not mean that her Honour was under any obligation to accept the whole of the evidence adduced on behalf of the Respondents. 
     
      
    83    Her Honour made a finding of fact that the master and the owner both had reason to believe that the hydraulic hose would probably not rupture by reason of the use of the crane. Her Honour based that inference on a number of findings of primary fact.  
     
      
    84    The first, was the fact that the owner had, to the knowledge of the master, engaged experts to carry out work on the crane both to assemble it and to test its operation. Her Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was reasonable in those circumstances for both the defendants to believe that the crane and its components would operate without mishap.” 
        
       
      
    85    Her Honour also referred to the fact that the crane had been installed for only six months and during that period had operated without failure. It may be that the longer the operation of the crane the more likely some form of failure by reason of abrasion and chafing should have been understood to be likely to occur. Nevertheless her Honour was entitled, in my opinion, to find that a period of only six months was not such as to give rise to concern in this respect.  
     
      
    86    Finally, her Honour referred to the fact that although it was a physical possibility to inspect the hoses at the point where her Honour found the rupture to have occurred, such inspection may not have revealed the abrasion and chafing which led to the actual rupture. 
     
      
    87    In my opinion, these matters, to which her Honour expressly referred, were facts and matters which her Honour was entitled to take into account and which did constitute evidence on the basis of which she could infer that the Respondents were not acting “recklessly”. It does not assist the Appellant’s case on the question of law as postulated, to submit that there was evidence of a different character which could give rise to a contrary inference. The choice was a matter for her Honour. It cannot be said that only one finding was open. The question should be answered: “Yes”.

     REGINA v A R D 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The background facts, the grounds of appeal and the submissions made to this Court appear in the judgment of Newman J which I have read in draft. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    2    For the reasons given by Newman J, Ground 1 should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2a 
       
      
    3    This ground is based on the failure of the trial judge to give the direction to which Dunford J referred in R v RAT [2000] NSWCCA 77. The relevant passage of Dunford J’s reasons is fully set out in the judgment of Newman J. I agree with both Newman J and Adams J that nothing in the High Court judgment of Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 requires a direction in this form. Nor do I understand Dunford J to suggest that a direction is necessarily required. A direction of the character to which his Honour refers may be appropriate, save insofar as his Honour suggests that the jury should be informed of the possible consequences on appeal of a finding of a particular character. (See Lucas v The Queen (1969-70) 120 CLR 171 at 175). 
     
      
    4    The parts of the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Jones upon which Dunford J based his observations included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of the events which was said to give rise to that count. … Whatever the explanation may be, however, the jury’s rejection of the complainant’s account on the second count diminished her overall credibility. The only reasonable conclusion is that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her evidence concerning the incident the subject of the second count.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third counts. There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.” (453) 
        
       
      
    5    Their Honour’s returned to this issue in their concluding remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant with respect to the second count lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown case on the first and third counts wore a different complexion. For it meant that, when her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof. 
        
       
       
        
        As we have already said, nothing in the complainant’s evidence gave any ground for thinking that the quality of her evidence was higher in respect of the first and third count than it was in respect to the second count. When the credibility factor is combined with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, the convictions on the first and third counts can only be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory.” (455) 
        
       
      
    6    Of particular significance for present purposes is the sentence in the second of the two passages which I have quoted to the effect that the evidence of the complainant “failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the standard of proof”, but that it did so only in the circumstance that “her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence”. In this passage their Honours directed attention to the other evidence in the particular case.  
     
      
    7    Their Honours were not, in my opinion, laying down a general rule that it is not open to a jury to acquit of one charge and convict of another whenever, to use Dunford J’s formulations, “the only direct evidence of the commission of the offence is that of the complainant” or “where there is no independent evidence of the commission of the offences”. The Court was indicating that where the evidence of a witness in one respect is not accepted on a beyond reasonable doubt standard, there must be a question whether other evidence by that witness should be accepted on the same standard. This is and remains a jury question and nothing the High Court said in Jones suggests otherwise. 
     
      
    8    As with many aspects of the process of weighing evidence, a judge may be able to assist the jury by drawing its attention to certain matters, even matters which would be regarded by many to be obvious. The proposition that a reasonable doubt about one aspect of a person’s evidence may, or in some cases should, affect the assessment of the reliability of that person’s other evidence, is in this category. 
     
      
    9    In some cases it will be appropriate for a trial judge to indicate to a jury that there is nothing to distinguish the evidence of a complainant on one charge from his or her evidence on another change. However, other relevant evidence or, indeed, the absence of evidence, will also be material in assessing the evidence of a complainant. Such evidence may be “indirect” but nevertheless sufficiently pertinent with respect to a particular charge so as to create a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury with respect, to the evidence of the complainant in a specific respect, without impinging upon the general assessment of the complainant’s truthfulness or reliability.  
     
      
    10    I do not understand Dunford J to have been proposing a direction which is mandatory in any sense. Rather, I understand his Honour to have been suggesting a course of prudence, indicated by the outcome in Jones itself, which involved a recurring situation in sexual assault cases where the only direct evidence is that of the complainant. I agree with Dunford J that it will often be prudent, and sometimes necessary, to assist the jury in this way. 
     
      
    11    In Jones Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ were not intending to lay down a specific rule for inconsistency of verdicts in sexual assault cases which was different to the approach which Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ had adumbrated in MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 esp at 365-369. 
     
      
    12    Submissions to similar effect to those in the present case were considered by this Court in R v Robinson [2000] NSWCCA 59, handed down one week after RAT. In that case Fitzgerald JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[8] In his judgment, par [60], Barr J has summarised the material directions to the jury in the following terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The jury were directed that they should consider each count separately. They were told that they might accept part of what the witness said and reject part. They were told that witnesses might be mistaken or might lie in some respects but not in others. They were told to scrutinise the evidence of the complainant with great care because the Crown depended on his evidence alone. They were told that when assessing the reliability of a witness they were entitled to take account of the demeanour of the witness and the impression made by that witness upon them.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [9] Directions to that affect are, of course, common. However, they are not always sufficient. The circumstances might be such that the jury should also be instructed that if they hold a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant’s demeanour or for any other reason, they must take that into account in assessing the reliability of his or her evidence in relation to other counts. This was such a case.” 
        
       
      
    13    His Honour went on to refer to the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Jones. I agree with Fitzgerald JA that there are cases in which a direction of this character is appropriate. It is not, the case that such a direction is required in every case where there is no direct independent evidence of the commission of an offence. (See also R v Crisologo (1997) 99 ACrimR 178 at 184 per Simpson J; R v Steenson [2000] NSWCCA 143 at [15]-[16] per Simpson J). 
     
      
    14    If a judge has made an express direction of this kind, an appellate Court will be more confident that the jury has taken into account their own reluctance, for whatever reason, to accept a complainant’s evidence on one charge, with respect to his or her general credit, and applied that assessment to each other charge. That does not, however, mean that the failure to give such a direction is of itself an error of law. The issue falls to be assessed, as in Jones itself, together with other aspects of the case, in determining whether the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory, to use the terminology employed in Jones, before the High Court emphasised the desirability of employing the terminology of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act in Fleming v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 250. (See R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53 at [31]-[44]). This is the subject of Ground 2. Ground 2a is not made out as a separate ground of appeal, for the further reasons which appear in my consideration of Ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
        
       
      
    15    In my opinion, Ground 2 should be dismissed. 
     
      
    16    The jury were given careful instructions that they had to treat each count separately. At the commencement of his summing-up the trial judge said at pp1-2: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The Crown brings the charge and the Crown has to prove it in each of the cases - 21 separate trials which must be tried as if you were 21 separate juries. You must consider each case absolutely independently without being influenced by whatever verdict you come to in any of the others and there is no need for all the verdicts to be the same in any way. Subject to matters of commonsense each verdict must be decided entirely on the facts that relate to that case.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        … but the essential guiding principle about each of these cases is that each case must be decided in its own compartment.” 
        
       
      
    17    Subsequently the trial judge qualified his statement to consider each case within its own compartment, by noting that the assessment of credibility of a witness could be made “by his or her overall impression during the case” (p15). Consistently with this ruling his Honour directed the jury at p3: 
     
      
       
        
        “… all 12 of you must agree what the verdict ought to be in each individual case and having decided on one case you would then move on to consider the next case.” 
        
       
      
    18    In terms of the approach to assessing the credibility of witnesses, relevantly that of the complainant, his Honour directed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The verdict which you return will be one which simply means that in any given case, if it were to be a verdict of not guilty, and I am only using this as an example, would mean that you do not find the Crown case proved. It would not mean in that case that you are making any positive finding that the complainant, the woman who had brought the charge is lying. Even though she is really the only Crown witness, even in that circumstance any verdict of not guilty does not mean that there would be any repercussions such as a charge of perjury or anything of that nature. You may rest assure that your verdict if it were a verdict of not guilty, would certainly mean that you have not found the Crown case proved beyond reasonable doubt and nothing more would flow from that.” (pp4-5). 
        
       
      
    19    His Honour also went on to caution the jury from acting on the uncorroborated evidence of each complainant in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in each of the cases here, each of the first 20 cases at least, the Crown case depends entirely on the evidence of one witness, that is the young woman as she then was, the woman as she now is, who is making the complaint. You may act on her word alone but you must exercise considerable caution before doing so. In any case in which the Crown case depends on the evidence of only one witness, you must scrutinise the Crown case with particular care.” 
        
       
      
    20    These directions were not, relevantly, the subject of any complaint. The nature of these directions were such as to require the jury to carefully differentiate the evidence with respect to each individual case. Where the jury’s verdict involves acquittals and convictions and it is possible to identify a proper basis of differentiation, then the differing verdicts is a manifestation of the jury attending properly to its function, rather than a manifestation of inconsistency of a character which would justify intervention on appeal. 
     
      
    21    Of central significance in all six of the relevant counts - 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 - was the evidence of RD Junior. Despite the significance of her credit on all counts it does not follow that a failure to convict on some of the counts represented a rejection in a general sense of the reliability of R D Junior as a witness. (c/f Jones supra at 453 and 455 as quoted above). 
     
      
    22    Each count had to be treated separately. When an individual is recalling prior events - particularly after many years - it is open to a jury to accept that person’s evidence as being more accurate with respect to some incidents than others. It is, in my opinion, wrong to suggest that a failure to find that the Crown has established a particular charge beyond reasonable doubt, necessarily impugns the reliability of that witness with respect to other matters. This is particularly the case where, as here, the jury were specifically directed to treat the complainant’s evidence with caution and to scrutinise her evidence with particular care. Such caution and care is required to be shown with respect to each charge separately. Differentiation by a jury between separate charges should not be seen as a relevant inconsistency where there is a rational basis for such differentiation unless, as in Jones, there is some basis for concluding that the jury may not have taken into account the fact that they held a reasonable doubt about the witnesses evidence or one count when assessing his or her reliability on other counts. 
     
      
    23    Counts 11 and 14 were, in my opinion, distinguishable from each of the four counts with respect to which a conviction was recorded by reason of the significance in the factual matrix of Counts 11 and 14 of RD Senior. In the case of both Counts 11 and 14 the jury would have expected corroboration for RD Senior and it was not forthcoming. 
     
      
    24    The jury can have been in no doubt that RD Senior was a witness hostile to the Appellant. Not only was she the principal witness with respect to Count 21, she gave significant corroborative detail, contradicting the case sought to be made by the accused, with respect to other charges. These included: 
     
      
       
      (i) Evidence that the Defendant had shorts called “stubbies” which did have a zipper, which contradicted the Appellant’s position with respect to Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
       
       
      (ii) Confirmation that his truck had a bed in the back and that RD Senior and the Appellant had had sex in that bed, which contradicted the Appellant’s position with respect to Count 17. 
       
       
      (iii) Confirmation that RD Junior helped the Appellant to construct fences, which was relevant to Counts 17 and 18. 
       
      
    25    The evidence of RD Junior with respect to Count 11 was that it occurred during a period where RD Senior was ill or convalescing. RD Junior gave evidence to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q … was there a time when your Aunty got you to feed the birds for her? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes she did yes.” 
        
       
      
    26    The evidence of RD Senior at the trial contradicted the evidence on this material circumstantial fact given by RD Junior. In her evidence in chief RD Senior said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q When you are away who looked after the birds, do you know? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well my sons as far as I know.” 
        
       
      
    27    During cross examination RD Senior directly contradicted the evidence of the complainant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q When you had this misfortune to be sick following your father’s passing away you left it to your two sons to look after your budgerigars and other birds. 
        
       
       
        
        A I assumed they were. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You didn’t make any arrangement with anybody to go and look after the birds? 
        
       
       
        
        A No sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Just hoped they’d do it? 
        
       
       
        
        A I assumed they would they were old enough.” 
        
       
      
    28    In view of this direct contradiction between RD Junior and RD Senior with respect to the circumstances of Count 11, there was in my opinion a relevant basis for differentiation upon which the jury could distinguish Count 11 from other counts. That differentiation was based on the surrounding circumstances of the specific incident. It was not of a kind which damaged the credibility of RD Junior on all counts. 
     
      
    29    Counts 12, 13 and 14 occurred on the same weekend. Counts 12 and 13 related to incidents on the Saturday night at the property. Count 14 involved an incident on the Sunday. The evidence in chief of RD Junior was that she had been driven to the property by RD Senior: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Do you recall on one occasion you went out there with your Aunt? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Did you stay the weekend” 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Did Robin pick you up from your house and drive you out there with her son Gary? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes.” 
        
       
      
    30    Although RD Junior gave evidence that she shared a room with Gary, there was no evidence that RD Senior was there for the whole of the weekend. RD Junior did not assert in her evidence in chief that RD Senior was there on the Saturday night when the offences in Counts 12 and 13 occurred. This is of some significance when differentiating these two counts from Count 14, because RD Junior’s evidence about the aftermath of this incident did involve RD Senior, when she and the Appellant returned from the area of the dam to the house. It was RD Senior’s evidence that during the relevant time, when the house on the property was under construction, she herself did not stay the night at the property. She said that she went up there on weekends but left in the afternoon: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q While the house was being built did you visit it from time to time at Warombi? 
        
       
       
        
        A I went out there on weekends. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You didn’t want to live in a caravan during the week? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Would it be true to say that you were there most weekends until the time you left. 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah of an afternoon yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Of an afternoon? 
        
       
       
        
        A Afternoon I’d leave. 
        
       
       
        
        Q I’m sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        A Afternoon I’d leave in the afternoon. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You’d leave where? 
        
       
       
        
        A The farm to go home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What afternoon would you leave? 
        
       
       
        
        A Sunday. 
        
       
       
        
        Q But on weekends until Sunday afternoons you’d be at the farm? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well I go home.” 
        
       
      
    31    There may be some ambiguity at the end of this passage as to whether or not she stayed on Saturday afternoons. This was clarified on the next page in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You’d be there on the weekend? 
        
       
       
        
        A I didn’t stay, I’d go back to Mum’s and come back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q So you were there during the day? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Then you’d go back then you’d come back the next day? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes.” 
        
       
      
    32    It was open to the jury to find that there was doubt as to whether RD Senior was present on the Saturday night when the offences in Counts 12 and 13 occurred. The jury may well have permissibly reasoned that there was nothing in the failure of RD Senior to give evidence about that occasion which could lead them to doubt the accuracy of the recollection of RD Junior with respect to those matters. 
     
      
    33    The position is otherwise with respect to Count 14. In that respect RD Junior in her evidence in chief directly implicated RD Senior in the immediate aftermath of that incident. 
     
      
    34    R D Junior’s evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q When you got up got on the bike and back to the house you went Saturday night? 
        
       
       
        
        A I was crying at first. Allan got onto the bike and I got onto the bike. As he was riding it up he stopped, I jumped off and ran straight over to my Aunty and asked her if she could take me home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q She said she would? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Were you still crying? 
        
       
       
        
        A A little bit. 
        
       
       
        
        Q A little bit? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Didn’t she ask you why? 
        
       
       
        
        A No she didn’t, no.” 
        
       
      
    35    Notwithstanding RD Senior’s preparedness to give evidence confirming the surrounding detail of the offences of which RD Junior gave evidence involving other counts, RD Senior gave no evidence with respect to Count 14, in a context where RD Junior’s recollection pointedly involved her in the immediate aftermath of the offence when RD Junior said she was still crying and asked to be taken home. Not only did RD Senior not recollect any such incident she did not appear to have any memory that RD Junior or TD had ever been present at the farm in the following, equivocal, passage of evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Did you see any of the girls at the farm when you were out there? 
        
       
       
        
        A No sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Never? 
        
       
       
        
        A No  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q So the other two younger girls you didn’t see at all? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q At any stage? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well they might have now and then. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Not that you took any notice? 
        
       
       
        
        A No take no notice.” 
        
       
      
    36    In my opinion there was a rational basis for the differentiation which the jury apparently drew. It was a basis which did not necessarily lead the jury to doubt the general credibility of RD Junior. It was a manifestation of the jury treating her evidence with the caution, and subjecting it to the careful scrutiny, which they were expressly directed to do. I do not find any reason to doubt that a jury which approached its task in this careful way, would have taken into account the fact that RD Junior’s evidence on Counts 11 and 14 did not satisfy them, when assessing her general credit on the other counts. The analysis in Jones discussed in relation to Ground 2a does not apply in this case. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    37    With regard to the additional evidence of DG, it does appear that if that evidence had been given at the trial, the defence could have made submissions with respect to certain aspects of the reliability of the evidence of LC about Count 20, the sole count involving her. 
     
      
    38    LC was the grand-daughter of DG. Her evidence was that the incident in Count 20 had occurred at her grandmother’s house where RD Senior and her son G were then living. She identified the period as being at the commencement of 1988, a time when DG was away on holidays. DG’s evidence was that she did take a holiday during the early part of 1988 but that RD Senior and her son G did not move in until late 1988 and that she did not take any holiday while they lived with her. 
     
      
    39    In cases of this character, reliability with respect to collateral facts is a legitimate subject of cross-examination and will sometimes determine the attitude of a trier of fact to the credibility of the witness upon the central issue. Adams J identifies the absence of the grandmother on holidays as being a crucial part of the narrative of events. I do not agree. There was no suggestion that the grandmother being away on holidays was the only possible occasion on which LC could have been alone in the house with AD. It was, however, evidence which, if adduced at trial, may have assisted the defence by casting some doubt on the reliability of LC with respect to contextual detail. 
     
      
    40    I have, on balance, concluded that no miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the failure to call DG at the trial. It appears from the evidence presented in this Court that a tactical decision had been made not to call DG.  
     
      
    41    Mr Meehan, AD’s solicitor at the trial, gave evidence in this Court that: 
     
      
       
        
        “By the commencement of the trial, the appellant felt that he could not trust any member of his family as he believed that they were all in the conspiracy with his brother E and his nieces.” 
        
       
      
    42    Senior Counsel who appeared for AD at the trial, Mr M J Finnane QC, said in an affidavit in this Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I have some recollection that Mr Meehan mentioned to me a suggestion from Mr D that we should speak to Mrs G. Mr Meehan spoke to Mrs G himself and told me and Mr Maiden of his conversation. What he told us convinced me that there was no point in having any further discussion with Mr G.” 
        
       
      
    43    Mr Maiden was the junior counsel at the trial. In an affidavit filed in this Court he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I did become aware that DG did attend the court during the trial. I understand that Mr Meehan spoke to her and took instructions. There was a meeting between Mr Finnane, Mr Meehan and myself regarding Mrs G. It was decided that it was dangerous to call Mrs G and indeed she would not help the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    44    In the light of this tactical decision not to call DG, a decision which has not been shown to be affected by any form of relevant error, there was no miscarriage of justice by the failure to adduce evidence from DG on one only of the twenty counts. Indeed to allow the appeal on this basis would be an indirect way of challenging the joinder of Count 20 to the other counts, the subject of Ground 1. This, as I will show below, was a carefully adopted strategy by the defence. 
     
      
    45    Even if I had come to the conclusion that a new trial was justified on Count 20, I would not have accepted the submission that such a decision should impinge on the convictions on the other counts. 
     
      
    46    The evidence of AD with respect to Count 20 was the barest of denials. The possibility that the rejection of such a denial may affect the jury’s acceptance of the evidence of AD on other matters was inherent in the hearing of Count 20 together with the other counts. The decision to permit this course to occur was made by three senior counsel who successively represented AD.  
     
      
    47    The original counsel was Mr C Porter QC who, according to the affidavit of Mr Meehan, AD’s solicitor throughout, considered the positive and negative aspects of hearing the charges together. According to the evidence of Mr Meehan: 
     
      
       
        
        “The main positive reasons to run one trial were: 
        
       
      
    · The appellant gave evidence once; 
     
      
    · The appellant’s evidence should then remain strong; 
     
      
    · There was a risk if more than two trials run back to back; 
     
      
    · Large number of charges could support the conspiracy theory? 
     
      
    · The victims give evidence one and there is a better chance of making inroads into their evidence, than if they get better with being in the witness box often.” 
     
      
    48    Mr Meehan said that Mr Milne QC confirmed this advice. Subsequently Mr Finnane QC who appeared at the trial also turned his mind to the issue and came to the same conclusion.  
     
      
    49    The tactical considerations set out in this evidence were, of course, balanced by risks, one of which would have been the impact of the acceptance of the evidence of any one witness upon the credibility of the accused. In these circumstances, I conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the merest of possibilities that the jury might have reasoned in the way suggested. 
     
      
    50    As I have indicated above, the trial judge gave the jury the firmest of directions about the need to assess each count separately. With respect to the two counts of which the jury acquitted the Appellant, they showed that they approached their task in this respect appropriately. 
     
      
    51    In my opinion the appeal should not be allowed by reason of the fresh evidence of DG or on the basis of the evidence adduced in this Court by RD Senior. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    52    Newman J and Adams J come to opposite conclusions on the issue of duplicity. The issue turns on two distinct pieces of evidence which the Crown alleged AD sought RD Senior to give. The first was to deny that there was a bed in his truck. The second was that she had heard AD’s brother E say that he would procure his daughter to make false charges. 
     
      
    53    It was the Appellant’s submission that some members of the jury could have found that one of the statements was made and others could have found that the other of the statements was made and, accordingly, that there was no unanimity about the particular act. I do not read his Honour’s instructions to the jury in this way. In my opinion, the matter was left to the jury on the basis that they had to find that both of the statements had been made by him.  
     
      
    54    His Honour’s relevant directions were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The things which are contained in the statements said to be made by the accused, on which the Crown relies, are firstly he asked Mrs RD Senior to say that there was no bed in his truck … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the Crown says he asked her to say that she sat around the table with E, that is his brother E, and that she was brought into the conversation with his two daughters and that they were ‘going to have me charged with rape’.” 
        
       
      
    55    The reference to the “things which are contained in the statements”, and the introduction of the two matters by “firstly” and “secondly”, do not suggest to the jury that either of these particular statements would do. In the manner in which the matter was left to the jury, it appears to me that the Crown undertook an unnecessary burden of establishing that both the relevant statements were made. 
     
      
    56    In any event, even if the Appellant’s characterisation of the summing-up was appropriate, I would not intervene. Issues of duplicity depend on the precise nature of the offence and often involve questions of characterisation on which reasonable minds may differ. 
     
      
    57    The offence is created by s319 of the Crimes Act 1900 which states: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who does any act, or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.” 
        
       
      
    58    Section 312 contains a definition: 
     
      
       
        
        “312 A reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law.” 
        
       
      
    59    The issue turns on the level of generality at which the offence is stated. Is it sufficient for a jury to convict on the basis that it accepts that AD sought to convince RD Senior to give false evidence? Or is it necessary for the jury to agree on the particular evidence of a false character which AD sought to procure? 
     
      
    60    The offence created by s319 is committed when a person, intending to pervert the course of justice, induces another to give false evidence even in circumstances where the first person does not specify the nature of the false evidence to be given. This was the case, for example, in R v Andrews [1973] QB 422 where the person accused of the common law offence of incitement to pervert the course of justice said in response to the question, “What do you mean? What are you getting at?” only, “It is obvious isn’t it? I’m in your hands.” 
     
      
    61    Where, as here, the person accused of this particular offence provides some detail as to the nature of the false evidence, that is a matter of particulars. The offence is committed by reason of a single “act”, namely, the inducement to provide false evidence, stated at that level of generality. The legal definition of the crime does not require the Crown to prove, as an essential ingredient of the offence, the specific nature of the false evidence. See generally R v Leivers and Ballinger (1998) 101 ACrimR 175 at 182-188. 
     
      
    62    Furthermore, as Newman J notes the present case has some similarities to R v Hamzy (1994) 74 ACrimR 341, where the Crown sought to establish a single count of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin by a large number of witnesses who said the appellant had supplied him with various amounts of heroin over a twenty month period. (See also R v Te [1998] 3 VR 566 esp at 578). 
     
      
    63    In Hamzy, Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Abadee and Simpson JJ agreed, said at 348-349: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the Crown is entitled to plead in the one count a charge of supply where it intends to prove a number of individual acts of supply by the accused to different people at different times, provided that those acts can fairly and properly be identified as part of the same criminal enterprise or the one criminal activity, but the trial court has power to direct the Crown either to elect or to separate the offences where the indictment would otherwise produce an unfairness to the accused. Where objection is taken to the indictment, the trial judge should apply commonsense and decide what is fair in the circumstances  
        DPP v Merriman 
         [1973] AC 584-593. In  
        R v Eades 
         (1991) 57 ACrimR 152 at 156, the Victorian Full Court said that the question as to how to frame an indictment when more than one act is involved is ultimately one of fact and degree … 
        
       
       
        
        It is nevertheless submitted by the appellant that the form of the indictment in the present case produced an unfairness to him, as the individual acts of supply proved in the present case could not fairly and properly be identified as part of the same criminal enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        I see no reason why the concept of one criminal enterprise or one criminal activity should be interpreted narrowly. Obviously enough, the fewer the number of individual acts, the fewer people and the shorter the period of time involved, the less likely that there could be any unfairness to the accused, but the issue on fairness is dealt with separately from the issue as to whether the individual acts could fairly and properly be so identified. …” 
        
       
      
    64    In the present case there is no relevant unfairness to the Appellant. The nature of the evidence was not such as to lead to any distinction between the two matters left to the jury as suggestions that AD made to RD Senior to give false evidence: first that there was no bed in the truck and secondly to say that his brother had told the three complainants to fabricate false allegations. 
     
      
    65    There was no basis for suggesting - nor was any propounded in the submissions to this Court - that any member of the jury could have rejected the making of one statement and accepted the making of the other. No doubt for that reason, no relevant re-direction was sought at trial. There is no basis, in my opinion, for a conclusion that the jury verdict lacked unanimity. 
     
      
    66    Analogous issues arose in R v Rowell [1978] 1 WLR 132 in which the defendant was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The defendant had taken a number of different steps to support a false allegation of robbery. Omerod LJ said at 138: 
     
      
       
        
        “… all the defendant’s acts, his two false statements to the police accusing the man, described but not identified by name, of robbery, the placing of the toy pistol in the bus, and the arranging that it should be found by Cronin, are all part of a course of conduct, between the dates alleged, which had a tendency and, as the jury must have found, was intended to pervert the course of justice. That it did in fact cause a grave injustice to Timms who was wrongfully arrested and detained in custody for several days is beyond question. No question of duplicity in the indictment, therefore, arises.” 
        
       
      
    67    In R v Morex Meat Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 78 ACrimR 269 the Queensland Court of Appeal was concerned with a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice, contrary to s43 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), of which charge eight separate acts were given as particulars. The Court referred to Rowell supra and their Honours, McPherson JA, Pincus JA and White J, concluded at 292: 
     
      
       
        
        “We consider that the appellant Douk was properly charged in count 17 with, and convicted of, a single offence of attempting (or ‘tending’) to pervert the course of justice, of which the particulars of the relevant element of that offence consisted of the eight acts identified by the prosecution at the trial, and the proof of that tendency consisted of the evidence in support of any one or more of those eight acts which the jury were persuaded beyond reasonable doubt to accept.” 
        
       
      
    68    The reasoning in Rowell and Morex Meat apply to an offence under s319 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    69    In his summing-up to the jury the trial judge directed the jury at the appropriate level of generality. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has to prove three things. Firstly, that he offered her $10,000. Secondly, that this was in order for her to give false evidence about one or more of the first 19 charges in respect of which you had already decided that there is a verdict of guilty. And thirdly, that he intended thereby to pervert the course of justice.” 
        
       
      
    70    I agree with Newman J that Ground 4 should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    71    NEWMAN J: This is an appeal against the appellant’s conviction on nineteen counts after a trial which commenced on 16 March 1999 in the District Court at Campbelltown. The appellant was indicted on twenty-one counts the jury finding him not guilty on counts eleven and fourteen of the indictment. 
     
      
    72    Twenty of the counts on the indictment involved allegations that the appellant had committed sexual offences against three girls, all of whom were related to him in varying degree. Two of the girls T and R were his nieces being children of his brother E. The third girl L was the niece of his former wife, RD. 
     
      
    73    In relation to the girl T the appellant was indicted on five counts of non-consensual sexual intercourse with a person under the age of sixteen years, one count (count eight) of attempted sexual intercourse and two counts of committing acts of indecency against her (counts six and seven). 
     
      
    74    The allegations relating to the girl R involved eight counts of non-consensual sexual intercourse with a person under the age of sixteen years, one count of indecent assault (count eleven) and one count of having non-consensual sexual intercourse with R while in company with his son S. Again, the allegation was that R was under the age of sixteen years at the time (count eighteen). 
     
      
    75    Count twenty on the indictment involved an allegation that the appellant had non-consensual sexual intercourse with L, again alleging that L was under the age of sixteen years at the time of the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    76    Count twenty-one on the indictment involved an allegation that the appellant offered his former wife, RD, money in order for her to give false evidence at court with the intention of perverting the course of justice. 
     
      
    77    As I have said, the jury found the appellant guilty of nineteen of the allegations contained in the indictment, finding him not guilty on counts eleven and fourteen, namely the count of committing an indecent assault upon R (count eleven) and count fourteen which involved an allegation that the appellant had had non-consensual sexual intercourse with R. 
     
      
    78    His Honour Judge Moore sentenced the appellant to a total term of ten years consisting of a minimum term of seven years six months and an additional term of two years six months. 
     
      
    79    The Crown case may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
      The complainant T gave evidence that she was born on 3 January 1972. She said that her parents were AD and ED. Her family had moved to a south western suburb of Sydney in 1985. She said that she had two brothers and two sisters. She said that her father had two brothers, the appellant and G. She said that when she was living in south western Sydney her home was about two minutes drive from the appellant. She said that the appellant used to come to her place “at least every day”. She said that RD was the appellant’s wife. She said that the appellant had three children, C, L, and G. 
       
       
      She recalled that in February 1985 shortly after she had moved to the south western suburb of Sydney the appellant came to her house. She said that she was in the lounge room with her sister R and she was still wearing school uniform at that time. At about 3.0 pm the appellant arrived in his truck and came to the house. He came in and sat on the lounge. She said that the appellant grabbed her from behind and pulled her down onto the ground and sat on top of her. She said that she asked him to stop it and she was screaming and he started spitting in her mouth to muffle her screaming. He then put his hand into her pants and groping inside her vagina. She said that R was trying to pull him off her. 
       
       
      She said that while R was trying to pull him off she noticed that the appellant had got R down on the ground. He was fondling with her breasts and then she saw his hands touching over her underwear, over her uniform and rubbing her vagina. Later she heard her father’s truck pull up. The appellant got up and just walked out and sat at the kitchen table as if nothing had happened. She said that her mother was not at home when this incident occurred. 
       
       
      She recalled there was an incident which happened a few years after the one mentioned above. She said it was about 3.30 pm after school and she was still wearing her school uniform. The appellant came into the lounge room in the house and sat beside her. He put his hand on her leg and said to her “How you going baby” and asked her to go and put the kettle on. As she got up the appellant pulled her from behind. She remembered that she hit the floor with a hard bang. He jumped onto her chest and pulled his penis out of his pants. He tried to shove it in her mouth. After that he started moving down towards her stomach and pulled her underwear down to her ankles. She was yelling at him to stop it and to get off her but he continued and tried to put his penis inside her vagina. 
       
       
      She recalled that around Christmas 1986 when she was in the lounge room in her home with her sister R she said that the appellant came in the lounge room and put his penis out of his pants and pushed it into her mouth. After that he pulled out his wallet and he threw $5 at her and said, “That’s for a job well done.” 
       
       
      She recalled that around Christmas time on a Saturday in 1986 she remembered she went to the appellant’s house and washed his truck and was paid $10. On the following day she said the appellant came to her house. She said that everybody was at home but they were outside, however she was in the lounge room watching television. She said that the appellant put his penis in her mouth. When the noise of the closing of the back door was heard, the appellant then walked out of the room as if nothing had happened. Before he left he gave her $5 and said “here’s some money for you.” 
       
       
      She recalled there was an occasion which occurred a few weeks before her brother G died on 7 July 1987 when the appellant came to her home. She said she and her sister R were there. He said “look girls look what I’ve got for you”. She saw his hands were wrapped around his penis and he was stroking and pulling it. She gave him a filthy look and walked off. 
       
       
      She recalled three days after the above incident happened, she was again in the lounge room watching television. She said the appellant stood at the door and had his penis out of his pants rubbing it. 
       
       
      She recalled that an incident happened around the end of August which was a few months prior to the death of her brother M who died in a motor cycle accident on 17 October 1989. She said that she was in the outside toilet of the house and the appellant came in. He took his penis out and tried to put it into her mouth but it did not penetrate her mouth. She said that she punched him in the testicles. She pushed him out and she got out the door. She said she was seventeen years old at that time. 
       
       
      She said that she had told nobody what had happened to her over that five year period as she was ashamed of what happened. She thought that it was her fault. 
       
       
      In cross-examination she said that she went to the police in 1997 with R and it was being suggested by her parents. She saw Operation Paradox on television and it was the first time that she had talked about it. She did not see a doctor or social worker. 
       
       
      The complainant R gave evidence that she was born on 13 February 1975. She said that she was nine years old when she moved to a south western suburb of Sydney. She was in Year 3 at that time. She said that the appellant was a very strong man. She said that about a month after she moved the appellant came up to her home. She said that she was sharing the room with her younger sister K at that time. While she was sleeping in bed the appellant came to her room. He put his knee on her leg and held her down. He then took her underpants off. She was crying and the appellant told her to shut up or something would happen to her. He forced her legs apart and put his penis in her vagina. She was crying. He pulled his penis out of her vagina and ejaculated over her stomach. 
       
       
      She recalled that two months after that incident she was in the lounge room at home after school with her sister T. She was wearing her school uniform. Later the appellant came in his truck. He asked T to make a cup of coffee. When she got up the appellant grabbed hold of her arm and pushed her to the floor. She saw the appellant’s his hands moving up T’s legs and T was crying. She asked the appellant to get off. R then started hitting him and getting him off T. He then grabbed hold of her by her arm and pulled her to the floor. He got on top of her and pulled her underpants down. He then put his penis in her vagina. 
       
       
      Count 11 was an allegation involving an incident which R said happened when she was in her fifth grade at school in 1986 or 1987. She said that she had an aunt called RD who lived in Sydney and bred budgerigars. She remembered one day she went with the appellant in his four wheel drive to see the aunt. After feeding the budgies she asked the appellant “can I go home?” and he said “no, just a minute, won’t be long”. As she was walking to the door the appellant grabbed hold of her and pushed her to the floor. She said that the appellant was feeling her breasts over her T-shirt. She said “no, I don’t want to do this”. The jury found the appellant not guilty on this count. 
       
       
      Next she recalled the appellant had a farm on the edge of the Sydney urban area. She said that she went there when she was in Year 8 and that was in 1989. She was thirteen years old. She said he went there on a weekend with her aunt R. She said that her aunt picked her up from her house and drove her out there with her son G. She said that she was sharing a room with G. She slept at the bottom of the bunks. She went to bed at about 10 pm and that during the night, being a Saturday night, the appellant stood beside the bed. He woke her by pulling the sheet back. He then grabbed hold of her, walked her out into the lounge room. He pushed her to the floor and pulled her track pants off and her underpants came off and she said “stop”. She said she was on her knees and he pulled his penis out, pushed her face towards his penis and made her suck his penis. He then pulled her head away and pushed her to the floor and put his penis into her vagina. After that he ejaculated onto her stomach. That was a Saturday night. 
       
       
      She said that on the following day she said the appellant asked her to get on the bike and she replied “no, I don’t want to”. He said, “just get on the bike” and she then got on to the bike. He stopped his bike in the shrub at the back of the dam. He pushed her onto the bushed and pulled his shorts down. She remembered she was thirteen and a half years old. The appellant rubbed his hand up and down his penis until it got erect and he then put his penis into her vagina. Later he ejaculated. Later he returned to the aunt’s home and she drove R home. She remembered when she was still behind the dam before he got back on the bike, he said to her “don’t say anything or something will happen to her”. These allegations related to count 14 on which count the jury found the appellant not guilty. 
       
       
      She recalled that there was an occasion when her father was helping dig a dam. She said that she went out with her father and the appellant was also there. She said that when she was in the kitchen he asked her whether the kettle was boiled yet and she said “no”. She said that he grabbed hold of her and then pulled his penis out and pushed her onto her knees and sucked his penis. He then grabbed hold of her and pushed her into his room and pushed her onto the mat and then put his penis into her vagina. After he had finished he said to her “if you say anything I’ll do something to you or to your father”. 
       
       
      She recalled there was an incident which happened around February 1990. She said that she was in Year 8. She recalled on a Friday night the appellant asked her father whether she could go out with him to mend the deer fences and dad said yes. He was in a Hino truck with the appellant. She said that there were two seats in it and there was a bed in the back behind the two seats. It was a mattress and like a quilt sort of thing over the mattress. She went to the back of the bed and he got up onto the seat on his knees. He got up in the back where she was and put his knees in between her legs and put his penis into her vagina. She said that she was screaming. He then ejaculated onto the mattress. She ran away and he told her to get back into the truck. She said “no” and he said “get back into the truck”. She did. He started to drive back to his farm. Upon arrival she said that her sister R and brother G were in bed and she did not tell anyone what happened to her. 
       
       
      She recalled about three weeks after that incident had occurred she went out to the farm. She said that she was helping to put up deer fences. She said that her father, the appellant and his son S and a mater of the appellant were there. She said that it was in summer of 1990. Later her father went with a mate of the appellant to get some lunch. At that time there was only herself, the appellant and S. She said that the appellant grabbed hold of her and dragged her towards the house into G’s room. The appellant pushed S onto her and she was yelling “no, I don’t want to do this, no”. He said to S “come on, join in”. The appellant had ripped her clothes off and pulled his shorts and underpants off. S put his erect penis into her vagina. He got off and walked outside of the house and the appellant got on top of her and put his penis into her vagina. She said that while S was doing this the appellant was rubbing his hand up and down his penis. He said that she did not tell her father what had happened. 
       
       
      She recalled that in early 1991 before her sixteenth birthday the appellant came over to her house. She said that she was in the room by herself. The appellant came in and pushed her to the floor and pulled his underpants down. He pushed her legs apart and put his penis into her vagina. 
       
       
      As to count 20 the complainant L gave evidence that she was born on 13 August 1975. In 1987 she was living in the same south western suburb as the other complainants with her mother and stepfather. Her mother has a sister who is RD and married to the appellant. She recalled there was an occasion when she visited her grandmother’s home and the appellant arrived in a tipper truck. This was in 1988. She was in the bathroom and he came in and undid her blouse, kissed her breast and she just stood there frozen. He put his hand up her skirt and rubbed her vagina with his hands and then put his fingers inside her vagina. She said that it was in early summer of 1988 and she was twelve at that time. She said that she had told her school friend, JC about this. 
       
       
      Count 21 relied upon the evidence of RD Snr. Her evidence was that at about 4.30 pm she had a telephone conversation with the appellant in which he said to her “I need to see you urgently tonight. I’m up for a number of counts of rape. Ernie got me into some rape trouble. He’s setting you and G up to go against me”. She said he told her that in case he went to gaol she won’t get anything out of him by going against him.  
       
       
      On 1 December 1997 the appellant arrived at her home with his brother GD. He said “you know there was no bed in that truck” and said to her not to provide a statement to the police. He further said “I’ll give you $10,000 to say that E is the cause of all this”. They then went back to the truck. She reported the matter to the police. On 27 January 1998 after a listening device was placed on her telephone she rang the appellant. On 28 January 1998 she went to the appellant’s farm fitted with another listening device. Tape recordings of these conversations were admitted into evidence. 
       
       
      AD, mother of the complainants T and R gave evidence that around September 1985 she started working in a glove factory. She said that her husband would get home mostly around 4 pm. She said that there were occasions when she returned home in the afternoon and she could see the appellant with T and R. 
       
       
      ED, father of the complainants T and R gave evidence that he often arrived home and his daughters were with the appellant. He said that R went with him every time he was the appellant’s farm helping to put up the deer fences. He said R loved the farm. He said during the course of putting up the fence he had gone down to the shops more than once and said that he had looked at the truck belonging to the appellant and that it had a mattress type of bed. 
       
       
      Det Snr Const McQueen gave evidence that he had conducted a record of interview with the appellant and he denied that he had sexually assaulted T. He declined to answer further questions put to him by police regarding alleged sexual assault on the other complainants. He said that there were two legally taped conversations between RD and the appellant on 21 January 1998 and 28 January 1998 respectively. During the journey back to the police station the appellant said to him “this is all from my ex wife is it?” and he asked “what do you mean?” and the appellant replied, “she’s been coming around telling me you’re harassing her for a statement and demanding money. I’ve recorded the conversation with her”. 
       
      
    80    The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf and was subjected to cross-examination. In chief and in cross-examination he maintained that he did not sexually assault any of the complainants. It was his contention that he had, at no time, visited the home of his brother when only the two girls, T and R, were present. 
     
      
    81    As far as count 21 was concerned not only did he deny that he attempted to bribe his ex-wife so that she would give false evidence but claimed that in fact she had attempted to extort money from him to tell the truth. 
     
      
    82    He also denied the presence of a mattress or bed in his truck which was said to be involved in the allegations raised by R in relation to count 16 of the indictment. 
     
      
    83    It should be noted that in cross-examination he in no way resiled from either his denials in relation to the sexual assaults or his allegations in relation to the conduct of his ex-wife RD and himself concerning count 21. 
     
      
    84    The appellant founded his appeal on a number of grounds. These were: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The evidence admitted in support of counts 20 and 21 in the indictment was not admissible on the other counts 1 - 19, and the appellant was unfairly prejudiced by the hearing of those two counts in the same indictment. 
       
      
    85    This ground also involved a submission that the failure of counsel at the trial to seek to severe counts 20 and 21 from the indictment constituted incompetence on counsel’s behalf which led to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
       
      Ground 2A: The learned judge failed to direct the jury according to law on issues attending the credibility of the complainants R and T and the appellant was thereby deprived of a chance of acquittal open to him and a miscarriage of justice was occasioned. 
       
       
      Ground 3: Evidence led on the appeal by way of oral and affidavit evidence from the appellant and RD and affidavit evidence of DG would make the Crown case on count 21 unsustainable and so impugned the evidence given in relation to count 20 that a new trial would be required in relation to that latter count. 
       
       
      Ground 4: The evidence admitted in relation to count 21 rendered the count duplicitous and the verdict upon that count lacking manifest unanimity. 
       
       
      Ground 1: The evidence admitted in support of counts 20 and 21 in the indictment was not admissible on the other counts 1 - 19 and the appellant was unfairly prejudiced by the hearing of those two counts in the same indictment. 
       
      
    86    The nub of the submission made by counsel for the appellant in relation to counts 20 and 21 was that they should have been severed from the indictment. As no application had been made either before or at the trial that this be done it was in this regard that the question of the competence of counsel was raised. 
     
      
    87    It was not suggested by counsel for the appellant that the counts involving the sexual assaults on R and T should have been considered separately - indeed having regard to the factual allegations set out above, it is difficult to see how such an application could have succeeded. 
     
      
    88    However, it was put that as far as count 20 was concerned involving as it did a discrete allegation of a sexual assault in different circumstances from the sexual assaults allegedly carried out on T and R that the inclusion of count 20 was impermissibly prejudicial to the appellant. 
     
      
    89    It was put that the evidence relating to count 20 was not relationship evidence or tendency evidence. Reliance was placed upon what had fallen from Dowsett J in R v Waterreus [1998] QCA 90, 12 May 1998 when his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, as in BKS v The Queen (1997) 71 ALJR 1512 the evidence of misconduct with another witness, the risk of ‘propensity reasoning’ is greatly increased.” 
        
       
      
    90    It should be said at once that his Honour gave directions which were not the subject of criticism which made it plain to the jury that they were to consider the allegations made by L separately from those made by T and R. 
     
      
    91    However, it was put that despite his Honour’s directions the risk of unfairness remained particularly when the allegations relating to count 20 are examined in combination with other matters raised on the appeal which would lead the court to conclude that the presence of count 20 resulted in an unfair trial taking place. 
     
      
    92    The failure of counsel to seek severance of this count as with count 21, was the matter most strongly urged on the appellant’s behalf. Accordingly I shall deal with this submission at the conclusion of my considerations relating to count 21. 
     
      
    93    Count 21 was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 12 November 1997 and 29 January 1998, did offer RD money in order for her to give false evidence at court, intending to pervert the course of justice.” 
        
       
      
    94    The evidence adduced by the Crown in relation to this count included as I have noted above, tape recordings of two conversations between the appellant and his ex-wife RD. While, again as I have noted, the appellant maintained in evidence that rather than it be the case that he had attempted to bribe RD to give false evidence on his behalf, the case was that RD attempted to extort money from him in order to tell the truth. 
     
      
    95    Again, as I have said, while the appellant did not resile from this position in cross-examination a fair reading of his cross-examination on this point indicates that his credibility was very severely impugned on this issue. 
     
      
    96    His Honour correctly directed the jury that the damage done to the appellant’s credibility on this issue could be taken into account by the jury on the issue of his general credibility, that is, in relation to all counts. 
     
      
    97    Again, criticism was mounted of the conduct of counsel in not seeking severance of count 21 from the indictment. It was submitted that as the joinder of count 21 was improper because it so seriously and impermissibly prejudiced and embarrassed the appellant in the conduct of his case that not only should counsel have sought to have it severed but also failure to severe would inevitably result in an unfair trial taking place. 
     
      
    98    I am of the view that even if the allegation that the appellant had sought to bribe his ex-wife so that she would give false evidence was not the subject of a separate count in the indictment that it would have been permissible for the Crown to lead evidence of the attempted bribery as evidence of consciousness of guilty on the part of the appellant. 
     
      
    99    Ex facie, it was fairer for the Crown to encapsulate the allegation of bribery in a separate count than to leave it as evidence to be applied in general in the trial. 
     
      
    100    I say this because it is fairer to an accused that a jury consider this matter initially, separately, in order that they determine whether they accept the allegations beyond reasonable doubt than to leave the matter merely as evidence in general, albeit that if left in the latter fashion it would have been proper to direct the jury that before they used the material they must find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the events occurred. 
     
      
    101    In my view this point alone is sufficient to dispose of the argument that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) count 21 should have been severed; and 
       
       
      (b) that counsel failed in his duty to seek such severance. 
       
      
    102    However, this does not dispose of the submission that counsel should have sought the severance of count 20. Affidavit evidence was obtained from senior and junior counsel who appeared at the trial relating to this point. Senior counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial was in fact the third senior counsel engaged in the matter. Both his predecessors had been of the view that it was better that all matters be dealt with in one trial rather than in a series of trials. Senior counsel who appeared at the trial was told of the views of his predecessors and agreed with them. 
     
      
    103    The reasoning behind that advice was: 
     
      
       
      1. That if the appellant was to give evidence it was better that he give evidence at one trial rather than at a number of trial where inconsistencies which may have occurred during the course of his various endeavours to give evidence could have been brought to bear in cross-examination by the Crown. 
       
       
      2. That in relation to the evidence of the three complainants it was thought that the possibility of inconsistencies being found in the testimonies given by each of the three could be used to good effect in the appellant’s defence. 
       
      
    104    In my view these considerations were soundly based. There often is a tactical advantage for an accused to have counsel expose inconsistencies in the testimony of a number of complainants in the case of sexual assault. The decision made by his predecessors and adopted by senior counsel at the trial was far distant from the type of flagrant incompetence referred to by this Court in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 particularly 683 which would induce this Court to interfere. 
     
      
    105    I should add that in his affidavit the appellant complained of a lack of communication between counsel and himself both before and during his trial. This lack of communication, so deposed the appellant, led to his counsel not receiving proper instructions from him. This in turn led to a submission of the type of incompetence identified by this Court in Birks. 
     
      
    106    Both junior and senior counsel deposed as to their actions in the trial by way of affidavit. Neither was required for cross-examination. Their affidavits make it plain that there was appropriate communication both before and during the trial by way of conferences with the appellant and that appropriate instructions were obtained from him in order that his trial could be properly conducted. 
     
      
    107    In these circumstances, there being no challenge to the evidence of counsel I accept their evidence in preference to that given both by way of affidavit and orally by the appellant before this Court. 
     
      
    108    One specific matter raised relating to counsel’s competency was an allegation made by the appellant that the three complainants had fabricated their evidence at the instigation of the appellant’s brother E. 
     
      
    109    I should add that this matter also arises in relation to ground four of the appeal. It is true that no direct accusation of this type was put to the witnesses R and L, nor to E when he gave evidence - albeit that he conceded in cross-examination that after 1991 he and his brother had fallen out. It was however, put directly to T who flatly denied any such conspiracy. 
     
      
    110    It may be that having received a flat denial from T and in view of the matters raised by the Crown under count 21, senior counsel took the view that it was tactically unwise to pursue this line. However, whatever the reason was the absence of cross-examination on this line to R, L and T does not amount to the type of incompetence adverted to by this Court in Birks. 
     
      
    111    Accordingly, in relation to both counts 20 and 21 ground one cannot succeed and this separate allegation of incompetence must also fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      
    112    Essentially this ground relied upon a submission that because those counts remain in the indictment the risk of impermissible evidence on all the counts by reason of the admission of the evidence on those two counts was so great as to cause injustice. 
     
      
    113    For the same reasons I have expressed in relation to the discreet matters raised in relation to counts 20 and 21, I am of the view that this ground must also fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2a: The learned judge failed to direct the jury according to law on issues attending the credibility of the complainants R and T and the appellant was, thereby, deprived of a chance of acquittal open to him and a miscarriage of justice was occasioned. 
       
      
    114    Reliance here was placed upon the failure of the trial judge to give a direction which was consistent with the observations made by Dunford J in R v R A T [2000] NSWCCA 77 24 March 2000. There his Honour, in dealing with what had fallen from the High Court in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “If I am correct in my understanding of the effect of Jones, then I believe consideration needs to be given to the directions regularly given to juries in such trials. Juries are constantly told that they should consider each count in the indictment separately and also that they may accept part of a witness’ evidence and not accept other parts of the evidence of that same witness. But Jones appears to establish a qualification to these directions to the effect that in sexual cases, where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, if they are for any reason not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to one count, it is not open to them to be satisfied to the criminal standard that she (or he) is telling the truth in relation to any other count, and therefore in such cases (ie where there is no independent evidence of the commission of the offences) if they find an accused not guilty on one count, they must also find him not guilty on all counts. They should also be warned specifically that if they return different verdicts where there are no distinguishing features in the evidence, such verdicts are liable to be regarded as a compromise and the guilty verdicts set aside.” 
        
       
      
    115    No such direction was in fact given, nor was any sought. 
     
      
    116    In Jones the appellant had been indicted on three counts of sexual assault. He was convicted on the first and third counts but acquitted on the second. 
     
      
    117    The High Court observed there was nothing in the complainant’s evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gave any ground for supposing her evidence was more reliable in relation to the first and third counts than it was in relation to the second count. 
     
      
    118    The majority in the High Court (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) at 85 adopted the application of the test for determining whether a verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory by the majority in the High Court in M’s case. In M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494 the majority has explained the test as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    119    At 453 in Jones the court went on to hold as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of the events which were said to give rise to that count.” 
        
       
      
    120    Later, again at 453, they observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, two other factors made it necessary for a reasonable jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with considerable care - (1) her delay in making the complaint; and (2) the lack of any corroborative evidence, in particular, the absence of any medical evidence.” 
        
       
      
    121    Here it may be seen from the narrative of facts above that in relation to the counts 11 and 14 that both involved her aunt RD. RD, while giving positive evidence against the appellant particularly in relation to counts 20 and 21, did not corroborate R in relation to her association with her on the dates involved in the two counts. 
     
      
    122    In my view the absence of such corroborative evidence could well have led a jury to the conclusion that in relation to those two counts they had a reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    123    In Jones the High Court, as I have indicated, were of the view that the evidence of the complainant there was of the same quality in relation to all three counts - hence the acquittal on the second count tainted the convictions on the first and third counts. 
     
      
    124    In other words here, the jury who must have accepted the evidence of RD in relation to other counts in the indictment, having taken into account the absence of corroborative evidence from her in relation to counts 11 and 14 were thus entitled to find that they had a reasonable doubt in relation to those counts. 
     
      
    125    In short, applying the principles adumbrated by the High Court in M, I do not conclude that the verdicts in relation to counts 11 and 14 were unsafe and unsatisfactory. It follows that the not guilty verdicts in relation to those counts do not taint the guilty verdicts in relation to the other charges. 
     
      
    126    I should add that the suggested direction proposed by Dunford J in sexual cases as far as it deals with the situation where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, that if they are not satisfied that the complainant is telling the truth in relation to one count and thus they find the accused not guilty in relation to that count they should find him not guilty on all counts, would seem to be unexceptional in relation to such cases. I underscore that this direction would only be appropriate in cases where the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant. 
     
      
    127    Here even if such a direction had been given, the absence of corroboration on counts 11 and 14 where the jury might well have expected to find it, is sufficient to explain how the jury may have entertained a reasonable doubt on these counts but yet were satisfied in relation to the other counts. 
     
      
    128    I do not agree with Dunford J’s statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “They should also be warned specifically that if they return different verdicts where there are no distinguishing features in the evidence such verdicts are liable to be regarded as a compromise and the guilty verdicts set aside.” 
        
       
      
    129    I say this because it is not part of a jury’s function to take into account the consequences of any verdict they reach with an exception which arises in the case of a finding of not guilty by reason of mental illness. See Mental Health Act 1990. 
     
      
    130    In Lucas v R (1969-70) 120 CLR 171 the High Court held that it is generally undesirable that references should be made to the possible consequences which may follow upon any verdict which a jury may properly return. There the court said at 175: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is, in our opinion, no need to complicate a trial and the resolution of the issues which arise in it by the introduction of what is truly, so far as the jury are concerned, an extraneous matter. It is, in our opinion, generally undesirable that reference should be made to the possible consequences which may ensue upon any verdict which the jury may properly return.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 3: Evidence led on the appeal by way of oral and affidavit evidence from the appellant and RD and affidavit evidence of DG would make the Crown case on count 21 unsustainable and so impugned the evidence given in relation to count 20 that a new trial would be required in relation to that latter count. 
       
      
    131    This, as I have said, consisted of affidavit and oral testimony given by RD and affidavit evidence of DG. 
     
      
    132    DG’s evidence was confined to count 20 and in particular to her presence at a time when L was resident in her house. 
     
      
    133    RD’s evidence as relied upon by the appellant was to the effect that she had perjured herself at the trial, that in fact the account given by the appellant at the trial was a correct one. 
     
      
    134    The approach to be taken by courts of criminal appeal to such evidence was dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in R v Flower [1966] 1 QB 146. There, Widgery J (as he then was) at 149 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having heard that evidence the court must next decide on the proper approach to it. When this court gives leave to call fresh evidence which appears at the time of the application for leave to be credible, it is still the duty of the court to consider and assess the reliability of that evidence when the witness appears and is cross-examined, and this is particularly true where evidence is called in rebuttal before this court. Having heard the fresh evidence and considered the reliability of the witness, this court may take one of three views with regard to it. First, if satisfied that the fresh evidence is true and that it is conclusive of the appeal, the court can, and no doubt ordinarily would, quash the conviction. Alternatively, if not satisfied that the evidence is conclusive, the court may order a new trial so that a jury can consider the fresh evidence alongside that given at the original trial. The second possibility is that the court is not satisfied that the fresh evidence is true but nevertheless thinks that it might be acceptable to, and believed by, a jury, in which case as a general proposition the court would no doubt be inclined to order a new trial so that that evidence could be considered by the jury, assuming the weight of the fresh evidence would justify that course. Then there is a third possibility, namely, that this court, having heard the evidence, positively disbelieves it and is satisfied that the witness is not speaking the truth. In that event, and speaking generally again, no new trial is called for because the fresh evidence is treated as worthless, and the court will then proceed to deal with the appeal as though the fresh evidence had not been tendered.”  
        
       
      
    135    I turn first to the evidence given by RD Snr. Not only did she claim as I have said, that certain of the evidence which she gave at the trial was untrue, but also that having read the depositions of the evidence given by T, R and L, she claimed that certain aspects of the evidence of T, R and L were untrue. 
     
      
    136    In particular, in relation to the complainant R, she claimed that R had “never stayed” at the appellant’s farm while she was there. She developed in her affidavit that theme in relation to the incidents referred to in counts 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the indictment. 
     
      
    137    As far as L was concerned she states that she did not move into DG’s home until late 1998 and that L did not assist G in getting ready for school. 
     
      
    138    As far as T’s evidence was concerned she stated that the appellant was in the country on a shooting trip for the whole of February 1985, matter going to counts 1, 2 and 3 of the indictment. 
     
      
    139    In oral evidence she was adamant that the appellant’s truck did not have in it a bed and thus the allegations made by R which constituted count 17 of the indictment could not have occurred. 
     
      
    140    As I have already mentioned, tape recordings had been made of several conversations, one by telephone and one face to face, between RD and the appellant. 
     
      
    141    In cross examination statements made by RD Snr to the appellant and the appellant's responses as recorded particularly on the face to face meeting, which were inconsistent with certain of the evidence she had given on the appeal, were put to her. 
     
      
    142    For instance, the question of the presence or otherwise of a bed in the appellant’s truck was squarely raised with her. As I have said she denied its existence before this Court. However, its existence was the subject of a lengthy exchange between herself and the appellant at what I have described as the face to face meeting which occurred on 27 January 1998. 
     
      
    143    Her explanation of the inconsistency between the two accounts in my view totally lacked credibility. The same comment is applicable to certain other matters which she raised in evidence before this Court as against what had passed in the recorded conversations to which I have made reference. 
     
      
    144    In short, I am of the view that her evidence totally lacked credibility. It follows that I regard her evidence as worthless. 
     
      
    145    Accordingly, the third possibility adverted to by Widgery J in Flowers case is, in my view, applicable and I would not order a new trial based upon the evidence she gave before this Court. 
     
      
    146    As far as DG deposed in her affidavit that RD Snr and G moved into her house in late 1988. Furthermore she said that to the best of her knowledge L, her grand daughter, had not assisted G in getting ready for school. She denied that she had gone on holiday at any time when RD Snr and G were residing with her. 
     
      
    147    While DG was not subject to cross examination on her affidavit, I am of the view that the weight of her evidence as disclosed in her affidavit is not sufficient to justify the ordering of a new trial. 
     
      
    148    It follows that I am of the view that the submissions based upon fresh evidence do not succeed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The evidence admitted in relation to count 21 rendered the count duplicitous and the verdict upon that count lacking manifest unanimity. 
       
      
    149    I have set out the terms of count 21 above. The gravamen of that count is that the appellant did offer RD money in order for her to give false evidence. The false evidence which it was alleged that the appellant was seeking to have RD give, was twofold:- 
     
      
       
      1. that the appellant told her to say there was no bed in the truck (a matter I have adverted to above); 
       
       
      2. the appellant told RD to depose that E, his brother, had told the three complainants to fabricate false allegations against the appellant. 
       
      
    150    It was submitted that duplicity existed because these two matters of false evidence were left as alternatives. Thus it was submitted that part of the jury may have been satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, as to one of the matters and another part of the jury satisfied as to the other matter raised. 
     
      
    151    Accordingly, so the submission continued, there should have been two separate counts alleging the crime of attempt to pervert the course of justice. 
     
      
    152    Reliance in this regard was placed upon what fell from the High Court of Australia in KBT v The Queen [1996-97] 191 CLR 417. That case involved allegations that the appellant had sexually misconducted himself with a child on a number of occasions in a number of different ways. 
     
      
    153    The complainant gave evidence of that sexual misconduct which the High Court described as falling within six broad categories. At 424 the majority of the court observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the trial judge correctly instructed the jury in his summing up, it was open to the jury to accept some parts of M’s evidence and to reject others. And given the nature of the offence, which is established by proof of acts of a sexual nature on three occasions, there is no basis on which it can be concluded that the jury did accept all her evidence. Moreover, the evidence in the defence case differed according to the different categories of incident to which M deposed. So far as concerned the incidents which, according to M, occurred on the motorcycle and during fruit picking, the defence evidence consisted, in the main, of the appellant’s denial that they occurred. However, in the case of incidents which, according to M, occurred of a morning in her bedroom, after morning tea, during afternoon rests and while watching television, the appellant’s wife gave evidence which was to the effect that it was improbable, if not impossible, that those events occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to the evidence, it is possible that individual jurors reasoned that certain categories of incident did not occur at all but that one or two did, and more than once, thus concluding that the accused did an act constituting an offence of a sexual nature on three or more occasions without directing attention to any specific act. It is, thus, impossible to say that the jurors must have been agreed as to the appellant having committed the same three acts. 
        
       
       
        
        Indeed, it may be that, had the jury been properly instructed, they would have concluded that the nature of the evidence made it impossible to identify precise acts on which they could agree. It follows that the accused was deprived of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open.” 
        
       
      
    154    KBT was a case brought pursuant to s 229B(1) of the Criminal Code (Qld). Subsection 1 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any adult who maintains an unlawful relationship of a sexual nature with a child under the age of 16 years is guilty of a crime and is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.” 
        
       
       
      The offence was elaborated by sub-s (1A) which provided: 
       
       
        
        “A person shall not be convicted of the offence defined in subsection (1) unless it is shown that the offender, as an adult, has, during the period in which it is alleged that the offender maintained the relationship in issue with the child, done an act defined to constitute an offence of a sexual nature in relation to the child, other than an offence defined in section 210(1)(e) or (f), on 3 or more occasions and evidence of the doing of any such act shall be admissible and probative of the maintenance of the relationship notwithstanding that the evidence does not disclose the dates or the exact circumstances of those occasions.” 
        
       
      
    155    The trial judge had instructed the jury that to convict the appellant of maintaining a sexual relationship contrary to subs 1 they “must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that on at least three occasions within the time frame charged the [appellant had], for instance, unlawfully and indecently dealt with the child”. 
     
      
    156    He had not however, instructed the jury that they had to be satisfied of the same three offences on the same three occasions. The Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal had held that he should have so directed. 
     
      
    157    In the High Court, counsel for the Crown conceded that the trial judge should have directed the jury that they are required to be satisfied as to the commission of the same three acts constituting offences of a sexual nature before they could convict the appellant of the offence charged. 
     
      
    158    Ultimately the High Court held that the Queensland Criminal Court of Appeal should not have applied the Queensland equivalent of the proviso contained in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act NSW. 
     
      
    159    Here, only one offence of attempt to pervert the course of justice is alleged. The fact that the evidence led in support of the count contained matters which could have been stated as separate offences does not make the single count charged, duplicitous. See R v Merriman, [1973] AC 584; R v Velardi, 24 May 1996, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported; R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341. 
     
      
    160    In Merriman, Lord Diplock at 607 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where a number of acts of a similar nature committed by one or more defendants were connected with one another in the time and place of their commission or by their common purpose in such a way that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise, it was the practice, as early as the eighteenth century, to charge them in a single count of an indictment.” 
        
       
      
    161    In Hamzy, at 349 Hunt CJ at CL followed what had fallen from the House of Lords in Merriman. At 349 he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I see no reason why the concept of the one criminal enterprise or one criminal activity should be interpreted narrowly. Obviously enough, the fewer the number of individual acts, the fewer people and the shorter the period of time involved, the less likely that there could be any unfairness to the accused, but the issue of unfairness is dealt with separately from the issue as to whether the individual acts could fairly and properly be so identified. In the present case, it would have presented a totally unreal picture of the activities alleged against the appellant if anything less than the total picture had been presented to the jury. According to the evidence, the appellant was constantly involved in the one criminal enterprise of dealing in heroin. Even if the individual acts of supply had been divided up into different counts, each count relating to the acts of supply to a different Crown witness, there would have been no real justification for separate trials relating to each count. Again, a totally unreal picture would have been presented. And, as the defence was one of denial of any involvement in the supply of heroin, the evidence of similar facts may well have been admissible in any event to meet the attempted exculpatory explanations by the appellant for the presence of the difference Crown witnesses at his home.” 
        
       
      
    162    In Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77 a number of the High Court justices considered the question of what would constitute a duplicitous count. However, as Hunt CJ at CL subsequently observed in F (1996) 90 A Crim R, the absence of a clear ratio in Tattersall’s case meant that the law in this State as he put it in Hamzy, remained. That is that the law as adumbrated in Merriman’s case is to be taken as the law in New South Wales. 
     
      
    163    In R v Moussad, [1999] NSWCCA 337 Smart AJ reviewed the authorities in detail, concluding as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the practice in New South Wales as reflected in Hamzy and the cases there cited and the subsequent cases including F and the absence of a clear ratio in Walsh v Tattersall which can be applied in this case, this Court should continue to follow Hamzy and F where the Crown has framed and relied upon a single count alleging a criminal enterprise.” 
        
       
      
    164    It should be noted that in KBT at 422 the court distinguished the offence created by s 229B(1) of the Queensland Code from offences involving a course of conduct such as trafficking of drugs or keeping a disorderly house. The court observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of each of these latter offences, the actus reus is the course of conduct which the offence describes.” 
        
       
      
    165    In the same way I am of the view that KBT is not authority which renders a count framed as count 21 was and involving the factual allegations upon which the Crown relied, a duplicitous count. 
     
      
    166    Accordingly I am of the view that this ground also fails. 
     
      
    167    For the above reasons I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    168    ADAMS J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment in draft of Newman J in which the facts relevant to the appeal have been set out and, accordingly, I do not need to repeat them here.  
     
      
    169    So far as the joinder of count 20 in the indictment is concerned, I agree that the submission that its inclusion resulted in a miscarriage of justice should be rejected. I think it is clear that the addition of this count, which led to adducing of L’s evidence (on the face of it, credible and convincing) in a trial where the appellant was defending himself from serious charges made by two other complainants as well, had the effect of ranging against him, as it were, the evidence of three, as distinct from two, witnesses. Where the trial, at the end, must have depended on the view taken by the jury about the credibility of the protagonists, it is difficult to conclude that, at least on that issue, the jury did not consider the evidence as a whole in the sense, if I may use a metaphor, that they placed the evidence of the complainants in a single pan on the scales and weighed it against the credibility which they might give to the evidence of the appellant in the other pan.  
     
      
    170    His Honour the learned trial Judge instructed the jury as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        “...the Crown brings the charge and the Crown has to prove it in each of the cases - twenty one separate trials, which must be tried as if you were twenty-one separate juries. You must consider each case absolutely independently without being influenced by whatever verdict you come to in any of the others, there is no need for all the verdicts to be the same in any way. Subject to matters of common sense, each verdict must be decided entirely on the facts that relate to that case. 
         
         
        “There will be one way in which...some of the material in the final charge may relate to some of the earlier charges and that is entirely a matter for you and, again, I will be telling you only how you may use it and not what you should do about it, and I will come to that in some detail tomorrow. But the essential guiding principle about each of these cases is that each case must be decided in each own compartment.” 
         
        
       
      
    171    His Honour’s reference to “matters of common sense” (which was not explained) as qualifying the need to independently consider each count, was capable of inappropriate application, especially where common sense might suggest that it is less likely, in the circumstances here, that all three complainants were lying than that the appellant was lying. However, no objection was taken to this lack of clarity. The jury were also told -  
     
      
       
        
        “In each of the first twenty trials that you have to decide, somebody is lying. In each of them, either the woman making the allegation or the accused is lying.” 
         
        
       
      
    172    If I may say so, this must have been the case. His Honour characterised the testimony on each side in this way for the purpose of warning the jury that it should not proceed by considering which side it believed, pointing out that, even though the appellant had put an affirmative case and had given evidence, the principle remained that the Crown had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and, merely because the appellant had chosen to present a defence, the trial was not converted into a contest in which the issue was whether the Crown or the defence cases were more convincing: the jury must decide the case “on the basis alone, has the Crown proved its case beyond reasonable doubt”. This, of course, is a conventional and, so far as it goes, an unobjectionable direction from the defence point of view. I am not sure, however, that a lay person would readily understand its import. It would have been helpful, I think, to point out to the jury that the crucial question in respect of each count, was whether it believed the complainant to be telling the truth beyond reasonable doubt, having regard to the sworn testimony of the accused and the criticisms of the Crown case made on his behalf, that if they believed that his evidence might reasonably possibly be true then they should acquit but, even if the jury found that it could not believe him, it could not convict unless persuaded beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence called by the prosecution that the accused was guilty. However, no redirection was sought as to either his Honour’s characterisation of the evidence on each side or the instruction concerning the need to be satisfied that the prosecution had satisfied its onus of proof. 
     
      
    173    The learned trial Judge returned towards the end of his summing up to the necessity that the jury should consider separately each of the counts alleging sexual crimes - 
     
      
       
        
        “In deciding then, whether the Crown has proved its case in each of those twenty cases you must rely on the direct evidence of the events in regard to those allegations and this is very important. I repeat what I said to you yesterday. Each case must be put in its own compartment and you must decide it just on the evidence in relation to that count. You are not entitled in any way to consider the evidence of any of the other counts in relation to the one you are considering at the time.  
         
         
        “I stress that you cannot, for example, say...even if you were to find a count - a verdict of guilty on one count because he has committed that matter, then he is a man [capable] of committing any one of the others and therefore you would convict him on one of the others. It is not an easy job to close your mind to the evidence of other matters but you must. And the Crown, as you will have observed, has not made any submission to you on the basis that if you were to find him guilty in relation to any other matter or even if you just thought there was so much evidence about a number of matters, that that therefore means that you should convict him on one matter. You are not entitled to do that as a matter of law. 
         
         
        “The only reason that we have got one jury here, rather than twenty juries, is for reasons of convenience in the giving of evidence. And that is the important reason why you must consider yourself as being a separate jury in each matter.” 
         
        
       
      
    174    The jury were entitled, of course, to have regard to the issues of credibility raised in the evidence overall. In other words, and taking the case depending on the evidence of the witness L, if the jury found that they believed her testimony beyond reasonable doubt, it would follow that they must have rejected the appellant’s evidence, and in the circumstances, that it was a lie. It seems to me that there is no reason why the jury could not use the finding that the appellant had lied on oath in respect of L for the purpose of assessing his credibility generally and, it follows, in relation to his sworn denials of misconduct so far as the other two complainants were concerned. On the other hand, the jury could not view its acceptance of L’s allegations as tending to prove that the appellant had committed the alleged sexual misconduct in respect of the other complainants. The directions as to this latter matter were sufficient for the purposes of the trial and his Honour’s omission to mention the former use which could be made of findings as to credibility favoured the appellant. 
     
      
    175    In the result, I think that the risk that the jury might not appreciate the necessity to obey the Judge’s warning about separate trials was a real one. However, that does not mean that the trial miscarried. No objection was taken by very senior counsel to the indictment in its form as presented. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I would have accepted that this had been done with due advertence to the dangers which such an indictment presented but in light of the potential for some countervailing advantage. For myself, I would be loath to endorse a practice of examining, in every case where a value judgment is made by defence counsel about what line should be taken in respect of one or other procedural or evidentiary issue, the matters counsel considered, simply because, in the result, the decision might have adversely impacted on the defence case. Merely because a judgment call, in the end, proved to have had a possibly or even probably adverse consequence, does not lead to the conclusion that a miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. Moreover, in the circumstances here, it does not follow that because there was a risk that the jury might have disregarded or misunderstood the trial Judge’s directions, this means that they actually did so. Even the extent of the risk will depend a great deal upon the atmosphere of the trial itself and the way in which the protagonists presented, a matter which is difficult for a Court of Criminal Appeal to assess from a transcript. This problem is exacerbated where, as here, counsels’ addresses have not been transcribed.  
     
      
    176    As was pointed out in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 by Gleeson CJ (at 683) - 
     
      
       
        
        “In our system of criminal justice a trial of an accused person is conducted in the manner of a contest between the Crown and the accused, and that trial has many (although not all) of the features which attend civil litigation conducted in accordance with what is sometimes described as the adversary system of justice. To a large extent the parties to such proceedings are bound by the manner in which they conduct them. It is the parties who decide, for example, what information will be put before a tribunal of fact, and the tribunal bases its decision on that information. 
        
       
       
        
        “As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case...There is an evident tension between those principles, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the power and duty of a Court of Criminal Appeal to correct a miscarriage of justice. It would be wrong, however, simply to regard these as two competing considerations which must from time to time yield to some compromise. The principles as to the role of counsel, and the capacity of counsel to bind the client, are fundamental to the operation of the adversary system, and form part of the practical content of our notions of justice.” 
        
       
      
    177    The Chief Justice stated that the relevant principles may be summarised as follows (at 685) - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
        
       
       
        
        “2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        “3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.” 
        
       
      
    178    In my view, the inclusion of count 20 in the indictment, considered realistically, carried with it the potential risk that the jury might use the evidence of L inappropriately in respect of the other counts of the indictment. This risk, apparent from the outset, was diminished but not destroyed by the directions of the learned trial judge, of which neither correction nor amplification was sought on the appellant’s behalf. However, I do not think that, in all the circumstances, the appellant has shown that the mere existence of the risk involved or caused a miscarriage of justice. The risk resulted from the exercise by counsel of his judgment on the appellant’s behalf in a context where all decisions carried some risk of one kind or another and to a greater or lesser extent of an adverse consequence for the appellant. The mere fact that the appellant was convicted does not establish that counsel’s judgment was wrong, still less so wrong as to render the verdict a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, I agree with Newman J’s conclusion that the submissions concerning the joinder of count 20 in the indictment should be rejected. 
     
      
    179    The appellant called additional evidence in this appeal material to the issues in the trial.  
     
      
    180    L, who was AR senior’s niece, and hence the cousin of the other complainants, gave evidence of a sexual assault on her by the appellant which allegedly occurred when her aunt, her three sons and the appellant were living with AR senior’s mother, DG, who, of course (and, I think, significantly), was L’s grandmother. They lived directly across the road from L’s house. The alleged assault occurred in early 1988 when, L said, she had commenced her first year at high school and L’s grandmother (DG) was away on holidays. L said that she went to the house to look after one of her young cousins G, who was five, before going to school since, as she put it, her grandmother was away on holidays and her aunt and mother had gone to work. She said that she crossed the road to get G ready for school. The absence of the grandmother on holidays was, therefore, a crucial part of the narrative of events, since it was the reason for L’s attendance at the house to get G ready for school, and which provided the occasion for the appellant, so she claimed, to assault her, as nobody else was in the house. Cross-examination, which was very brief, was confined to a suggestion that L had been encouraged to make a complaint to the police by her aunt and that it was an invention.  
     
      
    181    An affidavit sworn by DG was tendered in this Court. The Crown did not seek to cross-examine her. DG testified that, although she went on a short holiday in early 1988, which she was able to date because she was accompanied by a friend who died in March of that year, her daughter RD senior and G moved into her house in late 1988 and G was enrolled in a local school in January 1989. DG said that she did not go away on holiday at any time while her daughter and grandson moved into her house. 182    With respect, I consider that the approach explained by Widgery J (as he then was) in R v Flower [1966] 1 QB 146 at 149 to be a helpful one in the circumstances of this case. His Lordship said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Having heard that evidence the court must next decide on the proper approach to it. When this court gives leave to call fresh evidence which appears at the time of the application for leave to be credible, it is still the duty of the court to consider and assess the reliability of that evidence when the witness appears and is cross-examined, and this is particularly true where evidence is called in rebuttal before this court. Having heard the fresh evidence and considered the reliability of the witness, this court may take one of three views with regard to it. First, if satisfied that the fresh evidence is true and that it is conclusive of the appeal, the court can, and no doubt ordinarily would, quash the conviction. Alternatively, if not satisfied that the evidence is conclusive, the court may order a new trial so that a jury can consider the fresh evidence alongside that given at the original trial. The second possibility is that the court is not satisfied that the fresh evidence is true but nevertheless thinks that it might be acceptable to, and believed by, a jury, in which case as a general proposition the court would no doubt be inclined to order a new trial so that that evidence could be considered by the jury, assuming the weight of the fresh evidence would justify that course. Then there is a third possibility, namely, that this court, having heard the evidence, positively disbelieves it and is satisfied that the witness is not speaking the truth. In that event, and speaking generally again, no new trial is called for because the fresh evidence is treated as worthless, and the court will then proceed to deal with the appeal as though the fresh evidence had not been tendered.” 
        
       
      
    183    The Crown prosecutor did not submit in this Court that GD’s evidence was untruthful or insignificant. There is no inherent reason why it might be thought to be untrue. The question is whether it gives rise to such a doubt about the conviction as to require its quashing.  
     
      
    184    On the face of it, having regard to the evidence of L, not only as to when but how the occasion arose that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant, GD’s evidence that no such occasion was possible gives rise, in my opinion, to a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant of the charge involving L if this evidence had been before it in the trial: Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 402 per Mason and Deane JJ. Gibbs CJ said (160 CLR at 395) - 
     
      
       
        
        “The authorities disclose three main considerations which will guide a Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred because evidence now available was not led at the trial. The first of these, that the conviction will not usually be set aside if the evidence relied on could with reasonable diligence have been produced by the accused at the trial, is satisfied in the present case, and need not be discussed, although it should be noted that this is not a universal and inflexible requirement: the strength of the fresh evidence may in some cases be such as to justify interference with the verdict, even though that evidence might have been discovered before the trial. Two other matters that should be taken into consideration are whether the evidence is apparently credible (or at least capable of belief) and whether, if believed, the evidence might reasonably have led the jury to return a different verdict.” 
        
       
      
    185    Of course, “in judging of the weight of the fresh testimony, the probative force and the nature of the evidence already adduced at the trial must be a matter of great importance”: R v Craig (1933) 49 CLR 429 per Rich and Dixon JJ at 439. Here, the guilt of the appellant of the charge involving L depended largely upon the evidence of L, in respect of which the accused made sworn denials together with the inferences which may have been available from the taped conversation between the appellant and RD senior. 
     
      
    186    The appellant has not explained, in terms, why the evidence of DG was not called at trial. Certainly, he asserted that there was a conspiracy against him comprising RD senior and her children as well as his brother. The appellant said, in his affidavit tendered in the appeal, that he from time to time prior to the trial suggested that his solicitors should speak to DG who was, he said, at all times on relatively good terms with him. He said that they did not speak to her, explaining that, “She might bring you undone”. This suggestion could, or at least should, not have been made unless his legal advisers were aware of what DG might say. The appellant was cross-examined about other aspects of his affidavit but not as to this matter. DG said in her affidavit that she had not been asked about the events in question until she spoke to the appellant’s solicitor and counsel shortly before May 2000. Although she attended the appellant’s trial, she did not hear L’s evidence and was kept apart from other persons at the Court by a detective. 
     
      
    187    The appellant’s solicitor at trial deposed that the appellant never suggested before the trial that DG might be a witness who could assist him and that he did speak to her “after the trial” when asked to do so by the appellant but “what she told me was of no assistance to the appellant”. Junior counsel, however, deposed that he became aware that DG attended the court during the trial and understood that his instructing solicitor spoke to her and took instructions. He said that there was a meeting between counsel and the solicitor regarding DG, as a result of which it was decided that “it was dangerous to call [her] and indeed she would not help the appellant”. In his affidavit, Mr Finnane QC, who led the defence at trial, said that Mr Meehan had spoken to DG and reported the conversation to him and his junior. Mr Finnane was convinced that there was no point in any further discussion. The difference between the solicitor and junior counsel as to when DG was interviewed has not been clarified. On the solicitor’s account, it seems that it was too late to call her but, at all events, she was of no assistance. I think it very likely that the word “commenced” has accidentally been omitted from the solicitor’s affidavit following the word “trial”. This makes more sense of the solicitor’s characterisation of the utility of DG’s evidence. At all events, I consider the accounts of counsel to be the more reliable. As both counsel make clear, a tactical decision, based on good and proper reasons, was made not to call DG. The substance of these reasons was not sought to be elicited before us by the appellant, presumably because they would have damaged his case. This approach, no doubt tactically determined, makes it impossible for this Court to evaluate the cogency of the new evidence in a realistic way. 
     
      
    188    In Regina v Antal (unreported NSWCCA 12 February 1991) Newman J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said -  
     
      
       
        
        “...in determining whether or not such [new] evidence was available to an appellant at the date of trial, a Court of Criminal Appeal will adopt a more flexible approach to the efforts of an appellant prior to his trial to obtain evidence than it would in a corresponding situation involving the civil law. However, this does not mean that the dictates of justice and, in particular, the desirability of the finality of legal proceedings, whether they be civil or criminal in nature, allows a person accused of a crime to do nothing in seeking evidence prior to his trial and then, in any event, on appeal, allow him to present fresh evidence as a ground for quashing his conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        “...If the evidence sought to be adduced by an appellant was of a nature to persuade this Court that a miscarriage of justice had taken place because there was a significant possibility that a jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant of the charges if the new evidence had been before it in the trial...then I doubt that this Court would find that an appellant’s desultory behaviour prevented him succeeding in his appeal. Be this as it may, I do not wish it to be thought that I am saying that all such conduct would be put to one side by this Court in considering an appeal based upon this ground.” 
        
       
      
    189    Even though the evidence of DG was uncontroverted and it went to an important part of the Crown case against the appellant in respect of complainant L, I am not sufficiently persuaded of its cogency to be satisfied that a miscarriage occurred. This is not a case of the unavailability of evidence but of a deliberate decision not to call a witness. It is impossible for the appellant to demonstrate that the trial miscarried by the absence of evidence from DG where a deliberate and informed decision was made not to call her for reasons that the appellant has not sought to explain, except by adducing evidence that his legal advisers described the witness as “dangerous” and “of no assistance”.  
     
      
       
      Accordingly this ground of appeal must fail. 
       
      
    190    The appellant also sought to rely in the appeal upon an affidavit of RD senior who was the appellant’s wife although, sometime before the trial, they were divorced. In her affidavit RD senior says that some of the evidence which she gave at the trial was false. Each item of allegedly false evidence was briefly referred to and the way in which it was said to be false was set out. The first of these items is RD senior’s evidence that the appellant wore a particular brand of shorts, “Stubbies”, which did not have a zipper but he also owned shorts with zippers which he sometimes wore and which, she said, were also “Stubbies”. She had also stated that he would sometimes wear underpants. This evidence supported that of the complainants RD and TD, who said that, on the occasions when the appellant assaulted them, he wore shorts with a zipper and underpants. The appellant swore that his shorts were “Stubbies” without zippers and he never wore underpants. RD senior said in her affidavit that the appellant never wore either underpants or shorts with a zipper. For reasons which it unnecessary to mention, I do not consider this evidence, even if true, to be more than of peripheral importance in the context of the issues in the trial considered as a whole. Secondly, RD senior said that she gave evidence that RD used to stay at the farm owned by the appellant at weekends. The substance of her evidence, however, was that the appellant moved out to the farm to live in a caravan whilst he built the house on the property and to which she moved sometime later. Although she said that she knew that the appellant’s brother and his daughters (including RD) went out to visit the farm, it is clear that she was purporting to report what the appellant had told her, saying that she had never seen RD at the farm. Accordingly, the assertion in the affidavit that RD did not stay at the farm whilst RD senior was there adds nothing to the evidence in the case.  
     
      
    191    The third item of evidence to which RD senior adverted in her affidavit was her agreement, during examination in chief, to a leading question asking if the appellant said to her “I’ll give you $10,000 to say that [the appellant’s uncle] is the cause of all this”. This question was part of a series of leading questions which were obviously put by agreement with the appellant’s counsel, I assume, from RD senior’s statement. It was the appellant’s case that he did not make any such offer to RD senior. About two months after this alleged conversation, RD senior and the appellant had another conversation in which they discussed some of the issues in the impending trial, which was recorded on a device secreted on RD senior’s person.  
     
      
    192    In her affidavit, RD senior said that her evidence that the appellant had offered $10,000 was untrue and that he never said that to her. Having regard to the transcript of the later conversation, I am satisfied that RD senior’s affidavit is false in this respect. RD had alleged that one of the assaults upon her took place on a bed in the back of the appellant’s truck behind the two front seats. She described the bed as consisting of a mattress with a quilt over it. In the appellant’s interview with the police, tendered without objection, the appellant said that the area behind the front seats was only about a foot wide and contained a miscellany of various articles but no mattress. He also told the police that there was no room for sleeping in that part of the vehicle. A witness was called by the prosecution who purchased the vehicle from the appellant who said that behind the seats there was a small area which contained a board with a piece of foam mattress material on top of it, approximately two feet wide. In the trial, the appellant said that he had slept in that part of the truck although it was only two feet wide. He said that there was no permanent bed there, just a piece of foam that he put in if need be when he was working night shift. This matter was discussed in the tape recorded conversation during which the appellant asserted that there was no bed in the back of the truck and RD senior that there was and, indeed, that the two of them had sexual intercourse there on one occasion. During cross-examination in this Court, RD senior denied that the appellant had asked her to say that there was no bed in the truck and then suggested that there was some confusion between an actual bed and a mattress. She also denied that it was big enough to have sexual intercourse on although, in the taped conversation, she had asserted that she and the appellant had used it for that purpose. She said, however, that this assertion was something that she “just said”, I take it because she was attempting to trap the appellant. The conversation contained the following exchange close to its commencement - 
     
      
       
        
        “RD SENIOR Is that offer still available? 
        
       
       
        
        APPELLANT Oh yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        RD SENIOR How much was it again? 
        
       
       
        
        APPELLANT How much do you want? 
        
       
       
        
        RD SENIOR Well, how much can you offer? 
        
       
       
        
        APPELLANT How much do you want? You know all I want you to do is tell the...truth. 
        
       
       
        
        RD SENIOR Yeah, but is that offer, I will for that offer. 
        
       
       
        
        APPELLANT How much? 
        
       
       
        
        RD SENIOR Well you said $10,000, didn’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        APPELLANT Um um.” 
        
       
      
    193    The explanation for this conversation in this Court was that she had asked him for $10,000, but that he had not offered it. I do not think that this explanation is credible, nor do I consider RD senior’s explanation concerning the conversation about the bed is credible. At all events, at the end of her cross examination in the trial, RD senior agreed that at no stage did the appellant offer her any money. Having regard to these matters in particular and the way in which RD senior gave her evidence, I do not consider that it is sufficiently probative to call into question the propriety of any of the appellant’s convictions. 
     
      
    194    So far as RD was concerned, RD senior took up particular parts of the former’s evidence which described events at the farm. Consistently with her earlier statement, RD senior said that these events could not have occurred since RD never came to the farm or stayed whilst she was there. So far as one count is concerned, which allegedly occurred in early 1990, RD senior said she was at the farm during this time and that the allegation by RD that she yelled to the appellant that she did not want to have sexual intercourse and was screaming whilst it occurred for about ten or fifteen minutes, could not have happened without her hearing the screams, and she did not do so. As I have pointed out, however, RD senior had given evidence at the trial that the girls had not come to the farm whilst she was there, except “They might have now and then”. I note that RD senior did not withdraw her evidence that the appellant had told her that the girls had come out to the farm. In my view, the evidence of RD senior about this matter has very little, if any, probative worth and certainly is insufficient, when considered with the other evidence in the trial, to raise a doubt about the propriety of the convictions so far as they concern assaults on RD.  
     
      
    195    The first three counts in the indictment concerned sexual assaults on TD which, on the evidence of the complainant, occurred “around February” in 1985. RD senior, in her affidavit, said that the appellant was elsewhere during February 1985. In the circumstances of this case, even if this evidence be true, I do not think that it is sufficiently significant to doubt the propriety of the convictions. 
     
      
    196    Of the twenty one counts in the indictment, eleven concerned RD. In respect of two of these, counts 11 and 14, the jury acquitted the appellant. 
     
      
    197    So far as count 11 of the indictment was concerned, the complainant said that in 1986, when she was in 5th grade at school, her aunt, RD senior, had asked her to feed some budgerigars for her when she went away from home for a week and that RD agreed to do so. On one afternoon during this time, the appellant called in to RD’s parents’ home and drove her to her aunt’s house. When RD had finished feeding and watering the budgerigars, she walked into the lounge room and asked to go home. The appellant then grabbed her, pushed her to the floor and felt her breasts. RD said that she did not want to do this, got up and walked out.  
     
      
    198    RD senior said that when she was away from her home at about this time, it was for about six weeks and her sons looked after the birds “so far as I know”. 
     
      
    199    Count 14 concerned an alleged assault at the farm. RD said that she and RD senior were at the chicken pen when the appellant came over on his four-wheel bike and insisted that RD get on it. He drove them to an area of scrub and had intercourse with her. They drove back to where RD senior was and RD asked her if she could take her home. She said that she still crying a little at this time. The effect of RD senior’s evidence as to seeing RD at the farm amounted, in effect, to a denial that the occasion as described by RD occurred.  
     
      
    200    In the circumstances, I consider that the jury’s acquittals are explicable by a view that the complainant’s evidence was confused as to these occasions and they were therefore not satisfied that they occurred as charged in the indictment.  
     
      
    201    I think it unlikely that the jury considered that RD had fabricated these accounts. In respect of counts 11 and 14, it may be inferred that the jury found the evidence to be unreliable because of what they took to be the contradiction of RD senior although, for all we know, their doubts may have been excited by the way in which the complainant gave her evidence about these particular matters. Although RD’s evidence was that the events giving rise to counts 12 and 13 occurred at the farm at night on a weekend when she was taken there by RD senior and when it seems almost inevitable that RD senior, if she was present in the house, would have heard her yells of protest, RD senior denied that she had ever taken RD to the farm and, in effect, that she had heard RD yelling but she also said that she returned home in the afternoon. The alleged assault giving rise to Count 14 occurred on the following day of the same weekend. 
     
      
    202    I think it likely that the jury accepted that there were a number of sexual assaults perpetrated on RD by the appellant but, where there was apparently credible evidence which showed that a closely connected fact asserted by her to be part of the sequence of events may not have occurred, it was not prepared to convict. That was sufficient to give rise to a reasonable doubt. So far as count 11 was concerned, the contradictory evidence was rather slight, which indicates, perhaps, that the jury’s judgment was a somewhat finely balanced one. 
     
      
    203    So far as counts 12, 13, 15 and 16 are concerned, I cannot see in the evidence of RD any markers for reliability of a kind different to those which she said accompanied the events relied on to prove counts 11 and 14. However, the jury may well have been impressed by the way she gave evidence of these matters and thought there was no issue arising from RD senior’s evidence that raised a reasonable doubt as to RD’s reliability.  
     
      
    204    Count 9 involved the first assault by the appellant, count 10 both RD and TD, count 17 concerned the assault in the truck and count 19 the last assault by the appellant. The allegation founding Count 18 involved assaults by the appellant and his son Stephen. No mistake or confusion was possible. RD, however, said that she had cleaned herself in the bathroom which, implicitly, was in the house. The jury convicted despite the apparently truthful evidence of RD senior that the water had not been connected to the bathroom and all washing was done in a shed in the backyard. The jury may well have regarded this evidence as being only peripherally significant.  
     
      
    205    The question, of course, for the jury was not whether sexual assaults occurred or even that their number was, at least, not less than those charged but whether it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the particular occasions charged did occur. The question arises whether any of the guilty verdicts which I have identified is so inconsistent with the verdicts of acquittal that those convictions should be quashed. In MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 368) - 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and commonsense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty (R v Irvine [1976] 1 NZLR 96 at 99; R v Morgan [1981] 2 NZLR 164 at 168-169; R v Cooper (1993) 149 AR 207; Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings and Practice in Canada, (1983) at 15.212, requiring that the verdicts be ‘so mutually contradictory or violently at odds in relation to the evidence that they cannot stand together in the sense that no reasonable jury, who had applied their mind to the facts of the case, could have arrived at the same conclusion’: R v Peterson (1996) 106 CCC (3d) 64 at 79; cf Hall v Poyser (1845) 13 M & W 600 [153 ER 251]; Bedford v Crapper [1949] 3 DLR 153). More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law (R v Zundel (1987) 35 DLR (4d) 338 at 401-402, applying R v Mc Shannock (1980) 55 CCC (2d) 53 at 55-66; cf Mack v Elvy (1916) 16 SR (NSW) 313). It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside (R v Drury (1971) 56 Cr App R 104 at 105). It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ‘It all depends upon the facts of the case’. 
         
        
       
      
    206    In my view, the verdicts of guilt on counts 12, 13, 15 and 16 are not so inconsistent with the verdicts of acquittal on counts 11 and 14 that they cannot be reasonably explained as the outcome of an appropriate consideration of the evidence. Accordingly, I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    207    Counsel for the appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed along the lines proposed by Dunford J in R v RAT [2000] NSWCCA 77, 24 March 2000, although no such direction was sought at the trial. It will often be the case that, acting reasonably, a jury which considers that a witness is or might be dishonest in respect of some of his or her evidence cannot be satisfied of his or her honesty in respect of any other part. Accordingly, if the case depends upon the jury accepting the witness’ evidence as true beyond reasonable doubt in any particular respect, it might well be that a reasonable doubt about honesty as to any matter will mean that the jury should have a reasonable doubt about the crucial evidence. However, situations can vary widely and this will not always be the case. Much will depend on the nature of the jury’s conclusion as to the witness’ honesty: a doubt is one thing, a determination that the witness has lied is another. Accordingly, I do not think that a jury should be necessarily be instructed that a doubt about a witness’ honesty as to part of his or her evidence must cast a doubt about their honesty as to the important part or parts. I do not consider, with every respect to Dunford J, that the evidence of a complainant in a sexual assault case should be treated any differently from that of any other witness whose evidence is essential to proof of the charge. There will, however, be some cases where a decision that a witness is lying or even of doubtful veracity might so affect their evidence as render necessary a strong direction concerning the consequences of an adverse finding as to credibility. Similar considerations affect the evaluation of the reliability of a witness’ evidence. I cannot see anything in the judgments of their Honours in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 which justifies a more rigid approach. Dunford J also suggested that juries should be warned that different verdicts where there is no material difference between the applicable evidence “are liable to be regarded as a compromise and the guilty verdicts set aside”. Whilst I entirely agree that juries should, in appropriate cases, be warned in strong terms against compromise, I do not think, with respect, that the possible result of a potential appeal is an appropriate matter for the jury to consider. 
     
      
    208    Ground 4 of the grounds of appeal concerned count 21, which alleged that the appellant offered RD senior money “in order for her to give false evidence at court, intending to pervert the course of justice”. This charge was brought pursuant to s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900, which is in the following terms - 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who does any act, or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice, is liable to imprisonment for 14 years” 
        
       
      
    209    Before moving to the appellant’s contentions concerning this ground, I should mention part of the learned trial judge’s introductory directions to the jury. His Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        “[The appellant’s] account is that he was extremely worried facing a false charge and he did not even want them, as he said, to think that he had did it. It is a matter for you to assess the evidence, but I observe to you that it is frequently encountered in the Courts - and you will understand this I would think - that as a part of human nature, that persons who are falsely accused of a crime, will do everything they can to ensure that they are not convicted and sometimes they will even lie about it. It is not an attempt to pervert the course of justice if evidence of this nature is given to ensure that an innocent man is not convicted. That is if you accept - that is on what the accused puts to you.” 
        
       
      
    210    Although there is some ambiguity, this passage seems to suggest that dishonest evidence given for the purpose of ensuring an innocent person is not convicted does not constitute the crime of attempting to pervert the course of justice. This is wrong. Any attempt to induce a witness to give false evidence on oath or refrain from speaking the truth will constitute the offence, as will any bribery of a witness, even for the purpose of inducing him or her to tell the truth: Meissner v The Queen (1995) 80 A Crim R 308, per Dawson J at 327. In this case, however, the prosecution alleged that the appellant attempted to induce RD senior to give false evidence as to two matters: firstly, that there was no bed in his truck; and, second, that she had been present at a conversation involving the complainants RD and TD and their father in which “they were going to have [the appellant, semble, falsely] charged with rape”.  
     
      
    211    Having regard to the way in which the trial was conducted, by both prosecution and defence and the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury, the jury were required to consider whether the appellant attempted by payment to induce the witness to say the things alleged and, if so, whether they were, to his knowledge, untrue. Even though the last of these elements was not vital to guilt, it is certainly the case that, if the jury were satisfied that he attempted to induce her to say one of the alleged untruths, then the offence was proved. In this Court, I should note, the Crown has not submitted that the burden of proving this element was unnecessary or that the directions to the jury in respect of this count unduly favoured the appellant.  
     
      
    212    It is submitted, on the appellant’s behalf that the jury may not have been unanimous about which of the untruths was involved, so that some jurors may have been satisfied that the appellant attempted to get the witness to say there was no bed but doubtful about whether he also attempted to induce her to say (in effect) that RD, SD and their father were conspiring to falsely accuse him of rape but the rest of the jury were of the opposite view. It is also submitted that the count is duplicitous. 
     
      
    213    The section under which the appellant was charged provided that the crime comprised any act done or omission not done with the specified intent. Here, the alleged act comprised a bribe to give false evidence comprising two (or possibly one or other) lies. I consider that the count was, to this extent, duplicitous, for the reasons stated by Hunt CJ at CL in Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341 at 345 and Spigelman CJ in Regina v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53, since the appellant could not plead guilty only to one act, does not know whether he has been convicted of one or more offences and the judge will not know whether he should sentence for one or other or both lies (and see Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 per Gleeson CJ at 662 and Stanton v Abernathy & anor ( No 2) (1991) 53 A Crim R 241, per Gleeson CJ at 242). It will not be every case, however, where duplicity will lead to a miscarriage. Here, I do not think that that the defence was, in any real sense, embarrassed by the allegation in a single count that the appellant sought to have RD senior tell two lies rather than one, nor do I think that there was any significant difference for sentencing purposes between the lies (as in Giam) or if both lies were told. However, I consider that it was essential to instruct the jury that they could not convict unless all jurors were satisfied as to one or other of the alleged statements that it was a lie and the appellant committed an act intended that it be said in evidence. In respect of each of the alleged statements there was a real issue as to what was meant although the appellant’s evidence was somewhat unlikely. He said, in essence, that he had wanted RD senior to say that there was no bed in the truck in the sense that later models of the vehicle had a built-in bed. Whether this was a distinction without a difference rather depended, amongst other things, on what precise allegations had then been made by RD as to the bed. So far as witnessing the alleged conspiracy against him was concerned, the appellant said that RD senior had told him on an earlier occasion that the conversation had occurred. 
     
      
    214    The learned trial judge directed the jury as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has to prove three things. Firstly that he offered her $10,000. Secondly, that that was in order for her to give false evidence about one or more of the first nineteen charges in respect of which you have already decided that there is a verdict of guilty. And thirdly, that he intended thereby to pervert the course of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        The things which are contained in the statements said to be made by the accused, on which the Crown relies, are, firstly that he asked...[R D] senior to say that there was no bed in his truck... The Crown’s case is that when he said there was no bed there, then that means that he was asking her to tell a lie about that. The accused’s case [is] that even though those words appear there, he says he meant a real, permanent bed as used in later model trucks...If what he puts to you was what he really meant, then that is not an attempt to pervert the course of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the Crown says that he asked her to say that she sat around a table with [E]...and that she was brought into the conversation with his two daughters, and that ‘they were going to have me charged with rape’...His account...is that he heard from his wife [R D senior] that what I have just said was the case.  
        
       
      
    215    His Honour did not direct the jury that, if they had a doubt about either of these particulars, they must acquit. If the Crown case was, indeed, that proof of both particulars was essential to guilt, his Honour could not have failed to give a direction in precisely those terms and directed them to acquit if they had a doubt about either. The jury would, reasonably in my view, have been rather mystified at the point of such a direction, since attempting to persuade a witness to tell even one lie must constitute the offence. However, the learned trial judge identified each of the proposed lies and each of the accused’s answers as separate matters. I consider that the jury must inevitably have concluded that proof beyond reasonable doubt of either allegation established guilt of the charge.  
     
      
    216    In KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417, the prosecution had to establish that the appellant committed three of a number of alleged sexual assaults to prove his guilt on a charge of maintaining an unlawful relationship under a provision of the Criminal Code (Qld). The jury were not directed that they had to be satisfied of the same three offences on the same three occasions. Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ (at 191 CLR 424) concluded (Kirby J agreeing, in substance) that, in the absence of any direction as to unanimity, it was impossible to say that the jurors must have been agreed as to the same alleged acts; indeed, had the jury been appropriately instructed, they may have found it impossible so to agree; with the consequence that the appellant was denied the chance of acquittal that was fairly open. With respect, I consider that this reasoning applies to the circumstances of the instant case and I am unable to discern any point of real distinction. In KBT only one offence was charged but the mere fact that it comprised three particular acts was incidental. Even if the offence was established by proof of one sexual act, precisely the same considerations as to unanimity would have been required. Here, the offence would have been established on proof that the appellant sought to induce RD senior to tell one lie or another, but the jury had to agree on the lie. In Morex Meat Australia Pty Limited and anor (1995) 78 A Crim R 269, the Queensland Court of Appeal said (at 292) - 
     
      
       
        
        “We consider that the appellant...was properly charged in count 17 with, and convicted of, a single offence of attempting (or ‘tending’) to pervert the course of justice, of which the particulars of the relevant element of that offence consisted of the eight acts identified by the prosecution at the trial, and the proof of that tendency consisted of the evidence in support  
        of any one or more of those acts which the jury were persuaded beyond reasonable doubt to accept 
        .” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    217    Since conviction depended on proof of one or other alleged lie, I respectfully do not agree that unanimity on the ultimate conclusion overcomes the problem that there may not have been unanimity on the necessary basis for that conclusion. 
     
      
    218    As the evidence concerning the appellant’s attempts to suborn RD senior was admissible at all events in the trial of the other counts in the indictment, the error I have identified does not affect the other convictions. 
     
      
    219    In my view, the appeal as to Count 21 should be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered. Otherwise the appeal should be dismissed.

     R v Kevin Paul NAISMITH 
      
      SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: The prisoner Kevin Paul Naismith has been found guilty by a jury of the murders of Danny John Wasley and Mark Andrew Banks, both at Charlestown on 16 August 1999.  
    2    The prisoner, both deceased and a fourth man, whose name I have ordered not be published and who is hereinafter referred to as ""the accessory"", were all in August 1999 involved in the cannabis trade in the Newcastle area. It appears that Danny Wasley was getting his supply from Mark Banks and on-selling part of that supply to the prisoner, who in turn was on-selling a small amount to the accessory who was selling it in small deals. It also appears that Wasley and the prisoner had been ""ripped off"" in a drug deal in Sydney in December 1998 as a result of which they had each lost about $13,000, and according to the accessory, the accused told him that he believed Banks was the person who had organised the rip off.  
    3    A drug deal was arranged to take place on the afternoon of Monday 16 August 1999 and on the previous day the prisoner told the accessory that he was going to get the cannabis from Banks and rip him off to get roughly what Banks had previously ripped off him ""and a bit extra"". He asked the accessory to be there as he did not want the same thing as had happened the previous December and be ripped off again. He also told the accessory that he would be carrying ""a piece"". He had previously demonstrated to the accessory and to a neighbour, Mr Elder, a rifle and a sawn off bolt action hand gun which he and the accessory had test fired in the sand hills behind Stockton Beach.  
    4    The prisoner and the deceased Wasley had been best of mates since childhood and they spent some time together on the morning of 16 August visiting a motorcycle repair man etc. The prisoner picked up the accessory at his home at about 12.30 pm and took him to the prisoner's place. The prisoner's defacto wife and a friend of hers left there at about 1 pm. Shortly after that, Wasley arrived in his red Ford utility vehicle, and he and the prisoner went into the garage at the back of the house. According to the accessory he was, at the prisoner's request, waiting behind the garage.  
    5    What happened in the garage after that was narrated in detail by the accessory and one needs to be cautious about accepting such evidence because, being an accessory, there may be a tendency for him to minimise his own part and exaggerate that of the prisoner. However, the material parts of what went on in the garage were heard by a number of neighbours who were all impressive witnesses and one of whom wrote down almost contemporaneously with the events what she heard and saw.  
    6    There is no doubt that an argument developed in the garage between the prisoner and Wasley, and according to the accessory this was because the prisoner accused the latter of being involved in the rip off in December 1998. Wasley denied his involvement in the rip off and pleaded with the prisoner, calling out in a frantic voice, ""I didn't do it"" and, ""Please Kev, don't do it"". However the fight continued with a number of thumping sounds, and then the prisoner called the accessory to come around to the front of the garage. He went in and saw Wasley lying face down, the back of his head ""fairly bashed in"" and with blood all over the place and a baseball bat which he had borrowed from the accessory about a month before, laying next to Wasley, broken and with blood all over it. According to the accessory, he asked the prisoner what he had done and he said that this was one of the guys that had ripped him off. The prisoner then left the accessory in the garage with the body, saying he was going to the house to meet someone. 
    7    About 15 minutes later Mark Banks arrived at the house in a blue Hyundai vehicle borrowed by him and was seen by the neighbours to go towards the front door of the house. Shortly afterwards the accessory heard two gun shots and the prisoner then walked back to the garage, told the accessory that he had shot Banks, and after checking Wasley for a pulse said, ""Good, they are both gone."" He then took the accessory up to the house where the latter observed Banks dead on the floor with gun shot wounds to his head. He asked the prisoner who it was and he replied, ""The other bloke that ripped me off"". The accessory also saw the hand gun and a container of cannabis on the kitchen bench. 
    8    Ingrid Pfeiffer and her mother were neighbours of the prisoner and were having their lunch when they saw the prisoner and another man who fitted Danny Wasley's description go into the garage and later they heard sounds of a struggle coming from the prisoner's garage and heard a frantic raised voice saying, ""I didn't do it"", and, ""Please, Kev, don't do it"". They heard a number of thumping sounds and then silence after which they saw the prisoner leave the garage alone and go in the direction of the house, after which they saw the blue Hyundai pull up and the driver go towards the front door. About 10 or 15 minutes later they saw the prisoner walk back to and enter the garage and a short time later he emerged with a person who fitted the description of the accessory. Mrs Simpson, another neighbour also heard voices coming from the garage, one was that of the prisoner and the other was a high pitched voice like somebody was very stressed, she heard banging noises like someone being pushed around inside the garage; similarly Mr Simpson. 
    9    After both men had been killed, the prisoner got the accessory to drive the cars in which each deceased had arrived to Warners Bay Shopping Centre where they were left, and later they wrapped both bodies in tarpaulins. Later that evening the prisoner hired a trailer, and early the following morning both bodies and various other items were taken to the sand hills at Stockton Bight where they were buried, and over the following two nights burnt, to the extent that only one femur bone of Wasley could be identified, and the body of Banks was also extensively burnt. 
    10    Whilst, as I say, one must have reservations about the evidence of the accessory, the evidence of the neighbours so far as it went was most convincing, and consistently with the jury's verdict I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner arranged to meet Wasley on the day in question, took him to the garage where he accused him of ripping the prisoner off, and attacked him physically and with the bat to the extent that he killed him by striking him to the head a number of times with the bat so that his skull was bashed in and he died in a pool of blood. He then went to the house and waited for Banks to arrive with a large quantity of cannabis and shot him in cold blood, then with the co-operation of the accomplice he buried and later burnt the bodies. 
    11    I am satisfied that both murders were premeditated and planned. The prisoner either arranged for both the deceased to attend his premises or at least knew they were coming, he borrowed the baseball bat from the accessory beforehand and acquired, cut down and tested the hand gun at Stockton. He also told his friend and neighbour, Mr Elder not to come to the premises that afternoon and, according to the accessory, said he had told his friends to stay away that day and had arranged for his wife to be out. His wife gave evidence on sentencing suggesting that her going out was coincidental, but I am satisfied that the prisoner either arranged for her to be out or knew she would be out. After killing the deceased he then burnt their bodies, so that they were denied a decent burial.  
    12    The prisoner denies any involvement in the killings and at his trial gave a cleverly contrived version of the facts, which showed great imagination and inventiveness and fitted in with about 90% of the incontrovertible evidence for the Crown, but made subtle changes to words attributed to Wasley in the garage by the accessory and the neighbours. He attributed the death of Banks to an unmasked gunman who threatened him that he and his wife and children would be killed if he did not dispose of the bodies and all the evidence of the shooting, and attributed the death of Wasley to an associate of such gunman. The jury clearly rejected his version and so do I.  
    13    The Crown alleged that the motive for the deaths was to rip off Banks and thus recover $13,000 that the prisoner had lost when ripped off in December and to set himself up financially as he would have been if he had not been ripped off and that he believed Wasley was also involved in the rip off. There is some evidence to support this theory, but the killing of two men, including his best mate, appears to be out of all proportion for such retaliation. It may be that the motivation for the killings was to enable the prisoner to take over the drug activities of both deceased, but there is no evidence of this, and I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was in fact the motive. I therefore treat the crimes as ones where the motive has not been established. But whatever the motive, there is no doubt in my mind that the murders were related in some way to dealing in prohibited drugs. 
    14    The crimes are objectively very serious and there is nothing in the evidence to mitigate such objective gravity. Two persons are dead, one of them supposed to be the prisoner's best friend, and he has shown no remorse or even regret for their deaths. At the time, Wasley's pleas for mercy were ignored and Banks was given no chance. It may be that the accessory played a bigger part than he has admitted, but even if he did, that does not, in any way reduce the criminality of the prisoner; indeed if he and the accessory planned the killings together, that would be evidence of additional premeditation and planning. I am satisfied that in both cases the intention of the prisoner was to kill, and not merely to cause grievous bodily harm and the fact that both deceased were engaged in the illegal drug trade does not in any way reduce the objective criminality of the offences.  
    15    Having regard to these matters the Crown has submitted that this is a case that falls into the worst category for offences of this nature and therefore justifies a sentence of life imprisonment. Whilst in no way minimising the gravity of the offences, I reject this submission. Notwithstanding the deliberate nature of the killings and the lack of remorse, but bearing in mind that the prisoner was until he had a serious accident at work an apparently honest, hardworking and valuable member of society, that he has no previous convictions and that these offences were related to his involvement in the illegal drug trade, I consider that after a lengthy sentence of imprisonment there are prospects of rehabilitation, provided that on his release he keeps away from such illegal trade. 
    16    The prisoner was born on 15 August 1969 and is now aged 31 years. His father died when he was young. After completing an apprenticeship as a fitter and machinist and obtaining various trade certificates he worked as a fitter and machinist for some time, and subsequently bought a milk run which he operated for some years, but was required to sell it when he broke up with a former defacto wife. In 1994 he had a fall from a crane at work and badly injured his back. For this injury he received a compensation pay out and after paying off a number of debts and legal expenses, he and his current defacto wife were able to purchase the house at 18 Whitburn Close, but it appears that since the injury he has been unable to obtain paid employment and his only income has been from trading in cannabis.  
    17    He and his current defacto wife have four children, aged 7, 5 and twins of 20 months respectively. His wife has been back at work for 3 years, except for 7 months leave which she took for the birth of the twins. The prisoner's family are supportive of him and he is described as a good family man and a good father to the children. I have been asked to take into account a charge of supply a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 as noted on Form 1. He was arrested on 25 August 1999 and has been in custody since that date.  
    18    The accessory pleaded guilty to two counts of accessory after the fact to murder relating to his part in the disposal of the bodies. He co-operated with police, led them to where the bodies had been buried and later burnt at Stockton, and showed them where the keys of the deceaseds' cars had been buried, where cans of baby food from the garage had been dumped in a swamp, where wood and petrol had been purchased and so on. He offered to give evidence against the prisoner and subsequently did so and his narrative of events, supported in most instances by independent or objective evidence, considerably assisted the Crown case. He was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment for 4 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months. He also had drug matters taken into account on a Form 1. It was submitted that regard should be had to his sentences in sentencing the prisoner as otherwise the latter would feel a justifiable sense of grievance. I reject this submission. There can be no comparison between the objective gravity of the actual killings and being an accessory after the fact, and in addition with the pleas of guilty, assistance to the police, and the offer to give evidence, the accessory was entitled to, and received, significant discounts in his sentence. I therefore regard the sentences passed on the accessory as irrelevant.  
    19    I have read the Victim Impact Statements and, whilst I extend my sympathy to the families of both deceased, I do not consider the matters referred to in such Victim Impact Statements affect the sentences which should otherwise be imposed. Although the two killings were very closely related in point of time and probably also in motive (whatever that was), and it is therefore appropriate to make the sentences concurrent, the fact remains that two persons have had their lives cut short, but I also have regard to the principle of totality. 
     
      
      
      
      
    20    Kevin Paul Naismith on each count in the indictment that is for the murders of Danny John Wasley and Mark Andrew Banks respectively I sentence you to imprisonment for 33 years, such sentences to be served concurrently and are deemed to have commenced on 25 August 1999. I fix a non-parole period of 25 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 24 August 2024. I note that in sentencing you for the first count in the indictment I have taken into account the matter on the Form 1.

     REGINA v A.N. 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   PRIESTLEY JA: I agree that the orders proposed by Kirby J should be made, for the reasons he gives, subject to the same reservation as that stated by Greg James J, which does not bear upon the proposed orders. 
     
      
    2   GREG JAMES, J: Except in respect of one matter, I agree with the judgment of Kirby, J., which I have read in draft. 
     
      
    3   I am content the appeal be disposed of on the basis that, for the reasons his Honour gives, the tendency evidence was not properly admitted and the jury were not properly directed as to what evidence was available for what purpose on each count. In addition, I agree with his Honour's observations concerning the mis-statement of the evidence and the submission there was no evidence on count one. 
     
      
    4   The exception to which I have referred involves the question of the reception into evidence of the material of sexual activity extraneous to each particular charge as relationship evidence. 
     
      
    5   Whilst I consider his Honour's discussion of the questions involved most valuable, I find difficulty in accepting that in this case, if this material were to be admitted as relationship evidence and the jury to be directed to use it only as evidence of relationship in accordance with the direction required by application of the principles in Regina v. MM [2000] NSWCCA 78, they would be able in reality to act in accordance with that direction. 
     
      
    6   These considerations might merit reconsideration of the concepts of ""relationship"", ""context"", “guilty passion"" and such like in the light of the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 as they might apply to cases similar to this one but such considerations should await a suitable case. 
     
      
    7   In my view, it is not necessary to decide this appeal that the evidence be analysed to consider its possible use as relationship evidence. The appeal should be upheld on the limited basis I have indicated. 
     
      
    8   It is for those reasons I joined in the orders made.9   KIRBY J: The appellant, AN, was charged with a number of sexual offences. They arose out of allegations made by his stepdaughter, and her daughter, that is, his step granddaughter. 
     
      
    10   The charges concerning the stepdaughter were heard in Dubbo before Gibson DCJ and a jury. On 17 December 1998, AN was convicted. He was remanded in custody. 
     
      
    11   The trial concerning AN’s step granddaughter later proceeded before Gibson DCJ and another jury. AN was again convicted. On one count of carnal knowledge, involving his stepdaughter, the appellant was sentenced to nine years penal servitude, with a minimum term of seven years. Fixed terms, each of two years, were imposed in respect of the remaining counts. 
     
      
    12   An appeal was lodged against each conviction. Leave was sought to appeal against sentence. When the matter was argued on 14 September 2000, it was apparent that the appeals had to succeed. At the conclusion of argument, the appeals were allowed. The convictions in each case were quashed, and a new trial ordered. No judgment was given at that time. I now provide my reasons for joining in that order. 
     
      
       
      The First Trial. 
       
      
    13   AN was charged with three offences. They may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
    · First Count: That between January 1950 and December 1953, he indecently assaulted his stepdaughter, she then being less than 16 years (namely, approximately 9 years) (s76 Crimes Act, 1900). 
     
      
    · Second Count: That between January 1955 and April 1956, AN did unlawfully carnally know his stepdaughter, she being above the age of 10 years and under the age of 17 years (s73 Crimes Act, 1900). 
     
      
    · Third Count: The third count was in the same terms as the second count (s73 Crimes Act, 1900). 
     
      
    14   AN’s stepdaughter was born in 1941. She had two brothers. AN was employed on a property as a station hand. The family was housed in the shearers’ quarters, some distance from the homestead. 
     
      
    15   The appellant’s stepdaughter gave evidence that, from time to time, the owners of the property went away. Her stepfather had access to the homestead. The incident said to give rise to the first count occurred at the homestead whilst the owners were away. There was a grapevine next to the house. AN and his stepchildren used to pick grapes and eat them. The stepdaughter described an occasion where the appellant inserted a grape in her vagina. He then retrieved it with his teeth. He did this a number of times, perhaps six times in all. The complainant’s brother witnessed these events. He gave evidence broadly along the same lines. He, like his sister, was told to keep the episode secret from their mother. 
     
      
    16   The family later moved to another property. By the time of the move, the stepdaughter was about thirteen years old. They lived in a homestead, where the stepdaughter had her own room. She gave evidence that AN came to her room. He lay on the bed. Ultimately, intercourse took place. She was able to fix the time by reference to the death of a relative. A death certificate of that relative was tendered identifying the date as 23 October 1954. 
     
      
    17   The complainant described a further occasion when the appellant came to her bedroom. She had lost her school hat. Her mother had no money for a replacement. She said AN offered 7/6d, the cost of the hat. Once more he lay on top of her. Intercourse again took place. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    18   In respect of the first trial, there were ten grounds of appeal. The Court, having ordered a new trial, I need only deal with those grounds which gave rise to that order, and such other matters as may be of assistance in a new trial. 
     
      
    19   The grounds which require consideration may be grouped as follows: 
     
      
    · First, the admission of evidence of conduct by the accused on occasions other than those charged. 
     
      
    · Secondly, an alleged misdirection in respect of tendency evidence. 
     
      
       
      The Admission of Evidence 
       
      
    20   After the jury had been empanelled, and before the Crown opened, a discussion took place in the absence of the jury. Counsel for the Crown sought a ruling on evidence. The evidence related to the conduct of AN towards his stepdaughter on occasions other than those charged. Counsel for AN objected to that evidence. The following exchange took place between the Crown and the trial Judge: (T.8) 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I’d seek to lead the evidence on two bases - firstly to show a tendency on behalf of the accused to act in the way that the complainant alleges that he acted on the three occasions isolated within the indictment, and secondly, your Honour, I’d seek to lead the evidence to establish … or to show the jury firstly the context in which those things occurred and the nature of the relationship that existed. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The relationship evidence, yes, that’s admissible, but you’re asking it to go further, you’re asking it to be admitted under s97? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Have you given notice? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Notice was given, your Honour, yes. …” 
        
       
      
    21   The Notice was not produced during the course of this exchange. Counsel then appearing for AN made no reference to its terms, nor complaint that it was inadequate. I will come back to the Notice shortly. 
     
      
    22   The Crown then gave the trial Judge a broad description of the nature of the evidence which it proposed to call. His Honour repeated his preliminary view that the evidence was admissible to describe the relationship between AN and his stepdaughter. 
     
      
    23   Counsel for AN sought its exclusion, under s135 and s137 of the Evidence Act, 1995. After a brief discussion, his Honour ruled that he would admit the evidence upon both bases identified by the Crown. 
     
      
    24   Before evidence can be admitted as tendency evidence, the requirements of s97(1) and s101(2) must be satisfied. Those sections are in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “S97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        S101(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    25   His Honour did not advert to either section, nor the requirements of each section, apart from notice. 
     
      
       
      Evidence Led by the Crown 
       
      
    26   The Crown led evidence concerning a number of specific incidents involving the complainant and her stepfather. There was an occasion which occurred at the first property. She and her brother made icing for a cake. AN was apparently in bed, naked. He pretended to be asleep. They painted his penis with the cake icing. He then pretended to wake up, and be angry. According to the complainant, he then placed icing in her vagina, and licked it off. 
     
      
    27   There was no attempt to fix the time of this episode, and its relationship to each of the incidents, which gave rise to the charges. 
     
      
    28   The complainant also gave evidence of visiting the homestead with AN, and her brother, when the owners were away. She said this: (T.39) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. … did you go into the bathroom on some occasions? 
         
        A. Yes, we used to go in there and have a bath in the bath and we’d all be in there and we’d all have no clothes on.” 
        
       
      
    29   Elsewhere she said: (T.40) 
     
      
       
        
        “We just all used to be in the bath and we’d touch each other.” 
        
       
      
    30   When cross examined, it emerged that only she and her brother were in the bath. However, the “touching” concerned her brother, her stepfather and herself (T.23). There was no elaboration. The nature of the touching was not described. 
     
      
    31   Similar non-specific evidence was given about games played by AN with his stepchildren. Indeed, the matter was pursued at the suggestion of his Honour, he believing that it required clarification. The transcript included the following passage: (T.23) 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. … I just want to ask you a couple of further questions, you mentioned during the course of your evidence that yourself and your brother … and the Accused would from time to time play games? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You remember saying that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you said that often when you played these games you would have no clothes on? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to tell me firstly what were these games that you played? 
         
        A. We used to just touch each other and I can’t remember exactly what we used to do, we used to - it was just something we did sort of all the time.” 
        
       
      
    32   His Honour then asked the following question, which was the subject of complaint in one of the grounds of appeal: (T.24/25) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. How old were you when you first started playing these games with your brother and your stepfather? 
         
        A. I can’t remember how old we were but when we lived in Guildford I remember we had secrets from my mum then but what happened -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How old were you when you lived at Guildford? 
         
        A. About five or six and I remember then that we had secrets from mum.” 
        
       
      
    33   The Crown charged two acts of intercourse (counts 2 and 3). The appellant complained that evidence which suggested, or hinted, that there may have been other episodes, was admitted. The complainant, for instance, said this: (T.34) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You’ve told us that this occurred on two occasions. Do you have a recollection of whether or not it occurred on any other occasion? 
         
        A. I don’t remember specifically but I remember after a while that I learned if I’d pretend to be asleep he wouldn’t knock too hard on the door because he’d wake my mum up so I’d just pretend to be asleep.” 
        
       
      
    34   The stepdaughter also gave evidence, which suggested an ongoing relationship with her stepfather. It was in these terms: (T.35) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. … do you recall at what age or approximately what age you were when you commenced to have your periods? 
         
        A. I was about thirteen. I got them when I was at Mount Nanima.” 
        
       
      
    35   It is necessary to consider the admissibility of this material on each of the bases accepted by his Honour, namely, as relationship evidence, and as tendency evidence (that is, evidence of “guilty passion”). 
     
      
       
      Relationship Evidence 
       
      
    36   Evidence is admissible to prove the relationship between the complainant and the accused, where an understanding of that relationship is important to the determination of guilt. Such evidence serves two purposes. The first is to explain what happened, and why it happened. The second is to furnish the context within which the allegations against the accused may be examined. 
     
      
    37   Let me deal with each of these purposes in somewhat more detail. The first justification for the reception of relationship evidence is that it furnishes an explanation for the conduct of the accused. In R v Wilson (1970-71) 123 CLR 334, Barwick CJ endorsed the following passage in R v Bond (1906) 2 KB 389, taken from the judgment of Kennedy J: (at 338) 
     
      
       
        
        “The relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for which the accused is on his trial.” 
        
       
      
    38   In Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590, McHugh J explained the purpose of such evidence in these words: (at 630) 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence relating to the accused and the alleged victim (‘the relationship cases’), although revealing other criminal conduct, will frequently be admissible because it tends to prove how or why the conduct the subject of the charge arose or because it makes it more probable than not that the conduct occurred at the time or place or in the way alleged. In ‘the relationship cases’, evidence of previous acts is admissible not to show a general criminal disposition but to show the nature of the relationship between the parties.” 
        
       
      
    39   The touchstone is logic. Barwick CJ in Wilson (supra) said this: (at 339) 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not that all evidence of the relationship of the parties is admissible, but only that from which a relevant inference may logically and reasonably be drawn.” 
        
       
      
    40   In the context of sexual offences, McHugh J made the following comment in Harriman v The Queen (supra): (at 631) 
     
      
       
        
        “Likewise in sexual cases, evidence of previous acts of misconduct by the accused in relation to the complainant will usually be admissible because it tends to prove why or how on the occasion in question the offence occurred in the circumstances alleged. In  
        Reg v Etherington  
        ((1982) 32 SASR 230), evidence of previous acts of sexual intercourse and indecent assault by the accused on the complainant was rightly admitted because it served ‘to explain why she continued to submit to him and why he was able to commit his indecent acts upon her on the occasion charged’ ( 
        Reg v Etherington 
         (supra) at 235).” 
        
       
      
    41   The second purpose is to put the events in context. In R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Finlay and Levine JJ agreed), said this: (at 515) 
     
      
       
        
        “… the evidence is admissible in order to place the evidence of the offence charged into a true and realistic context, in order to assist the jury to appreciate the full significance of what would otherwise appear to be an isolated act occurring without any apparent reason.  
        R v Wickham  
        (CCA,17 December 1991, unreported) provides a very good example of how the act of sexual intercourse which was the subject of the charge would have appeared to be astonishing, and almost unbelievable, if the jury had not been made aware of the existing sexual relationship between the adult accused and the child complainant.” 
        
       
      
    42   McHugh and Hayne JJ in Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106, dealt with that purpose in these words: (at 130/131) 
     
      
       
        
        “Without knowing the course of the relationship, the jury may have had great difficulty in accepting that the incidents could have occurred in the way that the complainant described ( 
        R v Etherington 
         (1982) 32 SASR 230).” 
        
       
      
    43   They added: (at 131) 
     
      
       
        
        “Knowing that this was not the first time that the complainant and the appellant had engaged in sexual activity helps to explain the complainant’s apparent lack of surprise at being called into the bathroom to gratify the appellant’s sexual desires and her matter of fact recounting of the incident. The regularity with which incidents such as this occurred also helps to explain her failure to mention the incident to her mother and the appellant’s confidence …” 
        
       
       
      Limits Upon the Admissibility of Relationship Evidence 
       
      
    44   Are there limits to the admissibility of such evidence? A number of limitations have been rejected. Barwick CJ, in Wilson (supra, at 339), rejected the suggestion that evidence of relationship is limited to evidence which establishes motive. Nor, in the context of sexual offences, can the prosecution be confined to offences of the same type. Hunt CJ at CL in Beserick (supra) said this: (at 527) 
     
      
       
        
        “As Stable J said in  
        R v Witham  
        ((1989) Qld R 49, at 77), such a restriction would be ‘quite unreal’. Different types of sexual activity are, as that judge said, ‘all part of the same passion, the same sex urge’. When the other sexual activity has  
        preceded 
         that which is the subject of the charge, evidence of it will often be important in many cases to show how the nature of the accused’s guilty passion grew from minor transgressions, which the victim was initially reluctant to accept, to grave infringements of the law which, though not welcomed by the victim, were ultimately accepted without further express protest.” 
        
       
      
    45   Is proximity a requirement? Is it valid to enquire whether the events, which the Crown seeks to introduce, are too remote from the events which are the subject of the charge? A distinction needs to be made between events before and after the incident charged. It is hard to see how events after the offence can provide a context, although it is possible (if they are sufficiently proximate) that they may (cf Hunt CJ at CL in Beserick (supra) at 525). The relationship after the offence may, nonetheless, with the aid of the presumption of continuance, and if reasonably close in point of time, provide an explanation for certain conduct (cf R v Fordham 90 A Crim R 359, per Howie AJ). 
     
      
    46   Dealing with events before the offence, time, as such, appears not to be a limitation upon the reception of relationship evidence. The test is logic, and the capacity of the event to explain the conduct charged. Thus, McHugh J in Harriman v The Queen (supra) said this: (at 630) 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Reg v Garner 
         ((1963) 81 WN (Pt1) (NSW) 120) on a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, evidence of ‘a long course of cruelty and continued ill-treatment’ (p 122) by the accused to the complainant was rightly admitted because it showed the ‘atmosphere of hostility’ (p 129) which existed and made more probable than not that the assault in question had occurred.” 
        
       
      
    47   However, the remoteness of conduct from the offence charged is important to the exercise of discretions under s135, s136 and s137 of the Evidence Act, 1995. Hunt CJ at CL in Beserick (supra), said this: (at 521/522) 
     
      
       
        
        “As the authorities which I have cited show, remoteness of the other sexual activity from the time of the offence charged goes to the weight of that evidence. The more remote the other sexual activity is, the less will be its weight; and, in general (as a matter of commonsense), the weight to be afforded to  
        subsequent 
         sexual activity will be less than that to be afforded to  
        previous 
         sexual activity.” 
        
       
      
    48   Further, some form of balance needs to be maintained between evidence relevant to the offence charged, and evidence introduced either as relationship evidence, or evidence of guilty passion (cf Hunt CJ at CL in Beserick (supra) at 522). In R v Bradley (1989) 41 A Crim R 297, Shepherdson J said this: (at 302) 
     
      
       
        
        ”It is in my view not necessary that in every case the whole history of sexual activity between an accused person and the complainant be admitted in evidence. In some cases a trial judge may have to take care to limit that history to what is sufficient to enable the jury to set in its proper perspective and to understand the acts alleged to constitute a particular offence. In other words, in some cases the ‘full story’ … may have to be limited … In a case such as the present where there are quite a large number of instances of carnal knowledge alleged against the appellant prior to the first of the acts of alleged indecent dealing the prejudice to an accused person may be so great that the sheer number and weight of those instances may well overbear the jury in its consideration of the evidence in each of the three charges and prevent the jury from considering that evidence impartially.” 
        
       
      
    49   Finally, the generality of evidence concerning relationship, on one view, may render it inadmissible. In Gipp v The Queen (supra) Gaudron J said this: (at 112/113) 
     
      
       
        
        “General evidence of sexual abuse on occasions other than those charged does not have that special probative value which renders evidence admissible as ‘similar fact’ or ‘propensity’ evidence. And in this case, there was no feature of the kind present in  
        R v Ball 
         ([1911] AC 47) that made it directly relevant to the question whether the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. Thus, unless there was some subsidiary issue in the trial to which it was relevant, the evidence of general sexual abuse was not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    50   Callinan J was of a similar view (at 168/169). However, McHugh and Hayne JJ saw such evidence as unexceptional, often reflecting choices made by the advocate appearing for the accused. They said this: (at 132) 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence tendered was general in its nature and, as the above passage, makes clear, was admitted for the limited purpose of making the circumstances of the specific offences more intelligible. It was admissible because it was evidence ‘as to acts so closely and inextricably mixed up with the history of the guilty act itself as to form part of one chain of relevant circumstances ‘ ( 
        R v Bond 
         [1906] 2 KB 389 at 400; see  
        Wilson v The Queen 
         (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 338, 343). Counsel might have objected to the generality of the evidence and insisted that the complainant should recite in detail, so far as she could, the times, places and manner of these sexual interferences. But he preferred - what seems to us to have been the better forensic choice - that the evidence of the sexual history should be given shortly and without prejudicial detail.” 
        
       
      
    51   Kirby J, on this aspect, did not express a concluded view (cf 73 ALJ 432 at 440-441). Powell JA, in R v MM [2000] NSWCCA 78, provided the following comment upon this decision: (at para 46) 
     
      
       
        
        “Although in the course of their separate Judgments in  
        Gipp v R  
         (1998) 194 CLR 106 Gaudron J at 111-113 and Callinan J at 168-169 expressed the view that general evidence of sexual abuse on occasions other than those charged is, in the absence of conduct on the part of the defence which raises an issue to which prior abuse is relevant, not admissible unless it has a special probative value which renders it admissible as propensity evidence, that view does not appear yet to command a majority in the High Court.” 
        
       
      
    52   Here, the only evidence which seems to me arguably inadmissible, is the evidence relating to touching in the bath, and games. The evidence is not simply general. It is ambiguous, and arguably, not sexual. The remaining evidence, including that which may suggest more frequent intercourse, appears to me to be admissible. It tends to prove how or why the conduct, which is the subject of the charges, arose. It makes it more probable that such conduct occurred (cf McHugh J in Harriman (supra) at 630). 
     
      
       
      The Tendency Evidence 
       
      
    53   The same evidence was admitted at tendency evidence. Was it properly admitted? The Crown was obliged to pass through three gates before such evidence was admissible (quite apart from discretions which arise under s135 and s137 of the Evidence Act, 1995). 
     
      
    · First, the Crown was obliged to give reasonable notice in writing of its intention to adduce tendency evidence (s97(1)(a)). The Court has the power, upon application, to dispense with notice (s100(1)). 
     
      
    · Secondly, the Court must determine that the evidence, either by itself, or in combination with other evidence, has significant probative value (s97(1)(b)) (cf R v Lockyear (1989) 89 A Crim R 457). 
     
      
    · Thirdly, in a criminal trial, the evidence cannot be used unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have upon the defendant (s101(2)). 
     
      
    54   Here, the particular basis upon which the evidence was put forward was that it suggested that AN had a guilty passion for his stepdaughter, that is, an attraction or sexual desire for her. The relevance of such a passion was explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Beserick (supra) in these words: (at 515) 
     
      
       
        
        “The ‘guilty passion’ of the adult for the child which such conduct shows may well make more credible the complainant’s evidence that the sexual activity took place upon the particular occasion which is the subject of the charge. In other words, it makes it more likely that the offence charged was in fact committed:  
        Martin v Osborne  
        (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 376 (Dixon J);  
        Harriman v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 631 (McHugh J);  
        B v The Queen 
         (at 602, 09, 610-611, 618).” 
        
       
      
    55   However, careful directions were required before episodes in the sexual history between the complainant and the accused may be used when determining guilt. McHugh J, in Gipp v The Queen (supra) said this: (at 132) 
     
      
       
        
        “If the evidence of sexual history had been directed to specific incidents, although not the subject of charges, the learned judge would have been entitled to direct the jury that if they found one or more of those incidents proved, they could use such a finding or findings as proof of a ‘guilty passion’ in support of the charges in the indictment ( 
        R v Ball 
         [1911] AC 47 at 71;  
        O’Leary v The King 
         (1946) 73 CLR 566 at 575, 577, 582;  
        R v Hissey 
         (1973) 6 SASR 280 at 288-289). In that event, it would have been necessary to direct the jury that these incidents as well as the charges had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    56   Here, there was no evidence of any relationship, much less a guilty passion, which predated count 1 (the episode relating to the grapes). That needed to be said to the jury. 
     
      
    57   Further, much of the general (and especially the vague) evidence concerning the relationship between AN and his stepdaughter (the touching and the games) was, in my view, incapable of satisfying the requirements of s97(1) and s101(2). 
     
      
    58   It emerged, moreover, in the course of argument on the appeal, that the Notice which the Crown had given to the accused was defective. The obligation upon the Crown was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “S99 Notices given under section 97 or 98 are to be given in accordance with any regulations or rules of court made for the purposes of this section.” 
        
       
      
    59   Regulation 6 of the New South Wales Evidence Regulations, relevantly, is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “6(2) A notice given under section 97(1) of the Act (relating to the tendency rule) must state: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the substance of the evidence of the kind referred to in that subsection that the party giving notice intends to adduce; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if that evidence consists of, or includes, evidence of the conduct of a person, particulars of: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the date, time, place and circumstances at or in which the conduct occurred; and 
           
           
          (ii) the names and addresses of each person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the conduct, 
           
           
          so far as they are known to the notifying party.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    60   The Notice given by the Crown said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Notice is hereby given that the Crown will, subject to such order or orders that the Court may make, adduce tendency evidence at the trials of these matters as to the character, conduct and tendency of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        In the case in respect of each complainant the Crown will lead evidence of the charges in respect of each of the other complainants. 
        
       
       
        
        In the case in respect of each complainant the Crown will lead evidence of all sexual activity engaged in by the accused with that complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        The substance of that evidence and the particulars of the date, time, place and circumstances at or in which the conduct occurred has been disclosed in the brief of evidence and the evidence at committal, as have the names and addresses of each person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the conduct so far as they are known to the Crown.” 
        
       
      
    61   Plainly such a notice does not comply with the requirements of the Regulations. The Crown did not suggest otherwise. The Notice should have identified, in terms, the evidence to be called, and provided the other information required by the Regulations. 
     
      
    62   No complaint was made by the appellant concerning the Notice. However, that cannot be taken as a waiver. In criminal proceedings, in order for there to be a waiver of, inter alia, the provisions of Pt 3.6 of the Evidence Act (which includes the requirement for notice), a number of conditions must be satisfied. First, the accused must be apprised of his or her rights, and advised to waive those rights by his or her lawyer (s190(2)(a)). Secondly, the Court must be satisfied that the accused understands the consequences of giving consent (s190(2)(b)). The issue was simply not addressed. It is plain that nobody turned their minds to the question of waiver. Nor did the Crown make application to dispense with notice under s100. One is left, therefore, with a failure to provide notice, as required by s97(1)(a) of the Evidence Act. Objection was taken to the evidence by counsel for the appellant. Accordingly, the evidence was not properly admitted. 
     
      
       
      Direction on Tendency Evidence 
       
      
    63   In the course of the summing up, his Honour dealt with the evidence concerning the appellant’s conduct towards his stepdaughter on occasions other than those charged. He introduced his directions with these words: (S/U 11) 
     
      
       
        
        “You may consider such evidence but only for the limited purposes that I now outline, and they are two in number.” 
        
       
      
    64   His Honour then described the various episodes set out above (the icing incident, the games, the touching). He then referred to the first purpose, which was to put the charges in a realistic context; to make them intelligible. 
     
      
    65   His Honour thereafter dealt with the second purpose, which was concerned with the suggestion that AN harboured a “guilty passion” for his stepdaughter. His Honour said this: (S/U 13) 
     
      
       
        
        “Similarly, the Crown suggests that the actions of the accused showed that he had developed a guilty passion towards the young girl, the complainant, that she was sexually attractive to him and that he had in effect trained her. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence that this was the situation then you can use that in determining whether, on the occasions alleged in the indictment, he gave way to that guilty passion and indulged in the conduct complained of.” 
        
       
      
    66   His Honour added these words, which were the subject of a specific ground of appeal: (S/U 13) 
     
      
       
        
        “In addition if you are satisfied to the degree required, that is beyond reasonable doubt, in relation to one of the charges you may use that fact to assist you in the same way in relation to the other charges.” 
        
       
      
    67   His Honour concluded his directions on this aspect with the following comment, which appears to contradict the direction given immediately before: (S/U 13) 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence must not be used in any other way. It would be completely wrong to reason that because the accused has committed one crime or been guilty of one piece of misconduct he is therefore the sort of person who would be likely to offend again. You cannot substitute this evidence for the specific acts charged in the indictment. It is admitted on the basis that I have referred to only and can only be used in that way.” 
        
       
      
    68   With respect, it is difficult to see how a finding of guilt on one charge can readily be used to assist in determining guilt on another. It is possible that the conduct found in one charge may be evidence of guilty passion, which may assist in determining another charge. However, careful directions would be required to deal with that circumstance. Determining count 3 (the last in the sequence), for instance, would not assist in determining the first charge (the grape incident). 
     
      
       
      The Second Trial 
       
      
    69   Having been convicted in December 1998 as a consequence of the first trial, AN was tried again before the same Judge, and another jury, in March 1999. There were five charges which may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
    · Count one charged that between December 1970 and December 1971 the appellant did unlawfully carnally know his step granddaughter, she then being under the age of 10 years, namely 4 years (s73 Crimes Act, 1900). 
     
      
    · Counts two to five each alleged that AN had indecently assaulted his step granddaughter on various occasions when she was 6 years old (count two), 8 years (counts three and four), and between 10 and 11 years (count 5) (s76 Crimes Act, 1900). 
     
      
    70   The step granddaughter was born on 7 March 1966. She gave evidence in relation to counts two to five inclusive, in which she said that she had a recollection. She had no recollection of the episode giving rise to the first count (involving the allegation of carnal knowledge). Her older brother gave evidence concerning that episode, which I will deal with separately below. 
     
      
    71   Returning to the counts alleging indecent assault, the second count arose out of an incident when the stepdaughter was six years old. She alleged that AN gave her a piggyback, and placed his fingers under her shorts, and on her vagina. 
     
      
    72   The third and fourth counts arose out of the same incident. The complainant was then eight years old. She used to visit her grandparents at their property in the country. She said that she went to a shed with her brother. AN came to the shed. He persuaded the brother to keep a watch. AN then removed the complainant’s red shorts. He placed his tongue upon her vagina (count three). Later her brother did the same, after which AN once more placed his tongue on his granddaughter’s vagina (count four). 
     
      
    73   Count five arose out of a later visit to the property. According to the complainant, AN encouraged her to “have sex” with a neighbouring boy. In the course of a conversation soon after, “something came up” about the complainant falling pregnant. It was alleged that AN, in these circumstances, obtained his wife’s contraceptive device, an applicator, which he then filled with cream, and inserted in the complainant’s vagina. 
     
      
    74   Returning to the count alleging carnal knowledge at a time when the complainant was four years old (count one), the complainant’s brother gave the following evidence: (T.38) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And when you did that, what happened, what did you observe about …? 
         
        A. Very scared, we all were. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did you see in relation to him and …? 
         
        A. He was trying to put his penis inside her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did you in fact see? 
         
        A. One of us was standing at the end of the table, my brother was facing him and … and I was at the end of the table, I saw everything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did you in fact see? 
         
        A. His penis trying go inside my sister.” 
        
       
      
    75   In cross examination, the complainant’s brother said this: (T.40) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What was … wearing? 
         
        A. Nothing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long had … been wearing nothing for? 
         
        A. About ten minutes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you lifted … up with no clothes on at all, is that right? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you placed her on top of his body? 
         
        A. On his penis. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On his penis? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then what happened? 
         
        A. He tried to thrust her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He tried to thrust her? 
         
        A. Mm hmm but she was too young for him so she screamed stop. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She was too young for him she screamed stop and you and … were there whilst this was occurring, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes it was, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did that incident stop? 
         
        A. … screamed so we took - I took her off it. I just took her and we run.” 
        
       
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    76   As with the first trial, during the course of argument on the appeal, it was apparent that a new trial was necessary in respect of the second trial. First, the Crown relied upon the same defective Notice under s97(1) in respect of tendency evidence. 
     
      
    77   Secondly, his Honour gave the same direction as set out in para 66 above in the second trial. I believe, with respect, this was a misdirection justifying a new trial. 
     
      
    78   Thirdly, there was a misstatement of the evidence in the course of the summing up. His Honour did not have the advantage of a daily transcript. He was obliged to rely upon his notes. As it happens, his note of the evidence on one aspect was inaccurate. The summing up on this aspect was rather more adverse to the accused than the evidence justified. 
     
      
       
       
      Application for Acquittal 
       
      
    79   The appellant did not seek, except upon one count, a verdict of acquittal. With that exception, it was acknowledged by the appellant, that the appropriate order was for a new trial on each count. 
     
      
    80   The exception was count one in the second trial (the count alleging carnal knowledge). It was asserted that there was no evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, could infer beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant penetrated, in the least degree, his step granddaughter. 
     
      
    81   I disagree. The purpose of the appellant, according to the complainant’s brother, was to “go inside (his) sister”. He was described as having “tried to thrust her” while she lay naked on top of him. She was described as screaming. I believe this charge, as with the remaining charges, should be the subject of a new trial, should the Director of Public Prosecutions so determine. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    82   The order made by the Court on 14 September 2000, which I supported, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. That in respect of each count in both trials, the appeals are allowed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The convictions in each case are quashed, and the sentence set aside. 
        
       
       
        
        3. There should be a new trial.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings, in view of the young person being under the age of eighteen, I have already indicated that the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 apply, and have made orders which provide for non-publication of the young person's name. The order will also apply for the other two young persons to whom I will refer. 
     
      
    2    TCP was committed to this Court together with three co-accuseds, two being young persons bearing the initials PL and RG respectively, and the third being Jonathan Whitfield, on a number of serious offences including murder. 
     
      
    3    The trial date had been fixed but PL indicated that he wished to change his plea, and now TCP has also changed his plea. It is conceded by the Crown that this plea was made at the earliest opportunity. The plea was entered into before me to the charge of robbery in company, contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4    The plea of guilty is taken into account by me in the decision that I make in relation to TCP. The theft is of robbery involving a compact disc player and a mobile phone, both items being the property of a Ralph Mason, now deceased. 
     
      
    5    The facts are that the deceased, Ralph Mason, was heard to cry out for help at about 12.45am by a neighbour. The deceased was observed inside the property, and there were some quick movements and someone falling to the floor within that property. The police eventually attended the premises, found a trail of blood on the concrete leading to the front door, and the flyscreen door buckled. The police found the deceased lying on the floor beside the lounge and bloodstains on the carpet. The handset telephone was underneath the deceased. 
     
      
    6    The cause of death was stab wounds to the deceased's back. There was also a severe head injury and fracturing of the skull. The stab wounds which caused the death were stab wounds to the abdomen, as well as the blunt force head injuries. 
     
      
    7    TCP was arrested on 15 January 1999, and RG, PL and Jonathan Whitfield were arrested on 16 January 1999. 
     
      
    8    In a record of interview, TCP admitted that he had gone to the premises with a view to robbery with the three co-accused. The others wore balaclavas but he did not, and the robbery was intended not to cause any injury, even though TCP observed that there was a knife and a pole from a shopping trolley carried by the co-accused. He was told by Jonathan Whitfield that he had to come. Whitfield had threatened him if he did not participate. 
     
      
    9    TCP observed Whitfield kicking the screen door and stabbing the deceased with the knife after Whitfield and the deceased had struggled. The deceased called out for help on several occasions. TCP saw the knife in Whitfield's hands. TCP ran. Whitfield called him into the house and said that he was to participate while the assault was going on. 
     
      
    10    TCP ran with Whitfield to a nearby high school where he met the others. The balaclavas, the metal pole, the knife and the mobile phone were thrown away and the four returned to the flat of TCP's sister. 
     
      
    11    TCP comes before the Court as a person with no criminal record, as a person of good character. He relies on the psychologist's report of Elizabeth Kusch, a psychologist with Duffy Barrier and Robilliard. TCP also relies on a Juvenile Justice report of 25 October, of Mr John Brennan and Mr Reinhard Hitzegard of the Wollongong District Office of the Department of Juvenile Justice. Additionally, TCP relies on a case conference summary as to his custody and a reference from Councillor Violet Pocock of the Wollongong City Council; and also evidence of work that TCP carried out whilst in custody. 
     
      
    12    TCP has spent some eighteen months and twenty days in custody before he was released on bail. This period is somewhat longer than the two co-accused, who have already pleaded guilty to this offence. 
     
      
    13    It is put by the Crown, and it is not contested, that the degree of TCP's involvement was of a slightly higher level, indeed significantly higher than those who have already been sentenced, in that he actively persisted in Whitfield’s principal act of attacking the deceased, that he did in fact enter the premises and seize certain items, and that he did in fact spend slightly longer in custody. 
     
      
    14    The young person has indicated before this Court on oath that he proposes to enter into an undertaking to the Crown to give evidence against Jonathan Whitfield. I accept his evidence as given in that undertaking and on oath that he will co-operate. That is a factor which I take into account in the sentencing process which is now being carried out. 
     
      
    15    The Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act provides in Part 2, Division 4, that where there has been a plea to an indictable offence, which is not a serious indictable offence, the matter can be dealt with at a Children's Court. The offence of robbery in company carries a penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. It is not a serious indictable offence for the purposes of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. It may therefore be dealt with under Part 3 of that Act, and I have already indicated that I shall exercise the powers of the Children's Court as it is appropriate, because of TCP’s age and circumstances. 
     
      
    16    I have referred to, and apply, a decision of Hunt CJ at CL in R v R (1993) 71 A Crim R 95, which deals with the matters to be taken into account in such a case. 
     
      
    17    The offence of robbery in company is a serious offence and has been the subject of a guideline judgment. However, merely for these sentencing purposes, and in view of TCP’s youth, I note that that is a factor to be taken into account, particularly as his age is approaching eighteen years. 
     
      
    18    In terms of background, TCP and his siblings had a difficult time with his father who was abusive towards him and his mother, but his father would apologise for what he did. TCP obviously has a very loving and caring relationship with his mother. TCP’s parents were separated when he was seven years of age, and his mother formed another association which led to a further brother. TCP has been subject to a lot of moves, that is residential moves, and was subject to some peer group pressure where he began associating with some negative peers in the Wollongong area. For instance, he began smoking marijuana. Marijuana was found in his mother's de facto's room. 
     
      
    19    The history of moving from school to school, and from residence to residence, had a detrimental effect on TCP’s schooling and on his emotional upbringing. He is an average student, although he describes himself as below average. His childhood heritage means that he is stood over and picked on by other boys as is unfortunately common. He avoided school except for sport. 
     
      
    20    TCP does not now have addiction problems with any drugs. He has indicated that he is very sorry for what he has done. He has shown that he has grown up. He has carried out quite a remarkable regime of study in his time in custody, which demonstrates the maturity for a young man that a lot could admire and follow. I accept the substance of the reports before me, which indicate that TCP has grown up a lot and that this terrible, tragic incident in which he was involved, has caused him to realise how serious a matter he has been involved in. I also accept that he is extremely remorseful for what has happened. 
     
      
    21    TCP was, I think, fairly easily led. He is now getting assistance and I commend Councillor Pocock for the effort that she has made in providing TCP with assistance in the work that he has carried out. 
     
      
    22    I take into account in this sentencing process, that notwithstanding the objective seriousness, it would cause a justifiable sense of grievance if there was a significant disparity between the sentence of PL, RG and TCP. There is no such sense of grievance if sentenced on different facts or if TCP is less seriously involved. In fact, TCP in this case was more seriously involved, and I refer to Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 620, particularly the following passage (at 623): 
     
      
       
        
      ""It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence have to be taken into account."" 
       
      
    23    I have taken into account the heavier level of participation on TCP’s part, but also offset that by the fact that there is genuine remorse for what has happened, that he has demonstrated a responsibility and maturity in the way he has gone about undertaking courses which would improve his educational level, and that he has participated in quite a remarkable level of work. He has formed an ambition to gain a full-time apprenticeship in the bricklaying field, which is going to be a very lucrative income if he can carry on doing that. 
     
      
    24    I therefore propose to impose a similar bond and similar conditions as for RG and PL, and I particularly do that on the understanding that he will carry out that undertaking to the Court about which he has given evidence before me.

       3391/00 - BERNARD HILLEBRAND & ANOR v THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PENRITH 
        
        
       JUDGMENT (Ex tempore; revised 15 November 2000) 
        
       
      
     
     
     1    
     HIS HONOUR: This is an application by Notice of Motion filed on 30 October 2000 by the Council, as first defendant in the proceedings, for orders directed to part of the plaintiffs' Further Amended Statement of Claim filed on 1 November 2000 (‘the Statement of Claim’). 
      
       
      
     2    
     The orders seek to attack paragraphs 15 to 18 of the Statement of Claim which plead a cause of action in negligence against the first defendant in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ’15. In the alternative, if, contrary to the matters pleaded in paragraphs 8 and 11 above the first defendant is found to have validly conveyed either lot 17 or lot 20 of section C in Deposited Plan 976412 to the second defendant or the Half Lot to itself, the first defendant was under a duty to each of the plaintiffs to exercise reasonable care in taking any steps to sell each of the said parcels of land pursuant to sections 602 and 604 of the Local Government Act, 1919, as amended. 
         
        
        
         
         16. Further, in breach of the said duty, prior to executing the Deed of Conveyance to itself referred to in paragraph 4 above, the first defendant: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) did not take reasonable care to ascertain whether any rate levied by the first defendant in respect of the Half Lot had been overdue for more than five years at the time the Council decided to sell the said land; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) did not take reasonable care to publish any notice of any kind in the New South Wales Government Gazette or any newspaper of a sale of the Half Lot being land vested in the plaintiffs; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) did not take reasonable care in making a search against the Half Lot; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) did not take reasonable care to give notice to either of the plaintiffs of any proposed sale by the first defendant of the Half Lot. 
         
        
        
         
         17. In breach of the said duty, prior to executing Deed of Conveyance to the second defendant referred to in paragraph 9 above, the first defendant: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) did not take reasonable care to ascertain whether any rates levied by the first defendant in respect of lot 17 and lot 20 of section C in Deposited Plan 976412 had been overdue for more than five years at the time the first defendant decided to sell the said lands; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) did not take reasonable care to publish any notice of any kind in the New South Wales Government Gazette or in any newspaper of the sale of lot 17 and lot 20 of section C in Deposited Plan 976412 being land vested in the plaintiffs or any other persons; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) did not take reasonable care in making a search against lot 17 and lot 20 of section C in Deposited Plan 976412; and 
         
        
        
         
         (d) did not take reasonable care to give notice to either of the plaintiffs of any proposed sale by the first defendant of lot 17 or lot 20 of section C in Deposited Plan 976412. 
         
        
        
         
         18. By reason of the breaches of duty by the first defendant pleaded in paragraphs 16 and 17 above, the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage.’ 
         
        
       
      
     3    
     It will be seen that the cause of action asserts that the Council owed a duty of care to each of the plaintiffs to exercise reasonable care with respect to the sale of some parcels of land and that it failed to do so. The Council seeks to strike out these paragraphs under Pt 15 r 26 of the Supreme Court Rules, or to obtain an order that the claims based upon those paragraphs be stayed or dismissed under Pt 13 r 5. The Council relies, in addition to those two rules, on the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, submitting that the inherent jurisdiction is broader in scope than either of rules: see Mason K, ‘The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court’ (1983) 57 ALJ 449; cf, as to the respective scopes of the inherent jurisdiction and Pt 13 r 5,  
     Brimson v Rocla Concrete Pipes Limited 
      [1982] 2 NSWLR 937. 
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
      
     4    
     The plaintiffs have sued the Council for wrongfully selling three portions of the plaintiffs’ land in Emily Street, Londonderry New South Wales in 1993 for alleged non-payment of rates. The Council purported to do so in reliance on its powers under sections 602 and 604 of the Local Government Act 1919 (New South Wales). The land was held under old system title, though a primary application had been made to bring it under the provisions of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW). The portions sold comprised half of Lot 31 (‘the Half Lot’) and the whole of Lots 17 and 20 in Section C of Deposited Plan 976412. The plaintiffs had owned Lots 16 to 30 in Deposited Plan 976412 and the Half Lot as joint tenants since 1980. 
      
       
      
     5    
     The Statement of Claim pleads the conveyance of the whole of Lot 31 (including the Half Lot) by the Council to itself on 9 February 1993 in consideration of the sum of $555,650. It alleges that at the time of that purported conveyance no rates had been levied by the Council in respect of the Half Lot which were overdue for more than five years and that (in effect) the procedures set out in s 602 of the Local Government Act had not been followed and that the Council had not given the plaintiffs notice of any proposed sale of the Half Lot. 
      
       
      
     6    
     In its Amended Defence filed on 6 November 2000, the Council admits the assertion that no rates had been levied by it in respect of the Half Lot which were overdue for more than five years and the assertion that it did not give notice to the plaintiffs of the proposed sale. 
      
       
      
     7    
     Similar pleadings are found in the Statement of Claim with respect to Lots 17 and 20. In the case of those lots the Deed of Conveyance was made on 13 April 1993 in consideration of $3,050, the purchaser being Mr Richard Mork, the second defendant. 
      
       
      
     8    
     Again, the Council, by its Amended Defence, admits that no rates were levied in respect of Lots 17 and 20 which were overdue for more than five years and that no notice was given to the plaintiffs of any proposed sale by the Council of those lots. 
      
       
      
     9    
     The plaintiffs have submitted to me that, in light of those admissions, it is established that the Council's purported sales and conveyances of Lots 17 and 20 and the Half Lot were not authorised by s 602. Consequently, they submit, for the purposes of s 604, Lots 17 and 20 and the Half Lot are not encompassed by the statutory use of the words ‘the land’ because, as a matter of construction, those words refer only to land in respect of which rates have been levied that are overdue by more than five years. 
      
       
      
     10    
     Clearly, a major part of the case will be whether the purported conveyances had any effect in the circumstances set out above and whether Mr Mork can rely upon the defence conferred upon a purchaser by s 604(2) to any claim to recovery of the land after the Council has purported to dispose of it. Part of the relief sought in the Statement of Claim goes to establishing the validity of the conveyances. 
      
       
      
     11    
     The case is made complex by some inconsistency of description of the subject properties. It appears that the plaintiffs acquired by conveyance in 1980 land described as Lots 18 and 19 in Registered Plan 610. The conveyance also describes the land by metes and bounds. There are questions upon which, no doubt, survey evidence will become relevant as to the relationship between Lots 18 and 19 in Plan 610 and Lots 16 to 30 and the Half Lot in Plan 976412. 
      
       
      
     12    
     The Statement of Claim alleges that on the proper construction of the Deed of Conveyance in their favour the plaintiffs' land comprised Lots 16 and 30 and the Half Lot in the latter plan, but it appears that confusion was created by the co-existence of the two plans with different, though similar, numbering. 
      
       
      
     13    
     According to the evidence before me, an advertisement appeared in the Penrith Press on Tuesday 8 September 1992 giving notice of the intention of the Council to sell specified land for overdue rates. The specified land includes Lots 17 and 20 in Emily Street (the street which, according to Plan 976412, is the frontage to Lots 16 to 30 and the Half Lot), but the owners are named as ‘R Gropley’ and ‘K Moore’ respectively.  
      
       
      
     14    
     The plaintiffs submit that the intention of the Council was to specify Lots 17 and 20 in Plan 610, but when the sale was brought into effect the Council purported to sell Lots 17 and 20 in plan 976412, the plaintiffs' land, rather than the land of Mr Gropley and Mr Moore. 
      
       
      
     15    
     There is also evidence before me relating to a primary application made by the plaintiffs in respect of Lots 18 and 19 of Plan No 610. The primary application was dated 19 December 1990 and numbered PA63264J. 
      
       
      
     16    
     There was correspondence during 1993 with respect to the primary application between the Land Titles Office and the lodging party (Berkhart and Co) and Mr John Gibson, then the solicitor for the plaintiffs. It appears from that correspondence that the plaintiffs' application related both to land in respect of which they claimed documentary title and land in respect of which they asserted an entitlement based upon possession. 
      
       
      
     17    
     On 12 August 1993 Mr Gibson wrote to the Director of Land Titles saying: 
      
       
        
         
         ‘I refer to your letter of 3 August and advise that the applicants abandon their possessory claim to those parcels sold by Penrith City Council for unpaid rates. 
         
        
        
         
         I understand that these are Lots 17 and 20 Emily Street and also 31 Emily Street. I am not certain as to Lot 31 and should be pleased if you would let me know before I have the surveyor amend the linen plan.’ 
         
        
       
      
     18    
     Both plaintiffs gave oral evidence before me to the effect that they did not authorise Mr Gibson to write that letter and that they became aware of the existence of the letter only in May 2000. 
      
       
      
     19    
     Additionally, the plaintiffs have given evidence that they saw the advertisement in the Penrith Press to which I have referred but they observed that none of the lots identified was Lot 18 or 19 in Plan 610, and that they became aware that it was possible that some of their land may have been sold by the Council only in 1997 or 1998, when some work was done to the land on behalf of Mr Mork. The evidence implies that they were confused by the existence of the two plans and the failure of the Council's advertisement to specify which plan it had in mind. 
      
       
        
       Scope of Supreme Court Rules 
        
       
      
     20    
     In these circumstances, the Council seeks relief, as I have said, under the Supreme Court Rules or the Court's inherent jurisdiction. 
      
       
      
     21    
     As far as Pt 13 r 5 is concerned, it obviously cannot be said in the present circumstances that paragraphs 15 to 18 of the Statement of Claim are frivolous or vexatious, or that they constitute an abuse of the process of the court. The question under that rule is whether paragraphs 15 to 18 constitute a claim for relief which does not disclose any reasonable cause of action (r 5(1)(a)). 
      
       
      
     22    
     As far as Pt 15 r 26 is concerned, again there can be no claim, in the circumstances, of any abuse of process and so the question is whether sub-paragraph 26(1)(a) or (b) is attracted. They are in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ‘(1) Where a pleading-- 
          
         (a) discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading; 
          
         (b) has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings... 
          
         the Court may at any stage of the proceedings, on terms, order that the whole or any part of the pleading be struck out.’ 
         
        
       
      
     23    
     The Council does not in this application assert that paragraphs 15 to 18 fail to disclose any known cause of action. It is evident that the cause of action asserted in those paragraphs is a claim based on breach of a duty of care leading to economic loss (compare the earlier cases in this area,  
     McKenny v The Council of the Shire of Balmoral 
      [1906] QdWN Case 14;  
     Shoalhaven Shire Council v Logue  
     (1979) 41 LGRA 116, 121, which on one view may assert a stricter form of liability). There is no question of physical injury to the land or chattels upon it - this is a claim as to financial loss which is not ‘causally consequent upon physical injury to the plaintiffs' own property’: see  
     Bryant v Maloney 
      (1995) 182 CLR 609, 657 per Toohey J. 
      
       
      
     24    
     Although the plaintiffs submitted to me that the law as to negligence causing economic loss is in an uncertain state, (‘conceptually unsettled’ in the words of Kirby J in  
     Pyrenees Shire Council v Day 
      (1998) 192 CLR 330), it is at least plain that damages are the gist of the cause of action and that the cause of action arises when the economic loss is suffered: see  
     Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman 
      (1985) 157 CLR 424, 503-5 per Deane J. 
      
       
      
     25    
     The sole challenge to the cause of action asserted in paragraphs 15 to 18 is that any such cause of action is statute barred. Reliance is placed on s 14(1)(b) of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) which says: 
      
       
        
         
         ‘(1) An action on any of the following causes of action is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of six years running from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff or to a person through whom the plaintiff claims... 
          
         (b) a cause of action founded on tort, including a cause of action for damages for breach of statutory duty...’ 
         
        
       
      
     26    
     The immediate question is whether the Supreme Court Rules to which I have referred are relevant at all to the Council's limitation claim. 
      
       
      
     27    
     There is an obvious distinction between the pleading of a cause of action and the application of a limitation period which means that the cause of action is not maintainable. It is arguable that the words ‘no reasonable cause of action’ in the two rules have no application where the defect relied upon is the expiry of a limitation period. However, in my opinion the better view is that in an appropriate case if a cause of action is clearly statute barred, the Court may conclude that the cause of action is not reasonable for the purposes of these two rules and may act under the appropriate rule accordingly. The precondition to that conclusion is that on the pleadings, and without reference to any disputed questions of fact, the limitation period clearly applies and has expired. Although counsel have been unable to refer me to any case in which either of the rules has been applied because of the expiration of a limitation period, in principle it seems to me, having regard to the underlying policies of the rules as well as their wording, that they should be available in a very clear case.  
      
       
      
     28    
     The Council invited me to reinforce this conclusion by recourse to Pt 1 r 3(1) and (2), according to which the over-riding purpose of the Supreme Court Rules is to facilitate just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in proceedings, and the Court is to give effect to the over-riding purpose when it exercises powers and interprets the rules. The operation of this rule, which is new, was considered in  
     Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank 
      (2000) 49 NSWLR 51. My interpretation of Pt 13 r 5 and Pt 15 r 26 is consistent with Pt 1 r 3, but I do not find it necessary to rely on the latter rule in order to reach my conclusion as to the proper meaning of ‘no reasonable cause of action’. 
      
       
      
     29    
     Therefore, those rules are available to be invoked in the exercise of the Court's discretion, in my view. I am inclined to the view that Pt 13 r 5 is more appropriate in the present circumstances than Pt 15 r 26. This is because Pt 15 r 26 is limited to cases where there is a defect in the pleadings as such and does not include cases where after examination of the evidence the Court comes to the conclusion that the plaintiff's case is hopeless: see  
     Brimson's 
      case at 941. To establish the expiration of a limitation period, the Council must refer to some evidence, although (in its submission) the evidence is clear and uncontroversial. Although the Statement of Claim itself asserts the dates of the relevant conveyances, and at least implies that the conveyances (if valid) caused the loss relied upon in paragraphs 15 to 18, it seems to me that r 26 is not really directed at reliance upon the pleaded facts to establish the limitation point. I, therefore, prefer to rely on Pt 13 r 5 as a source of jurisdiction. 
      
       
      
     30    
     To the extent that the inherent jurisdiction of the Court reinforces Pt 13 r 5, I would rely upon the inherent jurisdiction as well, but it is not necessary for me to decide whether the inherent jurisdiction goes beyond Pt 13 r 5 in view of the construction I have adopted of the rule. 
      
       
      
     31    
     The Council relies not only upon the submissions that there is no reasonable cause of action disclosed in paragraphs 15 to 18 because of the expiration of the limitation period, but also that under Pt 15 r 26 (1) (b) paragraphs 15 to 18 have a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings. Essentially the submission is that if paragraphs 15 to 18 are allowed to remain, even though they are clearly open to objection because of the limitation period, the proceedings will be much longer and slower than they otherwise would have been. The plaintiffs say that to a large extent that is not so, because questions of assessment of damages will be referred to a Master and so issues of valuation will not have to be considered at the trial; and, in any event, there is a cross-claim by Mr Mork which will raise some issues of quantification of damages and other matters. In all the circumstances, say the plaintiffs, the hearing time will not be much reduced. 
      
       
      
     32    
     It is difficult for me to make a clear determination on this matter since there is no evidence on it before me, and I am relying only on the submissions of counsel. It seems to me, however, that if the cause of action in negligence causing economic loss is removed from the proceedings it is likely that there will be some saving in time and costs. I would, therefore, be inclined to regard paragraph 26(1)(d) as an additional jurisdictional ground for making the orders which I propose to make. However, as I have indicated, in my view it is preferable to act under Pt 13 r 5 as a matter of discretion. 
      
       
        
       Is the cause of action statute-barred? 
        
       
      
     33    
     This brings me to the key question in this case, namely, whether, on any view of the disputed facts, the limitation period must have expired so that paragraphs 15 to 18 do not disclose any reasonable cause of action. 
      
       
      
     34    
     The Council invites the Court to assume, for the purposes of determining that matter, that the plaintiffs were unaware of the facts constituting their right to commence proceedings against it for negligence at any time before the filing of the Summons by which the proceedings were instituted. The Summons was filed on 18 July 2000. 
      
       
      
     35    
     Section 14(1)(b) causes the limitation period of six years to commence to run on the day on which the cause of action first accrues. As I have mentioned, the cause of action in negligence causing economic loss is complete when the plaintiff first suffers actual economic loss or damage: see  
     Scarcella v Lettice 
      [2000] NSWCA 289, paragraph 13 per Handley JA. The authorities indicate that time commences to run when the damage accrues, even if the plaintiff is not aware of it:  
     Scarcella’s  
     case at paragraph 15. However, there is an apparent exception to those propositions where an owner suffers loss because of the existence of latent defect in a building, or because of the existence of a latent defect in title. 
      
       
      
     36    
     As far as latent defects in a building are concerned, the position was explained by Deane J in  
     Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman 
      at 503-5, a passage quoted in  
     Scarcella’s 
      case at paragraph 16. What emerges is that the fundamental question for the Court is to identify when the loss has occurred. 
      
       
      
     37    
     In the case of economic loss relating to a latent defect in a building, the loss does not occur until the inadequacy is first known or manifest. This is because until that occurs, the owner of the building is still in a position to dispose of it for a value not diminished by the defect, assuming of course that the purchaser from the owner would not discover the defect upon making normal inquiries. 
      
       
      
     38    
     Precisely the same principle is applied in the cases about latent defect in title.  
     Registrar General v Cleaver 
      (1996) 41 NSWLR 713 is a case where the benefit of a restrictive covenant was recorded on the plaintiff's certificate of title, but the burden of the covenant was not noted on the title of the land burdened by it. Both the land benefited and the land burdened by the covenant changed hands several times after the original mistake occurred. The plaintiffs acquired the property with the benefit of the covenant in 1978, but did not discover the absence of notation on the land burdened until 1988 when the proprietor of the land burdened threatened to breach the covenant. The plaintiffs were unable to enforce the covenant. They sought damages from the Registrar General because of his failure to annotate the register. The Registrar General unsuccessfully claimed that the action was statute barred. The Court's reasoning was that the plaintiffs' cause of action was not complete until the omission of the register was discovered because that was the time when the plaintiffs first suffered economic loss. They could, until that time, have resold the property for its full market value. A title search by someone aware of the existence of the covenant and the land benefited by it, would have disclosed the defect in title, but conveyancing practice did not require that such a search be made in connection with the sale and transfer of the burdened land. 
      
       
      
     39    
     Christopoulos v Angelos 
      (1996) 41 NSWLR 700 is slightly closer to the present circumstances. In that case the plaintiffs purchased property that was subject to an easement not recorded on the certificate of title to that property. However, the easement was recorded on the certificate of title of the dominant tenement. The plaintiffs had no actual or imputed notice of the easement at the time of the purchase. As with  
     Cleaver's 
      case, the existence of the easement could have been discovered by a search of the title to the dominant tenement, but conveyancing practice did not require searches to be made of the dominant tenement, or of unregistered easements, in connection with the sale and transfer of the servient tenement. The difficulty for the plaintiff was that s 42(1)(b) of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW), the fundamental provision dealing with indefeasibility of title to Torrens land, provides that the title of a registered proprietor is subject to an unregistered easement created in or existing upon the land. The Registrar General recorded the easement on the plaintiffs’ certificate of title about four years after the plaintiffs had become registered as proprietors. The Court of Appeal by a majority held that the plaintiffs did not suffer economic loss until the Registrar General recorded the easement on their title and they became aware that their land was burdened by it. 
      
       
      
     40    
     As with  
     Cleaver's 
      case, the reasoning was that until that time the plaintiffs could have resold their property for its full market value. If they had done so, they would not have incurred any economic loss. Consequently, economic loss only occurred at the point of time when the Registrar General acted and they became aware. The conclusion reached by the majority of the Court of Appeal was that the action (based on negligent misrepresentation), was not statute barred. I note that, according to the majority reasoning (per Handley JA at 703C, Cole JA at 711C), the plaintiffs would not have suffered any economic loss had they resold the property for its full market value in good faith before discovering the defect. 
      
       
      
     41    
     In the present case the economic loss flows from the conveyance by the Council of the two parcels of land by conveyances dated 9 February and 13 April 1993. The Council submits that the cause of action was complete upon delivery of the Deeds of Conveyance. It was the Council's conveying away of the land that caused the plaintiffs to suffer loss, and that occurred more than six years before the commencement of the proceedings. The plaintiffs submit that, by analogy with the latent defect cases, the cause of action for economic loss did not accrue until 1997 at the earliest, when one of them became aware that the Council had purported to make the conveyances. 
      
       
      
     42    
     In my opinion, the Council's submissions are correct on this point. This is a case where the loss was caused by the conveyances even though the plaintiffs were not aware of them. It is true that, the land being old system land, the plaintiffs might have purported to convey it for full value after the date of the conveyances by the Council. I have no evidence before me as to the proper conveyancing practice, but I am prepared to assume (indeed I am invited to do so, in effect, by the Council) that proper conveyancing practice would not have led to discovery of the conveyances by the Council if the plaintiffs had sold after April 1993. However, had they sold, they would have acted at a time when the conveyances by the Council were an established fact. Assuming (as the cause of action in negligence necessarily does) that the conveyances were effective, they operated to dispose of the title to the land the subject of the conveyances. A later purported conveyance would necessarily have failed to convey any title:  
     nemo dat quod non habet. 
      Therefore, a subsequent purchaser from the plaintiffs would have had a cause of action to recover an amount equivalent to the purchase money and other consequential loss from the plaintiffs, once the truth came out. There would surely be a high likelihood that the purchaser would seek recovery of the purchase price after discovering that the vendor had no title whatsoever. In those circumstances, any apparent avoidance of loss by the plaintiffs, if they had innocently purported to sell the land after April 1993, would have been likely to be corrected subsequently by a suit for damages brought by the purchasers from them. That prospect would be more than a mere contingency.  
      
       
      
     43    
     This is the crucial distinction between the present case and the  
     Christopoulos 
      case, for in  
     Christopoulos 
     , as I have emphasised, the Court of Appeal found that until the plaintiffs became aware of the defect they could have resold the property for its full market value and, thereby, avoided any economic loss. This implies that in the majority’s view, the prospect that a purchaser from the plaintiffs might sue them for damages for breach of warranty as to title (or, as in the  
     Christopoulos 
      case itself, for negligent misrepresentation in replies to requisitions) once the easement was discovered, should not be taken as sufficiently likely that the plaintiffs in that case should be regarded as able to sell only for a discounted price. Where, as here, the plaintiffs have no title whatever to convey to a purchaser, it is in my view unrealistic to proceed on the basis that they could convey away property that they did not own for a market price and retain the purchase money, and thereby avoid loss. 
      
       
      
     44    
     On this analysis, therefore, the economic loss asserted by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 15 to 18 of the Statement of Claim was suffered by them by virtue of the delivery of the Deeds of Conveyance in February and April of 1993. Upon the principles that I have set out, time commenced to run under s14(1)(b) at that stage, and the limitation period has expired. Therefore, even assuming the facts to be at their most favourable for the plaintiffs, the cause of action in paragraphs 15 to 18 cannot succeed because of the limitation period, and, in my view, the Council has made out its entitlement to relief. 
      
       
      
     45    
     In response to a question by me during the course of argument on 14 November, counsel for the plaintiffs said that he wished to rely upon s 56 of the Limitation Act, though he was unable to make any submission in respect of it at that stage. 
      
       
      
     46    
     Section 56 has the effect that where there is ‘a cause of action for relief from the consequences of a mistake’, the time which elapses after the limitation period commences to run and before the day upon which the plaintiff first discovers (or may with reasonable diligence discover) the mistake does not count in the reckoning of the limitation period. 
      
       
      
     47    
     If this section were applicable, it would have the effect that the cause of action in paragraphs 15 to 18 would commence to run no earlier than 1997 (on the plaintiffs' version of the facts), or no earlier than July 2000 (on the assumption the Council invited the Court to make). 
      
       
      
     48    
     In my opinion, however, this section does not apply. It is applicable only where the cause of action seeks relief from the consequences of a mistake. The cause of action in the present case seeks relief from the consequences of negligence rather than a mistake. It is true that the particulars of the negligence relied upon involve the assertion that the Council made mistakes including the mistake of confusing Lots 17 and 20 in Plan 610 with Lots 17 and 20 in Plan 967412, but the gist of the cause of action is negligence rather than mistake. 
      
       
      
     49    
     During argument, I led counsel for the plaintiffs to believe that he would have the opportunity to make submissions about s 56 and to refer the Court to any relevant authorities. In my  
     ex tempore 
      reasons for judgment delivered on 14 November 2000 I indicated that I would give counsel for the plaintiffs the opportunity to make any such submissions in writing by five o'clock on that day, and that I would defer making orders until 15 November 2000. I said that if any submission was made which affected the reasoning set out above, I would give the Council the opportunity to respond. If not, I would proceed to make the orders in chambers. Subsequently counsel for the plaintiffs notified my associate that he had received instructions not to lodge any further submission. 
      
       
      
     50    
     It follows from the reasoning set out above that it is strictly unnecessary for me to deal with the alternative submission made by the Council. This is a submission based upon Article 97 propositions 1 and 2 in  
     Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency 
      (16th edition 1996) (see also  
     Sargent v ASL Development Limited 
      (1974) 131 CLR 634 at 658), to the effect that the solicitor Mr Gibson had knowledge of all the relevant circumstances in 1993 and his knowledge should be imputed to the plaintiffs. 
      
       
      
     51    
     Suffice it to say that if this were the sole ground upon which the Council had relied, I would not have thought it appropriate to grant the relief which the Council seeks on any of the bases put forward today. This is because the state of knowledge of Mr Gibson as to the relevant issues in 1993 is far from clear, at least on the evidence before me now. In my view, it is just not appropriate to make any determination on that matter in an application of this kind. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
     52    
     Therefore, my orders will be that the claim to relief in the proceedings constituted by paragraphs 15 to 18 and the consequential claims for relief in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim be dismissed generally under Pt 13 r 5. 
      
       
      
     53    
     I propose to order the costs of the application to follow the event and that the proceedings be listed for mention before the Registrar next Thursday 23 November 2000.

     R v D.M.A. 
      
      JUDGMENT 
       
      (On fitness to plead) 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: Having regard to the provisions of ss 10 and 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, no persons other than members of the accused's family, members of the victim's family, members of the press or persons involved in the case may remain in Court. Any other persons are required to leave the Court and the name of the accused is not to be published without the consent of the Court. 
    2    Yesterday an inquiry was held pursuant to s 12 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (""the Act"") as to whether the accused is fit to be tried in respect of two charges pending against her, namely, (1) that on 25 January 1999 at Warilla, she did wound her mother with intent to murder, and (2) that on 23 July 1999 at Haberfield she did murder Scott Bremner. The hearing was short and at its conclusion I found that the accused was unfit to be tried and made consequential orders. I now give my reasons for those orders. 
    3    Subject to an incident towards the end of the hearing to which I shall refer, the inquiry took the form of the tender of a number of documents which became exhibits. These were tendered by consent and it was agreed by both counsel, Mr Dare, who appeared as Crown Prosecutor, and Mr Turnbull, who appeared for the accused, that subject to my being satisfied, the accused is unfit to be tried. In accordance with the requirements of s 12(2)(3) of the Act the proceedings were not conducted in an adversary manner and I do not regard the onus of proof as resting on either party, but I determined the issue on the balance of probabilities. 
    4    The issue has been determined by me, sitting without a jury, because of an Election by the accused pursuant to s 11A of the Act (exhibit C). Having regard to the material contained in paragraphs 38 to 44 of the affidavit of the accused's solicitor, John O'Donnell, sworn 9 November 2000, I am satisfied that before making the Election the accused sought and received advice in relation to such election from a barrister or solicitor, and that she was capable of receiving such advice and fit to make such election, see R v Mifsud (CCA - 8 November 1995). 
    5    The accused was born on 11 August 1982 and never knew her father. She was raised in a less than satisfactory home environment and was taken into care at 2 years of age. There followed a series of foster placements and periodically living back with her mother. She was apparently sexually abused by one of her mother's partners and was made a State Ward at the age of 4 years. She thereafter spent several years at Renwick, Mittagong, before at the age of 12 years being placed with foster parents under the auspices of Dr Barnardos, Wollongong. She has two half sisters, each by different fathers.  
    6    Over a number of years several psychotherapists who have seen her have expressed opinions as to her intellectual disabilities and social and intellectual immaturity, and she has been assessed as being within the mildly intellectually handicapped range. She also has episodes of rages and self harm. She developed and maintains a deep dislike of her mother. 
    7    The facts alleged by the Crown are that on the evening of 25 January 1999 she left her foster parents' residence and made her way to Warilla where she forced her way into the house occupied by her mother, menaced her mother's current de facto with a knife, as a result of which he fled the house and was chased by the accused. She later returned to the house and threatened her mother with the knife. Her mother ran from the house with another daughter and was chased by the accused. As the mother got into her car she felt a pain in her shoulder and heard the accused say, ""I'm gonna kill ya. I'm gonna kill ya"". The mother felt a sharp pain in her neck and had been stabbed, apparently by the accused. 
    8    After being charged with the offence in relation to her mother the accused was taken into custody and kept at Yasmar Detention Centre, but on 23 July 1999, while attending a TAFE cooking class held at that institution, she took a large kitchen knife and stabbed the course teacher, Scott Bremner, in the back. Mr Bremner died shortly afterwards during surgery at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital as a result of the stab wound. 
    9    The accused was seen by Dr Muul on 19 January 1999, that is before the attack on the accused's mother. His report sets out something of her background, and he noted a number of violent attacks over the years, as well as episodes of rage and deliberate self harm. He also noted that she had previously been diagnosed as suffering a Disruptive Behaviour Disorder not otherwise specified, Dissociative Disorder not otherwise specified, and Moderate Mental Retardation. 
    10    Another psychiatrist who had previously seen the accused, Dr Sarah Williams, had reported that the accused was the hardest case she had ever had to deal with in her 40 years of psychiatric practice. A psychological assessment done in January of 1995 had measured her verbal IQ at 46; her performance IQ at 46; and her full scale IQ at 40, although the psychologist felt that the IQ scale of 40 was probably an under-estimation of her abilities and reflected her degree of emotional disturbance and lack of educational opportunities. 
    11    Dr Muul considered that her Disruptive Behaviour Disorder had developed into a Conduct Disorder and that there was also present an Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as a Dissociative Disorder. He considered that she was at that time functioning in the range of mild mental retardation. 
    12    After the attack on her mother she was seen by Associate Professor Einfeld, subsequently described by Dr Brent Waters as ""a recognised expert in the area of mental illness and development disability"". Professor Einfeld expressed the view that she did not meet the criteria for fitness to be tried because she would not understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against her or be able to make a defence, except in response to simple or literal questions, and would not be able to give counsel any necessary instructions, apart from the most superficial and concrete ones. He felt her fitness to be tried was significantly limited by her intellectual ability. 
    13    She was also seen by Dr Westmore, a Forensic Psychiatrist, on three occasions: 11 August 1999, 12 November 1999 and 6 October 2000. The first interview was terminated when she assaulted Dr Westmore after about 45 minutes. In each of his reports Dr Westmore sets out a number of the questions he asked her and her responses to such questions. She showed a general lack of familiarity with, and lack of appreciation of, the Court processes. She would not talk about the incidents giving rise to the charges or about the alleged sexual abuse suffered by her. She was very vague about what subjects she was studying at school and claimed she had a best friend whose name she did not remember. She was also easily distracted by movements around her and Dr Westmore found it very difficult to get her to focus on relatively simple, straightforward questions or give any type of verbal response to a question. 
    14    In his report of 16 November he expressed the following opinion: 
     
      
       
       "" ... this young person is unfit to be tried, not because of her intellectual disability primarily, but because of her lack of social and intellectual (sic) maturity. She is also highly distractible and she would not I think be able to follow the proceedings of a lengthy trial. She appears to have some difficulty understanding the Presser issues, although I am not sure what level of explanation has been provided to her about these to date.  
        
       It is possible that with advancing age and maturity she might be able to focus more appropriately on the very serious matters now before the court. Her unfitness is not in my view related in any principal way to her intellectual disadvantage, but principally to a matter of maturity. She also is highly distractible ..."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    15    At her third interview with Dr Westmore on 16 October 2000, although conducted in an area where there were reduced levels of distraction from the environment, she continued to display high levels of distractibility and inattention. Again, questions and answers about the Court processes were recorded and she also admitted hearing voices and seeing faces. Dr Westmore confirmed his earlier opinion that she was not fit to be tried. 
    16    A further psychiatric examination, arranged by her own solicitor, was conducted by Dr Brent Waters on 30 October 2000. Dr Waters also had the opportunity to review the earlier reports. He concluded that she could not describe the role of the Judge, did not know the role of the jury and was unable to provide any understanding of the notion of instructing her solicitor. She was extremely distractible and at times she started mumbling inaudibly and said that she could hear voices. She expressed the view that she had the ability to predict events and told him that she knows two people who have somebody else's spirit in their bodies, and that one of the male prison officers in the Induction Unit had inside of him the spirit of the deceased, Scott Bremner. Dr Waters also formed the view that she was not fit to be tried for the same reasons as expressed by Professor Einfeld and Dr Westmore. He was of the opinion that at the time she was psychotic and showed abnormality of thinking in terms of delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations and her state was consistent with schizophrenia. 
    17    Finally, there was an affidavit by her solicitor who said that over the period of two years during which he had appeared for and represented her, she had exhibited little, if any, understanding of the legal process or procedures, and apart from the most mundane of questions, he found it impossible to get responsive replies to questions associated with the criminal charges and processes. He felt that her most recent presentation was significantly worse than on previous occasions. He also found her distractible and apparently hearing voices. He said that she cannot plead or instruct in a meaningful way, is delusional, and cannot accept the basic facts of the case. He expressed the opinion she would not understand what was going on in Court, even in a general sense, and could not give the Court or her counsel her version of the facts as can properly be established. 
    18    This perspective from her solicitor's point of view, together with the evidence of the psychiatrists, satisfies me that she is incapable of giving meaningful instructions for the conduct of her defence, and in the absence of such instructions she cannot be tried without unfairness or injustice. I do not believe she would be able to intelligently plead to the charges or give instructions for such pleas. Although she may understand, generally, the nature of the proceedings, I am not satisfied she would be able to follow the course thereof or the substantial effect of the evidence against her, in particular because of her easy and frequent distractibility. Moreover, she would not be capable of making any defence to the charges or giving evidence in support of such defences. These problems will all be accentuated the longer the trial lasts. See R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48, Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 245, 246. 
    19    When the proceedings commenced yesterday the accused was present in Court, she appeared reasonably relaxed and confirmed her name when I asked her. The tender of the relevant exhibits would have taken no more than 10 minutes and by the end of that time the accused was leaning to one side as though listening to something and repeating the words, ""Sorry, sorry"". She gradually became more and more agitated until she slumped further forward and to her side and appeared to be almost in a state of collapse. I waited a few minutes, and with assistance she returned to an upright position. I then asked her a few simple questions about whether she knew why she was here, where she was and who I was, but I received no response. I waited a short further time, but then, to avoid further distress to the accused or her family, I ordered that she be taken out of Court, intending to have her brought back for the making of the formal orders, and she was assisted out. 
    20    However, she could then clearly be heard making a great noise in the cells and with the express consent of her counsel I made the orders in her absence, regarding the circumstances which had arisen as constituting an exception to the general rule described in R v Cornwell [1972] 2 NSWLR 1 at 3, that the whole of the proceedings in respect of an indictable offence must be conducted in the presence of the accused, see also R v Hallacoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67. In reference to the concern expressed by Hunt CJ at CL in that case concerning cases of felony as opposed to misdemeanour, I note that the distinction has now been abolished in this State by s 580E of the Crimes Act 1900, inserted by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999, No. 94. 
    21    It was for these reasons that yesterday I found that the accused is unfit to be tried, in accordance with s 14 of the Act referred her to the Medical Health Review Tribunal, and remanded her to her former custody until further order. 
    22    One further matter concerns me. Following her being charged with the attempt to murder her mother, she then being aged 17 years and 6 months, the accused was remanded in custody and apparently kept at the Yasmar Juvenile Justice Centre, a Detention Centre maintained by the Department of Juvenile Justice under the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987. But whilst there during a cooking class she allegedly stabbed a teacher involved in the class with a kitchen knife, resulting in his death and her being charged with his murder. She was accordingly transferred to Mulawa Correctional Centre, an adult gaol, pursuant to s 28A of the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987 and has remained there since that time. 
    23    I understand she is kept in the ""Mum Shirl Unit"" which has been specially built for detainees with behavioural problems and is staffed by clinical psychologists and specially trained correctional staff, but clearly this young lady should not be in an adult gaol, whatever special provision is made by a special unit, but in a secure ward of a hospital maintained under the Mental Health Act 1990. She is clearly a danger to others and there have been a number of attempts at self harm. She is, on the evidence, intellectually disabled and lacks social and emotional maturity. She is highly unstable, violent and impulsive and apparently also suffering hallucinatory voices and visions. 
    24    Dr Waters also considers her psychotic and her condition consistent with schizophrenia. He concluded his report as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""She is also mentally ill at the moment and, in my view, she would benefit from appropriate psychiatric treatment. I would recommend that for her own safety, and the safety of others, she be placed in a secure psychiatric treatment unit where she can receive appropriate treatment."" 
       
      
      
    25    I endorse the doctor's opinion. As I say, it is not appropriate that she be kept in an adult gaol and she clearly needs appropriate psychiatric treatment. It is for this reason that I yesterday made a strong recommendation that she be transferred to a hospital within the meaning of the Mental Health Act, and detained there, rather than at a Corrective Services Institution.

     REGINA v Wayne James EADE 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   PRIESTLEY JA: The facts of this case, the matters that were raised by counsel for the accused, Mr Eade, before Kinchington DCJ and the way in which Kinchington DCJ dealt with those matters are set out in Kirby J’s reasons. 
     
      
    2   I agree with Kirby J that Kinchington DCJ was right in holding that the warrants to be relied upon by the Crown against the accused were invalid, but that that did not necessarily mean that evidence of the four conversations in question was inadmissible. I also agree with Kirby J and Greg James J that Kinchington DCJ was wrong, in ruling at the stage which he did, that he would not exclude the evidence in question from being placed before the jury. For the reasons given by both Kirby J and Greg James J that ruling was premature and may have been based on a misapprehension about onus (see par 63 of Kirby J’s reasons). 
     
      
    3   Despite my agreement with the views expressed by Kirby J and Greg James J on the matters that were argued before us, it seems to me desirable to add some observations concerning jurisdiction and procedure in the matters before the court. 
     
      
    4   After the presentment before Kinchington DCJ of the indictment against the accused containing the two charges detailed by Kirby J, but before a jury was empanelled, the judge was asked by counsel for the accused to rule on the admissibility into evidence of conversations between the accused and a witness named Hart whom, it seems, the Crown proposed to call in the Crown case. 
     
      
    5   Kinchington DCJ heard argument accordingly, after which he held that warrants the Crown was proposing to tender pursuant to which tape recordings had been made of the conversations between the accused and the witness, were invalid. He then gave reasons why he would not exclude evidence of the conversations from the jury. One step in his reasoning was that it did not necessarily follow from the proposition that the warrants were invalid that evidence of the conversations could not be given. 
     
      
    6   He ended his reasons by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In these circumstances I am satisfied that I should not exercise my discretion in favour of the Accused and exclude the evidence from being placed before the jury. To my mind it is proper for the circumstances surrounding all four conversations to be led into evidence. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    7   In the form in which his ruling and the reasons for it were presented to this court they were entitled “Judgment on admissibility of evidence - delivered 13/10/99”. A companion document containing a further ruling by Kinchington DCJ and the reasons for it was, in its form as presented to this court, entitled “Judgment on interlocutory application to permanently stay proceedings - delivered 13/10/99”. 
     
      
    8   The reasons in the second document stated that following his ruling that he would not exclude evidence of the four conversations, counsel for the accused had moved for a permanent stay of the false testimony charge in the indictment. Kinchington DCJ rightly observed that in light of his previous ruling the application for a stay must fail. However, he indicated that in his view the questions of the invalidity of the warrants and the consequences of their invalidity were important ones so that it was appropriate for him to certify pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act “that my two interlocutory judgments and the legal issues that arise out of them are proper ones for determination on appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal”. 
     
      
    9   Subsequently a certificate dated 13 October 1999 was given by the judge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        I hereby certify that the above judgment or orders is a proper one (sic) for the determination on appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal upon the following grounds: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Whether the listening device warrants were invalid in accordance with the decision of Grove J in  
        Bayeh v DPP 
         for failing to expressly direct the removal of the listening devices on or before a specific date. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The effect of such invalidity with regards to Section of the Listening Devices Act 1984, as amended. In particular whether Section 13 operates to exclude any evidence obtained by the listening devices being led in the trial against Eade on the charges of misleading the Royal Commission and inciting supply. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    10   A notice of appeal “against interlocutory judgment or order” was filed on 31 January 2000 on behalf of the accused. (an extension of time was asked for, and granted.) The notice said, in part: 
     
     “ 
     judgment or order appealed against: 
     
     
      
       
        
        1. That four conversations unlawfully obtained were admissible against the Appellant on a count of misleading the Royal Commission. 
        
       
       
        
        2. That four conversations unlawfully obtained were admissible against the Appellant on a count of incite supply. 
        
       
       
       judgment or order sought 
       
       
        
        1. An Order vacating the orders made by His Honour Judge Kinchington. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Such further or other order or orders as the Honourable Court thinks fit. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    11   This court must decide whether to uphold or dismiss the appeal (or the appeals, as in the oral argument they were at times treated as being). 
     
      
    12   In the written submissions filed for the Crown as respondent, paragraph 2 dealt with a matter which was not discussed in the oral argument, but which has since caused me some concern. The paragraph said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The first judgment dealt with the admissibility of evidence whilst the second was concerned with an application for a permanent stay. The first matter has not been regarded as an ‘ 
        interlocutory judgment or order 
        ’ such as to attract the operation of s 5F of the Act whilst the second matter has been so treated. Nevertheless in the present case it may be taken that the two matters are inextricably interrelated in the sense that the application for a permanent stay depended for its success upon the asserted inadmissibility of the evidence. In all the circumstances it seems appropriate for this Court to entertain the appeal. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    13   The history of s 5F and the question of what are and are not judgments and orders for its purposes have been discussed in a number of cases in this court. The history was reviewed in Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 by Sheller JA. Amongst other cases, he referred to Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 in which an application for leave to appeal from the District Court against rulings made in advance of a trial that recordings of conversations between the applicant and another person were prima facie admissible and refusing to stay the proceedings was refused on the ground (see Steffan at 639) that a ruling on evidence made in advance of or in the course of a trial was not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F.  
     
      
    14   On the other hand, in R v EID (1999) 46 NSWLR 116 Adams J, in this court, in reasons with which Abadee and Barr JJ both agreed, expressed the view, material to the decision of the court, that a decision by a magistrate in committal proceedings about the validity of a warrant was an interlocutory judgment within the meaning of s 5F(3).  
     
      
    15   In the present case the appellant is the accused, who has no interest in seeking to overturn the decision by Kinchington DCJ that the warrants in question were invalid. In this court the Crown did not seek to uphold or otherwise argue the validity of the warrants (see par 8 of the Crown’s written submissions).  
     
      
    16   That means that the only matter the accused was in fact appealing about was Kinchington DCJ’s statement that he would not exclude the evidence from being placed before the jury. In reaching this conclusion Kinchington DCJ had taken two steps. He had ruled upon the interpretation of s 13 of the Listening Devices Act 1984 and had then stated his intention to exercise discretion in favour of allowing evidence of the four conversations to be given. Whether or not as trial judge he would be able to carry out that intention would depend upon what happened at the trial. The judge could not bind himself in advance to exercise in a particular way a discretion which would depend upon the evidence in the trial, which might or might not be the same as that put before him in the application decided before the jury was empanelled. Furthermore, as was pointed out in Steffan:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        ... rulings on evidence may always be altered - although the necessary consequence of such an alteration may sometimes be the discharge of the jury. They may be altered because the circumstances in which the ruling was first made have altered, or simply because the judge has had a change of mind. 
        ” (at 639) 
        
       
      
    17   It thus seems to me that the ruling by Kinchington DCJ that he would admit evidence of the four conversations at the trial before the jury was not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F even although in making the ruling he relied upon an interpretation of s 13 of the Listening Devices Act (with which interpretation I agree). The ruling that the warrants were invalid was (probably) an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of the section but was not the subject of appeal. The application to stay the proceedings, the subject of Kinchington DCJ’s second ruling, was made, as Kinchington DCJ makes clear in his reasons, only after he had made his ruling about the admissibility of evidence of the four conversations. In any event, once Kinchington DCJ had reached the position (1), that the warrants were invalid, and (2), that that conclusion did not necessarily exclude evidence of the conversations being given, this application had to be refused.  
     
      
    18   Because the formal questions that I have been dealing with were not raised with the parties at the oral argument of the appeal and since the substance of the matter is agreed by the three of us hearing the appeal, I do not wish to hold up the decision of the proceedings by seeking further submissions on the topic. If my concerns about form are well founded, the result would be that the appeal (or appeals) would be dismissed in any event, even if one aspect of them would be dismissed on a jurisdictional basis. The reasons I have outlined for dismissing the appeal/s on this footing involve, so far as the jurisdictional point is concerned, my view that Kinchington DCJ was in error insofar as he committed himself finally, before the empanelling of the jury, to a ruling on the admissibility of evidence of the four conversations.  
     
      
    19   In my view one of the reasons why this court has no jurisdiction to set aside that ruling is that it was not a judgment or order at all, will not bind Kinchington DCJ at the trial, or any other judge who happens to preside over the trial, and is a ruling the making of which, if it is to be made, must await what happens at the trial. This court, in my view, can no more pronounce finally on the admissibility of the evidence of the four conversations at this point in the proceedings than Kinchington DCJ was able to do when the application was made before him. 
     
      
    20   Since however these formal and procedural aspects were not argued before the court, I would join in dealing with the appeals in the way envisaged in the oral argument, that is, by dismissing the appeal against the refusal of the stay and upholding the appeal against Kinchington DCJ’s ruling that evidence of the four conversations would be admitted. The upholding of this appeal should have the consequence that the ruling will be set aside, and that it will be for the judge at the trial, on the evidence before the court when the Crown seeks to put the disputed matter into evidence, to decide whether that evidence should be admitted. 
     
      
    21   GREG JAMES, J: I have had the benefit of seeing the judgment of Kirby, J. in draft. Subject to these remarks, I agree with his Honour's conclusions and with his reasons therefor. 
     
      
    22   For myself, I add that the submissions on behalf of the appellant that s.13 of the Listening Devices Act 1984 would permit, in the exercise of discretion, evidence of the conversation to be led on count one, but would bar that evidence on count two, appear to have been based upon a view that s.13(3) applies whether evidence of the conversation were to be given by Ms. Hart or any other witness. But the position may be different, depending upon whether the witness giving evidence of the conversation was a participant in it or whether the conversation otherwise came to the knowledge of the witness (s.13). In the latter event, the submission would appear to be correct, but in the former event, I agree that the analysis on which Kirby, J. has embarked of the constructions of the section is necessary. 
     
      
    23   In the event that the evidence is to be led through Ms. Hart, since she was a party to the conversation and the recording was made with her complicity, she may communicate or publish to another person the record of the conversation made by use of the device (s.7(2)(b)). 
     
      
    24   Evidence may be given by her of the conversation by using the record to revive her memory. Section 13 would not apply and hence s.13(3) in particular would not be applicable. But because matters of illegality or impropriety may arise as a result of her complicity in the recording which was in breach of s.5, questions of discretion under s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995 will need to be considered. 
     
      
    25   Although the criteria under s.138 are not precisely the same as those under s.13(3), since they speak to a more general position, nonetheless in the particular circumstances the precise application of them would appear to be very much to the same substantive effect as those under s.13(3). 
     
      
    26   If the evidence was to be tendered through some other person, not a participant, then the requirements of s.13(3) for the exercise of the discretion will have to be considered. 
     
      
    27   As his Honour, Kirby, J., points out, the issues relevant to the exercise of appropriate discretion will call for findings of fact. In either event, I note that both under s.13(2) and (3) of the Listening Devices Act 1984 and under s.138 of the Evidence Act 1995, it will be necessary for the prosecution to satisfy the court of the matters mitigating in favour of the evidence being admitted. 
     
      
    28   I agree that it appears that his Honour, the trial judge, has approached the matter wrongly in that he seems to have considered that it was necessary for the accused to obtain a favourable exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    29   I conclude, therefore, as does Kirby, J., that the appeal should be upheld, the questions answered as his Honour proposes with the addition that if the evidence is to be tendered otherwise than by a principal party, s.13 applies. I consider that the matter should be thereafter returned to the learned trial judge to determine conformably with the decision of this court. 
     
      
    30   KIRBY J: This matter comes before the Court as an appeal under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Certain questions were certified by Kinchington DCJ, which I will set out below. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    31   Wayne James Eade was, in 1995, an officer of the New South Wales Police Service. He became the target of an investigation conducted by the Royal Commission into that Service. On 24 August 1995, warrants were obtained from a judge of the Supreme Court (under Pt4 of the Listening Devices Act, 1984) to install listening devices in premises occupied by Ms Therese Colleen Hart. During August and September 1995, Mr Eade visited those premises. He spoke with Ms Hart. His conversations were captured on audio and video tape. 
     
      
    32   Mr Eade was called as a witness before the Royal Commission. He gave evidence in which he was cross examined concerning his conversations with Ms Hart. He was later charged with two offences: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On 12 September 1995 at Green Point in the State of New South Wales did incite Therese Hart to supply a prohibited drug, namely, 3,4 Methylenedioxyamphetamine (Ecstacy). 
        
       
       
        
        2. On 7 September 1995 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales being a witness at a hearing before the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, knowingly gave false testimony, namely, that he had never engaged in any form of illegal conduct, which was testimony touching a matter material in an inquiry being made by the said Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service.” 
        
       
      
    33   The matter came on for trial before Kinchington DCJ. Before the jury was empanelled, counsel for Mr Eade sought a ruling upon the admissibility of conversations which had been recorded under the warrants. It was said, on behalf of Mr Eade, that the warrants were invalid. They were in the same form as warrants considered by Grove J in Bayeh v William David Taylor, De Santo, The Director of Public Prosecutions & Ors (unreported, 4 February 1998), which were held to be invalid. The Crown accepted that there was no material difference between the warrants relied upon in the prosecution of Mr Eade, and those in Mr Bayeh’s case. His Honour Kinchington DCJ, accordingly, determined that the warrants were invalid. He further determined that the terms of the Listening Devices Act, 1984, s13, did not preclude the use of material so obtained, subject to the Court’s discretion. Kinchington DCJ then decided that the evidence should not be excluded. 
     
      
    34   Counsel for Mr Eade, in these circumstances, filed a Notice of Motion. The Motion sought a permanent stay of the second charge (the false testimony charge). His Honour refused the Motion. However, he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “In these circumstances it seems to me that it is appropriate for me to certify that my two interlocutory Judgments and the legal issues that arise out of them are proper ones for determination on appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to Section 5F(4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and I so certify.” 
        
       
      
    35   The questions certified by his Honour were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Whether the listening device warrants were invalid in accordance with the decision of Grove J in Bayeh v DPP for failing to expressly direct the removal of the listening devices on or before a specific date. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The effect of such invalidity with regards to Section 13 of the Listening Devices Act 1984, as amended. In particular whether Section 13 operates to exclude any evidence obtained by the listening devices being led in the trial against Eade on the charges of misleading the Royal Commission and inciting supply.” 
        
       
       
      Were the Warrants Invalid? 
       
      
    36   Part 4 of the Listening Devices Act, 1984, deals with warrants. It includes the following provisions: 
     
      
       
        
        “S16(1) Upon application by a person that the person suspects or believes - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that a prescribed offence has been, is about to be or is likely to be committed; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that, for the purpose of an investigation into that offence or of enabling evidence to be obtained of the commission of the offence or the identity of the offender, the use of a listening device is necessary, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        an eligible Judge may, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion or belief, authorise, by warrant, the use of the listening device. 
        
       
       
        
        ….. 
        
       
       
        
        S16(3) Where a warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section authorises the installation of a listening device on any premises, the eligible Judge shall, by the warrant - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) authorise and require the retrieval of the listening device; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) authorise entry onto those premises for the purpose of that installation and retrieval. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        S16(4) A warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section shall specify - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is granted; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) where practicable, the name of any person whose private conversation may be recorded or listened to by the use of a listening device pursuant to the warrant; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the period (being a period not exceeding 21 days) during which the warrant is in force; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the name of any person who may use a listening device pursuant to the warrant and the persons who may use the device on behalf of that person; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) where practicable, the premises on which a listening device is to be installed, or the place at which a listening device is to be used, pursuant to the warrant; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) any conditions subject to which premises may be entered, or a listening device may be used, pursuant to the warrant; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the time within which the person authorised to use a listening device pursuant to the warrant is required to report pursuant to section 19 to the eligible Judge and the Attorney General.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    37   Here, the warrants authorised the installation of listening devices in the premises of Ms Hart. They also authorised their retrieval. They fixed a period during which the warrants were in force. However, the warrants did not require the retrieval of the listening devices. 
     
      
    38   As mentioned, in Bayeh v Taylor & Ors (supra), Grove J considered warrants which were in similar form. His Honour drew attention to Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69. That case concerned the Listening Devices Act, 1969 (Vic), s4A(3) and s4A(4). These are the companion provisions to s16(3) and s16(4) of the New South Wales statute. The only difference between the two statutes is that s16(3) of the New South Wales Act, uses the word “shall”, whereas s4A(3) of the Victorian Act, uses the word “must”. That being the context, Gummow J in Ousley v The Queen (supra) said this: (at 127) 
     
      
       
        
        “Subsections (3) and (4) list certain matters that ‘must’ be specified in a warrant granted under the Act. The requirements of s4A(3) only apply if a warrant granted by the Supreme Court authorises the installation of a listening device on any premises. The requirements of s4A(4) apply to every warrant granted by the Supreme Court under s4A. The appellant did not suggest that either of the warrants failed to specify any of the matters that those subsections require on the fact of the warrant. 
        
       
       
        
        The matters listed in subss 4A(3) and (4) constitute a comprehensive list of the matters that must appear on the face of the warrant for it to be a ‘warrant granted under section 4A’ within the terms of s4(3) of the Act.” 
        
       
      
    39   Grove J, emphasising the words “by the warrant” in s16(3), determined that the failure to require the retrieval of the listening devices meant that the warrants were invalid. He said this: (at p18) 
     
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff’s contention in respect to the omission of the statement requiring retrieval of the listening device must be upheld. By the warrant, authority is given to retrieve it. Authorisation inheres no obligation to act and a person authorised may or may not choose so to do. A requirement to retrieve the device removes that choice. By the warrant, there must be no choice, there must be a requirement to retrieve the device. None of the warrants complies with s16(3) and as they relate to premises they are each therefore invalid.” 
        
       
      
    40   That conclusion, with respect, was plainly right. It has direct application to the warrants relied upon by the Crown against Mr Eade. They, likewise, are invalid, as Kinchington DCJ held. The Crown, in its submissions to this Court, did not suggest otherwise. 
     
      
       
      The Scheme of the Listening Devices Act 
       
      
    41   What are the consequences of invalidity of a warrant in terms of the admissibility of evidence obtained under that warrant? The Listening Devices Act, 1984, contains a general prohibition against the use of Listening Devices to record private conversations. Section 5 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “S5(1) A person shall not use, or cause to be used, a listening device - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to record or listen to a private conversation to which the person is not a party; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to record a private conversation to which the person is a party.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    42   The term “party” is defined as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        party 
         in relation to a private conversation, means - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) a person by or to whom words are spoken in the course of the conversation; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a person who, with the consent, express or implied, of any of the persons by or to whom words are spoken in the course of the conversation, records or listens to those words.” 
        
       
      
    43   There is also a definition of the term “principal party” which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        principal party 
         in relation to a private conversation, means a person by or to whom words are spoken in the course of the conversation.” 
        
       
      
    44   The words “private conversation” are defined in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        private conversation 
         means any words spoken by one person to another person or to other persons in circumstances that may reasonably be taken to indicate that any of those persons desires the words to be listened to only - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) by themselves; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) by themselves and by some other person who has the consent, express or implied, of all of those persons to do so.” 
        
       
      
    45   There are a number of exceptions to the prohibition in s5(1), including the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “S5(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the use of a listening device pursuant to a warrant granted under Part 4.” 
        
       
      
    46   None of the other exceptions is relevant. The exception in s5(2)(a), of course, presupposes a valid warrant, whereas there was none in this case. 
     
      
    47   Part 3 of the Act is headed “Admissibility of Evidence”. It includes the following provisions: 
     
      
       
        
        “S12 In this Part, a reference to the giving of evidence of a private conversation that has come to the knowledge of a person as a result of the use of a listening device includes a reference to the production of a record of such a private conversation. 
        
       
       
        
        S13(1) Where a private conversation has come to the knowledge of a person as a result, direct or indirect, of the use of a listening device in contravention of section 5 - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) evidence of the conversation; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) evidence obtained as a direct consequence of the conversation so coming to the knowledge of that person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        may not be given by that person in any civil or criminal proceedings (including proceedings for or in connection with the grant of bail). 
        
       
       
        
        S13(2) Subsection (1) does not render any evidence inadmissible - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if all of the principal parties to the private conversation concerned consent to the evidence being given; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the private conversation concerned comes to the knowledge of the person called to give the evidence otherwise than in the manner referred to in that subsection, notwithstanding that the person also obtained knowledge of the conversation in such a manner; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) in proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) in proceedings for - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for 20 years or more; or 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) a serious narcotics offence, 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          or in proceedings for or in connection with the grant of bail in any such proceedings) if the court considers that the evidence should be admissible. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        S13(3) In determining whether to admit evidence as referred to in subsection (2)(d), the court shall - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) be guided by the public interest, including where relevant the public interest in - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) upholding the law; 
            
           
           
            
            (ii) protecting people from illegal or unfair treatment; and 
            
           
           
            
            (iii) punishing those guilty of offences; and 
            
           
           
          (b) have regard to all relevant matters, including - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the seriousness of the offence in relation to which the evidence sought to be admitted; and 
            
           
           
            
            (ii) the nature of the contravention of section 5 concerned.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    48   A definition is provided of the term “serious narcotic offence”. That definition, relevantly, is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        serious narcotics offence 
         means - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) an offence under Division 2 of Part 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985;” 
        
       
      
    49   Inciting the supply of the drug Ecstacy (as alleged against Mr Eade in the first count) is a “serious narcotic offence” for the purposes of s13(2)(d)(ii) of the Act. 
     
      
       
      The Contentions Made on Behalf of Mr Eade 
       
      
    50   The written submissions made on behalf of Mr Eade made a distinction between the two charges which he faced. 
     
      
    51   In respect of count 1 (inciting the supply of the prohibited drug Ecstacy), counsel for Mr Eade made the following submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a charge of inciting the supply of a prohibited drug is, at least potentially, a serious narcotics offence within the definition contained in s3 of the Listening Devices Act. In those circumstances there is a discretion arising under the provisions of s13 of the Listening Devices Act as to whether the evidence, although unlawfully obtained, might be admitted as a matter of discretion.” 
        
       
      
    52   In respect of count 2 (alleging false testimony before the Royal Commission), the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the recording is unlawful, evidence of that recording cannot be introduced unless one of the exceptions to s13 of the Listening Devices Act, 1984, can be invoked. For the charge of giving false evidence, there is nothing available under s13 to enable the evidence to be admitted.” 
        
       
       
      The Construction of Section 13 of the Listening Devices Act. 
       
      
    53   Section 13 of the Listening Devices Act is an odd provision. The heading is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Inadmissibility of evidence of private conversations when unlawfully obtained.” 
        
       
      
    54   That heading rather suggests an intention on the part of the legislature to render inadmissible (subject to exceptions) all evidence of private conversations unlawfully obtained. The Second Reading Speech of the Attorney General encourages a similar view. The Attorney General (Mr Landa) said this: (Hansard 17 May 1984, p1094) 
     
      
       
        
        “Clause 13 will render evidence inadmissible in civil or criminal proceedings if it was obtained by the unlawful use of a listening device, whether directly or indirectly. The clause, however, will enable any such evidence to be admissible if, among other things, the parties consent or, in the case of certain serious offences, the court in special circumstances so determines.” 
        
       
      
    55   However, the extrinsic material, and the heading, are useful only where there is ambiguity. Here, on the Crown’s submission, there is none. The Crown pointed to the opening words of s13(1) which, for convenience, I repeat: 
     
      
       
        
        “S13(1) Where a private conversation has come to the knowledge of a person as a result, direct or indirect, of the use of a listening device in contravention of section 5 ….” 
        
       
      
    56   That section is not dealing with evidence by a party concerning a conversation in which he or she was a participant. In Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden [2000] NSWCA 167, the Court (Priestley and Powell JJA, and Foster AJA), construing s13(1), said this: (at 11) 
     
      
       
        
         “… the opponent (John Marsden), besides being a principal party to the conversation, had also listened to the recorded conversation after the tape had been made available to him and his representatives during the course of the trial and also had had access to the transcript of the tape. In our opinion, as a matter of construction, the section does not apply in the circumstances. The recorded conversation was a ‘ 
        private conversation’ 
          
        as defined in s3 of the Act and the opponent and Elomari were each a ‘ 
        principal party 
        ’ to it. In our opinion the section does not apply where the ‘ 
        person called to give the evidence 
        ’ is a ‘ 
        principal party 
        ’ to the private conversation. The conversation could not be said to ‘ 
        come to the knowledge 
        ’ of such a party. He had knowledge of the private conversation directly and contemporaneously as a participant in it. The person contemplated by the section is one who acquires knowledge of it other than as a participant in it. It would apply to someone overhearing the conversation or acquiring knowledge of it in some way other than through the use of a listening device.” (parenthesis added)

      The Transcript and Tape 
       
      
    58   The issue of admissibility having been raised before the trial, it was not entirely clear how the Crown intended to introduce the audio and video material. It would, presumably, seek its tender through Ms Hart, or a police officer responsible for the Listening Device. Is there any inhibition upon the reception of such evidence? The warrant being invalid, the tape has been illegally obtained (s5(1)(b)). Since, however, it was made with the complicity of Ms Hart, it may be used in the course of legal proceedings (s7(2)(b)). The Act does not prohibit its use. Its admissibility must be determined according to s138 of the Evidence Act, 1995. That section is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “S138(1) Evidence that was obtained: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.” 
        
       
      
    59   In determining that issue, the Court is obliged to consider, amongst other things, the matters identified by s138(3). That section is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “S138(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    60   These issues will, no doubt, call for findings of fact, made on the balance of probabilities (s142 Evidence Act). It is for the Crown to satisfy the Court, in the light of those facts, that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability (cf ALRC 26, Vol 1, para 959). 
     
      
    61   His Honour, whilst not specifically adverting to s138, plainly recognised the need to balance competing interests. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that in criminal proceedings there is a public interest in ensuring that reliable evidence of an accused person’s guilt should be admitted into evidence at his trial for the consideration of the tribunal of fact. Conversely that public interest also requires a trial Judge to look at the circumstances in which the questioned evidence may have been obtained because there is certainly a public interest in minimising the extent to which law enforcement agencies will be allowed to act outside the scope of their lawful authority. Indeed it seems to me that the principles enunciated by the High Court in  
        Bunning v Cross 
          
        and  
        Ridgeway v The Queen 
         as well as the Evidence Act itself should always be borne in mind when a trial Judge comes to decide on how he/she should exercise his/her discretion in relation to what evidence should or should not be allowed to be placed before the jury in a criminal trial in the exercise of his/her discretion.” 
        
       
      
    62   He determined that the evidence should not be excluded. His judgment on admissibility included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “While the taping of the subject conversations was unlawful in the sense that those tapings were not authorised in accordance with the Act to which I have previously referred this in my opinion is not a case where there was a calculated disregard for the law or any intentional or reckless illegality involved on the part of any law enforcement officer nor could it be said there will be any fundamental unfairness to the Accused if the evidence is allowed to be placed before the jury. On the contrary the conversations in question were recorded in good faith and would clearly entitle a jury to conclude that the Accused was involved in serious criminal activity.” 
        
       
      
    63   His Honour’s remarks, however, may suggest that he regarded the onus as being upon the accused to satisfy him, on balance, that the material should be excluded (cf s135 Evidence Act). He concluded his judgment with these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “In these circumstances I am satisfied that I should not exercise my discretion in favour of the Accused and exclude the evidence from being placed before the jury. To my mind it is proper for the circumstances surrounding all four conversations to be led into evidence.” 
        
       
      
    64   The issues arising under s138 must be redetermined. The Court should address (by reference, inter alia, to the matters identified in s138(3)) the precise issue raised by s138(1), namely, whether the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability (the onus being upon the Crown). 
     
      
    65   In view of the conclusion I have reached, I need not deal with the alternative argument of the Crown, which was directed towards count 1 (inciting the supply of the prohibited drug, Ecstacy). It was argued that, even if s13(1) applied, count 1 relates to a “serious narcotic offence”. Evidence obtained under the invalid warrant would be admissible (s13(2)(d)(ii)), subject to the Court exercising the discretion provided by s13(3) of the Listening Devices Act, 1984. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    66   Returning to the questions posed by Kinchington DCJ, I would suggest that they should be answered as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Yes, the warrants were invalid. 
       
       
      2. Section 13 of the Listening Devices Act, 1984, does not exclude evidence by a principal party to the conversation which was illegally recorded. The admission of the recording must be determined under s138 of the Evidence Act, 1995, the onus being upon the Crown. 
       
       
      Order 
       
      
    67   I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Priestley JA in draft. I agree with his Honour’s reasons. Leaving aside the jurisdictional issue, and approaching the matter in the way in which it was argued, I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. That the appeal against the refusal of stay be dismissed. 
       
       
      2. That the appeal in respect of the decision to admit evidence of the four conversations be upheld, and his Honour’s ruling set aside. 
       
       
      3. That the matter be returned to the District Court to be determined according to law. 
       
       
      Since it is apparent that Kinchington DCJ certified that his judgment or order (in respect of which he stated two questions) was a proper one for determination on appeal, it is unnecessary for leave to be granted (s5F(3)).

      Sudhakar RAO v CANTERBURY CITY COUNCIL 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    MASON P: An informant acting on behalf of the Canterbury City Council filed two summonses in the Land & Environment Court claiming orders that the appellant appear before a Judge of that Court to answer an offence (sic) alleged pursuant to s125 of the Environmental Planning & Assessment Act 1979 (the Act). Orders were made accordingly. 
    2    The charges were in the following form: 
     
      
       
       1. … on or about 12 September 1996 the defendant did cause development consent No 7615/94 for alterations and additions to a funeral parlour at 447 Burwood Road, Belmore of which the defendant is the owner to be implemented contrary to Conditions 6 & 8 of the said consent which respectively provide that: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “6. A detailed landscape plan be prepared by a qualified landscape architect or an approved consultant for submission to and approval of Council prior to the release of approved building plans. The Plans should provide for the retention of the row of pine trees towards the rear of the site, behind the proposed parking spaced 5, 6, 7 & 8 and the tree located on car spaces 3 & 4 shown on the Plans. 
          
          
          8. Landscaping of the site be carried out in accordance with the approved landscape plan, such landscaping to be maintained at all times to Council’s satisfaction.” 
          
          
         in that a detailed landscaping plan providing for the retention of the row of pine trees towards the rear of the site was approved by Council on the 20th day of June 1995 but the landscaping of the site was not carried out in accordance with the approved landscape plan in so far as the row of pine trees towards the rear of the site were removed from the site on or about 12 September 1996. 
         
        
        
       2. … on or about 18 September 1996 the defendant did cause development consent No 7615/94 for alterations and additions to a funeral parlour at 447 Burwood Road, Belmore of which the defendant is the owner to be implemented contrary to Condition 7 of the said consent which provides that: 
        
        
         
         “7. The car park layout is to be amended to ensure the retention of the Fiddlewood (Citharexylum Spinosum) by incorporating a 1.5m landscape strip along Leylands Parade frontage. The tree shall have a suitable barrier erected prior to and maintained during building operations”.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         in that building operations had been commenced prior to 18 September 1996, and on 18 September 1996 the Fiddlewood Tree did not have a suitable barrier erected during the building operations and thereby suffered damage. 
         
        
       
      
    3    After a trial before Justice Pearlman, Chief Judge of the Land & Environment Court, the appellant was convicted of each offence. He was fined $3,000 on the first charge and $1,500 on the second. Costs were awarded against him. 
    4    This appeal is brought pursuant to s5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
     Facts 
      
    5    The appellant owned a funeral parlour at 447 Burwood Road, Belmore. The zoning is general business 3(a1) under the Canterbury Planning Scheme Ordinance. 
    6    On 15 March 1995 the appellant was given notice of conditional development approval for alterations and additions to the funeral parlour. Conditions 6 to 8 were as set out in the charges. 
    7    The development was a controversial one with adjoining residents. This explains the care taken with respect to preservation and protection of existing trees around the rear boundary of the site. Retention of screening trees had been negotiated between the appellant and Council officers with the appellant taking an active role in discussions about the trees in 1995 and 1996. 
    8    A detailed landscape plan was prepared, as contemplated by conditions 6 and 8 and it was approved by Council 20 June 1995. Building Approval was issued on 8 May 1995. 
    9    Building work commenced in about April 1996. The builder was Vincent Caporale who had done previous building work for the appellant. The appellant in turn was his general practitioner. 
    10    Following a complaint, the informant, a health and building surveyor employed by the Council, inspected the site on 12 September 1996. He observed that the row of conifer pines along the rear that are referred to in condition 6 and depicted in the landscape plan had been cut down to 500mm stumps. 
    11    Her Honour recorded that the factual issue on the first charge was whether it was proved that the appellant authorised the cutting down of the trees. She found that he had done so. 
    12    At his inspection on 12 September 1996 the informant also observed that there was no protective barrier around the fiddlewood tree mentioned in condition 7. That tree was located at a corner of a driveway which gave access to eight car parking spaces at the rear of the site. The landscape and building plans show the fiddlewood as “existing fiddlewood to remain”. The plans also showed the fiddlewood as incorporated into a 1.5 metre wide garden bed with a six metre driveway one metre away from its trunk. 
    13    The Council’s landscape architect, Ms Tisdell, gave the following evidence about her inspection: 
     
      
       
       On 18 September I inspected the subject premises and observed that no barrier or protection was erected around the Fiddlewood tree during the building works. Contrary to the approved landscaping plan, the fencing alignment and the nature of the proposed fence had now changed. Instead of running along the Leylands Parade boundary, the fence was now indented around the tree, and was no longer a paling fence but a brick wall which required footings. The damage to the Fiddlewood tree consists of root severance caused by the footings. The roots had been severed at less than 1m from the trunk on three sides of the tree. The fourth side of the trees roots are under paving. Consequently the tree is unable to obtain water or nutrients as it no longer has a large enough root area. Had the builder followed the approved plan, a few roots may have been severed but the overall change would have been less. 
       
      
      
       
      
    14    Pearlman J correctly held that condition 7 was drafted with concern to protect the Fiddlewood tree during building operations. Ms Tisdell’s evidence was clear proof of breach of that condition, assuming the appellant’s responsibility for the breach. 
    15    With this background I turn to the grounds of appeal that were pressed. 
     
      
     Ground 1 (Summonses disclosed no offence known to law) 
      
    16    As indicated, the appellant was charged with contravening s125 of the Act in that he caused the identified development consent to be implemented contrary to the specified conditions. Each summons gave details of the manner in which it was asserted that the specified condition(s) had been breached. 
    17    As regards the first charge, the appellant accepts that conditions 6 and 8, when read with the detailed landscaping plan, impliedly prohibit the removal of the row of conifers at the rear. 
    18    The appellant submits that the first charge is bad on its face because it failed to identify the essential factual ingredients of the offence (cf Ex parte Lovell; re Buckley (1938) 38 SR(NSW) 153 at 173-174,  John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 519-520). He submitted that the essential element not pleaded in each summons is the carrying out of development contrary to the specified conditions of the development consent. Hornsby Shire Council v Winsloe (1998) 101 LGERA 117 at 129 is cited. 
    19    Section 76(2) of the Act, as it then stood, provides relevantly that: 
     
      
       
       Subject to this Act, where an environmental planning instrument provides that development specified therein may not be carried out except with consent under this Act being obtained therefor, a person shall not carry out that development on land to which that provision applies unless: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) that consent has been obtained and is in force under this Act; and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) the development is carried out in accordance with the provisions of any conditions subject to which that consent was granted and of that instrument. 
       
      
      
    20    At trial a slightly different point was taken to the one now advanced. It was accepted that there was a development consent and that it was in force under the Act. (A similar concession is made on appeal.) The submission at trial was that the development which was the subject of that consent was still to be carried out. Accordingly, where the summons charged that the consent had been implemented contrary to the specified conditions then it was raising an offence not known to the law because, the consent not having been completed, it could not be said to be implemented contrary to the conditions of the consent. The submission was rejected. Her Honour pointed out that s76(2) speaks of development that “is carried out”. Although the work consented to had not been completely finalised, it was in train and the charge alleged departure from conditions regulating the development work itself. 
    21    The submission is repeated on appeal. In my view her Honour was perfectly correct. Some conditions are capable of breach in the course of implementation of the consent. Stipulations that specific trees are to be retained or protected by “a suitable barrier erected prior to and maintained during building operations” are clearly such as of their nature are capable of infraction during development work. Likewise with a prohibition against cutting down existing trees. 
    22    On appeal, the charges were also said to be defective because they did not state in effect that the development was being carried out in a manner said to contravene the relevant conditions. I do not agree. Each summons is pleaded inelegantly with its reference to causing the development consent to be implemented contrary to the specified conditions in the nominated manner. But the sense of each charge is perfectly clear, namely that conditions of a (necessary) development consent were infringed in the manner stated at the conclusion of each of the charges. 
    23    Another variant of the challenge was the submission that the charges made no reference to s76(2) which gave statutory force to the consent conditions contravention of which is an offence by s125(1). Section 76(2) contains a prohibition, but it is section 125(1) that imposes an offence referable to such a prohibition (see Cooper v Coffs Harbour City Council (1997) 97 LGERA 125 at 130).  
    24    The summons adverts to the offence-creating provision (s125) and the particular instrument taking effect under the Act (the development consent). In my view the omission to mention the provision giving mandatory effect to the condition (s76(2)) is no more fatal than the omission to mention a section of the Crimes Act making a particular offence a crime. Section 76(2) is not an “essential factual ingredient” of the s125 offence, at least in a case such as the present where the charges identify particular conditions of a particular development consent and specify acts said to represent non-compliance with those conditions. 
    25    Winsloe’s Case involved a charge which alleged:  
     
      
       
       an offence against  
       [the Act]  
       in that on or about 1 October 1997 at Dural in the State of New South Wales, you did without authority, prune, lop and  
       [sic] 
        protected by Council’s Tree Preservation Order created pursuant to the Hornsby Shire Council Environmental Plan 1994. 
       
      
      
       
      
     Bignold J held that the charge failed to state an essential  
     legal 
      ingredient of the offence because it did not allege that the relevant prohibition was  
     “by or under this Act” 
     . 
      
    26    In my view Winsloe is clearly distinguishable. The first point that should be made is that the legal requirement is for the information to state “the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence” (John L at 519, emphasis added). The “essential factual ingredients” are to be distinguished from particulars necessary for the defendant properly to defend the charge and also from citation of the legal source of the offence charged. On these distinctions see Cooper at 131-2. 
    27    Secondly, the defects of the charge in Winsloe were of a different order to those contended for in the present case. The relevant prohibition did not lie in s76(2) of the Act, but in a particular tree preservation order whose statutory underpinning was not stated expressly or impliedly in the charge (in contrast to the present charges as analysed above). 
    28    Cooper v Coffs Harbour Council, a decision of this Court, is more directly relevant to the present case. The charge was: 
     
      
       
       … that the defendant in breach of s125(1) of  
       [the Act]  
       removed trees … contrary to conditions 14 and 15 of the Notice to Applicant of Determination of a Development Application dated 4 March 1994 in that no consent was obtained from Coffs Harbour City Council for the removal of those trees. 
       
      
      
    29    Howie AJ (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J agreed) held that the charge was a valid one. Like the present case, the charge contained no reference to s76(2) in terms. On the other hand, it did advert in terms to the absence of council consent for the removal of the trees. Howie AJ referred to s43 of the Land & Environment Court Act which was available to overcome any defect in the form of the charge contained in the application and order which were before the Land & Environment Court and before the Court of Criminal Appeal. He also relied (at 132-3) upon the powers available to this Court in an appeal by way of rehearing. 
    30    In my view the summons and order in each matter were adequate in their specificity to put the appellant on notice of the charges he was facing. The development consent was identified. Its validity was never in issue, for obvious reasons. In these circumstances, absence of reference to the linkage between the allegedly infringed conditions and the environmental planning instrument giving them statutory force did not render the charges bad in law. 
    31    An alternative attack was based on the absence of an express averment as to the manner or manners in which the appellant caused the development consent to be implemented contrary to the specified conditions. The appellant’s complaint did not relate to the factual matters averred at the end of each charge. Rather, it was submitted that it was incumbent on the prosecutor to aver the particular basis of accessorial liability if the case at trial was to be presented on the basis of the appellant having counselled or procured Mr Caporale to cut down the conifers and/or remove the protective barrier from around the Fiddlewood. There is no substance in this point in light of s55 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (see Burrell v Jacenko (1998) 99 LGERA 173). A simple indictment for murder can be the basis for a Crown case that proceeds by alternative routes, including the route of accessorial liability. The affidavits served prior to the hearing made it plain that this would be at least one of the ways in which guilt would be sought to be proved. There was no lack of procedural fairness and, absent that, no basis for challenging the form of the charges on this account. 
    32    I would not wish this to be read as an endorsement of the form of charge adopted in the present case. The informant who avoids reference to the essential ingredients of s76(2) in a case such as the present is flirting with great danger. Fortunately for the pleader in the present case, there was sufficient in the two charges to convey the essential nub of the contraventions charged. 
     
      
     Ground 5: (Evidence incapable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that appellant authorised the cutting down of the pine trees) 
      
      
     Ground 6: (Evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that appellant authorised the cutting down of the pine trees) 
      
      
     Ground 8: (Offences not established beyond reasonable doubt) 
      
    33    This appeal is by way of rehearing on the evidence given below. It was accepted that this Court’s function is as stated in Histollo Pty Ltd v Director-General of National Parks and Wildlife Service (1998) 45 NSWLR 661 at 678. It was also accepted that credibility-based findings of the trial judge are to be examined in light of the well-known principles in cases such as Abalos v Australian Postal Commission (1990) 171 CLR 167. 
    34    As indicated above, the critical issue on the first charge was whether the appellant authorised the cutting of the trees. 
    35    It was clearly established that the builder, Mr Caporale cut down the protected conifers, along with two trees in the middle of the back row which were permitted to be removed. 
    36    Mr Caporale had himself been charged with breaches of the development consent. He shared a common solicitor with the appellant until shortly before the time that he elected to plead guilty in about June 1997. The affidavit used by him in his own sentencing proceedings, being an affidavit dated 9 July 1997, was referred to at the appellant’s trial in February 1998. 
    37    Mr Caporale said that his plumber had told him that three trees at the northern end at the rear of the site were in the way of the laying of pipes. (It is not suggested that this in itself provided any point of relief from the appellant’s obligation to comply with the conditions of the development consent while they were extant.) Faced with the drainage problem, Mr Caporale met the appellant on site, told him about the problem, asked what he should do and was told: “Do whatever you have to do but it would look odd to have only three trees remaining. Get rid of the lot.” The appellant also told him that he had never wanted the trees there. Because of the car park and paving area, “they should never have been there from the beginning”. (Evidence from the Council and its officers also attested to the appellant’s opposition to retention of the conifers in the months leading up to the relevant development consent.) 
    38    Mr Caporale had not seen the development consent at this stage. He told his workers: “Well, you heard the doctor just do what you’ve got to do”. In consequence, all of the conifers were cut down, not just those impeding the laying of the drain. 
    39    This evidence established the appellant’s direct complicity in the acts which constituted the charged breaches of condition 8 and the departure from the approved building plans referred to in conditions 6 and 8. If true, there could not be a clearer case of counselling and procuring breach of the conditions requiring retention of the conifers by the landowner who had received formal notice of the development consent and who never suggested that he was ignorant of its relevant obligations. 
    40    Pearlman J accepted the evidence of Mr Caporale in her extempore judgment given shortly after hearing submissions. Those submissions had included the most explicit attack on his credibility from senior counsel who represented the appellant at trial (see AB 111G, 119-121). 
    41    In my view it was well open to her Honour to prefer the evidence of Mr Caporale to that of the appellant and to find the essential step in the first charge proved against the appellant. 
    42    Her Honour records the appellant’s denial of the critical conversation and the appellant’s evidence that the first he knew about the tree cutting was when contacted by the Council Health and Building surveyor. Pearlman J gives reasons at page 6 of her judgment as to why she preferred Mr Caporale’s evidence, according to the criminal standard. She mentions the appellant’s well-established early opposition to keeping the trees, the unlikelihood of Mr Caporale going on a frolic of his own having regard to the relationship between the two men, and the appellant’s close involvement in all matters of detail concerning the development. I find these reasons compelling. 
    43    The appellant invites this Court to review all of the evidence and to conclude that the essential fact of the appellant’s express authorisation was not established beyond reasonable doubt. Such review has been conducted, but it does not persuade me of appealable error. 
    44    The appellant refers in particular to evidence of Carolyn Steele, a witness called in the appellant’s case, who said that Mr Caporale had said that he would change his evidence against the appellant if the appellant paid his fines and costs. Mr Caporale denied the suggestion that he had approached Mrs Steele in the terms to which she deposed. He said that all he had asked Mrs Steele was whether there was a way that he could be helped because Dr Rao had said at the outset that whatever happened he would pay the costs. It was put to Mr Caporale that the conversation occurred in November 1997, ie well after the appellant’s solicitor had withdrawn his services because of the conflict in instructions and well after Mr Caporale had pleaded guilty. Mr Caporale replied: 
     
      
       
       I can’t change my evidence. It’s my affidavit so why would I say something stupid like that when I know that it’s all written down here. I asked her if she could help me out and she said no. 
       
      
      
    45    This response was one which her Honour was entitled to accept in preference to the evidence of Mrs Steele, who was a close business associate of the appellant, a director of the company that operated the funeral business and who was herself challenged in cross-examination as to the sinister version of the conversation with Mr Caporale. After all, Mr Caporale had sworn his affidavit on 9 July 1997. 
    46    It is unfortunate that her Honour did not deal expressly with this conflict of evidence, albeit that it went only to Mr Caporale’s credibility. However, it is impossible to think that she did not weigh the issue in her assessment of Mr Caporale’s evidence. Her judgment was given extempore after an adjournment “for 20 minutes to get my thoughts together”. 
    47    On the ultimately critical issue of the acceptance or otherwise of Mr Caporale’s evidence, I am not satisfied that her Honour failed to use or palpable misused the advantage which she had of seeing and hearing the witnesses.48    In a supplementary written submission dated 25 January 2000, the appellant pointed to details of the evidence of Mr Caporale about the row of conifers which were said to disclose fundamental problems with his evidence. The passages are set out verbatim in the submissions. I do not see this evidence as bearing the conclusion suggested. It certainly provides no basis for overturning her Honour in her assessment of Mr Caporale on the single critical issue. 
    49    In the appeal, the appellant sought to tender further evidence, being a letter from Mr Caporale to the appellant dated 23 June 1997 which stated: 
     
      
       
       Dear Dr Rao,  
       
      
      
       
       re: conifer trees at Belmore 
       
      
      
       
       Tony and I would be happy to replace the conifer trees which were removed at Belmore, with advanced-growth pines. Please let us know if you would like us to do this. 
       
      
      
    50    Evidence was tendered to the effect that the appellant’s solicitor was provided with a copy of the letter prior to the time when counsel was briefed to appear in the Court below. The letter was not introduced into evidence nor was the appellant asked any questions regarding it. It is suggested that senior counsel at trial did not receive a copy of the letter. 
    51    Accepting this, I am unpersuaded that it is in the interests of justice to admit this further evidence in the appeal. Given the joint mess in which the appellant and his builder found themselves in June 1997, the offer in the letter seems a perfectly reasonable one to have been made. For one thing, replacement of the trees would have been relevant as to penalty. The letter does no more than recognise that which was common ground, namely that the trees were removed. It casts no light upon the appellant’s involvement or otherwise in the builder’s actions. 
    52    I turn to the second charge. As indicated, the building work was well under way when it was discovered by Ms Tisdell on 18 September 1996 that no barrier was in place around the Fiddlewood tree. Mr Caporale said in his evidence that there was once a mesh and iron stake barrier but that he had removed it in order to build a brick fence for which the appellant had building approval. Although it was not of the essence of the charge, the removal of the mesh had most unfortunate consequences for the Fiddlewood, as observed by Ms Tisdell. 
    53    The prosecution case in relation to the second charge did not suggest that the appellant had given express instructions to his builder for the withholding of or removal of a protective barrier around the Fiddlewood tree. Rather the matter was prosecuted on the basis that the offence was one of strict liability (see eg Power v Penthill House Pty Ltd (1993) 80 LGERA 247). Her Honour found that it was and this legal conclusion is no longer in dispute in the appeal. 
    54    Against this background I return to the judgment to see the factual basis upon which the appellant was convicted on the second charge. Her Honour held that there was no evidence that the appellant authorised the builder to ignore the condition about the barrier. She found that the offence was one of strict liability. She then asked whether any culpability of Dr Rao was excused by an honest and reasonable belief in a set of facts which if true would exculpate him. She continued: 
     
      
       
       What are those facts? First that there was a barrier in existence. I do not think it reasonable for Dr Rao to hold the view that there was a barrier in existence of the sort that I have referred to for the protection of the tree. He could not hold that view by visual inspection because visual inspection would, on the evidence of Ms Tisdell, have shown him that there was no such barrier. 
       
      
      
       
       Was it an honest and reasonable belief on Dr Rao’s part to think that because there was a gate and a paling fence and approved hoarding that there was a suitable barrier erected prior to and maintained during building operations in relation to the fiddlewood tree? That there were such structures is clear but whether they were erected in relation to the tree is certainly not clear. I do not think it is reasonable to think that those structures were erected in relation to the tree or that they formed a suitable barrier in relation to it. Therefore I find that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake has not been made out and there is no foundation for it. 
       
      
      
       
       My conclusion therefore is that the prosecution has made out its case in relation to the fiddlewood tree I find that there was no suitable barrier erected prior to and maintained during building operations as required by condition 7 of the consent and that accordingly, the defendant is guilty of an offence under s125 of the EP&A Act. 
       
      
      
    55    I find no error here. 
    56    In challenging the conviction on the second charge, the appellant refers to Ms Tisdell’s acceptance in cross-examination that she had never specified the type of “suitable barrier” required by condition 8. That may be so, but the obligation stemming from the condition lay directly upon the developer. 
     
      
     Ground 11 (Error of law in failure to include an accomplice warning re Caporale in reasons for judgment) 
      
      
     Ground 12 (Error of law in failure to take into account in reasons for judgment the good character of the appellant) 
      
      
     Ground 13 (Error of law in failure to refer in reasons for judgment to respondent’s failure to call a particular witness, Tony Carlino) 
      
    57    As formulated in the appellant’s written submissions, each of these grounds proceeds from the springboard of Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250. Unfortunately, this reveals that the submissions have got off on the wrong foot.  
    58    Fleming involved a trial on indictment conducted by judge alone that was governed by ss32-33 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The provisions (now found at ss16-17) state: 
     
      
       
       32 Trial by Judge in criminal proceedings 
        
       (1) An accused person in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District court must be tried by the Judge alone if; 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the person so elects in accordance with this section, and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) the Judge is satisfied that the person, before making the election, sought and received advice in relation to the election from a barrister or solicitor. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (2) An election may not be made unless: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) all other accused persons in the trial also elect to be tried by the Judge alone, and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        (b) each election is made in respect of all offences with which the accused persons in the trial are charged. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) An election may be made only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
       
      
      
       
       (4) An election must be made before the date fixed for the person’s trial in the Supreme Court or District Court. 
       
      
      
       
       (5) An accused person who elects to be tried by the Judge alone may, at any time before the date fixed for the person’s trial, subsequently elect to be tried by a jury. 
       
      
      
       
       (6) Rules of court may be made with respect to elections under this section. 
       
      
      
       
       33. Verdict of single Judge 
        
       (1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.  
       
      
      
       
      
    59    In Fleming the High Court drew attention (at 262) to the distinction between the “finding [of ultimate guilt or otherwise] that could have been made by a jury” referred to in s33(1) and “the findings of fact on which the Judge relied” which s33(2) required to be included in the judgment.  
    60    Of direct relevance to the issues in the present appeal, the Court said (at 263-4, emphasis added): 
     
      
       
       [30] Seventhly, if the judgment fails to show that the judge applied a relevant principle of law, two possibilities are presented. One possibility is that, notwithstanding such failure, the principle was applied. Upon that hypothesis, there has been a breach of s 33(2) by reason of the omission from the judgment. The other possibility is that the principle was not applied, with the result that, independently of the question of breach of s 33(2), there has been an error of law which may attract at least the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The obligation imposed by s 33(2) was to ensure that the judgment included all principles of law which the judge applied. Unless the judgment shows expressly or by implication that the principle was applied, it should be taken that the principle was not applied, rather than applied but not recorded. 
        
        
       [31] Finally, there may be a breach of s 33(3) with respect to the requirement to take a warning into account. The present appeal is put as such a case. Section 33(3) is framed in a fashion which differs from that of s 33(2) and which emphasises the particular importance attached by the legislature to the requirements of the law with respect to warnings. Section 33(2) requires the inclusion of principles of law applied and of factual findings relied upon, whilst s 33(3) obliges the judge to take the particular warning into account. 
        
        
       [32] The obligation imposed by s 33(3) “to take the warning into account” is not only to be discharged but also to be seen to be discharged. The means by which the obligation may be discharged is that indicated in s 33(2), namely the inclusion in the reasons for judgment of the particular requirement for a warning among the principles of law applied by the judge. The various requirements that warnings be given have been expressed as rules of law or practice. The failure to give such a warning does not always lead to the setting aside of a conviction. But that does not mean that it is not a principle of law within the terms of s 33(2). The judge is obliged by s 33(3) to take the warning into account and in doing so the judge applies a principle of law. 
        
        
       [33] The result is to require the recording and heeding of a warning, if one is called for in the particular case, and the giving of effect to it in a real sense by stating reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or as a consequence of it, a particular verdict is reached. A mere recording or statement of it, without more, would amount to an empty incantation. If these criteria are not satisfied in a particular case, then the judge is to be taken as not discharging the obligation imposed by s 33(3) that the warning be taken into account. 
        
        
       
      
    61    The present matter was not a trial on indictment. Accordingly, there was no requirement (stemming from s33(2) and (3)) for a warning appropriate for a jury to be seen to have been given in the judge’s reasons. 
    62    There is a further difficulty with ground 11, because it contends that the judge’s obligation to be seen to have given herself a warning stemmed from s165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act 1995. The obligation to give a jury an appropriate warning is conditioned upon it having been requested by a party (see 165(2)). Here there was no such request. 
    63    In jury trials there will be cases where absence of an appropriate warning will mean that there was a miscarriage, even if no such warning was sought. I do not understand the appellant to submit that this is such a case. In any event, it is manifest that her Honour carefully scrutinised the evidence of Mr Caporale and took direct account of the circumstances in which it came to be available to the prosecution. 
    64    For similar reasons, Fleming cannot be used to challenge the judgment because it contains no express advertence to the appellant’s good character. There is not even a rule of law that such a direction must be given to a jury (Melbourne v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 1). 
    65    According to Mr Caporale’s affidavit (par 12), Mr Carlino had been present during the crucial meeting between Caporale and the appellant when the appellant told Caporale to “get rid” of the row of pine trees. At trial, the appellant’s counsel invited her Honour to “draw the usual inference … that the evidence of Carlino would not assist” the prosecution. Failure to advert to the submission in the ex tempore reasons given shortly afterwards does not establish miscarriage. Fleming’s Case does not require otherwise, for reasons already given. 
     
      
     Ground 14 (Specific error re findings inconsistent with innocence which were not put to appellant during his evidence) 
      
    66    Under cross-examination the appellant gave evidence that for some time after being charged with the offences he and Caporale shared the same solicitor and on a number of occasions travelled to court together in the same taxi. In relation to this the learned trial judge made the following remarks: 
     
      
       
       Dr Rao gave evidence that he came to the Court in a taxi with Mr Caporale on at least one occasion in order to save money, and that initially they engaged the same solicitor. If Dr Rao was so concerned and shocked by the breach of a condition of consent by Mr Caporale, I find it hard to believe that he would be so accommodating of Mr Caporale. 
       
      
      
     The appellant submits that the implicit conclusion is that the appellant’s testimony about sharing the taxis and solicitor was inconsistent with his evidence that he was innocent of the offences with which he has been charged. Since this was not put to the appellant during cross-examination it is submitted that the learned trial judge should not have made such a finding about the evidence and erred in doing so. 
      
    67    I see no error in the way her Honour dealt with this fairly tangential aspect of the case. The rule in Brown v Dunn does not require every conceivable point and counterpoint to be raised in cross-examination, nor does it translate into a direct basis for challenging the reasoning process in a judgment. 
     
      
     Grounds 9 and 10 (Rejection of s556A order and size of penalties) 
      
    68    In my view, there is no merit in these grounds. If anything, the penalties were on the light side given that these were deliberate contraventions of conditions which the appellant had earlier struggled to resist, of which he was well aware and whose purpose was obvious. This is an area where deterrence was clearly relevant. 
    69    The appeal should be dismissed. 
    70    DOWD J: I agree with the proposed orders and the reasons of Mason P. 
    71    AUSTIN J: Subject to the following observations, I agree with the reasoning and conclusions of Mason P. I wish only to address what seems to me to be the principal ground of appeal. This is the contention that the charges in the summonses failed to identify the essential factual ingredients of the offences.  
    72    Each summons alleged an offence pursuant to s 125 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW). Section 125(1) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
       ‘(1) Where any matter or thing is by or under this Act, other than by or under the regulations, directed or forbidden to be done, or where the Minister, the Director, a council or any other person is authorised by or under this Act, other than by or under the regulations, to direct any matter or thing to be done, or to forbid any matter or thing to be done, and that matter or thing if so directed to be done remains undone, or if so forbidden to be done is done, a person offending against that direction or prohibition shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.’ 
       
      
      
    73    The application of s 125(1) is enlivened (relevantly) by a direction by a council authorised by or under the Act, directing something to be done or forbidding something from being done.  
    74    Each summons identifies a development consent in specific terms relating to premises of which the defendant is the owner, and asserts failure to comply with conditions of the development consent which the summons sets out. In my opinion the conditions amount to directions by the council that something be done, and the conditions in the first summons imply that the council has forbidden something to be done, namely the cutting down of the pine trees. Therefore in this case there are directions and prohibitions by an authorised council that enliven the application of s 125(1).  
    75    Obviously the directions and prohibitions in a case such as the present one are not absolute and unqualified. Since the applicant for development consent is not obliged to undertake the development once consent is granted, there is no absolute obligation to comply with the conditions of the consent. But in my view, once the development commences, the obligation to comply with the conditions becomes unqualified. That being so, the conditions are properly described as directions and prohibitions for the purposes of s 125(1). 
    76    Section 125(1) says that a person offending against such a direction or prohibition is guilty of an offence. In my view, a person ‘offends against’ such a direction or prohibition if · the direction or prohibition applies to that person, and· the person does something, or fails to do something, contrary to the terms of the direction or prohibition (that is, there is relevant contravening conduct). 
    77    As to the first of these requirements, the conditions do not expressly designate the owner as a person under an obligation to comply with them, but in this case the application for development consent was an application by the defendant as owner of the property which was the subject of the application, and therefore conditions that give directions or make prohibitions are, by implication, addressed to him (but not necessarily only to him). 
    78    This conclusion is reinforced by s 76(2) of the Act, which has the effect in the present circumstances of prohibiting any person from carrying out a development for which consent is required unless the development is carried out in accordance with the provisions of any conditions subject to which consent has been granted. To the extent that the defendant engaged in carrying out the development and the development was not carried out in accordance with the conditions, there was a contravention of s 76(2).  
    79    In her reasons for judgment Pearlman J referred to a decision by Talbot J in Power v Coopers Construction Pty Ltd (6 October 1995, unreported), to the effect that ‘a condition of a development consent granted under the EP&A Act is not encompassed directly within s 125 simply by reference to it, because s 122(b)(3) refers only to Div 3 of the EP&A and not Div 4 in which s 125 found’. It is true that s 122(b)(iii) states that a reference in Div 3 to this Act includes a reference to conditions subject to which a consent is granted. It does not follow, however, that the absence of a similar definition for the purposes of Div 4 is an obstacle to the view that a condition of a development consent can be a direction or prohibition for the purposes of s 125(1). It is unnecessary, under s 125(1), to rely on any expansive definition of the words ‘this Act’, since s 125(1) applies (inter alia) to any matter or thing directed to be done or forbidden to be done by or under ‘this Act’ or by a council authorised by or under the Act. A development consent containing conditions of the kind present in this case is a direction or prohibition by an authorised council rather than under the Act itself.  
    80    Nothing in Cooper v Coffs Harbour City Council (1997) 97 LGERA 125 is inconsistent with this view. In that case the proceedings were brought on the basis of an alleged infringement of s 76(2) (at 130 per Howie AJ). The issue was not whether proceedings brought under s 125(1) were defective because of the failure to plead the matters referred to in s 76(2).  
    81    Therefore in my opinion, assuming there is relevant contravening conduct, it is unnecessary to invoke s 76(2) in order to reach the conclusion that the defendant ‘offended against’ the directions and prohibitions contained in the conditions. This is because the conditions, upon their proper construction, were directions to him.  
    82    That brings me to the second requirement, that there be relevant contravening conduct. The summonses allege that the defendant caused the development consent to be implemented  contrary to the specified conditions. In my view an owner who by his conduct or failure to act has caused a development consent to be implemented contrary to conditions can be said to have ‘offended against’ the directions or prohibitions contained in the conditions. Again it is unnecessary for the summons to rely on s 76(2) or make a specific assertion that the defendant carried out the development contrary to s 76(2).  
    83    In my opinion, therefore, the summonses are adequate in their own terms. It follows that I would not join in the criticism of the forms of charge made by the President in paragraph 32 of his judgment.  
    84    However, if (contrary to my view) s 76(2) is a necessary ingredient in the establishment of liability, I respectfully agree with the President, for the reasons he has given, that the summonses are nevertheless sufficient to identify the essential factual ingredients of the offence in each case.

     R v Salehedine EL-HAMID 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Salehedine El-Hamid against the penalties and orders imposed by her Honour Senior Judge Murrell SC in the Drug Court of New South Wales on 27 July 1999, upon the appellant pleading guilty to two counts of driving a motor vehicle whilst unlicensed contrary to s 6(1)(A) of the Traffic Act 1909 (since repealed), one count of using an uninsured motor vehicle contrary to s 8(1) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988, and one count of using an unregistered vehicle contrary to s 18(1) of the Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Act 1997. 
    2    At the same time her Honour dealt with a number of shoplifting, goods in custody, and stealing offences, in respect of which she sentenced the appellant pursuant to s 7 of the Drug Court Act 1998, but those sentences were suspended on the appellant entering into a Drug Court program. 
    3    Subsequently, on the Court being satisfied with his progress in that program, final sentences were imposed by way of a bond in respect of those dishonesty offences. 
    4    In respect of each of the traffic matters, her Honour imposed a fine of one penalty unit, that is $110, and ordered that the appellant be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver's licence for a period of three years. In dealing with the traffic matters she said that the sentences were imposed under s 24 of the Act. 
    5    A preliminary question has arisen as to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear this appeal. Section 7 of the Drug Court Act applies to the conviction and sentencing of a person who has pleaded guilty and been assessed as suitable to enter a program under that Act. Under that section the Court imposes an initial sentence, and also suspends execution of the sentence for the duration of the program. Subsequently, under s 11, there is provision for the termination of the offender's program, either because of its successful completion, or because the Court is satisfied that there is no useful purpose to be served by the offender's further participation in it, and the Court is then to determine the final sentence in accordance with s 12. 
    6    Section 8 provides that in respect of a person who has been referred to the Drug Court but whom the Drug Court has not convicted and sentenced under s 7, the Court may convict and sentence the person for the offence, only if the person consents to being dealt with under the section. 
    7    That is what happened in the present case. Because of the nature of the offences, it was not appropriate to deal with these traffic matters by requiring the person to undergo a Drug Court program, but as he consented, the matters were dealt with under s 8. 
    8    Her Honour referred to exercising jurisdiction in respect of the traffic matters under s 24, but that section is a general section which confers on the Drug Court the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court and the Local Court, and gives the Drug Court all the functions of both those courts. 
    9    Section 15 provides for the sentences which may be imposed by the Drug Court, for indictable offences any penalty which could have been imposed by the District Court if the matter had been dealt with on indictment in that Court, and for summary offences any penalty which the Local Court could have imposed. 
    10    The effect of these provisions is that in sentencing the appellant for these traffic offences, her Honour was acting pursuant to s 8, exercising the jurisdiction conferred by s 24(1)(b), and she therefore pursuant to s 15(1)(b) had the power to impose the same penalties as could have been imposed by the Local Court. 
    11    Section 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is the only provision which provides for appeals in matters dealt with by the Drug Court. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       ""(1) Section 5AA applies to and in respect of a person convicted of an offence by the Drug Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Part 2 of the  
       Drug Court Act 1998 
        (in relation only to a final sentence determined by the Court under section 12 of that Act) in the same way as it applies to a person referred to in section 5AA (1). 
       
      
      
       
       (2) For the purposes of this section, a reference in section 5AA to the Supreme Court is to be construed as including a reference to the Drug Court. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) The power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine an appeal under this section is to be exercised by such single judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct."" 
       
      
      
    12    Section 5AA(1) of that Act provides that where a person is convicted of an offence by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction, such person may appeal to this Court against the conviction (including any sentence imposed) or order. 
    13    The difficulty in the present case arises by the words in s 5AF(1) in brackets, namely: ""in relation only to a final sentence determined by the Court under section 12 of that Act"". 
    14    The learned Crown Prosecutor has submitted that having regard to those words, s 5AF has no application to any sentence or order of the Drug Court, except a final sentence imposed under s 12, that is, the sentence that is imposed after a Drug Court program has been terminated or completed. He submits there is, therefore, no right of appeal against the sentence or penalty in the case of a matter dealt with under s 8. 
    15    He submitted that the only right of appeal in such cases was pursuant to s 5A of the Justices Act 1902, which deals with appeals from the Local Court to the District Court, so that any appeal against penalty lies to the District Court. 
    16    I reject this submission, because it would mean that in a case such as the present there would be an appeal from one judge of the District Court to another judge of the same Court, and I know of no other circumstance where an appeal lies from a single judge of a Court to another single judge of the same Court. 
    17    Moreover, there may be cases where more serious matters which would normally be triable on indictment, were dealt with under s 8, and orders, for example, for community service or periodic detention were made, for example if those matters came to light after a person had entered a program pursuant to s 7. If the Crown Prosecutor's submission were correct, it is difficult to see how there could in such circumstances be any right of appeal at all. 
    18    In my view, the words in brackets in s 5AF(1) should be read as meaning that in relation to matters dealt with under s 7, there is no appeal in relation to the initial sentence imposed under that section, but only in relation to the final sentence imposed under s 12, and that the limitation should not be regarded as in any way limiting the right of appeal in cases dealt with under s 8. 
    19    Although I consider this the proper construction of s 5AF, it is not necessary to go so far in relation to this case, because the appellant does not wish to appeal against the fines, but only in respect of the period of disqualification, and as s 5AF imports s 5AA, there is a right of appeal not only against the conviction, including any sentence imposed, but also against any ""order"" of the Court appealed from, and I regard the orders for disqualification as orders rather than as part of the sentence. 
    20    I am therefore satisfied that this Court does have jurisdiction to deal with the appellant's appeal. 
    21    Her Honour appears to have regarded the disqualification period of three years as mandatory, and there is material in Ex. A before her Honour which seems to have been the reason for her acting under this impression. The drive whilst unlicensed offences were, however, charged under s 6(1)(a) of the Traffic Act 1909, and neither the learned Crown Prosecutor, nor myself, can find anything in that section, or in ss 10 or 10A, which impose a mandatory period of disqualification upon persons convicted of an offence under s 6(1)(a). There is, however, a general power to impose a period of disqualification pursuant to s 10(2). 
    22    The defendant has a poor driving record, and a number of previous convictions of this nature, but since being dealt with by the Drug Court he appears to have rehabilitated himself. He is conducting a business as a tiler, and I am satisfied from the evidence presented by the appellant that the lack of a driving licence is hindering him in that business to a significant degree. He also informs me, and I accept, that he has not driven since the making of the orders by her Honour on 27 July 1999. 
    23    Having regard to his appalling record in this regard, I am satisfied that a period of disqualification was called for, but in all the circumstances I consider that eighteen months is a sufficient period to impress on the appellant the fact that in future he must always be licensed, and must maintain his licence, fully paid up. This applies to each of the drive whilst unlicensed charges. 
    24    In relation to the drive unregistered vehicle and use uninsured vehicle, it appears there is no power to impose a period of disqualification. The notice of appeal was issued out of time, but the Crown has no objection to the time for Mr El-Hamid to file an appeal being extended. 
    25    I therefore make the following orders. I grant the application for extension of time and I grant leave to appeal. In respect of the matters of use an uninsured vehicle and use an unregistered vehicle, the appeals are upheld. I confirm the fines and quash the orders for disqualification. 
    26    In respect of each of the two matters of drive whilst unlicensed, the appeals are upheld. I confirm the fines but quash the orders for disqualification, and in lieu thereof, in each case, I order that the appellant be disqualified from holding any driver's licence under the relevant legislation for a period of eighteen months to date from 27 July 1999.

    IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 60386/00 MEAGHER JA HIDDEN J  Wednesday, 6 December 2000 
     
     REGINA v BRETT JOHN KELLY 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
    1   MEAGHER JA: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed by her Honour judge Ainslie-Wallace in the District Court at Sydney on 15 June 2000 for an offence of conspiracy to commit larceny. 
    2   The applicant had pleaded not guilty to an offence of conspiracy to commit robbery in company but guilty to conspiracy to commit larceny, and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. 
    3   Her Honour imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 months to commence on 14 March 2000. 
    4   No complaint is made on the applicant's behalf as to length of time of the sentence imposed. The sole ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
       ""The learned judge erred in principle in setting the commencement date of the sentence at 14 March 2000, thereby failing to take account, or proper account, of a period of approximately 14 months which the applicant had spent in custody attributable solely to a revocation of parole because he was charged with a considerably more serious offence than that to which a plea of guilty was ultimately accepted."" 
       
      
      
    5   I might add the two charges referred to both arose out of the same sets of facts. 
    6   The applicant has had an extremely lengthy history of criminal convictions. For present purposes, the starting point is that in 1992 he was convicted and sentenced in relation to what seemed to be three counts of armed robbery, and was sentenced by his Honour Judge Shadbolt in the District Court to seven years imprisonment with a four year minimum term. The seven years were to go from 30 April 1992 to 29 April 1999, the minimum term was to go to 30 April 1992 to 29 April 1996. He was released on parole on 29 April 1996, and apparently again in relation to some other matter on 21 May 1998. 
    7   In September 1998 he committed the offence to which he pleaded guilty. He was taken into custody on that offence on 17 September 1998 and bail was refused. 
    8   Whilst in custody and charged with this offence, the Parole Board revoked his parole operative from 16 September 1998 and he commenced to serve the balance of the term to which Judge Shadbolt had sentenced him. The additional term concluded on 21 November 1999. Thereafter he remained in custody solely in relation to this matter, not quite, but almost until 15 June 2000 when her Honour imposed the sentences to which I have referred. 
    9   The matter which is now in issue, that is to what extent her Honour should have backdated the non-parole period, is a matter of some complication because if one looks at the applicant's sojourn in prison before the commencement of the trial in the present case, some of it is attributable to the fact that he was awaiting trial in the present case. Other parts of it are attributable to the fact that his parole, in respect of different matters, had been revoked. 
    10   Her Honour was conscious of all these complications, and they were very complicated indeed. 
    11   Her Honour said there was argument as to how much, if any, of the pre-sentence custody ought to be taken into account on the sentence of this matter. The revocation of the parole was consequent upon the prisoner being charged with this matter and held without bail. 
    12   Counsel for the Crown submitted that whilst a matter for discretion, the time served in custody did not directly relate to this offence but to the offence committed in 1992. 
    13   I am of the view that it should be taken into account in some way on the sentence as the revocation was related to the charge in relation to this matter. However it is clear that he was serving an additional term. 
    14   Then her Honour said ""I propose to backdate the sentence to reflect some of the time spent in custody but also to reflect the decision of the Parole Board to revoke the prisoner's parole on the earlier matter"" and it is evident, from the order which her Honour made, that she did take these matters into account. It is a purely discretionary matter, and I am not able to see any error in what her Honour did. Other judges may have come to a slightly different conclusion, but it was a matter for her Honour to decide how far back the non-parole period should start. 
    15   In this respect I have found great deal of assistance in the case referred to the court by the Crown in R v Eric John Andrews (unreported, NSW CCA, 28/04/93), and in particular to what Hunt J, then the Chief Judge at Common Law said, that it is quite fallacious to assert, as it is so often asserted, that the prisoner is being punished twice for the same thing in these circumstances. The parole is revoked, because by reason of the further offence committed, it has been demonstrated that the applicant was unable to adapt to normal lawful community life, and therefore is no longer entitled to parole in relation to the earlier offence. 
    16   The sentence is imposed as punishment for the further offence itself committed whilst on parole. That, in my respectful opinion, exactly covers the present situation. 
    17   This morning we were treated to an interesting argument by Mr Doris, learned counsel for the applicant, to the effect that a bargaining had gone on between the Crown and the applicant in which the applicant had made perfectly plain which charge he was prepared to plead guilty to and which charge he was prepared not to plead guilty to, and if the Crown wanted to they could have brought on the trial in question some months before they in fact did, and this fact of itself ought to result in a successful appeal in the present matter. 
    18   In my view this is not so. I do not doubt that interchange of views was conducted, and I do not doubt, from what Mr Doris has told me, that the prisoner's attitude was disclosed to the Crown in the manner in which it was suggested. On the other hand, I cannot think that any really firm deal was done or that the parties placed great reliance on it, otherwise the matter would have been canvassed in terms by her Honour, which it was not. For those reasons I am of the view that leave to appeal should be allowed and the appeal dismissed. 
    19   HIDDEN J: I agree. 
    20   MEAGHER JA: Those are the orders of the court.

      INTRODUCTION 
       
       
      This matter was remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal by an order of the High Court of Australia made on 9 September, 1999. The order directed this Court to deal with the matter in accordance with the reasons given by the High Court ( 
      AB v The Queen 
       (1999) 198 CLR 111). The decision to remit the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal was by a majority of the High Court and the effect of that Court’s order has been the subject of argument before this court. 
       
       
      BACKGROUND 
       
      
    3   The appellant is now aged 49 and has been in custody since his arrest in the United States of America on 15 August, 1995. On 8 November, 1996 he was sentenced in the District Court to a head sentence of 18 years with a minimum term of 13½ years in respect of sixty seven sexual offences committed by him against fifteen children who had been under his care on various occasions between 1976 and 1987. At the time of committing the offences the appellant was a teaching Brother in a religious order of the Catholic Church and taught in various schools which the children in respect of whom the offences were committed, attended. He ceased to be a member of the religious order in 1991. 
     
      
    4   The appellant left Australia in 1989 after two complaints had been made about him to the police at Campbelltown. His departure can properly be characterised as flight because it would appear that he was aware of the complaints against him and that his decision to leave Australia was as a consequence of his knowledge of those complaints. 
     
      
    5   The appellant went to the United States of America and Canada, undertook higher studies, obtained employment as a teacher and as a head master, and married. In August 1992 application was made for his extradition to New South Wales to stand trial for thirty six sexual offences against six named pupils the commission of which extended over a three year period from 1984 to early 1987. These offences were later amended and reduced in number to twenty eight. 
     
      
    6   As was his legal entitlement the appellant opposed the extradition, but in the result the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against him and permitted it. In this context it is relevant to note that by virtue of s.42 of The Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), the provisions of The Treaty on Extradition between the United States of America and Australia of 14 May, 1974 and an amending protocol of 4 September, 1990, (together referred to as The Treaty) a person who has been extradited pursuant to The Treaty may not be tried or punished in the country requesting extradition except for: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the offence for which extradition (was) granted …  
        
       
       
        
        (c) any offence for which the executive authority of the requested State consents to the person’s … trial or punishment” 
        
       
      
    7   On his return to Australia in April 1996 the appellant made a confession in relation to the offences for which he had been extradited and in addition co-operated with the authorities by revealing another thirty nine sexual offences against nine additional children who had been in his care and under his charge in the schools at which he was a teacher. Furthermore, the confession extended by an additional eight years the period over which the offences had been committed None of the additional offences formed the basis of his extradition and as a consequence could not have been the subject of charges or trial, other than in accordance with the terms of s.42 of The Extradition Act 1988 and The Treaty. 
     
      
    8   The appellant’s appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed in the District Court was dismissed by majority (Gleeson CJ and Sperling J; Grove J dissenting). In his dissenting judgment Grove J expressed the view that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was excessive, should be quashed and a discount in the order of 25% allowed. He expressed the view that if the sentence imposed in the District Court : 
     
      
       
        
        “were to remain undiscounted it would virtually have set at nought the subjective case made out on the applicant’s behalf” 
        
       
       
      a view that was later quoted with apparent approval by Gummow and Callinan JJ (supra at 130) in their joint judgment in the successful appeal taken to the High Court. 
       
       
      ARGUMENTS ON AMBIT OF THE APPEAL 
       
      
    9   At the outset of the hearing of the present appeal two questions were raised: first, which of the judgments given in the High Court in the present matter should this court apply in determining the reference; second, whether this court should deal with the matter solely on the basis of the two factors considered in detail by Gummow and Callinan JJ (supra at 131 para 53) rather than on the basis of the approach indicated by Kirby J, namely that : 
     
      
       
        
        “The entire sentence and not merely that component which concerned post extradition offences will require consideration.”  
        (supra at 152 para 106) 
        
       
      
    10   The argument advanced on behalf of the Crown was that the joint judgment of Gummow and Callinan JJ concluded by proposing an order that the matter be remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal “to be dealt with in accordance with this judgment” (supra at 132 para 56). Kirby J agreed with the orders proposed by Gummow and Callinan JJ (supra at 153 para 108). As a consequence, so the Crown’s argument proceeded, this court should look solely at the joint judgment and consider only the two matters dealt with in detail in such judgment.  
     
      
    11   The actual order made by the High Court was that the matter be remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales “to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons” (at 161 para 133). Such order renders the first argument in support of the Crown’s proposition as to the basis on which the re-sentencing should proceed misconceived.  
     
      
    12   The second argument advanced was that Gummow and Callinan JJ intended that the Court of Criminal Appeal should restrict itself to the two matters dealt with in detail in their joint judgment, namely: 
     
      
       
      (i) the desirability and public interest in encouraging the full revelation of all criminality by extraditable persons; and  
       
       
      (ii) the waiving of rights not to be dealt with by the requesting State for offences which are different from, and were not included amongst, those on which the extradition was founded.  
       
      
    13   Nowhere in the joint judgment of Gummow and Callinan JJ do those Justices expressly so restrict the basis of consideration by this court. However, the Crown submits that this was the intent of, and should be inferred from, the joint judgment. It supports such an approach by pointing to the fact that Kirby J expressly states (para 106) his view about the role of the Court of Criminal Appeal, namely that it should exercise its own sentencing discretion in the place of the discretion which miscarried in the District Court. He would not have done so, it was argued, unless the inference the Crown asked this court to draw was appropriate. 
     
      
    14   The principle adverted to by Kirby J is one of long standing. It is not in doubt. House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 sets out in the clearest of terms that the sentencing function “depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion by the court imposing” the sentence (supra at 504) and details the bases on which the exercise of such a discretion may be the subject of intervention. Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ unequivocally state that if the case under review falls within the principles for intervention set out in their joint judgment : 
     
      
       
        
        “then (the) determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution … if it has the materials for doing so.” 
         (supra at 505). 
        
       
      
    15   House v The King (supra) has been frequently applied by the High Court. Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited (1985-1986) 162 CLR 24 and more recently CDJ v VAJ (1998-1999) 197 CLR 172 and Lowndes v The Queen (1998-1999) 195 CLR 665 are but three examples. 
     
      
    16   In both CDJ v VAJ (supra) and Lowndes v The Queen (supra) Gummow and Callinan JJ applied House v The King (supra). If it had been intended by them that a principle of such longstanding should be departed from in the present case, and that they were intending to depart from it notwithstanding their recent adherence to it, such a departure would be expected to be highlighted. It was not. 
     
      
    17   In my opinion there is no inconsistency between the role of this court as explicitly stated by Kirby J in relation to the ambit of the sentencing discretion on remission to this court on the one hand and its role as envisaged in the joint judgment of Gummow and Callinan JJ on the other. In the part of the joint judgment that analyses the two factors referred to above their Honours are, in my opinion, doing no more than stating the matters which, if decided in favour of the appellant, would result in the appeal being determined favourably to him.  
     
      
    18   Absent any express statement in the joint judgment to the contrary, and having regard to the form of the order made, I am of opinion that, in accordance with well established principle and the express statement of Kirby J, this court is required to deal with the present reference on the basis that the discretion in relation to the sentence to be imposed is not restricted in the manner contended for by the Crown, but that the factors identified in the majority judgments must be taken into account in favour of the appellant and in the manner discussed, when imposing the sentence. 
     
      
       
      SENTENCE: FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED 
       
      
    19   In the High Court a number of subjective considerations were identified as being of significance in determining the extent of the sentence. They were: 
     
      
       
      (a) The appellant’s plea of guilty. This had a twofold benefit, first it saved the necessity for a trial; second it obviated the need for the victims to undergo the ordeal that would be likely to be involved for them in a trial in which they had to give evidence and be cross-examined. 
       
       
      (b) The fact that the appellant had not re-offended for 10 years. This involved, as a related matter, that he had undergone and completed a rehabilitation program which apparently had been successful. 
       
       
      (c) The expression of remorse by the appellant to the victims. 
       
       
      (d) The co-operation by the appellant with the authorities by admitting the additional offences. 
       
       
      (e) The vindication (by virtue of the plea of guilty) of the truth of the allegations made by the children in question and the importance to them of being so vindicated. 
       
       
      (f) The avoidance of the trouble and expense of a long trial and of possible further extradition proceedings. 
       
       
      (g) The encouragement of full revelation of all criminality, especially in respect of that for which the appellant had not been extradited and in respect of which he was protected from prosecution at the time of his confession. 
       
       
      (h) The waiver by the appellant of his rights under the law of extradition. Such a waiver had a dual significance: first, it saved considerable expense and avoided the possibility of a second extradition application being made, perhaps unsuccessfully, as has occurred in some recent cases of notoriety (see per Gummow and Callinan JJ, supra at 132); second, it was a valuable indicator of true contrition, not to be lightly set aside or heavily discounted on the basis that the case against the fugitive was strong, even overwhelming. 
       
      
    20   Both the confession made after extradition and the waiver by the appellant of his rights under the law of extradition not to be detained or tried for offences on which he had not been extradited were said by the majority of the High Court to be significant considerations, especially since, with one exception, none of the additional thirty nine offences had or would be likely to have come to official notice.  
     
      
    21   Kirby J was of the opinion that the decision by the appellant to waive his legal rights, and confess to additional offences meant that : 
     
      
       
        
        “…the appellant was entitled to expect particular and additional consideration from the sentencing judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal.” (supra at 145) 
        
       
      
    22   The appellant’s solicitor swore affidavits for both the High Court and this court in which he detailed the problems for, fears of and effect on, the appellant of the strict custody, amounting virtually to isolation - not strictly, but akin to, solitary confinement - involved in his imprisonment. In this context it should be remembered that Kirby J said in AB v The Queen (supra): 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is well recognised in England and in Australia that every year in protective custody is equivalent to a significantly longer loss of liberty under the ordinary conditions of imprisonment.” (supra at 152) 
        
       
      
    23   In his judgment Kirby J (at 152) referred with approval to R v Lowe (1977) 66 Cr App R 122; R v Davies (1978) 68 Cr App R 319; R v Perez-Vargas (1986) 8 NSWLR 559 and R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. 
     
      
    24   In R v Lowe (supra) the English Court of Appeal considered the case of a prisoner who had given information to the police which enabled authorities to prevent crime or bring to justice a number of criminals. As a consequence of having done this there was a prospect of danger to the prisoner’s life. It became necessary for him to be confined under circumstances of protection, the conditions of which were, according to the court, “to put it mildly, unpleasant”(at 126). Such a circumstance was regarded as appropriate to consider in relation to the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    25   The English Court of Appeal affirmed the correctness of such an approach in R v Davies (supra). It said that in imposing the sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “We must also bear in mind that a sentence on an offender who has helped the police is one of intense severity in the prison. … a prisoner in Davies position … would have to be subject to solitary confinement … for the rest of his time in jail …” (at 322) 
        
       
       
        
        and 
        
       
       
        
        “… in deciding what Davies sentence ought to be by itself we must bear in mind that every year he will serve would be the equivalent of 18 months or two years in a happier atmosphere.” (at 322) 
        
       
       
      Applying this principle the prisoner was held to be entitled to “a substantial discount” (at 322) on his sentence. 
       
      
    26   The law as stated in England in relation to the discounting of sentences for co-operation with the authorities and the consequential need for isolation or solitary confinement of a prisoner has been regarded as part of the law in Australia also.  
     
      
    27   In New South Wales in R v Perez-Vargas (supra) Street CJ (with whom Hunt and Allen JJ agreed) examined the decisions in R v Lowe  (supra) and R v Davies (supra) and drew particular attention to the comment in R v Davies concerning the hardships of particular types of custody. Street CJ said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In commenting on the hardships of custody under protection in England, the Chief Justice in  
        Davies 
         case made observations that are equally applicable to the state of custody under protection in this State”. His Lordship said (at 322): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘We must also bear in mind that a sentence on an offender who has helped the police is one of intense severity in the prison … a prisoner in Davies position in an ordinary prison in this country would have to be subject to solitary confinement … for the rest of his time in jail …’ “(at 563) 
          
         
        
       
      
    28   In R v Cartwright (supra) the Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ adopted a similar approach to that adopted in R v Lowe (supra) and R v Davies. The court confirmed that in New South Wales weight should be given to the fact that a prisoner who is held under conditions of isolation from other prisoners undergoes special discomforts and such factors should be taken into account in fixing the sentence (at 255). That and the factors of full, frank and effective co-operation with the authorities as well as remorse on the part of the prisoner lead in that case to a discount of 50% of the sentence that would have been imposed in the absence of those factors. The approach was also adopted by Carruthers J (with whom Loveday J agreed) in R v Foster (1992) 25 NSWLR 732 at 736.  
     
      
    29   Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 referred to “the more difficult time which an informer is likely to have during the period of incarceration as a result of having co-operated” (supra at 227) as being a factor relevant to the mitigation of the sentence which might otherwise be imposed. Meagher JA and Hunt J agreed with Gleeson CJ. 
     
      
    30   A similar approach has been adopted in South Australia (The Queen v Golding (1980) 24 SASR 161 and in Western Australia (R v Hayes (1981) 3 A Crim R 286) in relation to persons who inform on their fellow criminals and as a consequence have to be held in special circumstances within the prison.  
     
      
    31   In the light of these decisions the appellant is entitled, in addition to other discounts that may be applicable and appropriate, to a further discount on the basis of his co-operation with the authorities in revealing offences which would not otherwise have come to notice and because of the circumstances of his incarceration. As Kirby J indicated this last mentioned matter is one which might not have been given as much weight as it deserved, suggesting that of itself it calls for some real and measurable weight to be given to it. 
     
      
    32   The District Court Judge who imposed the initial sentences, totalling 18 years with a minimum term of 13½ years, recognised that the total sentence imposed by him may well have been “overly harsh”.  
     
      
    33   Grove J thought it was overly harsh. As he pointed out in the previous appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, an examination of the head sentence imposed in the District Court suggests an un-discounted sentence of 24 years. He expressed the view that this was excessive and as already stated his reasoning appears to have found a degree of acceptance in the High Court. 
     
      
    34   Error has been found by the High Court in that two matters to which weight should have been given were not addressed in fixing the sentence. As a consequence this court must exercise its own discretion to fix the sentences. It must determine the whole sentence in the light of the facts and the discounting factors referred to in the High Court judgments which we are directed to apply in determining the sentence. 
     
      
    35   The maximum sentences which could be imposed in respect of the various offences to which the appellant pleaded guilty were :

    36   The objective considerations relevant to the offences weigh heavily against the appellant. The gravity of his offences was of a very high order. The number of offences committed was considerable, the period over which they were committed, long. The victims were young and vulnerable. In many instances the effect of the offences upon them has been quite extreme and on-going. The offences were committed by a person who was in a position of authority and trust. The circumstances of the offences were deplorable. They were demeaning and degrading of the children involved and in a number of instances likely to have an adverse effect on other children who, although not direct victims, were in the class rooms at the times some of the offences were committed. The appellant should have been a role model for the children. He was a member of a religious order, teaching in schools to which the children had been sent by their parents so that they would be raised in an atmosphere in which Catholic beliefs and values were taught to them both expressly and by virtue of the conduct of those who were their teachers. All of these objective factors mark the matter out as one calling for a substantial sentence. Subjectively, in the appellant’s favour, is the fact that the majority of the offences was revealed voluntarily by him in circumstances in which he was not bound to do so and in respect of matters which, with one exception, would not otherwise have come to attention of the authorities. Furthermore, although the period of time over which the total number of offences was committed was some eleven years, the voluntary revelations by the appellant accounted for eight of those years.  
     
      
    37   The nature, number and circumstances of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty and the time over which they were committed leave no doubt that the matter must be treated over all as a very serious case. Having said that, however, it should be remembered that in no case was there penile penetration nor any physical violence offered to any of the victims. The absence of such factors, in my opinion, denotes the crime as not being such as to call for the maximum sentence possible, but rather a high proportion of such a sentence.  
     
      
    38   A similar, but not identical, case is that of Ridsdale (1995) 78 A Crim R 486. The nature of the offences, their number, the number of victims involved, the period over which they were committed and the status of the prisoner made that an even more serious case than the present. In Ridsdale the prisoner was a Catholic priest. The offences included five counts of buggery involving four different young boys. Two of the counts were representative and in one instance involved anal penetration once a month for nearly two years. There was also a count of attempted buggery as well as multiple counts of gross acts of indecency and indecent assault. The total number of charges against the prisoner was forty six, including the representative counts. The period over which the offences were committed was 21 years. A sentence of 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years was imposed and not varied by the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal.  
     
      
    39   The fact that the prisoner was a priest who betrayed the trust of altar boys, the members of his parish under his spiritual direction and the parents who committed their children to his pastoral care, weighed heavily with the sentencing judge. In imposing the heavy sentence he said “nobody else comes to mind but a priest who could achieve that trust”. (supra at 489). The Court of Criminal Appeal in Victoria agreed. This suggests that the position of a priest involves a degree of trust even higher than that of a teacher, even a teacher who is a member of a religious order teaching in a religious school. Furthermore, in Ridsdale the cure or rehabilitation of the prisoner remained unresolved. His prognosis was said to be “a very dangerous and vexed issue”. He still “had a serious and destructive psychosexual disorder” amounting to “a sexual addiction”. He remained a person who should not “be in the company of minors unless accompanied by an adult”. This is in marked contrast to the situation of the appellant who has successfully undergone treatment. In this context I agree with the Chief Justice and Barr J that this appeal should be dealt with on the basis that the appellant is unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    40   Notwithstanding the shades of difference that exist between the level of trust reposed in a Catholic priest on the one hand and a Catholic teaching brother on the other, the extent to which the high trust reposed in the appellant was abused was extreme and such as to call for the imposition of a heavy sentence. 
     
      
    41   An undiscounted sentence of 20 years would be appropriate. It is a heavy sentence. But a heavy sentence is called for. The crimes were very serious. The extent of disapprobation by the court on behalf of the community must therefore be great.  
     
      
    42   Having determined the appropriate maximum sentence, it is necessary to look at what is required by the High Court’s order by way of discount and to apply the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-4 (R v Itamua [2000] NSWCCA 502; unreported 4 December 2000. 
     
      
    43   The majority of the High Court was clearly of the view that no or no adequate regard had been had to the fact that the appellant had confessed upon his return to Australia and had waived his rights in relation to the matters on which he had not been extradited. Gummow and Callinan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge’s remarks do not refer to the public interest in confession and waiver of the appellant’s extradition rights. It does seem to be the case that neither before the sentencing judge nor the Court of Criminal Appeal was the point articulated as clearly as it should have been” (supra at 131) 
        
       
      
    44   Furthermore, although mentioned in passing, it appeared that the circumstances in which the appellant would be held during his time of imprisonment “might not have been given as much weight as it deserved”. (supra at 152 per Kirby J). 
     
      
    45   The determination of the sentence and the discounts that have been applied to arrive at it should be transparent. As Kirby J pointed out: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Pearce v The Queen 
         has been interpreted, rightly in my view, as a ‘call for a greater degree for transparency on the part of the sentencing judge in exposing the manner in which, and the reasons by which, the aggregate sentence is arrived at.’ Judges have long since accepted the burden of adjusting their sentences for various consideration … It is always necessary to look back at the product of such adjustment for the requirement of the principal of totality and other applicable principles of sentencing” ( 
        AB v The Queen 
         supra at 150)  
        
       
      
    46   The elements involved in the ultimate sentence should “be plain for all to see” (R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 228 per Gleeson CJ), “be capable of being seen to be substantial” (R v Gallagher (1989) 44 A Crim R 256 at 260 per Grove J). In R v Many (1990) 51 A Crim R 54 the Court of Criminal Appeal (Finlay, Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ) said in relation to discounts that : 
     
      
       
        
        “The public policy which dictates that a person … should be rewarded by a discount of his sentence also demands that such discount should be obvious to all.” ( 
        supra at 70) 
          
        
       
      
    47   In some cases it may not be possible to give a specific and separate discount for each consideration in respect of which some discount may be appropriate. However, this is not so in the present case for the reasons set out below. 
     
      
    48   The guideline judgment of Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal 17 May, 2000, (2000) NSW CCA 309) states that an accused person is entitled to a discount of 10 - 25% (para 152) for a plea of guilty. The discount to be allowed in respect of the utilitarian value of the plea in the present case was conceded by the Crown to be 25%: 
     
      
       
        
        “We would readily acknowledge that (it) is at the very top of any range in relation to the utilitarian aspect alone, that is 25%. We also accept when one moves to the contrition aspect  
        there is a further aspect 
        .”(bold added) 
        
       
      
    49   The Chief Justice agrees with Barr J that the concession by the Crown was appropriate and that such an allowance should be made in respect of the matters comprehended by Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton (supra) I am of opinion that a discount of 25% should be allowed in respect of the plea by the appellant. That plea was entered at the earliest possible opportunity and should, in accordance with the guideline authority attract a discount “at the top of the range.”(supra at para 155) 
     
      
    50   Having referred to the utilitarian factors of plea and assistance to the authorities in the course of later submissions on behalf of the Crown, Senior Counsel for the Crown then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But 
         in addition to that 
        , there are other features of the case, particularly a finding there was contrition attenuated only by factors I have made reference to in the submission.” 
        (bold added) 
        
       
       
      This submission, combined with that part of the concession referred to in paragraph 47 that is highlighted makes it clear that the concession in relation to the 25% discount did not comprehend the particular features of the case in respect of which an additional discount should be applicable, conformably with the guideline judgment and the reasons of the majority of the High Court. 
       
      
    51   In view of the nature of the order made by the High Court in remitting the present appeal to this court and in the light of the concession made by the Crown and adopted by the Chief Justice and Barr J, it is appropriate to consider what it is that is comprehended by “the utilitarian value” of a plea of guilty. In Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton (supra) a specially constituted Court of Criminal Appeal discussed the factors which were encompassed by the phrase “the utilitarian value” of a plea of guilty. That value was seen as separate from considerations such as “remorse or contrition” and “other subjective considerations.”(supra at para 114). 
     
      
    52   The judgment of the court stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The benefits to the criminal justice system as a whole which flows from a plea of guilty, particularly an early plea of guilty, are not related to the circumstances of the offence or the conduct of the offender. Such benefits flow from an act by the offender that is not directly related to any of the multifarious objectives designed to be served by the sentencing process: deterrents, rehabilitation, punishment, etc. Rather, they are a collateral benefits for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole which require acknowledgment of some character by way of an incentive so that the benefits will in fact be derived by the system. 
        (supra at para 115) 
        
       
      
    53   The benefits derived by the criminal justice system from a plea of guilty include the avoidance of the need for witnesses to give evidence, particularly victims and their families. This is an even greater benefit in relation to victims of sexual assaults and their families.(supra at para 119) However, this aspect of benefit was not included within the value to be given to a plea of guilty as the following passage makes clear: 
     
      
       
        
        “The aspects of the guilty plea that go to remorse and witness vulnerability are much more closely associated with other factors concerning the circumstances of the offender and of the offence including other evidence relating to contrition, than the element of advantage to the administration of criminal justice.  
        The public interest served by encouraging pleas of guilty for their utilitarian value is a distinct interest. 
         (bold added) 
        
       
       
        
        For these reasons I am of the opinion that any general quantitative guideline should focus on the utilitarian advantage derived by the criminal justice system from encouraging pleas of guilty. 
        (supra at paras 122-123) 
        
       
      
    54   In order to understand what it was that the utilitarian value was contrasted with it is appropriate to go to an earlier part of the guideline judgment in which the following factors were treated separately and in contrast:·  express credit for surrendering privileges, such as extradition rights …·  Discount for assistance …·  Discount for guilty plea.” (supra at para 59)” 
     
      
    55   The above examination in my opinion makes it clear that the utilitarian value referred to in the guideline judgment (and the Crown concession which was dependent upon such judgment), does not comprehend a number of matters particular to the instant case which the High Court has in its reasons indicated should be the subject of further or additional discount. That this was the intention and purport of the Crown’s concession is in my opinion also clear from the form of the concessions referred to above. 
     
      
    56   As a consequence, over and above the considerations dealt with in Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton are the matters to which particular attention was given by Gummow and Callinan JJ and by Kirby J. These have already been referred to above and should, as the High Court indicated, be given weight. There is then the further factor identified by Kirby J and dealt with both in the English and Australian cases, namely the character of the incarceration of the appellant because of the problems he is likely to encounter within the prison system. Whether the prisoner be an informer, or a sexual offender against young children, is not to the point. The end situation is the same for each category. Each category of prisoner requires special circumstances of imprisonment. The offenders have to be isolated, kept in circumstances of virtual solitary confinement. If the offenders are not so kept (and perhaps even if they are) they will be subjected to threats against their lives, with consequent fear that such threats will be implemented. That fear will not of necessity be removed entirely by special circumstances of imprisonment. This is a factor for which, in accordance with the authorities referred to above and the reasons of the majority of the High Court which this Court is directed to apply, an additional discount should be made. 
     
      
    57   In the light of the concession by the Crown referred to in paragraph 47 and its adoption by the Chief Justice and Barr J, it is possible to give a specific and separate discount in relation to such considerations. That being so conformably with authority, it is appropriate to do so. Transparency is thereby maintained. 
     
      
    58   In my opinion a further reduction of 10% on the already discounted sentence should be allowed for these factors. Although such a further reduction may be thought to be smaller than the cases suggest should be allowed, it should be seen in the context of the sense of proportionality which needs to be maintained between the seriousness of the offences committed on the one hand and the total sentence to be imposed in respect of those offences on the other. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
       
      
    59   I am of opinion that the un-discounted head sentence of 20 years should be discounted in the first instance by 25%, in respect of the factors considered in the guideline judgment of Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton (supra). This reduces the sentence to 15 years. Then an additional discount of 10% of the initially reduced sentence should be allowed in respect of the matters of special application in this case referred to in paragraph 55 results in a head sentence of thirteen years and six months. This is the order of sentence adverted to by Grove J in the appellant’s first appeal to this Court, albeit arrived at by a process of reasoning that is not the same as that of Grove J. It is still a heavy sentence, a significant mark of community disapproval of the crimes giving rise to the sentence and a substantial deterrent for others who might otherwise be disposed to offend. It is a real vindication of the victims. The circumstances of his incarceration mark out such a head sentence as very severe indeed. On the comparison referred to in at least some of the cases this is an effective equivalent of between twenty and twenty seven years of conventional imprisonment. 
     
      
    60   The minimum sentence must also be adjusted. It is necessary to maintain a proper relationship between the head sentence and the minimum sentence. The appellant had no previous convictions. This is a special circumstance relative to the appellant. There is a further factor to consider in relation to the minimum sentence, namely the evidence concerning the apparently successful treatment of the appellant and hence likelihood (as far as anyone can foretell) that he will not commit like offences again. Although rehabilitation appears to have been successful it will be necessary, having regard to his previous scale of offending, to provide for supervision over a period to cement and develop his rehabilitation as part of the community in the context of community living on his release from jail. I am of opinion that the case does not justify a period of parole longer than three and a half years. Such a period should be adequate for the appellant to resume his life as a member of the community whilst under supervision. A minimum term of ten years imprisonment should therefore be fixed. Ten years isolation, with constant concern for his life and physical safety, is a real deterrent not only for the appellant, but also for others in like situations. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
       
      
    61   In the light of the forgoing it will be necessary to recast a number of the sentences imposed by the District Court judge In accordance with the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (supra) specific sentences will need to be imposed in respect of each of the offences. However, I am aware that Barr J takes a different view in relation to the sentences that should be imposed and that the Chief Justice agrees with his view. In these circumstances I think it sufficient merely to indicate that the sentences should be adjusted to reflect the conclusions set out above and that the non parole period should be fixed so as to expire on 14 August 2005, on which date the appellant should be eligible for release on parole. 
     
      
    62   BARR J: This is an appeal against sentences imposed on the appellant in the District Court. The appellant, whom I shall refer to as AB, pleaded guilty of a large number of sexual offences against children. On 8 November 1996 Freeman DCJ imposed a number of sentences the effect of which was a total head sentence of eighteen years and a minimum term of thirteen years six months. The appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court, which on 7 July 1997 granted leave but dismissed the appeal. The appellant appealed by special leave to the High Court of Australia and on 9 September 1999 that Court allowed his appeal, set aside the relevant order of this Court and ordered that the appeal to this Court be allowed. The appeal was remitted to this Court to be dealt with in accordance with the reasons of the High Court of Australia. 
     
      
    63   The appellant was born on 19 March 1951. He joined the order of Marist Brothers when he was seventeen years old and after a period of training took up teaching in that order. The pupils in his classes were aged between nine and eleven years. For a period of about eleven years between 1976 and 1987, when he was aged between twenty-five and thirty-six years, the appellant committed many acts of sexual intercourse, indecent assault and acts of indecency against his charges. He ceased active teaching during 1987. 
     
      
    64   In August 1989 two of the girls against whom he had committed offences complained about him to the police. He found out about the complaints and left Australia in order to avoid answering them. Between then and his arrest in the United States in 1995 he was on the run in North America. Not long after leaving Australia he undertook treatment for paedophilia and associated personality disorders. He then moved to various localities in the United States and remained for some time under the supervision of those who had treated him. In 1991 he left the Marist Brothers order and obtained employment. He married in 1992. 
     
      
    65   By 1995 the New South Wales Police were aware of complaints by six of the appellant’s former pupils and criminal proceedings were commenced against him, leading to his arrest in the United States and to an application that he be extradited to Australia in order to face the outstanding charges. The applicant unsuccessfully defended those proceedings and was eventually returned involuntarily to New South Wales. 
     
      
    66   The laws governing the extradition of persons from the United States of America to Australia are given effect to by the Extradition Act 1988 (Commonwealth). A regulation issued under that Act incorporates the protocol which gives effect to the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the United States of America. S 42 of the Act contains a number of provisions, one of which is that when an extraditable person is surrendered by a country to Australia that person shall not, unless having first left Australia or having had the opportunity to do so, be tried for any offence that was committed before the surrender of that person other than those for which extradition is granted. The section contains exceptions to this general rule, including where the surrendering country consents to the person’s being so tried. So the United States of America had the right to expect that the appellant would not be tried for any offence committed before his extradition, other than those contemplated by the charges in respect of which he was extradited, without its express consent. That rule gave rise to a corresponding right in the appellant not to be tried for any other such offence: AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111 per Gummow and Callinan JJ at 128-129, 131 and 132, or a privilege to object to prosecution for any other such offence: AB v The Queen per Kirby J at 141-144. 
     
      
    67   The appellant was extradited on charges relating to thirty-six separate acts pertaining to six complainants. The charges were eventually amended and reduced in number to twenty-nine, a recasting permitted by a further provision of s 42, since they related to the conduct contemplated in the thirty-six original charges. 
     
      
    68   When he arrived in New South Wales the appellant sought legal advice and then decided to plead guilty to the twenty-nine charges he was facing. He also told his solicitor that he had committed a large number of offences against nine other complainants and expressed his desire to tell the police about them and be charged and punished in due course. With one possible exception, the police knew nothing at all about those offences. 
     
      
    69   The appellant’s solicitor advised him that he could not lawfully be charged with the additional matters but his instructions were firm, and that led to correspondence between his solicitor and the officer in charge of the police investigation and a representative of the Office of the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions. In order to permit the appellant to be lawfully charged with the additional offences it was necessary for the United States of America to waive its rights under the Extradition Treaty, so approaches were made to that country through the Commonwealth Attorney General’s Department. It was necessary for the United States Government to be informed about the appellant’s attitude towards the diplomatic request. Accordingly, his solicitor furnished an affidavit on his instructions setting out a number of matters including an assertion that he wished to waive his rights and to enter pleas of guilty to charges relating to the nine further complainants. In due course the United States of America gave its consent and the fresh charges were dealt with together with the original ones. The original charges came to be referred as “the pre-extradition proceedings” and the fresh charges as “the post-extradition proceedings”. 
     
      
    70   Neither the learned sentencing judge nor this Court dealt with the value for sentencing purposes, other than as evidence relevant to contrition, of the appellant’s voluntary revelation of the facts of the post-extradition offences and of his waiver of his rights not to be charged with them. It was the failure to give weight to the utilitarian value of those two matters as affecting the sentences that satisfied the majority of the members of the High Court of Australia that the sentencing proceedings had miscarried. See the judgments of Gummow and Callinan JJ at 131-132 and of Kirby J at 141-145. 
     
      
       
      The jurisdiction of this Court 
       
      
    71   A preliminary issue arises as to the power of the Court in dealing with the appeal. It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the task of the Court was confined to a consideration of the two matters identified in the judgments of Gummow and Callinan JJ and Kirby J to which I have referred. Assuming this were possible, the Court would have to weigh the utilitarian value of those matters in the light of the sentences as they stood and make any corresponding deduction the Court thought appropriate. 
     
      
    72   The Crown relied on a portion of the joint judgment of Gummow and Callinan JJ to support this submission. Having observed that the public interest in the disclosure of unknown offences and the waiver of extradition rights were relevant matters to which the sentencing court should have had regard, their Honours said at 132 - 
     
      
       
        
        The Court of Criminal Appeal should reconsider the appeal to it taking into account these matters. 
        
       
      
    73   Their Honours went on to propose that - 
     
      
       
        
        The matter should be remitted to be dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal in accordance with this judgment. 
        
       
      
    74   Kirby J said at 152, 153 - 
     
      
       
        
        The established error of principle requires, in my view, that the sentence imposed upon the appellant by Judge Freeman should be reconsidered. This will mean that the entire sentence and not merely that component which concerned the post-extradition offences will require consideration. 
        
       
      
    75   His Honour agreed with the orders proposed by Gummow and Callinan JJ. 
     
      
    76   The judgments of McHugh and Hayne JJ do not touch upon this matter since their Honours would have dismissed the appeal. 
     
      
    77   The relevant order of the High Court was as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        Remit the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons. 
        
       
      
    78   It was submitted that of the overall minimum term of thirteen years six months, only three years six months related to post-extradition offences and that the Court’s consideration was therefore confined to what weight the additional facts should have in relation to that minimum term. 
     
      
    79   I do not think that the Crown’s submission is made out. I do not understand the words of Gummow and Callinan JJ as intending to confine this Court in the factors it might consider in re-sentencing after a finding of error. I see no conflict between the remarks of their Honours on the one hand and Kirby J on the other. The invariable position in an appeal to this Court against sentence is that if error is shown to exist, the Court must exercise its discretion and sentence afresh. It cannot fulfil that function by any partial approach. All the factors relevant to every part of the sentencing must be considered afresh. In any event, it would be quite impossible in my view to deal partially with an appeal of this kind. Several features of the case entitled the appellant to a lesser sentence than he would have otherwise received, for example the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty and his strong prospects of rehabilitation as well as the new matters the Court must now take into account. It is well recognised that it is inappropriate to attempt to quantify separately any or all of the multifarious elements involved in the determination of a final sentence as though sentencing were a process by which mathematical formulae were applied in order to produce a single correct answer. See, for example, the remarks of Hayne J in AB v The Queen at 156-157 and Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 227-228. 
     
      
    80   I conclude that, error having been found, it is the duty of this Court to reconsider the whole sentence by reference to all the evidence and all the principles which may bear upon it. This approach is consistent with the requirement of Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(3), which provides as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        On an appeal under section 5(1) against sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. 
        
       
      
    81   See also the judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 - 
     
      
       
        
        If the judge acts upon a wrong principle … then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution in his if it has the materials for doing so. 
        
       
       
      The objective facts 
       
      
    82   The statements of the complainants were before the learned sentencing judge together with psychological reports dealing with the effects of the offences upon them. The facts are best described by the following extract from his Honour’s remarks on sentence. 
     
      
       
        
        I will deal chronologically with the offences. Accordingly the first victim comes within the post-extradition proceedings, a child whom I will identify only as CPA. On matter 2710/1, the first of the charges with which I am dealing, this child was, in about Easter of 1976, taken by the prisoner to his room in the monastery to look at a model train set by which device I should add the prisoner induced a number of his victims into the premises where he could assault them. He pushed this child onto the bed and fondled his genitals and then he pulled down his shorts and underpants and touched him on the penis.  
         
         
        Charges 2 and 3 relate to the same victim. They involved touching the child and indeed masturbating him until he experienced his first orgasm which one might expect would have been an awesome experience for a child of that age in the circumstances in which he came to puberty. These charges, 1 to 3, involving that child ….. are but representative of a number of occasions upon which the prisoner abused that boy. 
         
         
        The next victim, whom I will identify as SA, was in the prisoner’s fifth class in 1977. Having isolated the child in the classroom at lunchtime, the prisoner undid the child’s pants, pulled out his penis and fondled it. There was an interruption. The prisoner told the child to go downstairs and not tell his parents or anyone.  
         
         
        The following charges 5, 6 and 7 also involve the child SA and include mutual masturbation, although 6 and 7 carry with them, to my mind at least, aggravating elements in that the prisoner was then dealing with another child whom I will refer to as HM. So that he was encouraging the boys to masturbate each other in his presence.  
         
         
        Charges 8 and 9 refer to the child HM. They involve the prisoner requiring the child to masturbate him, the prisoner, and the reverse, him manipulating the child…. It is with this child, it is said, that the prisoner went so far as to have them both naked and to lie the child on the bed so as to engage in what can only be called simulated sexual intercourse. 
         
         
        The next victim to whom reference may be made was LM. He was abused by the prisoner in August, September and October in 1976. It involved the prisoner masturbating the child. The child was sufficiently strong-minded as to decline to reciprocate when the prisoner requested him so to do.  
         
         
        Charges 13 and 14 relate to boys who in 1979 were in the prisoner’s class and may be referred to as SM and WP. They are charges of indecently touching those children. 
         
         
        TW was a victim in 1979. Again this is a series of charges which are but representative of a wholesale assault upon this child’s innocence continuing, he says, about twice a week over that year. Not for the only time the prisoner introduced the subject of masturbation by referring the child to a book and then by rubbing his penis through his clothes and encouraging him to try that activity at home by himself. 
         
         
        The next day, according to the facts underpinning charge 16, he undid the child’s clothing and masturbated him. Charges 17 and 18 were again an occasion when the prisoner used two boys together encouraging them to masturbate each other and him whilst he did the like to them. He had taken them to his room and caused them all to be totally undressed and this was the first occasion on which TW had seen the results of a male climax. He speaks of his shock and horror and well may he do so. 
         
         
        Charges 19 to 22 again involve an occasion when the prisoner had two boys each masturbating each other and doing the like to him. Although this is not chronologically accurate, to continue dealing with the post-extradition offences the next victim is CM who was in the prisoner’s class in 1983 and again the prisoner introduced the child to the subject of masturbation by showing him a book explaining it. 
         
         
        Within a couple of days of this introduction the prisoner had the child masturbate him. Charge 24 is a similar activity later and charge 25 relates to mutual masturbation occurring again when the child had been directed to come back and assist his teacher. 
         
         
        Charge 26 relates to the following year, although involving the same victim, and again illustrates the extent to which the prisoner ingratiated himself, not only into the life of these children at school but in their home life as well. He had been invited by the child’s unsuspecting parents to dinner. Afterwards, he took the child for a drive upon which mutual masturbation occurred. The power and authority of the prisoner could have been no more dramatically illustrated than the fact that he was welcomed and probably lionised in the child’s own home so that there was no sanctuary from his interference at all. The child was required to fellate the prisoner on this occasion. 
         
         
        Charges 27 and 28 involve mutual masturbation and fellatio. Charge 29 occurs three years later when the prisoner came back, having left the town of Lismore in which these things had earlier occurred, and visited the child when he was then 15. He took him out in his car to a fire track in the bush and initiated mutual masturbation. To have come back looking for this victim years after he had passed from his purview strikes me as being a sinister element.  
         
         
        Charges 30 to 42 involve the victim to be referred to as BR. They occur in 1985. Again the book on masturbation is produced as a prelude. Again shortly after the child was masturbated. Some of the charges, notably 31, involve the child beginning to reciprocate by rubbing the prisoner’s penis outside his clothes. By charge 34 mutual masturbation had again been established. Charge 35 relates to involvement of two boys again, as does 36, as does 38. Charge 40 relates to the child's 11th birthday when the prisoner promised him a birthday present and proceeded later to take him in his car and masturbated him until the child experienced his first ejaculation. Charges 41 and 42  
        (sic, apparently a mistake for 31 and 32) 
         again refer to mutual touching and each of those counts involve this victim.  
         
         
        I turn now to the pre-extradition proceedings which are identified formally as Registry No. 68752/1 through to, but not comprehensively involving, /59, 68752 /57 and /13 occurred in Lismore in 1985 and involved the victim to be known as AG. Again the child was in fifth class where the prisoner was his teacher. He lured the child to the monastery with the device of the train set. He touched the child on his penis on the outside of his clothing. And then /13, he took the child to his room, took off his clothes and tried to undress the child telling him that a couple of his classmates had been in this position before and asking why would he not co-operate. With considerable bravery in a child so young, the child not only declined but endeavoured to leave the room. To his dismay he found that the door was locked. Nonetheless he managed to unlock it and leave.  
         
         
        68752/58 involving the victim DS …..She was called out by the prisoner to his desk at the front of the class where he rubbed his hands up and down her leg on her bottom on the outside of her underpants. That child complained to one of the Sisters of the school but apparently nothing was done. In 1984 the prisoner dealt with two young girls to be referred to as LH and RL. As was the case with the victim DS, he began by calling these children out to his desk in front of the classroom and touching them there. Indeed, /56 and /53 refer to an occasion on which he had both girls simultaneously in front of the class inserting his finger into their vaginas and demonstrating even more forcefully than ever before his complete mastery of the situation; their total helplessness and powerlessness that he was able to do these things with impunity in the presence of, although not perhaps in the sight of, all of their classmates. 
         
         
        The victim LH is concerned as the victim in charges /56, /55, /51, /45, /46, /47 and /48. 
         
         
        They represent a litany of misbehaviour beginning with the prisoner promising the girls that he would take them to Luna Park. The prisoner enticed them into a situation where he could place his finger in the vagina of LH. He had her touch his penis which was erect. At the theatre of the school after watching some production he directed her to remove her pants, rubbed her vagina and guided her hand in manipulating his erect penis until he ejaculated. He engaged in a comparison between the two little girls telling one that while she was a good kisser the other girl was a better kisser, but at least was better at the other things. He committed cunnilingus on this child. 
         
         
        As to the victim RL on /53, the occasions when the two girls were being penetrated digitally in front of the class ….. On the other counts, which briefly summarised involve /50, the prisoner requiring the child in the school playground to insert her hand through the pocket of his pants and touch his naked penis …... 
         
         
        68752/52 and /49 relate to an occasion when he summoned the girl to the classroom after the school fete. I regard these actions as having sinister connotations as well because the girl’s parents were working at the school fete and it was in the full knowledge, of course, that he was not obliged to account for the girl’s absence from home and not likely to be interrupted by her parents that he took her into the classroom and inserted his finger in her vagina and required her to masturbate him. 
         
         
        In the later years of 1986 and 1987 the remaining victims may be referred to as the boy CA and girl AT. The boy who is the subject of /28 found the prisoner rubbing his penis, outside his clothing admittedly, but again in front of the class, reinforcing, as I said earlier, the power of the prisoner.  
         
         
        /40 and /41 involve occasions when the child was ordered into a storeroom and masturbated. It is said that these again are only representative counts involving a long series of sexual misbehaviour by the prisoner against this child whom he endeavoured to encourage to engage in sexual intercourse with the remaining victim AT, indeed in front of the class. /39 involves the child being at the monastery after watching a movie, helping the prisoner and having his penis rubbed outside his clothing, as does /42. On each occasion the child declined to reciprocate those sexual acts.  
         
         
        The final victim is AT, a girl used by the prisoner for his sexual gratification over a period from the middle of 1986 to early 1987. /1 refers to an occasion when he called her out in front of the class and fondled her outside her underclothing and on that I would impose 12 months imprisonment from August 2006. /34 relates to again touching outside the clothing. 
         
         
        /27 ….. On this occasion the prisoner had taken the child in his car from her home down a bush track and inserted his finger into her vagina. /28 involves a similar activity except, having taken her in the car to the same bush track and after inserting his finger in her vagina, he had her masturbate him to the point of ejaculation.  
         
         
        The counts referred to as /29 involve similar activities, as do /31, although this was at the monastery and involved the prisoner performing cunnilingus upon the child after having her masturbate him whilst he digitally penetrated her. 
         
         
        /25 involved digital penetration after swimming at the beach at Wattego and again similarly in /33. /24 refers to an occasion on which the prisoner took the girl to her home and finding no member of the family present, undressed her, placed her on the kitchen bench and performed cunnilingus on her in her own home. There was nowhere any of these children could be safe from this predator. 
        
       
      
    83   Further undisputed detail illustrates how serious some of the individual offences were. The first example is of one of the female complainants. The following facts were admitted by the applicant in his record of interview. The child was in the applicant’s class. When she was ten or eleven years of age, he commenced first to call her to front of the classroom where he fondled her legs. He then progressed to fondle the outside of her vagina through her underpants. That led to his placing his fingers inside her vagina. On other occasions he had her take his penis in her hand and masturbate him to ejaculation. On another occasion he kissed her on the breasts. He put his tongue inside her vagina. Such intimacy occurred at a place called Woodlawn where he parked the motor car. He took the child there on a number of occasions. He visited the child’s home quite a lot. Prior to August of the first year of these occurrences, such intimacy occurred once a fortnight or once a week. Later, it was once a fortnight or once every three weeks, extending into the following year. 
     
      
    84   According to a report by a graduate social worker, the child remembered fear as being the dominant emotion during the period of abuse. In adolescence, the child developed uncontrollable intrusive thoughts about the abuse. She became estranged from her parents, fearing that they would blame her for what had occurred. Her scholastic performance declined. She now associated sex with pain. She still felt the need to control everything in her life and avoided situations where she might feel out of control. 
     
      
    85   The second illustration relates to a male complainant. In his record of interview, the applicant admitted abusing this child on several occasions, including having the child masturbate him. Further detail is provided in a statement of facts which was tendered in evidence before his Honour. The applicant had begun by showing the child a book about masturbation. Intimacy progressed from the applicant fondling the child’s penis to mutual masturbation in a storeroom, including such activity in company with another male child, mutual masturbation in the applicant’s own room, on a holiday camp and in a holiday house at Byron Bay. This course of conduct commenced when the boy was ten. 
     
      
    86   In this case there is also a report by a graduate social worker. The child reported having felt confused and ashamed at the time. He had thought he would not be believed if he disclosed what occurred. For some nine years after these events, he endeavoured to suppress the memory. He felt numb, cut off from the world. He experienced intense feelings of anger, with irritable outbursts often directed at his family and friends. His tolerance to stress was low. He still suffered from intrusive thoughts. This continued to interfere with potential sexual relationships. 
     
      
    87   In the course of his account of the objective features of the offences, his Honour made some more general observations which were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I pause to observe that this particular tactic (showing the child an illustration in a book relating to masturbation) seems to me, even in the context of the overall criminality of the prisoner’s behaviour, particularly reprehensible. He was there to teach these children but not to accelerate their sexual maturing by introducing them to onanism in an apparent oblique reference to his school masterly role. 
         
         
        (T)hat (asking the child to keep encounters a secret) is a recurring theme, not only in the history of this prisoner, but in all who molest children. They impose secrecy upon their victims and in this prisoner’s case he was able to do so with particular effect having regard to the position in which he stood to these children. He was not only an adult and their teacher but of course their spiritual guide. 
         
         
        The totality of the prisoner’s control over these children is easily understood (a reference to molesting a child in front of the class). As is observed in one proof: If he told me to pick up a pencil, I picked up a pencil. If he told me to take my pants down, I took my pants down. If he told me to do this, I did this. It was entirely appropriate, as Mr Walsh said in the opening of his submissions, that the prisoner should acknowledge that he was in a position of absolute trust and the breach of that trust is the more stunning because of the awe and respect in which the children not only held him but were entitled to hold him. 
         
         
        It is not difficult to understand that the effect of activities such as these in those circumstances (another reference to molestation in the sight of classmates) has been on these victims, as on the earlier ones, to produce deep-seated long-lasting, if not permanent, psychological damage which has had a pervasive effect upon their entire life. Indeed the evil done by this prisoner is not confined to each of these many victims individually. Each of them has suffered sorely at his hands. Each of them has been warped and distorted in personal development. Each will face prolonged difficulties in interpersonal relationships and in the assessment of their own self-worth. But beyond that, like ripples in a pond, the damage has spread to their peers, to their families and to those with whom they would seek to arrange relationships. 
         
         
        Each of them (the children involved) has suffered sorely at his hands. Each of them has been warped and distorted in personal development. Each will face prolonged difficulties in interpersonal relationships and in the assessment of their own self-worth. But beyond that, like ripples in a pond, the damage has spread to their peers, to their families and to those with whom they would seek to arrange relationships. 
         
         
        I am pleased that the prisoner had prolonged psychosexual analysis, treatment, counselling, support and supervision in America. I am much less pleased to find that none of these children had anything like the same opportunity to redress the wrongs which he has done to them and to those to whom they belong. Some of them have turned out, understandably, to be rebellious. Nearly all of them have suffered academically. 
        
       
      
    88   Objectively, the offences individually and collectively were very serious indeed. They involved fifteen children, who suffered lasting damage. They were carried out over a period of about eleven years. They were carried out by a mature predator on little children. In order to commit and repeat them the appellant took advantage not only of his power as an adult over little children but of the special trust that had been placed in him not only as a teacher but as a religious brother with moral as well as religious obligations towards his charges. Nothing less than a very long total sentence could give proper recognition to the need publicly to condemn the offences and deter others from offending in like manner. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case 
       
      
    89   The appellant presented a strong subjective case. His Honour described it as powerful. The appellant had been treated for his paedophilia and other disorders and in the opinion of one of his attending medical practitioners, Professor McConaghy, he had responded well. Professor McConaghy remarked on the appellant’s apparently successful marriage then of six years’ standing and the development of his work and social relationships with adults. He thought these things consistent with the appellant’s report that he no longer had a sexual interest in children, since in Professor McConaghy’s experience most paedophiles were incapable of forming satisfying social or sexual relationships with adults. Whereas paedophiles who reoffended did so within three years or so, the appellant had not done so for over nine years and this, together with the other features I have mentioned, made Professor McConaghy think that the appellant was very unlikely to reoffend. 
     
      
    90   His Honour expressed some reservation about that opinion. It appeared that the appellant himself had been abused as a young person and that that was a matter he had not disclosed to Professor McConaghy until a late stage. However, it is apparent from Professor McConaghy’s evidence that he was well aware when expressing his opinion of the sexual abuse of the appellant himself and appreciated the late stage at which the appellant had revealed information about it. I do not consider that his Honour was entitled to accept the evidence other than at face value. 
     
      
    91   Although by the time of sentence the appellant had not reoffended for ten years, his Honour observed that up until then he had been living in a different atmosphere, facing the investigation of the charges, which circumstances were likely to cause him to modify his behaviour. The implication was that his Honour considered that there was a real risk of the appellant’s re-offending. He concluded that only actual punishment would serve to deter the appellant from further offending. As Sperling J pointed out in the judgment of this Court of 7 July 1997 that was not a conclusion supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    92   I think that this appeal should be dealt with on the basis that the appellant was unlikely to reoffend. 
     
      
    93   His Honour accepted that the appellant was contrite, as evidenced by the way he had changed his life following medical treatment and had pleaded guilty to the original charges and by the way he had volunteered the post-extradition offences and pleaded guilty to charges brought in respect of them, as well as his generally co-operative attitude towards the investigating and prosecuting authorities. His Honour thought that the appellant’s defence of the extradition proceedings showed that contrition did not merit the highest ranking. In my view his Honour’s assessment was appropriate. 
     
      
    94   His Honour also recorded the appellant’s entitlement to leniency for the utilitarian value of his confessions and pleas. The time and expense of long and possibly difficult trials were saved and the complainants were spared the ordeal of giving evidence. 
     
      
    95   As well, the appellant is entitled to consideration for the value to the community of his volunteering those offences and of his having waived his rights not to be charged with them before having the opportunity to leave Australia, which would have entitled and enabled him to defend any further extradition proceedings. The community has thereby been saved substantial trouble and possibly great expense. 
     
      
    96   In Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 this Court encouraged sentencing courts to quantify the effect of a plea of guilty where appropriate, as it relates to contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian values. Particular encouragement was given to the quantification of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. The same principle applies to co-operation with the authorities in the various ways that that might happen. Here all the factors I have mentioned are important but particularly the saving of time and expense in trying the appellant on all the charges, the ordeal that the complainants have been spared on all the charges and the saving of trouble and expense that might have been occasioned if the appellant had not waived his extradition rights. I refer to the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [124]-[140]. 
     
      
    97   The range of discount applicable on account of the utilitarian value on a plea of guilty and co-operation with the authorities on the part of an accused person will vary between ten and twenty-five percent. It was conceded by counsel for the Crown that the utilitarian value of the appellant’s pleas of guilty, his voluntary co-operation and his waiver of his extradition rights concerning the post-extradition offences entitled him to a reduction of twenty-five percent from the sentence which would otherwise apply. I think that the concession was appropriate and I would make such an allowance. 
     
      
    98   Because the appellant is a child sexual offender he will face danger in prison and will have to be kept away from the ordinary prison population. This Court has been told that he is now kept apart even from other prisoners who are on protection. His movements and the access he may have to work and other gaol programmes will therefore be restricted. He is entitled to additional consideration because in the circumstances he will find his sentence harder to serve than it would otherwise be. 
     
      
    99   But for the allowance of twenty-five percent for the utilitarian value of the several features I have mentioned, an appropriate sentence would in my opinion be one of twenty years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of sixteen years. In arriving at that sentence I have taken into account all other relevant factors, objective and subjective, favourable to the appellant and unfavourable to the appellant. I have adopted the “instinctive synthesis” approach expressed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 300 and approved by the High Court of Australia, for example, in the judgments of McHugh and Hayne JJ in AB v The Queen at [15]-[18] and [113]-[116] and in the judgments of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [46]. I have also taken into account that in this case there is an overlap between the utilitarian consideration of the features that I have mentioned and other subjective considerations, namely the remorse and contrition which are thereby demonstrated to exist: see R v Gallagher per Gleeson CJ at 227-228 and Hunt J at 233-234; R v Thomson; R v Houlton per Spigelman CJ at [70] -[71]. 
     
      
    100   A reduction of twenty-five percent from the appropriate sentence produces a head sentence of fifteen years and a non-parole period of twelve years. No lesser non-parole period would be sufficient to reflect the objective gravity of the offences. I do not think that this case justifies a longer period of parole than three years, which ought to be adequate to enable the appellant to settle into the community under supervision. 
     
      
    101   In order to achieve this result it is necessary to recast only the sentences passed for offences committed on the complainants referred to by his Honour as the boy CA and the girl AT. I would leave all the other sentences undisturbed. I propose the following orders - 
     
      
       
       Quash the sentences passed with respect to the boy CA and the girl AT and sentence the appellant in lieu as follows - 
       
       
       Complainant CA 
       
       
       On charge 68752/38, imprisonment for one year six months commencing on 15 August 2003 and expiring on 14 February 2005. 
       
       
       On each of charges 68752/39, 68752/40, 68752/41 and 68752/42 imprisonment for one year commencing on 15 August 2003 and expiring on 14 August 2004. 
       
       
       Complainant AT 
       
       
       On each of charges 68752/1, 68752/27 and 68752/34 imprisonment for one year commencing on 15 August 2003 and expiring on 14 August 2004. 
       
       
       On each of charges 68752/24, 68752/25, 68752/29, 68752/31 and 68752/33 imprisonment for two years commencing on 15 August 2003 and expiring on 14 August 2005. 
       
       
       On charge 68752/28 imprisonment for seven years commencing on 15 August 2003 and expiring on 14 August 2010. 
       
       
       Non-parole period

     WEDNESDAY 6 DECEMBER 2000 
     
     REGINA v. ADONIS KHOUZAME 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   PRIESTLEY, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of five years imprisonment comprising three years minimum term, with an additional term of two years and against another sentence of three months fixed term, both imposed upon him in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by Grove, J. 
    3   The first sentence was imposed upon him in respect of his conviction on one count of manslaughter and the second in respect of his conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
    4   The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty on the assault charge is five years imprisonment. 
    5   The applicant had been in custody for about a month prior to having been released on bail prior to his trial. 
    6   He had originally been charged with murder and the verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter led to the imposition of the first sentence to which I have referred. 
    7   The learned trial judge gave extensive reasons for the sentences he imposed. On the first count, he found the facts to be that the applicant killed the victim by striking him on the head with a substantial piece of wood which had apparently been used as a garden stake and on the second count that thereafter the applicant and certain of his relatives attacked another man occasioning him injuries, including a bloody and swollen face and bruising on his arm and back. 
    8   These events occurred after some young boys of Turkish ethnicity had chatted to some girls in the vicinity of the applicant's home. Another young boy apparently took objection to his sister conversing with those boys. His report of what was going on attracted the applicant to the front balcony of the upper storey of his house and an exchange of verbal abuse occurred. The applicant demanded in forceful terms that the boys leave the area. 
    9   When the applicant perceived that the boys were not going to depart immediately, he formed an intent to drive them away. He descended to the street, stripped off his upper garment, armed himself with the garden stake. 
    10   The learned trial judge found no occasion for the applicant to believe that there had been by the boys any misconduct or provocative incident, or any matter which could reasonably cause an apprehension that the boys were about to misconduct themselves. There was no suggestion that any unwelcome attention was being paid to the girls. 
    11   The girl about whom the other young boy had made particular complaint was not a member of the family of the applicant but was a member of the same ethnic group as the applicant. The boys were of a different ethnic group. 
    12   His Honour rejected the offender's complicity in a statement made in his undissenting presence by his brother, ""Don't bring any fucking Turks into the street"" but he concluded that the offender had formed the intention to drive the visiting youths away from the street. He had regard to these matters and to the claim of self-defence as a useful guide to the reality of the offender's recognition of responsibility. 
    13   His Honour was of the view that:- 
     
      
       
       ""Save the rantings of a 10 year old boy, the prisoner had been given no cause to form such an intention."" 
       
      
    14   His Honour was referring to the intention to drive the visiting youths away from the street. 
    15   His Honour rejected that the prisoner had feared attack from the youths and the defence of self-defence, of course, must have been rejected by the jury. 
    16   His Honour concluded that it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner struck one blow to the victim which occasioned that person's death. He held:- 
     
      
       
       ""It was a blow which is adequately described by common parlance as a 'king hit'."" 
       
      
    17   He rejected also a contention that the victim on the second count had initiated the violence involved in that matter by placing the applicant in a headlock. 
    18   His Honour, as he was bound to because of the verdict, rejected that the blow had been struck intending to kill or recklessly as to the prospect of killing or with intent to cause really serious injury. He sentenced the applicant on the basis that the killing was the consequence of an unlawful and dangerous act by the prisoner. It was open to his Honour to find the blow was struck without the applicant adverting to whether serious injury might be caused or not. His Honour, whilst having regard to a post-mortem measurement which suggested the victim had a greater than average vulnerability to the effects of a blow on the head, concluded:- 
     
      
       
       ""But this was not a case of a moderate blow causing unexpectedly grave damage, the violence in this instance was a full-bodied blow with a substantial weapon."" 
       
      
    19   His Honour referred to the applicant's lack of prior convictions, his close and supportive family and the favourable impression he gave to the probation officer and the psychologist, Ms. Robilliard. His Honour rejected, as, of course, in accordance with the verdicts he had to, suggestions put on the applicant's behalf that his conduct was in the exercise of lawful self-defence. He was not persuaded that the content of various letters tendered on behalf of the applicant established profound remorse for the victim's death and did not accept the opinion of the psychologist in that regard. In his remarks on sentence, his Honour treated that matter in the following way:- 
     
      
       
       ""I accept the assertions in the various letters comprising the exhibit mentioned that, these crimes apart, the prisoner is a person of good character. They have not persuaded me that he is contrite for his offences and I have concluded that he clings to the myth that his action was justified in whole or in part by some need for self-defence. The consequence of that finding is not, of course to increase sentence but I do not make the finding invited by counsel that the prisoner has genuine remorse and contrition so as to attract particular leniency."" 
       
      
    20   Notwithstanding that his Honour did not find genuine remorse and contrition, and did find the intent to which I have referred, his Honour did accept that generally the offender had been of prior good character and gave him the benefit of that finding to a very great extent. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""As I have said, the prisoner's prior good character is supported by these referees together with the opinions of the probation and parole officer and the psychologist Ms. Robilliard. The combination promotes a finding which I make that the prisoner is so far as I can predict, unlikely to re-offend. In terms of the question of rehabilitation there should be a determination favourable to the prisoner. The need for sentence to reflect personal deterrence is therefore of a low order."" 
       
      
    21   Turning to general deterrence, his Honour accepted the necessity to condemn the use of a significant implement to assault an unarmed youth and that the community would expect an assault of that kind leading to death to attract objectively an appropriate degree of punishment. 
    22   His Honour found special circumstances in the offender's youth, that this was the first custodial sentence and that on release it would be desirable for him to have objective assistance over a significant period from a person independent of his family to guide him in accepting the reason for his imprisonment and to assist him to re-enter the community with an appropriate attitude. These circumstances justified his Honour's departure from the statutory proportion. 
    23   The sole ground assigned for the application is that:- 
     
      
       
       ""The sentence imposed by the learned trial judge was manifestly excessive."" 
       
      
    24   This ground does not assert any particular error, but on its face asserts that the sentence passed is so disproportionate to the circumstances that it is in error, whether simply by reason of the result being wrong, or because of some otherwise undisclosed error of principle in arriving at that result. 
    25   The written submissions of the applicant challenge particular aspects of his Honour's findings. In particular, his Honour's characterisation of the fatal blow as ""a king hit"" and the appropriateness of his Honour's observation that this was ""not a case of a moderate blow causing unexpectedly grave damage … [but] was a full-bodied blow with a substantial weapon"". Secondly, it is contended that his Honour erred in finding that the applicant did not have ""genuine remorse and contrition such as to attract particular leniency"". Each matter raises questions of fact in the context of submissions that the language employed by his Honour to describe the phenomenon to which he was referring in his judgment overstate the matter when regard is had to the relevant evidence. 
    26   Particularly in relation to the ""king hit"", reference is made to the deceased's ""thinner than usual"" skull in the context of a submission that, although some force would have been required to fracture it, it is asserted that the necessary degree of force to occasion the injuries that were inflicted, in the context of the evidence of the position of the deceased to the applicant at the time of striking the blow, did not permit one to draw the conclusion his Honour did, particularly in the context that it must be accepted in the verdict of the jury that an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm was not established. 
    27   In this regard it was submitted that it was necessary for his Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a ""full-bodied blow"" had been delivered as such was a matter of aggravation relevant to sentence and in that regard The Queen v. Olbrich (1999) 166 ALR 331 at para.24-25 was cited for the proposition that his Honour had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. It was put that there was a reasonable possibility that it was ""a case of a moderate blow causing unexpectedly grave damage"" and that his Honour had erred in finding against that. 
    28   With respect to the matter of genuine remorse or contrition, it was contended that his Honour's finding was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. It was submitted that the passages to which his Honour made reference in the testimonials were taken out of context and that what the applicant put and his counsel put on his behalf at trial did not accord with such a finding. The passages of evidence cited in support of this submission clearly illustrate that the applicant had not wanted ""this"" to happen and that he felt sorry for the victim's family and his own family, ""putting everyone through this"". He said he had never wanted to hurt anyone in his life including the victim. Reference is made to evidence from other witnesses concerning his regrets and sorrow for what had happened and that the behaviour in question was ""uncharacteristic"". Passages in support of the submission from the Probation and Parole report and psychologist's report were also cited. 
    29   There were, however, also passages in the evidence from which, in my view, his Honour was entitled to draw the conclusion that he was not satisfied that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and contrite as showing insight into why the law proscribed his conduct and such as to support his Honour's view that his attitude did not merit particular leniency by reason of contrition. As also there was evidence capable of founding a conclusion that an unprovoked forceful blow was struck with the stake upon an unsuspecting victim.  
    30   In my view it was open to his Honour to reach each of the challenged findings of fact. I do not consider that the finding as to the nature of the blow struck is a circumstance of aggravation such as Olbrich (supra) refers to and as is necessary to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, even if it was, in the context of the evidence in this case, in my view, it was open to his Honour to reach such a conclusion. Merely because another possibility described as reasonable is open on the evidence, his Honour was not precluded from reaching the view that that possibility was excluded to his satisfaction. 
    31   Alternatively, even if it was open to his Honour to reach the conclusions that he did, it was contended by the applicant's oral submissions that, in the light of the task entrusted to this court, on such an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, it was necessary for this court to consider on the evidence whether it would make the same findings. 
    32   This contention is in the teeth of the way in which the court has, since 1912, construed the legislation as directing it in the manner of disposition of applications for leave to appeal against sentence. The submission goes so far as to contend that on a proper construction of ss.5 and 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act it is incumbent upon the court to undertake a review, revision or re-hearing on the materials below and on such materials as are admitted by way of fresh evidence to reach its own findings and its own conclusions as to the sentence in the light of them. 
     
      
    33   Section 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 confers upon persons convicted on indictment a right to appeal under that Act to this court (s.5(1)(c)) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person's conviction. Section 6 provides for the determination of appeals in ordinary cases and by subsection (3) it is provided that:- 
     
      
       
       ""On an appeal under s.5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal."" 
       
      
    34   Our attention was drawn to Coal & Allied Operations Pty. Limited v. Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47 in the judgment of Gleeson, CJ., Gaudron and Hayne, JJ. (at para.68):- 
     
      
       
       ""Appeal, as such, was unknown to the common law. It is a creature of statute. It is not possible to adopt any hard and fast or universal approach to the process called 'appeal' in a particular statute. The word encompasses 'different litigious processes which have few unifying characteristics'. No fewer than six forms of a procedure loosely called an 'appeal' have been identified. Within these broad categories are various subcategories reflecting the particular nature of the 'appeal' in question, the issues which the appeal presents and the purpose for which it exists, derived from the language in which it is expressed. 
       
      
      
       
       In every case where the issue is that of the duty and function of an appellate court or tribunal, the only safe starting point is a careful examination of the language and context of the statutory provisions affording the appellate right, together with a consideration of the powers enjoyed by, and duties imposed on, the body to which the appeal lies. 
       
      
      
       
       The range and variety of the decisions that may, with leave, be the subject of an appeal under the Act (under s.45(1) of the Act) is such as to suggest that generalities will be dangerous. So different are the various decisions amenable to appeal that it will only be of limited help to catalogue the process within the broad class of an 'appeal in the strict sense' or an 'appeal by way of re-hearing', as if, without more, such classification dictates the way in which the particular appeal must be approached. True, such broad categories will offer a limited measure of guidance. But it remains for the appellate body in every case to discharge its functions in a way apt for all of the statutory provisions that are brought into play. 
       
      
      
       
       It is necessary to make this point because some of the discussion of the nature of the appeal to the Full Bench of the Commission, both within the Commission and in the reasons of the Full Court, might, on a superficial reading, be taken to suggest that there is a particular classification of appeals generally, being 'appeals against discretionary decisions', which is in some way to be distinguished from 'appeals by way of re-hearing'. This is a false dichotomy. Many appeals by way of re-hearing involve appeals from discretionary decisions. The re-hearing identifies the materials upon which the appellate body acts. It will have relevance for any supervening changes in the facts or in the applicable law. 
       
      
      
       
       On the other hand, the character of the decision under appeal (as discretionary, interlocutory, final or otherwise) will govern the approach to be taken by the appellate body in discharging its function. In the case of discretionary decisions, that approach in the case of an appeal is one of caution and restraint. This is because of the primary assignment of decision-making to a specific repository of the power and the fact that minds can so readily differ over most discretionary or similar questions. It is rare that there will be only one admissible point of view. Disputation and litigation are expensive, distracting and time-consuming. Therefore, the law, for policy reasons, recognises these features of discretionary decisions. Except in appeals involving a complete hearing de novo, all other appeals will approach with restraint the reconsideration of discretionary decisions which are based on the same material that was before the primary decision-maker. 
       
      
      
       
       Because of the necessity to ascertain the ambit of the appellate function in a particular case by reference to the legislation in question, it is obviously useful where the task of classification has already occurred to accept the guidance of a previous decision."" 
       
      
    35   In support of the propositions therein referred to, their Honours cited State Rail Authority of New South Wales v. Earthline Constructions Pty. Limited (In Liq.) (1999) 73 ALJR 306 and cases therein cited, also Turnbull v. New South Wales Medical Board [1976] 2 NSWLR 281; Builders Licensing Board v. Sperway Constructions (Syd.) Pty. Limited (1976) 135 CLR 616; Clarke & Walker Pty. Limited v. Secretary Department of Industrial Relations (1985) 3 NSWLR 685 and House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; Norbis v. Norbis (1986) 161 CLR 513 (see also Cranssen v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 509). 
    36   Although House (supra) was not concerned with a statutory provision in terms similar to that now in question but one conferring a full right of appeal on law and fact, nonetheless, the oft quoted passage at 504-505 in the decision of the majority has long been accepted as applicable to appeals brought under s.5 of the Criminal Appeal Act against sentence. That passage reads:- 
     
      
       
       ""But the judgment complained of, namely, sentence to a term of imprisonment, depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion by the court imposing it. The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred. Unlike courts of criminal appeal, this court has not been given a special or particular power to review sentences imposed upon convicted persons. Its authority to do so belongs to it only in virtue of its general appellate power. But even with respect to the particular jurisdiction conferred on court of criminal appeal, limitations upon the manner in which it will be exercised have been formulated. Lord Alverstone, LCJ said that it must appear that the judge imposing the sentence had proceeded upon wrong principles or given undue weight to some of the facts ( 
       Regina v. Sidlow 
        (1908) 1 Crim. App. R. 28 at 29). Lord Reading, LCJ. Said the court will not interfere because its members would have given a less sentence, but only if the sentence appealed from is manifestly wrong ( 
       Regina v. Wolff 
        (1914) 10 Crim. App. R. 107). Lord Hewart, LCJ. has said that the court only interferes on matters of principle and on the ground of substantial miscarriage of justice ( 
       Regina v. Dunbar 
        (1928) 21 Crim. App. R. 19 at 20). See, further,  
       Skinner v. The King 
        (1913) 16 CLR 336 at 340 per Barton, J. and at 342 per Isaacs, J. and  
       Whittaker v. The King 
        (1928) 41 CLR 230 at 244-250."" 
       
      
    37   Other appellate provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act have not been held to provide for a re-hearing. See, eg., Griffiths v. The Queen (1976-77) 137 CLR 293 at 300 per Sir Garfield Barwick, CJ. I have referred to some of the authorities in Histollo Pty. Limited v. Director-General of National Parks & Wildlife Service (1998) 45 NSWLR 661. See also Kurtic v. The Queen (1996) 85 A. Crim. R. 57 at 59-60; Regina v. BWM (1997) 91 A. Crim. R. 260; Harris v. The Queen (1954) 90 CLR 652. 
    38   In Regina v. O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A. Crim. R. 397, Hunt, J. (as he then was), with whom Carruthers and Wood, JJ. agreed, observed:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this court is not by way of re-hearing. An appeal which is not by way of re-hearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below:  
       A-G v. Sillem 
        (1864) 10 HLC 704 at 724; 11 ER 1200 at 1209;  
       Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co. Pty. Limited v. Dignan 
        (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 109. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge. The members of this court may individually disagree with the findings which were made, but the court cannot for that reason interfere with those findings. It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this court can intervene in relation to a trial judge's findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice: see  
       Regina v. Merritt & Roso 
        (1985) 19 A. Crim. R. 360 at 372-373;  
       Regina v. Kyriakou 
        (1987) 29 A. Crim. R. 50 at 60-61."" 
       
      
    39   His Honour's observations in that regard have been approved in this court on numerous occasions including in Regina v. Altham (unreported 18 June 1992); Regina v. Chapple (unreported 14 September 1993); Regina v. Hawkins (unreported 17 December 1992); Regina v. Allen (1992) 27 NSWLR 398. In Regina v. Rose [1999] NSWCCA 327 and Regina v. Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A. Crim. R. 81, the court concluded that the appropriate course to take in the context of examination of a factual finding below was to consider whether the trial judge had failed to weigh the facts properly in their true relation to one another because this may show that the trial judge had acted in a wrong principle. 
    40   In all of these cases, the approach taken in House (supra) was that which commended itself to the court. Because the Criminal Appeal Act does not stipulate the grounds upon which the Court of Criminal Appeal can set aside a sentence, it is the approach in House (supra) which should be taken: see AB v. The Queen [1999] HCA 46 and the approval expressed by the High Court for what had been said by Hunt, J. (as he then was) in O'Donoghue (supra), in Fleming v. The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250. This court would accept the guidance of previous decisions on this question of classification even if it were not by precedent bound to proceed in the way I have described. 
    41   In accord with that approach, it is only if the judge ""mistakes the facts"" in the sense that these authorities have referred to that the findings of fact may be set aside and in that event, the court may reach the opinion that some other sentence should have been passed and might pass that other sentence should it be warranted in law. 
    42   The existence of a power in the court to receive fresh evidence, even if not strictly in accord with the principles expressed in Regina v. Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR 392) and Regina v. Mickelberg (1989) 167 CLR 259, in cases of applications for leave to appeal against sentence in which the reception of that evidence is thought necessary to place the facts as they were before the primary judge in the context that should have been made known to him at that time does not derogate from the conclusion I have expressed. 
    43   I am strongly confirmed in my conclusion by the recent decision of the High Court in Dinsdale v. The Queen [2000] HCA 54 where that court was called upon to construe s.689(3) of the Criminal Code (WA) which, whilst analogous to s.6(3), is not in precisely the same terms. The Chief Justice and Hayne, J. held:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is desirable to restate some propositions which are fundamental to criminal appeal but which may sometimes be obscured by the development of shorthand descriptions of what is done in particular cases. It is of the first importance to identify the jurisdiction which the Court of Criminal Appeal exercises, the power the court is given, and the circumstances in which those powers may be exercised. In this particular case, the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia was exercising jurisdiction given by s.687(1) of the Criminal Code (WA) to hear and determine a prosecution appeal against sentence brought pursuant to s.688(2). That latter sub-section provides:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'An appeal may be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the part of the prosecution - 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         … 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (d) against any punishment imposed or order made in respect of a person convicted on indictment …' 
         
        
       
      
    44   They concluded, that in relation to a provision so expressed:- 
     
      
       
        
       ""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal was to determine whether there was error made in sentencing the accused, error being understood, in this context, as it was explained in  
       House v. The King 
        (1936) 55 CLR 499.""  
       
      
    45   Further, Gaudron and Gummow, JJ. were of opinion that:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is common ground that, in this case, the Court of Criminal Appeal was empowered by s.689(3) of the Code to quash the sentence passed at the appellant's trial and to pass the increased sentence it imposed upon him, without an order for its suspension, 'if they [thought] that a different sentence should have been passed'. Further, the respondent correctly accepted that the exercise of the powers conferred by s.689(3) was conditioned upon the formation of an opinion by the Court of Criminal Appeal, a process to which there applied the reasoning of this court (with respect to an appeal against sentence brought directly this court under s.73 of the Constitution) in the joint judgment in  
       House v. The King 
        (1936) 55 CLR 499. To that we would add that this opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal must be expressed as well as formed, so that, to adapt a statement by McHugh, JA. in  
       Soulemezis v. Dudley (Holdings) Pty. Limited 
        (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 280, the essential ground or grounds for the formation of the opinion are articulated.""  
       
      
    46   Kirby, J. concluded:- 
     
      
       
       ""The legal process before the Court of Criminal Appeal was, as described, an appeal. This is a creation of statute. An appeal may take several forms, the precise nature in a particular case depending upon the legislation in question. Here, that legislation, by providing for an appeal, required the demonstration of error before the appellate court enjoyed the authority to disturb the decision subject to appeal. In  
       Lowndes v. The Queen 
        (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671-672, this court remarked that:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'A court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. … The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice.' 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The necessity to show error in such a case is fully accepted by courts deciding appeals against sentence. Indeed, it is commonly referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia. Because the imposition of a sentence involves the exercise of judgment and evaluation upon which minds can differ, it bears close similarities to the making of a discretionary decision. Like such a decision, if properly imposed, a sentence will not be disturbed on appeal merely because the appellate court would have reached a different result had the responsibility of sentencing belonged to it. As in the case of appellate review of a discretionary decision, a brake is imposed upon undue appellate disturbance of primary decisions (and unwarranted appeals seeking that relief) by the necessity to identify an error that justifies and authorities appellate intervention. Such an error may involve the adoption by the primary judge of an incorrect principle, giving weight to some extraneous or irrelevant matter, failing to give weight to some material considerations, or a mistake as to the facts.""  
       
      
      
    47   I therefore conclude that, in the absence of established error in the sense referred to by the High Court in House (supra), it is not open to this court to set aside the trial judge's findings of fact in preference for views of our own on those questions.  
    48   It was also submitted in oral argument that his Honour's findings of fact, if reviewed by this court in accordance with the principles in House (supra), should still lead to a conclusion that his Honour was mistaken in respect of the two matters to which I have referred leading to a sentence which was excessive. It was submitted that even if it were open to his Honour to conclude as he did, this court on an examination of the material would conclude he was mistaken. 
    49   For my part, I do not see that his Honour was constrained by the evidence and materials before him to reach any conclusions other than those he came to. For myself I would, if I were hearing the matter for myself, quite possibly have reached the same conclusions. But that is not the task that I am required to undertake sitting in this court in pursuance of my function under the Criminal Appeal Act. I find no error. 
    50   Further, when having regard to the range of sentences available for manslaughter on the facts of this offence, I am not persuaded of the submission that the sentence was so disproportionate as to show error. 
    51   Since the matter has been fully argued, in my view, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed. 
    52   The orders I propose are: leave to appeal granted; appeal dismissed.53   KIRBY, J: I agree with Greg James, J.

    Friday 7 December 2001 
     
      
    70005/01 – R v COLIN THOMAS BONDSENTENCE 
     
      
    1 JAMES J: On 29 June 2001 after a trial presided over by me a jury found the prisoner Colin Thomas Bond guilty of the murder of Donna Gaye Wheeler on or about 2 November 1999 at Berala, a suburb of Sydney. In these remarks on sentence I will sometimes refer to Donna Gaye Wheeler by her name and sometimes refer to her as “the victim”. 
     
      
    2 Immediately after the verdict of guilty was returned by the jury the proceedings on sentence commenced. The Crown Prosecutor tendered four documents all of which were admitted into evidence. Counsel who had appeared for the prisoner at the trial, who is a junior counsel, then applied for an adjournment of the proceedings on sentence, on the grounds that the prisoner wished to be represented in the proceedings on sentence by senior counsel. I granted the application for an adjournment and adjourned the proceedings on sentence to 10 August. 
     
      
    3 On 10 August an application for a further adjournment of the proceedings on sentence was made on behalf of the prisoner, on the grounds that the senior counsel by whom the prisoner wished to be represented was unable to appear for him on that day. I granted this application for a further adjournment and the proceedings on sentence were adjourned to 12 October. 
     
      
    4 The hearing of the proceedings on sentence continued and was concluded on 12 October. On 12 October no further evidence was adduced by the Crown. The prisoner did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence and no evidence was adduced on his behalf in the proceedings on sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing on 12 October I informed the parties that I would need time in which to consider what sentence should be imposed on the prisoner. 
     
      
    5 At the trial there was no dispute that the victim had been killed by someone. However, there was no direct evidence that it was the prisoner who had killed the victim. The Crown case that it was the prisoner who had killed the victim was a circumstantial one.  
     
      
    6 I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the following facts relating to the offence of murder committed by the prisoner are established by evidence given at the trial or must be taken to have been established by the jury’s verdict of guilty.  
     
      
    7 In early November 1999 the prisoner, who was then fifty-one years old, his brother Keith Bond and a man named Peter McDougall were living together in a house at 88 Amy Street, Regents Park. The victim, who was then thirty years old, was living alone in a house at 9 Kingsland Road, Berala, which was not far from 88 Amy Street, Regents Park. 
     
      
    8 For about five years down to about May 1999 the victim had lived in a de facto relationship at Waterloo with a man named James Wellfare, by whom she had had a son when she was only seventeen years old. 
     
      
    9 After separating from James Wellfare in about May 1999 the victim lived firstly with her mother and then in a flat at Bankstown.  
     
      
    10 While the victim was living at Bankstown she entered into a relationship with the prisoner’s brother Keith Bond. During this relationship Keith Bond was sometimes physically violent to Donna Wheeler. She obtained an apprehended violence order against him, which he breached. Keith Bond also performed acts of vandalism on Donna Wheeler’s car. At times Keith Bond behaved obsessively towards Donna Wheeler. He wanted to marry her and have children by her but she rejected this proposal. By October 1999 Donna Wheeler had clearly shown that she did not wish to have any further relationship with Keith Bond. 
     
      
    11 On 16 October 1999 Keith Bond met another woman named Debbie Howarth. Before 2 November 1999 he had entered into a sexual relationship with Debbie Howarth, which continued for another two or three months after 2 November 1999 and then ended. After Keith Bond had met Debbie Howarth and formed a relationship with her, Donna Wheeler told James Wellfare that Keith Bond had a new girlfriend, that Keith Bond was not bothering Donna Wheeler any more and that she felt much more at ease. 
     
      
    12 After, or shortly before, the relationship between Keith Bond and Donna Wheeler ended, the prisoner himself entered into a relationship with Donna Wheeler. The prisoner and Donna Wheeler spent time together at the Regents Park Hotel and the Regents Park Bowling Club. 
     
      
    13 The 2 November 1999 was the day that year on which the Melbourne Cup was run. The prisoner, who worked as a furniture removalist, did not go to work that day. He went to the Regents Park Hotel in the morning and he spent much of the day either at the Regents Park Hotel or at the Regents Park Bowling Club. While at the Hotel he watched the running of the Melbourne Cup on television.  
     
      
    14 On 2 November 1999 Donna Wheeler went to work. After work she went to the Regents Park Hotel and joined the prisoner there some time late in the afternoon. 
     
      
    15 At about 6.35, while the prisoner and Donna Wheeler were at the Hotel, a woman named Monique Damaso telephoned Donna Wheeler on her mobile telephone and Monique Damaso and Donna Wheeler made an arrangement to met at Donna Wheeler’s house at 7.30. At about 7.15 Donna Wheeler and the prisoner left the Hotel and travelled together to 9 Kingsland Road in Donna Wheeler’s car. At about 7.30 there was a meeting at Donna Wheeler’s house between Donna Wheeler and Monique Damaso, in the course of which Donna Wheeler supplied some marijuana to Monique Damaso.  
     
      
    16 The prisoner and Donna Wheeler then went in Donna Wheeler’s car to the Regents Park Bowling Club, intending to have a meal at the Bowling Club. While Donna Wheeler and the prisoner were together at the Bowling Club, Donna Wheeler received a call on her mobile telephone from James Wellfare. In this telephone conversation Donna Wheeler and James Wellfare made an arrangement to met each other at Strathfield.  
     
      
    17 The prisoner and Donna Wheeler then left the Bowling Club in Donna Wheeler’s car. Donna Wheeler dropped the prisoner off at the Regents Park Hotel and she proceeded on to Strathfield. At Strathfield she had a meeting with James Wellfare. After the meeting Donna Wheeler drove back to the Regents Park Hotel, where she joined the prisoner at or shortly after 9 o’clock. The prisoner and Donna Wheeler bought a takeaway Chinese meal and went by car to Donna Wheeler’s house at 9 Kingsland Road.  
     
      
    18 It is relevant to note the movements on 2 November of Keith Bond and Debbie Howarth.  
     
      
    19 Unlike the prisoner, Keith Bond went to work on 2 November. He also was a furniture removalist. Debbie Howarth arrived at the Regents Park Hotel some time in the afternoon. Keith Bond left work and himself went to the Hotel. Keith Bond and Debbie Howarth were together at the Hotel around Melbourne Cup time. At about 4 o’clock in the afternoon they travelled together to 88 Amy Street, where Keith Bond changed out of his work clothes. Keith Bond and Debbie Howarth then went to the Regents Park Bowling Club, where they spent some time together.  
     
      
    20 From about 7 o’clock to about 9 o’clock or shortly afterwards Debbie Howarth played bingo at the Bowling Club. At about 7 o’clock or a quarter past 7 Keith Bond left the Bowling Club and went to the Regents Park Hotel. He remained at the Hotel until about ten to nine, when he left the Hotel to return to the Bowling Club. Keith Bond and Debbie Howarth were together at the Bowling Club, where they were seen by a number of people, until some time between 10 o’clock and a quarter past ten. Keith Bond and Debbie Howarth then left the Bowling Club and, after giving someone else a lift home, they returned to 88 Amy Street. Shortly afterwards they went to bed in Keith Bond’s bedroom at 88 Amy Street. 
     
      
    21 On the afternoon of Wednesday 3 November James Wellfare was expecting Donna Wheeler to come to his place at Waterloo to pick up their son. When she did not arrive, James Wellfare made a number of unsuccessful attempts to contact her or find out where she was. He became alarmed and drove to Donna Wheeler’s house at 9 Kingsland Road. When he entered the lounge room of the house he discovered Donna Wheeler’s body lying on the floor of the lounge room. James Wellfare telephoned an emergency number and ambulance officers and police arrived at the house shortly afterwards.  
     
      
    22 A forensic pathologist Dr Cala attended at 9 Kingsland Road, Berala at about 3.16 in the morning of Thursday 4 November. I am satisfied that the body of Donna Wheeler had not been disturbed since James Wellfare had discovered it.  
     
      
    23 Dr Cala observed that Donna Wheeler was lying on her back, that she had clothing on the upper part of her body but apart from a sock on one foot was naked from the waist down and that there were three stab wounds in her left upper chest.  
     
      
    24 On 5 November 1999 Dr Cala conducted a post mortem examination of the dead body of Donna Wheeler.  
     
      
    25 Dr Cala found gross fracturing of facial bones with complete disarticulation and gross fragmentation of the cheek bone, two fractures of the lower jaw and a fracture of the hyoid bone. In Dr Cala’s opinion the amount of force to produce the head injuries would have been severe to extreme. The head injuries could have been produced by the attacker using his fists, feet or knees.  
     
      
    26 Dr Cala observed that there were three stab wounds in the left chest, which had passed into the lung and two of which had penetrated ribs. There was a stab wound in the abdomen but the absence of any abdominal bleeding associated with the stab wound suggested to Dr Cala that the stab wound had been inflicted when the victim was already dead or nearly dead. 
     
      
    27 Dr Cala found petechial haemorrhages on the eye lids, suggestive of compression of the neck by the attacker using his hands, fingers or elbow. 
     
      
    28 Dr Cala considered that Donna Wheeler had died as a result of the combined effects of the blunt force head injuries and the stab wounds to the left lung. 
     
      
    29 Although the victim was naked from the waist down, there was no evidence of sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    30 After Donna Wheeler’s body was found investigating police, quite naturally, initially suspected the prisoner’s brother Keith Bond of being the culprit, because of his previous, sometimes violent and obsessive, relationship with Donna Wheeler. 
     
      
    31 On the morning of 4 November investigating police came to the house at 88 Amy Street, intending to interview Keith Bond. Keith Bond was not at home and the police spoke to the prisoner. There was a short interview of the prisoner by police at his home on the morning of 4 November, a longer electronically recorded interview of the prisoner later the same day and a further electronically recorded interview of the prisoner on 15 November. On 15 November the prisoner was arrested and charged with the murder of Donna Wheeler. Keith Bond was interviewed by police on 4 November and 11 November. 
     
      
    32 At the trial the Crown presented a strong circumstantial case that it was the prisoner who had killed Donna Wheeler. The circumstances relied on by the Crown included that he was last person known to be alone with her and had been alone with her in the room in which her dead body was subsequently found, that he had lied about the circumstances in which he claimed that he and Donna Wheeler had separated on the night of 2 November, that according to evidence from Keith Bond and Debbie Howarth the prisoner washed the clothes and shoes he had been wearing on the night of 2 November, starting the washing machine at 88 Amy Street at or shortly after midnight, that the prisoner was observed to have a recent injury to his right hand consistent with the prisoner having used his right hand to punch someone, that on a towel in the lounge room of Donna Wheeler’s house where her body was found there were four areas of blood having the same genetic profile as Donna Wheeler’s blood and one area of blood having the same genetic profile as the prisoner’s blood, that a finger print of the prisoner in blood which had the same genetic profile as Donna Wheeler blood was found on a plastic shopping bag lying near Donna Wheeler’s head, that blood having the same genetic profile as Donna Wheeler’s was found on the face of the watch the prisoner had been wearing that night, that there was no evidence of any forced entry to Donna Wheeler’s house and that the prisoner had told lies in consciousness of guilt on a number of occasions after 2 November. 
     
      
    33 I have already noted that the prisoner did not give oral evidence at the trial. Keith Bond did not give oral evidence at the trial, although evidence of the interviews of Keith Bond by the police, evidence of a statement made by Keith Bond and evidence given by Keith Bond in the committal proceedings was admitted. Keith Bond had been subpoenaed by the Crown to give evidence for the Crown at the trial but he failed to appear at the trial. He was clearly aware of attempts by police officers to find him. On 5 June 2001 Keith Bond made a telephone call to one of the investigating police officers, leaving a message on that officer’s mobile telephone to the effect of “stop bothering looking for me”. 
     
      
    34 I am satisfied that Keith Bond deliberately avoided giving oral evidence at the trial, because he did not want to give evidence which might be adverse to his brother the prisoner. The evidence which Keith Bond could give which might be adverse to the prisoner included some evidence tending to incriminate the prisoner but also, importantly, included evidence tending to exculpate Keith Bond himself. Keith Bond was the only person apart from the prisoner who, as a matter of practical reality, might, conceivably, have killed Donna Wheeler. Keith Bond had been assured by police, while police were still in contact with him, that he was no longer regarded by police as a suspect for the murder of Donna Wheeler. 
     
      
    35 In the absence of direct evidence, only a limited number of findings can be made beyond reasonable doubt about the actual killing of Donna Wheeler by the prisoner.  
     
      
    36 At the trial the Crown accepted that it could not establish any motive for the killing. I find that a dispute of some kind occurred between the prisoner and Donna Wheeler. The prisoner became enraged. He struck Donna Wheeler on the face a number of times with his fist, with severe to extreme force, fracturing a number of bones in her face. The prisoner then obtained a knife from within Donna Wheeler’s house and stabbed her three times in the chest with a sufficient degree of force to penetrate two of her ribs. The prisoner then stabbed her in the abdomen. The prisoner removed the clothing from the lower part of Donna Wheeler’s body. Despite removing the clothing, the prisoner did not have sexual intercourse with Donna Wheeler. The prisoner wiped his bleeding hand on the towel which was found in the lounge room. After killing Donna Wheeler he returned to his house.  
     
      
    37 The killing of Donna Wheeler was brutal and violent and the prisoner clearly had an intent to kill. However, the killing was not premeditated.  
     
      
    38 I turn to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner.  
     
      
    39 The prisoner did not give evidence at the trial and did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence and no evidence was tendered on his behalf at the trial or in the proceedings on sentence, apart from two letters written by the victim which were tendered at the trial. Accordingly, there is very little evidence about the subjective circumstances of the prisoner. 
     
      
    40 The prisoner was born on 10 September 1948. Accordingly, he was fifty-one years old at the time of committing the offence and was still fifty-one years old at 30 June 2000, which, as I will explain later in these remarks on sentence, is the date from which any sentence I impose must commence. The prisoner is at present fifty-three years old. 
     
      
    41 Some evidence given at the trial shows that the prisoner has sometimes worked as a furniture removalist.  
     
      
    42 The prisoner has a substantial criminal history. Many of his convictions have been for offences of dishonesty or for driving offences and I do not attach any significance to them. Twice in 1970 and again in 1987 the prisoner was convicted of assaulting a female but the penalties imposed on the prisoner suggest that the courts which imposed the penalties regarded the offences as minor. 
     
      
    43 The offences previously committed by the prisoner to which careful consideration must be given are offences committed by the prisoner on 9 December 1987, in respect of which he was indicted before Allen J on 16 March 1989.  
     
      
    44 On 16 March 1989 the prisoner was indicted before Allen J on charges that on 9 December 1987 at Chester Hill he had murdered a woman named Margaret Smyth, that he had inflicted grievous bodily harm on Margaret Smyth with intent to have sexual intercourse with her and that he had robbed Margaret Smyth with striking. The prisoner pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to the manslaughter of Margaret Smyth and he pleaded guilty to the other two charges. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the count in the indictment charging murder.  
     
      
    45 On 2 June 1989 Allen J sentenced the prisoner to penal servitude for twenty years for the offence of manslaughter, to penal servitude for thirteen years for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse and to penal servitude for eight years for the offence of robbery with striking. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of fifteen years and ordered that all the sentences be served concurrently.  
     
      
    46 These sentences were, of course, imposed before the coming into force of the Sentencing Act and the nominal length of the sentences and of the non-parole period would have been substantially reduced by the effect of remissions, if the Sentencing Act had not been enacted and had not come into force. 
     
      
    47 After the coming into force of the Sentencing Act the sentences imposed by Allen J were converted into a minimum term of penal servitude of nine years five months eleven days, which would expire on 23 May 1997, and an additional term of three years one month four days.  
     
      
    48 On 12 April 1990 the Court of Criminal Appeal by majority dismissed an appeal by the prisoner against the sentences imposed by Allen J. 
     
      
    49 In his remarks on sentence delivered on 2 June 1989 Allen J found the facts of the offences in a way which was not the subject of any criticism by the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal. In his remarks on sentence Allen J said inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences were committed shortly before 11.00 p.m. in a small park at the corner of two streets in that suburb. The prisoner had been drinking that night at a local hotel in the company of two other men. The victim was observed drinking alone and was invited to join them. She was not previously known to them. She accepted their invitation and at closing time went with the prisoner, at his invitation, to the R.S.L. Club which was nearby. They were not admitted to the Club as the victim was not a member and it was after the time during which non-members would be admitted. The victim requested the prisoner to walk her home and it was in the course of that journey that the offences were committed’. 
        
       
       
       . . . 
       
       
        
       
       
        
        “..as they got near to the corner of the two streets she said to him: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘You can piss off now, I’m nearly home’ 
          
         
        
       
       
       . . . 
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
       
        
        This summary dismissal incensed the prisoner. The message he had got from the victim’s behaviour was a firm promise of her sexual favours. In the upshot what occurred was, in the prisoner’s words: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘With a few beers under my belt, I got the shits and hit her’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          That the prisoner was incensed there is no doubt. His statement that he ‘hit her’ is, however, a quite inadequate description of what he did. She was found on the following morning at about 5.35 a.m. in the park, devoid of clothing from the waist down. She was unconscious, lying on her back and in the words of the gentleman who found her: ‘She was gurgling’. Her face was so badly battered that in the words of that gentleman it appeared ‘just pulped’. She was taken by ambulance to the Bankstown Hospital but transferred almost immediately, because of her condition, to the St George Hospital. Upon examination she was found to have gross facial and neck swelling with bruising around both eyes and the throat. There was a 5 centimetre laceration of the left cheek and her mandible was fractured. There was leakage of cerebro-spinal fluid from the left ear and the left tympanic membrane was found to be ruptured. Both upper arms were bruised. She died on 25 December, 1987, 16 days after the bashing, without having regained consciousness. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          What happened? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that after being rebuffed the accused in his rage and frustration dragged her into the park where he proceeded cruelly to bash her. I accept that where the bashing occurred it was dark and that in the emotional storm which possessed him, the prisoner, whilst intending to punish the victim by inflicting pain and humiliation upon her did not realise, carried away as he was, that he was inflicting grievous bodily harm. Had he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm, he would have been guilty of murder – not manslaughter. It is manslaughter to which he has pleaded. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in his enraged and frustrated state, he also stripped her of the bottom half of her clothing and, by his plea to the second charge, he has admitted that he intended to have sexual intercourse with her. I do not accept his claim in his record of interview that he did not remove the clothing. I do accept however, that he did not carry out his intention to have sexual intercourse. The paroxysm of violence had ended and the realisation that he had gotten himself into serious trouble was taking its place. But he did leave her, alone in the park, collapsed on the grass naked from the waist down and obviously badly hurt. He simply took himself home – taking the victim’s two handbags with him. These bags he later threw into an industrial waste bin not far from his own house”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 There are obvious similarities between the killing of Margaret Smyth and the killing of Donna Wheeler. There are also some differences. One difference is that the prisoner was convicted, not of the murder, but only of the manslaughter of Margaret Smyth and the Crown must be taken, by its acceptance of the plea of guilty to manslaughter, to have accepted that the prisoner did not intend to kill Margaret Smyth or to inflict really serious bodily injury on her. 
     
      
    51 The prisoner was not released immediately after the minimum term of his converted sentence expired. He was, however, released on parole on 6 February 1998. He was on parole for the offences committed by him against Margaret Smyth at the time he committed the present offence of murder and this is an important circumstance of aggravation. After the prisoner was arrested for the present offence, his parole was revoked and his sentence for the offences committed against Margaret Smyth did not expire until 30 June 2000. 
     
      
    52 I note that I have received a victim impact statement from Mrs Carol Ann Wheeler, Donna Wheeler’s mother.  
     
      
    53 Under s19A of the Crimes Act the maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life but s 19A does not affect the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which authorises the imposing of a lesser sentence, that is a sentence for a specified term.  
     
      
    54 Under s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the Court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person convicted of murder, if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.  
     
      
    55 In R v Harris (2000) NSW CCA 469 the Court of Criminal Appeal held that under s 61(1) the assessment of the level of culpability has to be directed to “the circumstances surrounding or causally connected with the offence” (par 60).  
     
      
    56 In R v Harris the Chief Judge at Common Law, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not at all clear to me that the assessment whether the case falls within ‘the worst case category’ at common law is any different from that postulated in s 61(1)”. (par 87) 
        
       
      
    57 The Chief Judge went on to say that “the decision in Veen (No 2) (1987) 164 CLR 465 permits reference at common law to background material for the purpose of assessing moral culpability and dangerous propensity”. 
     
      
    58 In his submissions in the proceedings on sentence senior counsel for the Crown submitted that it would be open to me to impose a life sentence but that I could properly impose a lesser sentence, provided that it was a very substantial sentence. Counsel for the Crown said that the Crown accepted that the offence was un-premeditated. The Crown submitted that I should find that the offence had been committed by the prisoner in an explosive outburst of violence, like the offence of manslaughter committed by the prisoner against Margaret Smyth. Counsel for the Crown said that the absence of premeditation might have the effect of removing the case from the worst category of cases at common law and from the category of cases within s 61(1) where the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme as to require the imposition of the maximum penalty.  
     
      
    59 The Crown accepted that the prisoner had not gone to the victim’s house armed with the knife which he used to stab the victim but had obtained a knife from within the victim’s home during the explosive outburst of violence.  
     
      
    60 The Crown submitted that principles stated by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No.2) at 477 were applicable to the present case. At p 477 Mason CJ, Brennan J, Dawson J and Toohey J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The first principle is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences… The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.” 
        
       
      
    61 It was submitted by senior counsel for the prisoner that both at common law and under s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the focus is on the level of culpability in the commission of the offence. It was contended that there were a number of reasons why the present offence, grave though it was, should not require a life sentence. These reasons were:- 
     
      
       
      (i) Unlike a number of notorious other cases, the prisoner was being sentenced for the murder of a single victim. 
       
       
      (ii) There had not been any enduring hostility by the prisoner against the victim. 
       
       
      (iii) No motive had been shown. 
       
       
      (iv) The offence had been unpremeditated and unplanned. 
       
       
      (v) The prisoner had not armed himself in advance of committing the offence. 
       
       
      (vi) The prisoner had not committed any other connected offence. 
       
       
      (vii) Unlike some other notorious cases, the victim had not been subjected to a prolonged ordeal. 
       
      
    62 Reference was made by counsel for the prisoner to the prisoner having been intoxicated. I accept that the prisoner had drunk a considerable amount of alcohol on 2 November. However, he was accustomed to heavy drinking, any intoxication was self induced and he knew that he had attacked Margaret Smyth after he had been drinking. 
     
      
    63 Counsel for the prisoner accepted that the decision of the High Court in Veen (No 2) was relevant but he submitted that Veen had been sentenced at a time when release on licence was permitted, that the decision of the High Court in Veen (No 2) does not authorise the imposition of a sentence disproportionate to the offence for which the prisoner is being sentenced, that the commission by the prisoner of two offences twelve years apart on Margaret Smyth and Donna Wheeler did not show that the prisoner had a syndrome of violently attacking females and that it must be borne in mind that the previous offence of which the prisoner had been convicted was an offence of manslaughter and the Crown had accepted that the prisoner had not had the intent required for murder.  
     
      
    64 Senior counsel for the prisoner suggested that a sentence in the order of twenty-eight years with a non-parole period of twenty-one years would be an appropriate sort of sentence.  
     
      
    65 In reply counsel for the Crown submitted that, if a determinate sentence was imposed, the non-parole period should be longer than twenty-one years. 
     
      
    66 After considering the submissions made by counsel, I have reached the conclusion that I should not impose a life sentence. I consider that the circumstances referred to by counsel, including, particularly but not exclusively, the absence of any premeditation or planning on the part of the prisoner, require the conclusion that the present case, although grave, is not one of the limited number of cases of murder which fall within the worst category of cases of murder or in which the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that a life sentence is required.  
     
      
    67 On the other hand, the objective facts of the commission of the offence require the imposition of a long determinate sentence. A circumstance of aggravation is that the prisoner was on parole for the offences committed against Margaret Smyth at the time of murdering Donna Wheeler.  
     
      
    68 Subject to the limitations stated by the High Court in the passage from Veen (No 2) which I have quoted and keeping in mind the submissions made by counsel for the prisoner including that the previous offence committed against Margaret Smyth was an offence of manslaughter and not of murder, I consider that the previous offence committed against Margaret Smyth does show that the offence committed against Donna Wheeler was not an uncharacteristic aberration, that it illuminates the moral culpability of the prisoner, that it shows a dangerous propensity on his part and the need to impose condign punishment. 
     
      
    69 There is almost a complete lack of any subjective circumstances which might have attracted some leniency. The prisoner stood trial and did not plead guilty. He has not shown any contrition. There is no material on which I could find that he has any prospects of rehabilitation. Apart from the offences committed against Margaret Smyth, he has an extensive criminal history. There is no material on which I could make a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    70 I consider that a determinate sentence somewhat longer than that suggested by the prisoner’s counsel is required. I realise that the prisoner may die in custody before he completes serving a sentence of the length I intend to impose.  
     
      
    71 The sentence will commence from 30 June 2000, from which date the prisoner’s custody has been exclusively referable to this offence. The non-parole period will be more than three quarters of the total term of the sentence and represents a period which I consider the prisoner should have to serve in custody before being eligible to be released. 
     
      
    72 Mr Bond, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for thirty years commencing on 30 June 2000. I set a non-parole period of twenty-five years, commencing on 30 June 2000 and expiring on 29 June 2025. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 30 June 2025.

     Regina (Cth) v Craig Andrew Macgregor 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1     HIDDEN J: The applicant, Craig Andrew Macgregor, was committed for sentence to the District Court upon four charges: firstly, attempting to possess a prohibited import, being a quantity of ecstasy in excess of the commercial quantity; secondly, possessing a prohibited import, again being ecstasy; thirdly, supplying ecstasy, relying upon the deeming provision in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and fourthly, possessing property, being a sum of money reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime, an offence under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1987 (Cth). 
     
      
       
      
    2     On the first offence of attempting to possess a prohibited import, he was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of six years, to date from 21 October 1999. Sentences were passed in respect of the other three offences, but I need say no more about them because this application relates only to the sentence passed on that first charge. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The facts of all the offences are adequately summarised in the remarks of the learned sentencing judge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         On 21 October 1999 a German-national, Yougan Veith, flew into Sydney on Qantas flight QF30 from Bali. On his arrival he was searched by Australian Customs Officers who located packages of ecstasy strapped to his thighs. The amount of ecstasy carried by Mr Veith was some 8,000 tablets which, on analysis, amounted to a total of 2,306.9 grams which was equivalent to 657.3 grams of the pure drug. At the time of his arrest he offered his assistance to the police, and agreed to make a telephone call to his contact in Bali, and then to deliver the ecstasy to whoever was going to pick it up in Sydney. 
         
        
        
         
         The Australian Federal Police substituted the ecstasy with an inert substance, and a controlled delivery sample of 20.2 grams was inserted into the substitution. The controlled delivery was conducted at the room occupied by Mr Veith at the Furama Central Hotel at Surry Hills. 
         
        
        
         
         About 6.54pm on that day, the prisoner, Craig MacGregor, attended Mr Veith’s room at the Furama Hotel and collected a black bag containing the substituted ecstasy. He gave $1000 to Veith in exchange for the ecstasy, and said that he would arrange for the additional moneys to be paid to Veith the following day. 
         
        
        
         
         The prisoner then left the Furama Hotel with the black bag containing the substituted ecstasy, entered a motor vehicle and travelled to the suburb of Mosman. Whilst the prisoner was driving his motor vehicle he was observed by following police to open and look into the bag which he had taken from Mr Veith. About 7.15pm the police stopped the vehicle and arrested the prisoner. The police found the black bag containing the substituted ecstasy on the back seat, and on inspection of that bag observed that one of the bags containing the substituted ecstasy had been opened. 
         
        
        
         
         The prisoner was taken back to the Australian Federal Police Sydney Headquarters, and following legal advice declined to participate in a record of interview. Some time later police searched the prisoner’s motor vehicle and found a bag in the rear of the vehicle containing an amount of $67,750, and small amounts of narcotic substances, including ecstasy. 
         
        
        
         
         On 23 October, the Australian Federal Police attended the prisoner’s premises at Flat 5, 136 Brook Street, Coogee, where a search of the premises was conducted. At that time the police found a red drink container containing thirty-two ecstasy tablets. The total weight of the ecstasy found in the later search of the vehicle, and the ecstasy tablets found at the flat, was 2.16 grams. 
         
        
       
      
    4     The pure ecstasy involved in the major offence was 657.3gm, the commercial quantity being 500gm. 
     
      
       
      
    5     Her Honour found that the applicant was motivated by financial gain and was not a user of the drug. She described his role as that of ""a collector of the drugs illegally imported into Australia"" and indicated that she would sentence him upon the principles applicable to couriers. 
     
      
       
      
    6     Her Honour took into account that the pleas of guilty to all offences were offered at the earliest opportunity. She noted that he was twenty-three years old at the time of the offences. He is now twenty-five. She noted also that he had no prior convictions and that he was able to produce an impressive body of character evidence. Her Honour's conclusion was that, apart from his involvement in these offences, he appeared to be a well respected member of the community. Her Honour noted also that, since being in custody, he had made significant efforts towards rehabilitation and she considered his prospects of rehabilitation to be good. 
     
      
       
      
    7     The application in relation to the sentence passed on the major charge is put on two bases. Firstly, it is said that the sentence is manifestly excessive. Secondly, it is said that there is unwarranted disparity with a sentence passed upon the man Veith, such as to engender in the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance. In my view, there is substance in both of these complaints. 
     
      
       
      
    8     The Crown Prosecutor in this court has provided us with a helpful summary of a number of decisions of this Court dealing with the importation of ecstasy. I mention only a few of them: R v Camus [1999] NSWCCA 425; R v Bigic [2000] NSWCCA 9; R v Bowers (1997) 97 ACrim R 461; and R v Budiman (1998) 102 ACrim R 411. These were cases where sentences more or less of the order of that passed upon this applicant were passed, but in circumstances where the criminality of the persons concerned was greater. For example, in the cases of Camus and Bigic the offenders were seen as higher in the hierarchy of criminality than this present applicant. In Budiman a sentence was imposed somewhat less than that passed upon this applicant, but he did not have the benefit of a plea of guilty. 
     
      
       
      
    9     In any event, Mr Odgers SC, who appears for the applicant, took us to the recent guideline judgment in R v Wong and Nguyen (1999) 108 ACrim R 531. That, of course, was a case dealing with patterns of sentence for the importation of heroin and cocaine, and in respect of low range commercial quantities of those drugs the range propounded was between eight and twelve years: see the judgment of the Chief Justice at par 142. That range encompassed sentences imposed both after pleas of guilty and pleas of not guilty. In addition, it was dealing with drugs of a different order from that with which we are here concerned.  
     
      
       
      
    10     There have been a number of decisions of this Court which have classified ecstasy as a middle range drug, in contrast to the higher range occupied by heroin and cocaine. It is sufficient to refer to a recent statement to that effect to be found in a judgment of Simpson J in Bigic at pars 14 and 16. 
     
      
       
      
    11     When one has regard to those matters, the sentence of nine years passed upon this applicant does appear to be excessive. However, his entitlement to intervention is put beyond doubt by the sentence passed upon the man Veith. Mr Veith was sentenced by another District Court judge during the period when the judge in the present case had reserved her decision, and it does appear that the sentence passed upon Mr Veith was not brought to her attention before she sentenced the present applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Mr Veith pleaded guilty to the present charge, together with another charge of the importation of ecstasy, itself quite a serious charge, almost of the order of the present charge. The learned sentencing judge in his case took the view that both charges on their face called for concurrent sentences of eight years with a non-parole period of four years and ten months. However, he reduced that term by fifty per cent because of the significant assistance to the authorities which Mr Veith had undoubtedly afforded. 
     
      
       
      
    13     There are some distinctions between the two men. An obvious one is the fact that the applicant faced sentence for three other charges. Mr Veith faced sentence for one other. However, when one looks at the relative seriousness of the other charges which the applicant faced and the other charge of importation which Mr Veith faced, that does not appear to me to provide any proper basis for the distinction between them. Their subjective cases were broadly similar. 
     
      
       
      
    14     In my view, it is fair to say that the applicant would entertain a justifiable sense of grievance, being subject to a sentence greater than that which the other sentencing judge considered the appropriate starting point in respect of Mr Veith. For these reasons I am satisfied that the Court should intervene. 
     
      
       
      
    15     The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal be allowed, and that the applicant be re-sentenced on the major charge to imprisonment for eight years, to date from 21 October 1999, with a non-parole period of 5 years.

      JUDGMENT 
       
     
     
      
       
      
    1    DOWD J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on the applicant, James Nguyen, also known as Sang Duc Nguyen, who had entered a plea of guilty before Gibson DCJ at the Penrith District Court on 15 October 1999, to a charge under s25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, for supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, being heroin. The maximum penalty is twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2    On 15 October 1999, the applicant was sentenced to six years imprisonment, to be served by way of a minimum term of four and a half years to commence on 14 January 1999, being the date that he was arrested, and to expire on 13 July 2003. An additional term of eighteen months was imposed to commence on 14 July 2003, upon which date the applicant would be eligible to apply for parole. 
     
      
    3    The facts are that on 14 January 1999, as the applicant and his wife, Loan Phuong Luong, were travelling from Melbourne to Sydney in a hired car, they were stopped by police on the Hume Highway at Bowna. At the time, the applicant was driving and his wife was a passenger. 
     
      
    4    A police officer carried out a breathalyser test on the applicant, and asked him where they had been travelling from. When spoken to, both the applicant and his wife appeared nervous. The police then asked to view a few items contained in the vehicle, whereupon the applicant produced to the police a lady’s handbag which contained a large amount of money. The applicant informed the police that there was some $12,000 in the bag. 
     
      
    5    At the time, the police noticed that part of the rear floor carpet in the vehicle was not fitted correctly. The police then found a set of electronic scales inside the lady’s handbag. 
     
      
    6    Both the applicant and his wife left the car and began speaking to each other in a foreign language unknown to the police. They were soon separated from one another, and further police were summoned to the location. 
     
      
    7    A short time later, the hire car was searched by police in the presence of both the applicant and his wife. The police lifted the rear seat of the vehicle, and located a plastic bag. Inside the bag, the police located a rectangular yellow-coloured block substance. The police also found a potato chip bag that contained several blocks of a light, white rock substance, wrapped in clear plastic bags. 
     
      
    8    Both the applicant and his wife were placed under arrest, and were taken to the Albury Police Station, as was the vehicle in which they were travelling. 
     
      
    9    The police removed the white rock substances from the chip packet at the police station and saw that there were thirteen packages. A field test was then conducted by police on one of the packages, and it was found to produce an immediate reaction. The thirteen white packages and the yellow block package were then weighed and sealed in drug bags. Police also located the money in the vehicle and found that it totalled $13,006. 
     
      
    10    The applicant was later interviewed regarding the items that were located in the vehicle, a Vietnamese interpreter being present. The applicant denied having any knowledge of the yellow rectangular package or the thirteen white block packages that the police had located in the vehicle. However, he indicated his intention to plead guilty shortly after his arrest. 
     
      
    11    During the interview, the applicant stated that he had won the $13,000 in the Melbourne Casino prior to travelling to Sydney. Although he was unable to remember how much money he had actually won at the casino, he nevertheless claimed that the $13,000 was the remainder of such winnings. The applicant was later charged. 
     
      
    12    The gross weight of the drugs that were seized from the vehicle totalled 727 grams, averaging 77.25 percent purity, with a street value of $218,000. 
     
      
    13    At the sentencing hearing, Gibson DCJ, although taking into account the fact that the applicant had no prior convictions, said that the authorities seemed to suggest that this factor would not play as much weight in crimes such as that which the applicant was claiming, as it would in other matters. However, it was still a matter that His Honour said that he would take into consideration. 
     
      
    14    His Honour found that the applicant was addicted to gambling. Evidence led in the trial showed that the applicant spent a considerable amount of time at the Casino, and that from time to time he received large amounts of money by cashing in his chips at the Casino. The evidence showed that on the day the applicant left to travel to Sydney, he had cashed in chips worth $27,000, that he had given his wife $12,000, and that he had lost the remaining $15,000 before leaving the Casino. 
     
      
    15    His Honour accepted both that the applicant came from a law abiding family, and that the applicant acknowledged that his actions caused his wife problems in being separated from her newly born child. It was accepted that special circumstances arose in the wife's case which justified the manner in which her sentence was structured. 
     
      
    16    His Honour, at pages 3 and 4 of the Remarks on Sentence, 15 October 1999, went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I also accept on the evidence that I think that she was somewhat influenced by her husband in relation to the actions that she took, but notwithstanding all that the prisoner has been convicted of a serious offence. It was a substantial amount of heroin. The Courts in this State have indicated quite clearly that people that become involved in the supply of heroin for financial gain to them, and that can be the only reason, whether it was to feed a gambling habit or not, it was for financial gain to him, in my view. And he does not have the excuse, if it be an excuse that he was a user. He was doing it cold-bloodedly and for profit in my view.""  
        
       
      
    17    His Honour, at page 2 of the Remarks on Sentence, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I think in fact there was at least some of his money involved in relation to this amount of heroin that was being transferred from Sydney to Melbourne by him. Exactly how much I am not sure, exactly what part he was playing in relation to it I am not sure, but- and there is no evidence in which I could do, but I am satisfied that he was not merely a courier and I proceed on that basis that he had, as I say, money involved.""  
        
       
      
     
     
      
    18    Although His Honour did take into account that the applicant's family would be able to give him assistance when he was released from the sentence which he must serve, His Honour found that there was nothing in the case that would indicate that it would be proper to find special circumstances. His Honour accordingly found that there were no special circumstances in terms of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 that then applied. 
     
      
    19    Accordingly, His Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of six years imprisonment, with a minimum term of four and a half years, and an additional term of eighteen months. 
     
      
    20    The applicant submits two grounds of appeal. The first ground was that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was so disparate to the sentence imposed upon Mrs Luong that it gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    21    Counsel for the applicant submitted that although His Honour was entitled to find that the applicant played a greater role in the offence than his wife, the sentences imposed were disproportionate to the difference that is appropriate. In support of this submission, counsel for the applicant relied upon R v Hauser (Unreported, NSWCCA, 11 December 1997, Gleeson CJ, Dunford and Barr JJ). 
     
      
    22    Counsel for the applicant emphasised, particularly in the oral submissions, that this disproportionality in sentences was particularly evident in considering that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity before the Court, whereas his wife ran a trial and was found not to have suffered any remorse for the offence committed. 
     
      
    23    The disparity was put on the basis that the applicant pleaded guilty, where the six year term was, in effect, a notional discount of twenty-five percent, and that the basic term would have been eight years. It was argued that on the basis of the wife’s sentencing, there was a disparity in the sentence of some four and a half years of the total sentence, where she had in fact run a trial and pleaded not guilty. 
     
      
    24    The Crown submitted that the offence of the applicant was objectively very serious, and that it called for a significant punishment. It was put that the sentence imposed on the applicant was not severe, given its objective seriousness. It was pointed out by the Crown that Gibson DCJ clearly rejected the applicant's contention that his wife was not involved and obviously concluded that the applicant was the principle player in the offence. It was further submitted that His Honour noted that although the applicant’s wife was involved, she was however being influenced by the applicant. 
     
      
    25    On this issue, the Crown asserted that it was therefore appropriate that the applicant should receive a heavier sentence, even allowing for the fact that his wife did not plead guilty and he did. In this regard, counsel noted that Mrs Luong was assisted in her attempt to escape conviction by the applicant who testified at her trial that she was not involved in the offence. This version of events was ultimately rejected by the jury. 
     
      
    26    It is implicit in the finding of guilty, that the jury in Mrs Luong’s trial rejected her case. She had gone to trial before the same sentencing judge as the applicant, and the applicant had given evidence for her maintaining that the drugs were his and that she knew nothing about them. 
     
      
    27    In Mrs Luong’s sentencing, His Honour was urged to find that exceptional circumstances existed on the basis that on 22 June 1999, whilst in custody, she had given birth to a child. That child was almost immediately taken from her and she was only able to see the child twice a week. 
     
      
    28    His Honour had refused to find that exceptional circumstances existed, but found, as I have indicated, special circumstances in terms of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act based on the position of Mrs Luong’s children and the loss of both adult members of the household. 
     
      
    29    It was submitted at Mrs Luong’s hearing that she was merely a courier. His Honour however found that the offence was committed for greed, adding that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am not at all sure that it was not the husband's greed and that she was not playing a part, albeit a willing part, to assist him because of their relationship, and I propose to sentence her on that basis. That he was a heavy gambler on the figures that emerged before me was clear, but assist him she did."" 
        
       
       
      
    30    The Crown in Mrs Luong’s trial appealed against the purported inadequacy of this sentence on the basis that the minimum term was manifestly inadequate. However, there was no challenge to the total sentence. The Court, comprising Priestley JA, Foster and Smart AJJ, dismissed the appeal and the sentence stood: R v Luong [2000] NSWCCA 139. 
     
      
    31    The primary submission that there was a significant disparity is, of course, correct. A four and a half year notional variation between the two head sentences is significant. However, it is necessary to look at the factors that His Honour would have weighed, and those which His Honour took into account. In determining whether that disparity is such as to give rise to a sense of injustice, it must be noted that Mrs Luong is unable to speak English; she has been deprived of the company of her child during the usual bonding period; and of course, she had, like the applicant, no previous convictions. 
     
      
    32    Because of the evidence that it was not Mrs Luong, but rather the applicant that gambled, Mrs Luong in fact was clearly playing a significantly lesser role than the applicant. And although there is a disparity between the two sentences, clearly those factors which ultimately went to determine special circumstances were proper factors for His Honour to take into account when fixing the head sentence. The fact that material (facts and subjective factors) were applied in accordance with s5(2) of the Sentencing Act, does not mean that it is not proper to also use those same factors significantly in determining the head sentence, and in fact in most occasions that will be the case. 
     
      
    33    Notwithstanding the disparity between the sentences, it is my view that due to the factors that His Honour found, and the clear difference in circumstances between Mrs Luong and the applicant, that the difference between the sentences is not such as would justify in the applicant’s mind a sense of injustice. Indeed, on the applicant’s own evidence, Mrs Luong did not play as great a role. That lesser role is reflected in the disparity in the sentences. 
     
      
    34    The second ground of appeal is that His Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion, by failing to find any special circumstances on the part of the applicant. 
     
      
    35    In Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 at 449-450 per Hunt CJ at CL, a special circumstance was described as “the need or desirability for the offender to be subjected to an extended period of conditional release subject to supervision on parole”. 
     
      
    36    Although counsel for the applicant asserted that a finding of no special circumstances existed, His Honour however found that the applicant was addicted to gambling. The gambling addiction had played a part in the commission of the offence. His Honour dealt with that circumstance, but not as a special circumstance coming within s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. 
     
      
    37    Obviously there is assistance to be given in the form of appropriate counselling to overcome the gambling problem. There is no reason why that cannot take place both whilst the applicant is in custody as well as during the period of supervision afterwards. 
     
      
    38    It is the factors which impact upon Mrs Luong which are significantly different from the applicant. She had given birth to a child and was obviously separated and depressed. She also did not speak the English language, which can be extremely harsh on anyone in a foreign country who cannot speak the language of the custodial authorities. It was a very harsh matter on her, and it was held to be clearly appropriate in the interests of her family, that her recovery be facilitated. Thus Mrs Luong rightly had a disproportionate long additional term which the Court of Criminal Appeal did not interfere with. 
     
      
    39    In the applicant’s case, there were circumstances about which, in my view, His Honour quite correctly found as not being special circumstances. It cannot be automatic that the first time in custody for a person who had no previous offence, is a special circumstance justifying an enlargement of the additional term. There are going to be certain occasions where the first time in custody can be a special circumstance. There is nothing in this case however that makes it so. 
     
      
    40    In my view, there is nothing in the applicant’s sentence which shows that His Honour erred in not finding special circumstances. This was a very serious offence, involving a very high degree of purity, which places the applicant a lot closer to the source of the heroin than if it were at the street distribution level. 
     
      
    41    In my view, the discount that obviously had been given for the applicant’s relatively early plea means that the sentence is in my view appropriate. Therefore, in terms of disparity between the sentences of Mrs Luong and the applicant, there is no error on this finding. There were no special circumstances, thus I again find no error. I would grant leave, but would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    42    HOWIE J: I agree. Notwithstanding the apparent disparity in the sentences imposed upon the applicant and upon his wife, particularly in light of the applicant's early plea, this Court should not intervene. 
     
      
    43    I agree that the applicant cannot have a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the sentence imposed upon his wife. That sentence not only reflected the culpability between the applicant and his wife, but also the special subjective matters applicable in the wife's case and not applicable to the applicant. 
     
      
    44    His Honour found by the reason of the wife's inability to speak English she would find her prison term more onerous than it would be for other inmates. 
     
      
    45    DOWD J: I agree with His Honour's remarks. The orders will be as I have indicated.
