Cur Adv Vult
 
The accused Koh Aik Siew was tried in the High Court on the following charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`): 
 
You, Koh Aik Siew, are charged that you on or about 29 April 1990, between 8.20pm and 9.06pm in Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 676.8g of diamorphine which was in your possession at the bedroom of premises #03-02, Prince Apartment,
 
 
 
34 Jalan Datoh, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) committed an offence under s 5(a) and punishable under s 33 of the said Act.
 
 
 
 
 The undisputed facts
 
Two officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`), Narcotics Officers Ting Ming Ling (`NO Ting`) and Chan King Onn (`NO Chan`), had been observing the activities of the accused since early January 1990. They had observed the accused driving his car, licence plate number EW321T, to and from Block 79 Lorong Limau (`Block 79`) and had seen it parked at the foot of Prince Apartment at Jalan Datoh (`Prince Apartment`). On 28 April 1990, they observed the accused at flat #07-165 of Block 79.
On 29 April 1990 at about 7pm, NO Ting and NO Chan went to Block 77 Lorong Limau to keep a lookout for the accused`s car. At about 8pm they were joined by NO Ravinder Singh. At 8.20pm, they spotted vehicle EW321T moving towards Block 79 and NO Ting instructed NO Ravinder Singh to proceed to flat #07-165 of Block 79 to keep watch. NO Ting and NO Chan then went to the ground floor of Block 79. At about 8.35pm, NO Ravinder Singh came and told NO Ting and NO Chan that the accused was leaving flat #07-165. The accused was duly arrested when he alighted from the lift. NO Ting seized a key pouch from the right hand of the accused. On being questioned, the accused replied in Hokkien that he had been having a bath at his friend`s flat upstairs. The accused confirmed that vehicle EW321T was his car. NO Ting opened the right side door of vehicle EW321T with one of the keys from the key pouch seized from the accused. A brief search of the car did not turn up anything incriminating.
The three officers then escorted the accused to the lift lobby of Block 79.
NO Chan asked the accused in Hokkien for the unit number of his friend`s flat and the accused replied that it was `#07-165`. The party proceeded to flat #07-165 and NO Ting opened the front door with keys from the key pouch seized from the accused. On entering the flat, NO Ting directed the other two officers to conduct a search but, again, nothing incriminating was found.
At 9pm the officers left the flat with the accused and proceeded to Prince Apartment in the car belonging to the accused. They arrived at Prince Apartment at 9.05pm. The accused, on being questioned, told the officers that he was staying in flat #03-02 and led them to the flat. The accused pointed out a key from the bunch of keys in the key pouch and NO Ting opened the front door of flat #03-02 with this key.
The accused led NO Ting and NO Chan to a bedroom and pointed to a key in the key pouch with which NO Ting opened the bedroom door. After entering the bedroom NO Ting instructed NO Chan to check the wardrobes in the room.
NO Chan recovered four bags from the wardrobe beside the bed: a red travelling bag, a brown travelling bag, an `OG` shopping bag and a dark brown briefcase. There were 17 packages wrapped in newspaper in the brown travelling bag and two similar packages each in the red travelling bag and the `OG` shopping bag. The dark brown briefcase was locked with a combination lock and, on being asked by NO Chan, the accused supplied the numbers to the lock which NO Chan used to open the briefcase. Inside were three plastic packages containing brown granular substances, a daching and some empty plastic bags. The contents of all the packages were later found to be diamorphine. NO Ting recovered from another wardrobe near the television set an electric plastic sealing machine, a weighing scale, an electronic weighing scale, a packet of plastic bags and cash of $8,000 and RM690 and some cheques. Two books were also recovered but these were subsequently returned to the accused`s family.
NO Ting`s superior officer, Senior Narcotics Officer Chow Toong Chee (`SNO Chow`), arrived at the scene at 9.40pm and was briefed by NO Ting who introduced the accused to him. The accused was escorted to the CNB office in Geylang Police Station and arrived at 12.45am. At 2.30am SNO Chow instructed NO Ravinder Singh, NO Peh Beng Kiat (`NO Peh`) and another officer to escort the accused to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for a check-up. The party arrived at the hospital at 2.40am and the accused was examined by the medical officer on duty. They returned to the CNB office at 4.10am.
At about 4.40am, the accused was brought to SNO Chow`s office, a small room in the CNB general office. Another officer, SNO Chew Khai Chow, and an interpreter, Wu Nan Yong (`Wu`), went into the room together with him. The charge was read out to the accused in English by SNO Chow and interpreted by Wu into Hokkien. Wu then informed the accused that trafficking meant the sale and purchase of drugs, that he faced the death penalty if he was convicted, and that under s 17 of the Act he was presumed to be trafficking in the diamorphine because he was in possession of more than two grammes of it. The notice of warning was also read to the accused in English and interpreted in Hokkien, and the accused admitted that he understood it. The accused then gave a cautioned statement in Hokkien under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the CPC`) which was interpreted by Wu and written down in English by SNO Chew (`the cautioned statement`). The statement was: `The heroin was passed on to me by a Malaysian. I kept the heroin with me. That is all.`
 The disputed facts
There were two main disputes on the facts. The first concerned statements allegedly made by the accused to certain CNB officers during the course of the arrest and the seizure of the diamorphine. The second involved statements made to the accused by certain CNB officers at the Geylang Police Station and at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital which allegedly induced the accused to make the cautioned statement.
 Statements made by the accused
The prosecution adduced evidence to show that the accused made certain statements to NO Ting at the flat #07-165 of Block 79. NO Ting gave evidence that, after the search of the flat #07-165 by NOs Chan and Ravinder Singh failed to produce any drugs, he asked the accused whether there were any drugs in Prince Apartment. The accused replied that he wished to co-operate with the government because of his involvement with drugs. The accused asked to be placed under criminal law detention instead of being hanged. He admitted that he had 20lb of heroin at Prince Apartment. NO Ting asked the accused whether anyone else had the keys to the place where he kept the drugs and the accused replied in the negative. This conversation was recorded by NO Ting in his notebook when he returned to the office and was transcribed into his pocket diary a day or two later. NOs Chan and Ravinder Singh gave evidence that NO Ting was talking to the accused while they were searching apartment #07-165.
According to the prosecution, the accused also made certain statements to NO Ting while in the bedroom at Prince Apartment where the diamorphine was recovered. NO Ting and NO Chan gave evidence that, when they first entered the room with the accused, NO Ting asked the accused where the drugs were kept. The accused turned his head towards the wardrobe beside the bed and replied in Hokkien, `On top.` After NO Chan recovered all the diamorphine from the wardrobe, NO Ting asked the accused if he knew how much heroin he had with him. The accused replied that he did not know and that he had obtained it from a Malaysian. NO Ting asked the accused how much he had paid for the heroin and the accused said in Hokkien that he had paid RM5,000 for one pound. NO Ting then asked the accused what he did with the heroin and the accused replied in Hokkien that he disposed of it by selling it. The accused further asked NO Ting if the latter really thought that he (the accused) could consume all the heroin himself. This conversation was recorded by both NOs Ting and Chan after the operation and transcribed into their pocket diaries later.
The accused allegedly had a third conversation with SNO Chow. This took place after SNO Chow arrived at Prince Apartment and the accused was introduced to him by NO Ting. SNO Chow asked the accused what he had and the accused replied that he had over 20lb of heroin. The accused told SNO Chow that he had been very co-operative and he had surrendered the drugs to the officers. The accused further said that he did not want to make things difficult for them and asked SNO Chow to check with the officers whether or not he had been co-operative earlier on. The accused then told SNO Chow that he did not wish to be hanged but would rather face criminal law detention for 12 years. SNO Chow recorded this conversation on a piece of paper and transcribed it in his pocket diary two or three days later. NO Chan also recorded this conversation in the same way. NO Ting gave evidence that he heard this conversation. The accounts given by all three men were substantially similar. SNO Chow also gave evidence that about ten minutes later he asked the accused whether anyone else had the key to the room and the accused replied that no one else had the key.
The accused denied that he had made any of the above statements. He gave evidence that, after the officers had searched flat #07-165 of Block 79, NO Ting questioned him as to where he lived and he replied that he lived in Prince Apartment. NO Ting then asked him to bring the officers there and this was what he did. The accused denied that there was any mention of drugs by the officers or that he made any incriminating statements as alleged by the prosecution.
The accused similarly denied that he showed or indicated to NOs Ting and Chan where the drugs were in his bedroom in Prince Apartment, or that there was a conversation between him and NO Ting in the room after the drugs were recovered. According to the accused, after the drugs were recovered, he was asked by NO Ting to whom the drugs belonged and he replied that he did not know. There were no other questions from NO Ting after this, and he did not make any other statements.
The accused also denied that there was a conversation between him and SNO Chow at Prince Apartment. He said that he was merely introduced to SNO Chow and that SNO Chow did not speak to him at all.
The accused said that he was a moneylender and that his partner in moneylending was one Koh Kim Leng, who resided at flat #07-165 of Block 79 with his wife. He was on very good terms with the Kohs and would go to their flat to sleep, bathe and change his clothes. The accused also rented a bedroom of a flat in Prince Apartment. The accused did the moneylending accounts and kept the account books in this room. On some occasions, Koh Kim Leng would come to the room to look over the accounts.
The accused gave evidence that he did not know anything about how the drugs came to be in his bedroom and that he had not previously opened the top portion of the wardrobe where the drugs were found. He had never seen the travelling bags and the `OG` shopping bag before, and did not know to whom they belonged. He admitted that the briefcase was his but said that he had lent it to a Malaysian friend whom he knew by the nickname of Pui Kiah. When the packages of diamorphine were recovered from the briefcase, he had thought to himself that they must have been put there by Pui Kiah, since he had lent the briefcase to him. The evidence of the accused was that Pui Kiah was a procurer who often came to Singapore with his lady associates and that Pui Kiah kept his girls` passports and bags containing their clothing in the bedroom in Prince Apartment to save hotel expenses. Pui Kiah had borrowed the briefcase from the accused to keep his girls` passports. According to the accused, Pui Kiah would come to the bedroom in the morning when the other occupants of the flat were sleeping to avoid detection, as the accused was not supposed to bring guests to the flat. The accused had duplicated the keys to the main door and the bedroom door of the flat in Prince Apartment and had given them to Pui Kiah. However, the accused did not know Pui Kiah`s full name, surname, address or telephone number. He only knew that Pui Kiah could be found in some eating houses in the Sentosa Complex in Johor Bahru and was known as `Ah Seong` in Malaysia.
The accused gave evidence that he had been staying in hotels from 27 April to 29 April when he was arrested, and this was supported by documentary evidence from the respective hotels. During this period he never went back to Prince Apartment. The accused also claimed that during this period he was paged twice by Pui Kiah and he returned the call to a local telephone number. Pui Kiah told the accused that he was in Singapore. However, the accused admitted in cross-examination that he never mentioned Pui Kiah to any CNB officer on the day he was arrested (29 April) or the day after (30 April).
 Trial-within-a-trial
The defence alleged that there were three acts of inducement which rendered the cautioned statement of the accused inadmissible under s 122(6) of the CPC. As to the first alleged act of inducement, the accused gave evidence that, when he was first brought into the CNB general office from Prince Apartment, some officers came and said that he was in serious trouble and that he had no hope unless he admitted that someone had left the heroin with him. The accused said that he was in a confused state of mind when he heard that and was unable to say who spoke the words or whether they were directed at him. NO Peh, one of the officers in the general office at the material time, denied that the officers said anything among themselves or to the accused.
The second alleged act of inducement was by NO Peh at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The accused claimed that, while he was waiting for the doctor, NO Peh sat beside him and asked him whether he had committed the offence. The accused replied that he had not. NO Peh then told him that if he was found to be in possession of such a large quantity of heroin he could face the death penalty, but that if he said that the heroin had been left with him by a Malaysian he would have a `50/50 chance` of escaping the penalty. NO Peh then spoke to the accused about other matters such as whether he was married and had children. The whole incident was denied by NO Peh who claimed that no such conversation took place. This evidence was corroborated by the evidence of NO Ravinder Singh, who was seated behind the accused during the material time.
The third act of inducement allegedly took place just before the accused made the cautioned statement to SNO Chew. The accused gave evidence that he begged SNO Chew to charge him for possession or to detain him under criminal law detention. SNO Chew did not answer but told the accused to sign and said that the case would be a 50/50 case. The accused made the cautioned statement to SNO Chew after this. The incident was denied by SNO Chew. The interpreter, Wu, also denied that there had been any such incident.
 The decision of the High Court
In his judgment, the trial judge considered the evidence adduced during the voir dire. He stated that an accused who is alleged to have made a cautioned statement needs to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not make it voluntarily for the statement to be rendered inadmissible. He rejected the allegations made by the accused and accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. He thus found that the accused had not discharged his burden of proof and admitted the cautioned statement in evidence.
With all due respect, we must say that the trial judge misdirected himself in considering the evidence adduced during the voir dire, because it is still for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made voluntarily. The trial judge therefore applied the wrong burden of proof, and, as we cannot be at all certain what the result would have been had he proceeded correctly, we must state that the statement was wrongly admitted and must be excluded. Notwithstanding that the statement was wrongly admitted, however, this would not be sufficient ground to justify allowing this appeal if, as was the case here, there was sufficient other evidence to justify the conviction: see Evidence Act (Cap 97) s 169. Here the statement was merely to the effect that a Malaysian had passed the heroin to him and he had kept it with him. This tended to show that he had the drug in his possession.
In this case, having reviewed all the prosecution evidence, the trial judge reasoned that as it was undisputed that only the accused had the keys to the bedroom in Prince Apartment, a rebuttable presumption of possession arose under s 18(1)(c) of the Act, quite independently of the cautioned statement. He then pointed out that when possession was established, a rebuttable presumption of trafficking would arise under s 17(c) of the Act as amended on 15 February 1990. Therefore, when the prosecution closed its case, the prosecution had made out a case which if unrebutted would warrant the conviction of the accused. Accordingly, he called on the accused to enter on his defence.
After examining the defence case, the trial judge observed several shortcomings. He pointed out that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of the accused. The evidence about Pui Kiah was doubtful, as the accused did not satisfactorily explain why he did not tell the officers about Pui Kiah earlier and there was a paucity of information about Pui Kiah. Accordingly, he rejected the evidence on Pui Kiah. He was also not persuaded that the accused did not make the oral statements attributed to him by the CNB officers and which the accused denied making. He therefore found that there was sufficient direct evidence that the diamorphine recovered was in the possession of the accused. Having reviewed the evidence and the proceedings in the High Court, we are in complete agreement with all these findings of the trial judge.
Before us in this court counsel for the appellant confined himself to a simple submission based on the presumption concerning trafficking under the amended s 17 of the Act which came into effect on 15 February 1990. He conceded that the present s 17 when invoked presumes that the offence of trafficking has been constituted, in that both mens rea and actus reus are presumed, but he contended that the presumption can be rebutted by showing the absence of either actus reus or mens rea. Actus reus itself is specifically defined in s 2 of the Act by which `trafficking` means - 
 
 
(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or 
 
(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a)
  
 
 
Accordingly counsel for the appellant contended that in the present case the actus reus had been effectively rebutted. The evidence mainly of the prosecution`s own witnesses showed that between 8.20pm and 8.40pm on the evening in question the appellant was at his friend`s flat #07-165 of Block 79 Lorong Limau, having a bath, a claim which was credible and was not challenged. After 8.40pm he was in fact in the custody of the CNB officers. This being the sequence of the appellant`s movements during that critical period `between 8.20pm and 9.06pm` which was stated in the charge, it was impossible for him to perform any of the several overt acts enumerated in the definition of `trafficking` in s 2 of the Act. There was therefore no actus reus and the presumption under s 17 had been successfully rebutted.
While this appears to be a formidable contention on the face of it, it is no longer valid since the decision of this court in 
Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 511
  In that case, in which the facts were very similar, this court held that the proper interpretation of s 17 which would be in accord with both the intention and the wording of the section is that s 17 presumes the act of possession to be an act in the course of selling, giving, transporting and so on, or offering to do so, and thus the actus reus of possession is presumed to be the actus reus of trafficking. That being so, an accused person presumed to be in possession and to traffic would have to rebut the presumption by adducing satisfactory evidence that he was not in possession for any of the overt acts of trafficking as defined in s 2.
As the act of possession can be presumed to be any of the seven overt acts of trafficking as defined in s 2 of the Act, or an offer to do any of them, this might be unduly burdensome for an accused to show that he was not in possession of the drugs in the course of performing any of these acts. In that case, therefore, the court was of the view that the particulars in the charge with respect to the manner of trafficking should be more specifically stated, and the charge should state which of the several overt acts of trafficking in s 2 the accused was charged with. Following the example in that case, this problem would also have been met in the present case if the words `by offering to sell or distribute` should also appear in the charge immediately after the words `to wit,`. As was stated in 
Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 511
  the Court of Criminal Appeal has the power to amend the charge but this power must be exercised judiciously and the possibility of prejudice must be of utmost concern when this court decides on whether to alter a charge. In the present case, the defence had been one of complete denial of the act of possession. There would therefore be no prejudice occasioned by the proposed amendment of the charge as the defence, if believed, would be a complete answer to the charge (see 
PP v Yeoh Teck Chye
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 176
  ). In the present appeal therefore we direct that the charge be amended accordingly.
The large quantity of drugs having been found in his room, the appellant was presumed under s 18(1)(c) to have possession of the drugs, and by the amended s 17 was presumed to traffic in it, unless the presumption was rebutted, which it was not. In addition, paraphernalia associated with the handling of drugs for sale and distribution were also found in the room. The defence of the appellant that he had no knowledge of the drugs and that they belonged to Pui Kiah, was rejected by the trial judge. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.
Outcome:
