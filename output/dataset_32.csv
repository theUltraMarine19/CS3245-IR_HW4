 Introduction 
The appeal is brought against the decision of Kan Ting Chiu J concerning certain claims against the respondent, Gan Boon Hock (`Gan`), for breach of director`s duties and fraudulent misrepresentation. The appellants, Kea Holdings Pte Ltd (`Kea Holdings`) and Kea Resources Pte Ltd (`Kea Resources`) had brought 16 claims against Gan, pertaining, inter alia, to alleged breach of fiduciary duties owed to Kea Resources by Gan during his time as a managing director of Kea Resources. Gan counterclaimed against Kea Resources for annual wage supplements, various guaranteed bonuses and CPF contributions. The trial judge allowed five of the claims, but dismissed the remainder. He awarded the appellants S$101,536, US$60,000 and Rmb660,000, plus interest on these sums and half their costs. He also allowed the counterclaim and awarded Gan S$42,166.67 and CPF contributions on this amount, plus interest and half his costs to be taxed on the Subordinate Courts scale.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
Kea Holdings are a holding company. The second appellants, Kea Resources, are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kea Holdings, and are in the business of shipbuilding and the sale and purchase of vessels. Gan joined Kea Resources on 15 July 1993 as a general manager and subsequently became the managing director, holding this position up till 21 November 1998. While in this post, he became a shareholder and director of Sinindo Pacific Pte Ltd (`Sinindo`) together with an Indonesian businessman, Teddy Salim Liem (`Teddy Salim`).
On 12 February 1999, the appellants commenced proceedings against Gan comprising 16 claims relating to alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, breach of confidence and fraudulent misrepresentation. The trial judge decided in their favour on five claims. The appellants initially brought this appeal on seven of the claims that had been decided against them. However, the appellants subsequently proceeded on only four of the seven claims during the course of the appeal. These claims are: 
(a) claim arising from purchases by Sinindo Pacific Pte Ltd (Sinindo); 
(b) claim in respect of three barges `Pacific 4`, `Pacific 5` and `Pacific 7`; 
(c) claim arising from the sale of the `Regal 8` to Kea Maritime; and 
(d) claim arising from the sale of the `Orient VI`.
As was pointed out by the trial judge, each claim was founded on its own facts and circumstances. As such, it would be convenient to deal with each claim on its own.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Claim arising from purchases by Sinindo Pacific Pte Ltd
 
Sometime in May 1995, whilst Gan was the managing director of Kea Resources, he became a majority shareholder and director of Sinindo. The other shareholder and director was one Teddy Salim Liem (`Teddy Salim`). The respondent claimed that he had disclosed his involvement in Sinindo to the appellants. However, they said that he only informed them that he was lending his name to Teddy Salim to form a company.
Between mid-1995 and mid-1996, Gan caused Sinindo to purchase five vessels from a company in China, China Jiangsu Machinery & Equipment Import & Export Corporation (`SUMEC`). The appellants claimed that, in doing that, Gan diverted business away from Kea Resources, and caused Kea Resources to suffer a loss of S$1,266,559, which represents profits they would have earned if they had sold the five vessels to Sinindo.
The trial judge held that in his capacity as director of Sinindo, Gan`s duty was to ensure that Sinindo bought the vessels from the best available source. He owed no duty to direct Sinindo`s business to Kea Resources. Kea Resources thus could not assert that, because Gan was also a director of Kea Resources, he should have placed the orders with Kea Resources. The judge therefore felt that nothing turned on the scope of Gan`s disclosure of his involvement with Sinindo to the appellants.
The trial judge further noted that Gan could not make any decisions to buy vessels for Sinindo without consulting Teddy Salim. Teddy Salim had not said in evidence that there was any agreement or understanding between him and Kea Resources that his companies would buy all their vessels from Kea Resources. There was no diversion of business from Kea Resources because there was no basis to suppose that the business would have gone to Kea Resources but for Gan`s intervention. The claim therefore failed.
On appeal, the appellants` main contention was that Gan had accepted a secret commission from SUMEC in return for his procuring Sinindo to purchase the vessels from SUMEC. The appellants tendered evidence purportedly relating to Gan`s receipt of the commission on the purchase of one of these vessels, `SP 2705`, by Sinindo. By doing this, the appellants said that he had placed his own interests above that of Kea Resources and had breached his fiduciary duties to Kea Resources.
Although the issue of the secret commission was not pleaded originally by the appellants, the argument was raised in the court below. In particular, the appellants tendered certain documents which formed the chief evidence in support of this allegation. The first document was a credit advice from the National Commercial Bank Ltd, Hong Kong, to Fuchuen Machinery & Equipment (`Fuchuen`) stating that the sum of US$780,303.40 had been remitted to Fuchuen`s account from DBS Finance Ltd, who are Sinindo`s bankers. On this document was a handwritten note stating the name of the vessel, the price of the vessel (US$606,000) and that US$173,303.40 had been credited into Gan`s account (A/c No 163118). The other relevant documents were a letter written in Chinese and its accompanying English translation certifying that, after that sum was remitted to their account, Fuchuen remitted the amount of US$173,303.40 to the respondent`s Citibank account No 163118. Gan, however, denied that the sum of US$173,303.40 had been deposited into his account, though he admitted that he had a Citibank account bearing the number 163118. When asked if he knew why Fuchuen would write the letter if no money had been remitted to him, he said he did not know. Gan refused to give discovery of his Citibank account on the basis that some of the assets in the account belonged to his relatives.
The trial judge did not make any finding as to whether Gan had indeed received the sum of US$173,303.40. Instead, as stated above, the decision was based on two reasons. First, that Gan had no duty to direct Sinindo`s business to Kea Resources and secondly, the fact that there was no diversion of business in this case as it had not been shown that Gan`s intervention had led to the series of events.
Now, the documents purportedly evidencing the fact that Gan had received a secret commission from SUMEC for procuring Sinindo to purchase the vessels, in particular, `SP 2705`, from SUMEC, were made by Fuchuen. The appellants explained that this was due to the fact that Fuchuen was the provider of letter of credit facilities for buyer companies like SUMEC. However, it was clear that the maker of these documents was not called upon by the appellants to give evidence. Instead, the appellants produced a witness, one Mr Yu Tian Lu, who was the manager of Zhejiang Machinery & Equipment Import & Export Corporation (ZMEC), as the representative of Fuchuen. He claimed to be authorised to give evidence on Fuchuen`s behalf by virtue of a letter from Fuchuen authorising him to be their witness.
In the circumstances, the documents purporting to evidence the payment of the secret commission by SUMEC to Gan amount to hearsay and are inadmissible as evidence. Counsel for the appellants pointed out to us that the authenticity of the documents had been admitted by Gan. However, such an agreement does not mean that Gan could not dispute the truth of the statements. It is this aspect of the documents that the hearsay principles apply to. The information in the documents were assertions of the fact that Gan had received a secret commission for the sale of `SP 2705`. In our view, this is a case where it would be highly unsafe to rely on the contents of these documents to prove the facts contained therein as the maker was not present in court. Counsel for Gan had no opportunity to cross-examine the maker and test the veracity of the assertions in the documents.
The presence of Mr Yu Tian Lu as Fuchuen`s representative and the fact that he may have had authorisation from Fuchuen to give evidence could not detract from the fact that the statements were hearsay. In any event, he did not claim to have any first-hand knowledge of the transaction between SUMEC, Fuchuen and Gan and said that he personally had nothing to do with Fuchuen himself. Furthermore, he did not even give any evidence, as the representative of Fuchuen, that Fuchuen had paid the secret commission to Gan. We also noted that apart from the letter of authorisation, there was apparently no other evidence that Mr Yu was indeed authorised to give evidence on behalf of Fuchuen. Quite apart from those concerns, no one from SUMEC was called to give evidence on the payment of the secret commission as well. That would have been the clearest evidence that Gan had indeed entered into such a transaction. Instead, the only reference to these documents was made by Mr Goh Siew Hua, the Group Accountant of Kea Holdings. However, he clearly had no first-hand or personal knowledge of whether the secret commission was in fact paid to Gan.
As for Gan`s refusal under cross-examination to produce details of his Citibank account into which the secret commission had purportedly been paid, we did not think that his behaviour was sufficient for the court to draw an adverse inference that he had indeed received the money. He consistently denied having received the secret commission and said that he did not know why Fuchuen would have written the letter certifying that they had paid the sum of US$173,303.40 to him. While it may have been the case that producing the details would have put an end once and for all to the issue of whether the money had been paid into his account, it was nevertheless still the obligation of the appellants, as the plaintiffs, to prove their case against Gan. As the documents purportedly evidencing the payment of the secret commission should have been excluded as hearsay, the appellants had no other evidence to establish their claim that Gan had received a secret commission from SUMEC in respect of the purchase of `SP 2705` by Sinindo. In our judgment therefore, the appellants had not successfully proved that Fuchuen had paid a secret commission, on behalf of SUMEC, to Gan.
On this basis, we reject the appellants` claim that Gan had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties vis-.-vis Kea Resources. The appellants submitted that if Gan had received the secret commission, he would have been in a situation whereby his interests and that of Kea Resources would clash. In connection with this, the appellants cited 
Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley
 
[1972] 2 All ER 162
 to counter Gan`s argument that Sinindo would not have purchased the vessels from Kea Resources anyway. The appellants said that, applying 
 Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley 
, Gan would nonetheless still be liable to Kea Resources for damages arising out of his breach of duty.
 In Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley 
, the defendant, Cooley was the managing director of the plaintiff company. The company was interested in obtaining certain contracts from the Eastern Gas Board but the Board was not satisfied with its set-up and refused to award the contract to it. The Gas Board then approached Cooley personally and invited him to be their project manager. Cooley resigned from the company and accepted the Gas Board`s position. The company brought an action against Cooley for account of profits. Cooley argued that he had not breached the duty because the Gas Board would not have awarded the plaintiffs the contracts in any event. This argument failed. Roskill J (at p 175) said: 
 
... It is said: `Well, even if there were that conflict of duty and interest, nonetheless, this was a contract with a third party in which the plaintiffs never could have had any interest because they would have never got it. That argument has been forcefully put before me by counsel for the defendant.
 
 
 
The remarkable position then arises that if one applies the equitable doctrine on which the plaintiffs rely to oblige the defendant to account, they will receive a benefit which on Mr Smetton`s evidence at least it is unlikely that they would ever have got for themselves had the defendant complied with his duty to them. On the other hand, if the defendant is not required to account he will have made a large profit as a result of having deliberately put himself into a position in which his duty to the plaintiffs who were employing him and his personal interest conflicted ...
 
 
 
If one looks at the way the cases have gone over the centuries it is plain that the question whether or not the benefit would have been obtained but for the breach of trust has always been treated as irrelevant ...
 
 
 
The appellants also relied on 
Hytech Builders Pte Ltd v Tan Eng Leong & Anor
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 795
 . In this case, the plaintiff company claimed declarations that the defendants were trustees of profits made by the second defendants, a company substantially owned and controlled by the first defendants, from a construction contract known as `Contract 220`, and for an account of profits. The first defendant was a director of the plaintiff company at all times. Contract 220 had been awarded by tender to `Kung Sing`, a Taiwanese company, the second defendants, and `HLS`, a Singapore company. Kung Sing had originally approached the plaintiff company with a view to a joint tender for the project. However, the plaintiff company did not qualify to tender for the project, so the board of directors had decided to tender for the contract in the name of a joint venture company, Sinbelco, in which the plaintiff company held a 50% stake, and which did qualify to tender. The plaintiff company`s board of directors had appointed the plaintiff to manage the tender project, but the first defendant instead tendered for the project using the second defendant`s name.
Warren LH Khoo J allowed the plaintiff`s claim. He held that as a director of the plaintiffs, the first defendant owed a fiduciary duty to them not to divert the business opportunity for his own profit. He acted in breach of that duty when he procured the second defendants to tender for the contract. This was so even though the first defendants did not qualify to tender for the project.
Also relevant is s 157 of the Companies Act (Cap 50), which is a statutory statement of a director`s duties under Singapore law. The provision states:
 
 
As to the duty and liability of officers.
 
 
 
157
 
(1)
 
A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.An officer or agent of a company shall not make improper use of any information acquired by virtue of his position as an officer or agent of the company to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself or for any other person or to cause detriment to the company.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)
 
 
 
 
(3)
 
An officer or agent who commits a breach of any of the provisions of this section shall be -
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
liable to the company for any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the company as a result of the breach of any of those provisions; and
 
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.
 
 
 
 
(4)
 
This section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other written law or rule of law relating to the duty or liability of directors or officers of a company.
 
 
 
 
(5)
 
In this section -
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
`officer` includes a person who at any time has been an officer of the company;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
`agent` includes a banker, solicitor or auditor of the company and any person who at any time has been a banker, solicitor or auditor of the company.
 
 
 
 
Under s 157(4), the duties under s 157(1) are specifically stated not to be in derogation of any other rule of law relating to the duty or liability of directors or officers of a company, including the common law and equitable rules. There are two principles of conduct of relevance to the present case. First, that a director must act in what he honestly considers to be the company`s interest, and not in the interests of some other person or body. Secondly, the equitable rule that a fiduciary must not place himself in a position where his duty to the company and his personal interests may conflict.
In this case, the appellants alleged that Gan should have channelled the sale of the barges from SUMEC to Sinindo through Kea Resources so that Kea Resources could have earned a profit on them. The trial judge held that there was no such duty on him to do this. His duty was to obtain the best prices for Sinindo.
We agreed with this conclusion. We have decided that the appellants had not proved their allegation that Gan had received a secret commission relating to Sinindo`s purchase of `SP 2705` from SUMEC. As such, no conflict of interests arose between his personal benefit and that of Kea Resources. The facts of this case were different from the cases of 
 Cooley 
 and 
 Hytech 
 relied on by the appellants. In those cases, the defendants had acquired information as directors of the plaintiff companies and had earned a personal profit from the information. The court therefore ordered that the directors had to account for the profits made. The situation was different in this case. Here, the appellants failed to show that Gan had earned a secret commission from the sale of the vessel. The claim was thus correctly dismissed by the trial judge.
 Claim in respect of the barges `Pacific 4`, `Pacific 5` and `Pacific 7` 
 
 
 
Some time prior to 1996, before Gan joined Kea Resources, Kea Resources had ordered three barges from ZMEC. Gan subsequently suggested to the Chairman of Kea Resources, Mr Kea Meng Cheng, that the orders for the barges be cancelled because there were no buyers for the barges and also to avoid paying the export duty of 5% which would be imposed on the purchase. Mr Kea Meng Cheng agreed and the orders were cancelled on 22 August 1996, which led to Kea Resources forfeiting the deposits paid on each barge totalling US$77,610.
In the court below, the appellants alleged that Gan had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to Kea Resources because he knew that Sinindo was looking for barges at about the same time as the orders were cancelled, yet he recommended the cancellation. In this sense, this particular head of claim was connected to the issue above relating to the alleged diversion of business from the appellants to SUMEC. The appellants thus claimed the forfeited deposit from Gan.
The trial judge stated that the gravamen of the complaint was that Gan had acted improperly by causing Sinindo to buy three barges from SUMEC when Kea Resources had three barges available and awaiting collection from ZMEC. However, Gan had a duty to see that the orders placed by Sinindo were in the best interests of Sinindo. Gan owed no duty to Kea Resources to place the orders with them. The trial judge went on to say that in any event, there was no evidence that the barges from ZMEC and those ordered by Sinindo from SUMEC were interchangeable. Also, the trial judge added at [para ] 20 of his judgment that: 
 
... even if the defendant breached his fiduciary duty to Kea Resources in 1995 when Sinindo placed the orders with SUMEC, there is a leap in logic to conclude that he is accountable for the lost deposit payments following the cancellation of the orders from ZMEC in 1996, because Kea Resources did not order the three barges with the knowledge that Sinindo would be on the market for barges, and did not cancel the orders because Sinindo did not buy those barges from it.
 
 
 
The appellants submitted that in fact the three barges ordered from ZMEC were all of the same length, ie 270 feet, as those which were ordered from SUMEC. They said that the length of the vessel is the most important dimension in relation to a barge, whereas the width and height are of less importance to the purchaser. The vessels should therefore be treated as interchangeable. Further, they asserted that Kea Resources could have offered Sinindo similar terms for the three barges as Sinindo had paid to SUMEC.
Gan, on the other hand, contended that there was no evidence that the barges were identical, or interchangeable. The only available information was that the barges were of the same length, which is not the same as saying that they were interchangeable. Further, the appellants failed to prove that Gan was in control of Sinindo such that only he could have caused Sinindo to purchase vessels from SUMEC rather than from Kea Resources. It was Teddy Salim who was in fact controlling Sinindo.
Clearly, Gan was obliged both by his statutory duty under s 157(1) of the Companies Act and the general equitable principles governing the duties of fiduciaries to act in the best interests of Kea Resources. As stated above, this also encompasses a duty not to place himself in a position where his duty to Kea Resources and his own interests are in conflict. However, this does not mean that Gan was precluded from holding directorships in two companies. In 
Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians
 
[1963] 2 QB 606
, Upjohn LJ, as he then was, said in reference to the relationship between the `no conflict of interests` rule and directors who hold posts in more than one company that: 
 
Directors ... may sometimes be placed in a position that, though their interest and duty conflict, they can properly and honestly give their services to both sides and serve two masters to the great advantage of both. If the person entitled to the benefit of the rule is content with that position and understands what are his rights in the matter, there is no reason why he should not relax the rule. ... To sum up the position, it is clear that the person entitled to the benefit of this positive rule is the person who is protected by it, but he, and he alone, can in proper circumstances relax it ... It cannot be used as a shield by the person owing the duty
 
 
 
In other words, as long as the fact of this is disclosed to the company and approved, the holding of cross-directorships is not 
 per se 
 a breach of duty. In this case, the appellants knew that Gan was a director of Sinindo. However, this does not mean that Gan could then subordinate the interests of Kea Resources to Sinindo in a situation where their interests were in conflict.
In determining whether Gan had acted in breach of his duties to Kea Resources, we note that, although the facts of this claim were related to the claim above for diversion of business, the thrust of the claim was somewhat different. In this case, the complaint was that Gan did not tell Kea Resources that there was a willing buyer for the three barges in question in the form of Sinindo.
While we agree with the trial judge that Gan was under no duty to ensure that all orders from Sinindo should be placed with either one of the appellants, it is our view that the crucial fact in respect of this claim was Gan`s material misrepresentation which led to the forfeit of the deposit for the barges. This case was unlike the situation above where Gan made a decision not to procure Sinindo to purchase the vessels from the appellants. Here, Gan had misled the appellants, in particular Kea Resources, into believing that there was no buyer in the market when in fact Sinindo was interested in purchasing similar vessels. By doing so, he was not acting in the best interests of Kea Resources. As such, it was a breach of Gan`s duty to Kea Resources to act honestly in discharge of his duties as required by s 157 of the Companies Act. The forfeiture of the deposit was a real and proximate loss to Kea Resources caused by the respondent`s breach of duty and we order that Gan compensate Kea Resources for the loss of the deposits amounting to US$77,610.
 Claim arising from the sale of the `Regal 8` to Kea Maritime 
 
 
 
In November 1995, the vessel `Regal 8` was sold by Kea Maritime Pte Ltd (`Kea Maritime`), a company which is part of the same group as the appellants but was not a party to this action, to Trisakti Utama Shipping Pte Ltd (`Trisakti Utama`), another company in which Teddy Salim was involved. Gan was the managing director of Kea Maritime and owned 20% of its shares, with Kea Holdings owning the other 80%. However, the appellants were interested in the sale because Kea Resources had paid for the construction of the vessel. Payment for the vessel by Trisakti Utama was to be in 48 instalments and title was to be transferred upon the completion of the payments.
The vessel developed mechanical difficulties after it was delivered to Trisakti Utama. A dispute arose over whether the difficulties were caused by equipment failure or by improper maintenance. On 13 February 1997, the vessel sailed back to Singapore, and Kea Resources eventually incurred $338,493.29 for repairs. At that time, the instalment payments were in arrears. Kea Resources took the position that the agreement was terminated from that date, reasserted possession over the vessel, and forfeited the instalment payments made.
In the court below, the appellants had claimed the repair costs from Gan on the basis that he had failed in his fiduciary duties to Kea Resources to ensure that the vesel was properly maintained by the purchaser, and that he had taken the vessel back without the consent of Kea Resources. This claim was dismissed by the trial judge and there was no appeal against this decision.
However, the appellants also brought a related claim in respect of the sale of the `Regal 8` which was also dismissed by the trial judge, which the appellants appealed against. The allegation was that Gan procured two sale agreements of the vessel between Kea Maritime as seller and Trisakti Utama as buyer, which stated different sale prices. The agreement in Kea Maritime`s possession showed the price to be $1.2m, while the agreement in Trisakti Utama`s possession showed the price as $1.3m. Teddy Salim confirmed in evidence that the contract that he signed on behalf of Trisakti Utama was for $1.3m and that the agreement for the lower sum was a forgery.
The trial judge made a finding of fact that the defendant had dishonestly caused there to be two agreements with the intention of retaining the difference of $100,000. However, his scheme did not bear fruit because Trisakti Utama did not complete paying the instalment payments. The undisputed facts were that the instalments were in arrears when the vessel sailed back to Singapore and was subsequently repaired, chartered out, then resold by Kea Resources. Kea Resources had proceeded with the claim on the basis that $1.3m had been paid for the vessel, but this was wrong, and there was therefore no basis for the claim. In any event, any loss in the sale price would be a loss to the sellers, Kea Maritime. Any claim for the $100,000 should therefore have been made by Kea Maritime and not Kea Resources.
The appellants submitted that the trial judge was wrong to assume that the respondent would be enriched by $100,000 only upon full payment of the purchase price by Trisakti Utama. They asserted that the genuine sale agreement stipulating the $1.3m purchase price provided for a $100,000 deposit to be paid. This sum represented Gan`s secret `commission`. The appellants stated that: 
 
When `Regal 8` was repossessed by the second appellants [Kea Resources] and all instalments forfeited by the second appellants, they suffered a loss of S$100,000 being the deposit which they would otherwise have forfeited if not for the respondent`s fraudulent misrepresentation that the price of `Regal 8` was S$1.2m instead of $1.3m. Had the respondent not dishonestly misled the second appellants, the S$100,000 deposit would have gone into the second appellants` account.
 
 
 
Although there is no evidence that the respondent had himself taken the sum of $100,000, the second appellants submit that following the case of 
Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders
 
[1941] 2 All ER 205
, it is sufficient to find that a tort of deceit had been committed by the respondent so long as the second appellants can show that they have suffered a loss. The second appellants have shown at para 175 above that they could not collect and forfeit the said sum due to the respondent`s fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
 
 
In addition, the appellants said that the trial judge was wrong to think that the claim should have been brought by Kea Maritime, and not by Kea Resources. This is because Kea Maritime would pay any sums collected from the sale of the `Regal 8` to Kea Resources without any deductions. Kea Resources were thus the `ultimate beneficiary` under the contract of sale. In this respect, they rely on the English case of 
Ross v Caunters (a firm)
 
[1980] Ch 297
[1979] 3 All ER 580
, a case involving solicitor`s negligence. In their view, that case is authority for the proposition that an action could be maintained against Gan because he was in sufficient `proximity` with Kea Resources, which were the real beneficiaries of the sale contract.
Like the trial judge, we did not disagree with the appellants that Gan had made a false representation of the price offered by Trisakti Utama for the vessel to Kea Maritime through his apparent forgeries of the two different contracts with the intention that Kea Maritime would act upon his fraudulent act. However, the elements of the tort of deceit, as set out in 
Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders
 
[1941] 2 All ER 205
, require more than this. The tort of deceit consists of the wilful making of a false statement with the intent that the plaintiff shall act in reliance upon it and with the result that he does so act and suffers damage in consequence. This damage must be proved by the plaintiff; 
Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal
 
[1979] QB 333
.
It is in relation to the final requirement that the appellants` case failed. Neither Kea Resources nor Kea Maritime had actually suffered damage as a result of Gan`s actions. The appellants` basic point appeared to be that, since the deposit of $100,000 was not received by Kea Maritime, they were entitled to claim it from Gan. The difficulty with this was that there was no evidence that the $100,000 was ever paid to him or anyone else.
Furthermore, it is trite law that the person against whom a tort has been committed must prove that he has suffered actual damage. This proposition was encapsulated by Lord Diplock in 
Albacruz (Cargo Owners) v Albazero (Owners)
 
[1977] AC 774
 where he said the following: 
 
The general rule in English law today as to the measure of damages recoverable for the invasion of a legal right, whether by breach of a contract or by commission of a tort, is that damages are compensatory. Their function is to put the person whose right has been invaded in the same position as if it had been respected so far as the award of a sum of money can do so. Such an award can readily do so in the case of mercantile contracts, since the purpose of the parties in entering into them is to make a money profit. So where the wrong for which suit is brought is the breach of a mercantile contract the measure of damages for the breach is generally the financial loss that the plaintiff has sustained by reason of the defendant`s failure to perform the contract according to its terms.
 
 
 
Thus, even if the appellants successfully proved that Gan had made the fraudulent misrepresentation, they failed to show that neither Kea Resources nor Kea Maritime suffered any loss, or that Gan gained a profit as a result, due to the fact that the transaction fell through for other reasons. There was nothing for Gan to compensate. Under the circumstances, any claim against him must fail and we dismiss the appeal on this issue.
 Claim arising from the sale of the `Orient VI` 
 
 
 
The facts from which this claim arose were somewhat similar to that of the sale of the `Regal 8`. The sale was between Kea Maritime as vendors and PT Ersihan Satya Pratama (`Ersihan`), a company controlled by Teddy Salim, as purchasers. Kea Resources had claimed that they were the owners of the `Orient VI`, and this was admitted by Gan.
Again, there were two sale agreements, one for $685,000 which was in the possession of Ersihan and another for $650,000 in the possession of Kea Maritime. Teddy Salim acknowledged that the correct price was $685,000, that it was paid by Ersihan, and that his signature on the $650,000 was a forgery.
The trial judge accepted Teddy Salim`s evidence that he had handed a cash cheque of $35,000 to Gan as part of the purchase price. This sum was not paid over to Kea Maritime. In this last respect, the evidence differed from the `Regal 8` claim. However, he dismissed this claim on the basis that, although Kea Resources were the owners of the vessel, they were not the vendors. Kea Maritime were the vendors and as such the party entitled to receive payment from the purchasers. The $35,000 was therefore due to Kea Maritime, but who were not the claimants. The trial judge observed that in the sale of an asset the owner is not ipso facto entitled to the proceeds of sale if it is not also the vendor. Where the vendor and the owner are separate parties, prima facie, the vendor is the party entitled to the proceeds. The owner may have a claim to the proceeds, e.g. if the vendor was selling as its agent, but there must be a basis for a claim beyond its ownership. Kea Resources had not established that in its claim.
The appellants argued that the trial judge erred in his view that Kea Resources could not bring the claim. They said that Kea Resources had established a basis for the claim beyond their ownership of the vessel: 
 
The second appellants [Kea Resources] have more than one basis beyond ownership. Other than the fact that the second appellants were the owner, the second appellants were also the `ultimate beneficiary` in the sale of `Orient VI`. The loss of S$35,000 was therefore a loss to and suffered by the second appellants and not Kea Maritime. The trial judge had therefore erred by failing to take into account such evidence.
 
 
 
The second basis is the duty owed by the respondent to the second appellants. Such duty stems from the close and proximate relationship between the respondent and as Managing Director of the second appellants. The respondent as managing director of the second appellants owed it a duty not to cause it to suffer loss. It is foreseeable by any reasonable man that the respondent, being in such a proximate relationship with the second appellants, would foresee that the second appellants would suffer loss as a result of his fraudulent scheme.
 
 
 
The facts of this claim were different from the claim in respect of the `Regal 8` in that, in this case, the trial judge accepted that Gan had been paid $35,000 for the sale, which had not been paid over to Kea Maritime. On appeal, Gan also did not seriously dispute this finding. Kea Maritime was clearly entitled to bring an action for recovery of the $35,000. The difficulty faced by the appellants, however, was that Kea Maritime were not a party to this action. The trial judge accepted that Kea Resources were the owners of the vessel, but held that this was not enough - something `beyond ownership` was required.
As stated above, the elements of the tort of deceit are the wilful making of a false statement with the intent that the plaintiff shall act in reliance upon it and with the result that he does so act and suffers damage in consequence: 
 Bradford Third Equitable Benefit Building Society v Borders 
. It seems to us that the question of who the seller was in determining who the proper party to the suit should be is therefore not as crucial as the trial judge opined. We are unable to agree with the trial judge`s analysis of this issue. The facts show that Gan must have made the fraudulent misrepresentation of the selling price to Kea Maritime as well as Kea Resources. This is because there was a very close relationship between Kea Resources on the one hand, who expended the money and resources to build the vessels and Kea Maritime on the other, who sold these vessels.
The re-re-amended statement of claim gives details of the relationship between Kea Maritime and Kea Resources and these two transactions. The relevant portion of para 32 of the re-re-amended statement of claim reads: 
 
 
32 On or about 15 November 1995, the defendant caused and/or procured the second plaintiffs [Kea Resources] to sell a vessel named `Regal 8` through M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd to Trisakti Utama at the price of S$1,200,000 plus 5% per annum contractual interest charges. The agreement provided that the payment for the vessel `Regal 8` was to be by way of 48 monthly instalments of S$30,000 inclusive of 5% per annum contractual interest charges, totalling S$1,440,000 
 
Particulars 
 
(a) M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd is a company formed on 28 September 1993 to carry on the business of selling vessels on an instalment basis where ownership of the vessels would be transferred to the buyer only upon full payment. This is different from the second plaintiffs` business which is the outright sale of vessels to buyers; 
 
(b) The defendant [Gan] holds 20% of the shares in M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd whilst the balance 80% of the shares is held by the first plaintiffs; 
 
... 
 
(d) The costs of construction of all vessels in China including the vessel `Regal 8` were borne by the second plaintiffs; 
 
(e) All other expenses, costs, disbursements for all vessels including the vessel `Regal 8` were also borne by the second plaintiffs; 
 
(f) The defendant, as a director and managing director of both the Second plaintiffs and M/s Kea Maritime Pte Ltd, knew or ought reasonably to know that all payments in connection with or related to the vessel `Regal 8` were or would be made by the second plaintiffs; 
 
...
  
 
 
Further, it is stated that Kea Maritime would be the legal owner of the vessels until the payment of the instalments was completed by the respective buyers. The amount of proceeds received by Kea Maritime would then be transferred to Kea Resources.
These circumstances show that Gan`s fraudulent misrepresentation must therefore also have been made to Kea Resources. He intended that they would act upon it by entering into the transaction, which they did, and they suffered damage as a result, viz the difference in the selling price that Ersihan paid and the amount of sale proceeds that they actually received. In our view, the trial judge erred in holding that the appellants had to prove something beyond ownership in order to be entitled to claim the proceeds. The facts showed that the elements of the tort that Kea Resources claimed had been perpetuated on them by Gan had been made out. Thus, they were entitled to bring the claim for the $35,000. We thus allow the appeal on this issue.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
Out of the four issues on appeal, we allow the appeal on the second and fourth claims and dismiss the appeals relating to the first and third claims. Gan is thus ordered to pay over the sums of US$77,610 and $35,000 to the appellants. As the appellants are only partially successful, and in particular, lost the first issue which was by far the most hotly-contested claim, we award them one-third the costs in the appeal. We make the usual consequential order for the security deposit to be returned to the appellants or their solicitors.

Order accordingly.",2000-07-03 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

QUEBEC

Criminal law—Uttering a forged
document—Notary falsely attesting receipt of affidavit before him—Forged
document attached to loan deed—Criminal Code , ss. 282 , 324 , 326 .

Respondent, a practising notary, attested
that a power of attorney had been sworn to before him when this was not the
case. It subsequently proved that the power of attorney was a forgery, although
respondent was unaware of this. Respondent was charged with fraud, uttering a
forged document, drawing a document without authority and conspiring to commit
fraud; he was acquitted in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace on the four
counts. The Crown appealed on the second count only, the uttering of a forged
document contrary to s. 326  of the Criminal Code . A majority of the
Court of Appeal (Corey and Chouinard JJ.A.) upheld the acquittal, but
Montgomery J.A. dissented. In his opinion, by adding a false attestation to the
affidavit respondent had made the power of attorney a false document, and by
attaching it to the deed of loan concluded before him, had acted with regard to
the document, knowing it to be forged, as if it was authentic: he should have
been convicted of the offence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Robbery—Stabbing—Sentencing—First offender—Character and psychiatric
evidence favourable to the accused—Prejudicial evidence adduced in
reply—Evidence as to weapon, disguise found in accused’s apartment—Evidence as
to accused’s plans to commit a further crime.

Appellant was convicted on a plea of guilty
of robbery. The provincial court judge sentenced him to eight years’
imprisonment. The offence occurred at a Safeway Store in Toronto where appellant and a companion
concealed themselves in an underground parking lot after having deflated a tire
on the automobile of the store manager. When all the other employees had left
the manager entered the parking lot and upon finding that his tire was flat
began to change it. Appellant appeared with a butcher’s bone paring knife and,
when the manager resisted his advance by reaching for a tire iron, appellant
stabbed the manager three times and inflicted injuries including a collapsed
lung and cuts on the hand. The manager was forced to surrender his keys and the
sum of $20,000 was stolen. The injured man was left in the premises but
appellant did after leaving the premises phone for an ambulance. The manager
recovered but now has a partially disabled hand. Appellant was arrested and
brought to trial about a year after the robbery. After the plea of guilty a
police officer gave an account of the facts and in doing so made certain
observations favourable to the accused. A psychiatrist then gave evidence again
favourable to the accused pointing to his “non-violent character” and “genuine
remorse”. Further evidence of good character was elicited from appellant’s
employer. The Crown however recalled the police officer who, after alluding to
the increase of armed robberies in Toronto, indicated that at the appellant’s
apartment shortly after his arrest the police found another weapon and
disguises and that appellant had there told them that he had been planning
another robbery. No objection was taken to the admissibility of the statement
and appellant did not crossexamine on it. Appellant had no previous convictions
and on

[Page 750]

appeal argued that the trial judge had in
imposing sentence taken into account other untried or potential offences. The
Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal without recorded reasons.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

It did not appear that the trial judge had
considered any potential untried offence and it was doubtful whether there was
a possible offence. The impugned evidence was in the circumstances properly
admissible on the issue of appellant’s character, conduct and attitude and
indeed was particularly relevant in view of the medical evidence adduced by the
appellant. It was open to the trial judge to weigh this with the other evidence
which had been given and his reasons did not disclose any undue reliance on the
reply evidence nor any undue rejection of the evidence called for the
appellant.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
recorded reasons an appeal from sentence imposed by a provincial court judge
after a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery. Appeal dismissed.

John A. Olah and Paul H. Shapiro, for the
appellant.

Casey Hill, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal attacks the legality of
a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment imposed upon the appellant by a
provincial court judge after a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery. It is
alleged that the sentencing judge was in error in that in imposing the sentence
he admitted and acted upon evidence of a potential but untried charge not
connected with the offence to which the plea of guilty had been entered. An
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed without reasons being given
and this appeal comes by leave of this Court. Due to the absence of reasons in
the

[Page 751]

Court of Appeal, it is in effect an appeal from
the trial judge.

The offence occurred at a Safeway Store in Toronto. The appellant and a companion, who
had once been employed by Safeway and who was familiar with the company’s
procedure, entered an underground parking lot on Safeway’s premises and
concealed themselves after having deflated a tire on the automobile of the
store manager. When all other employees had left the premises, the manager
entered the parking lot. Upon finding that his tire was flat, he began to
change it. The appellant then appeared with a butcher’s bone paring knife and
when the manager resisted his advance by reaching for a tire iron, the
appellant stabbed the manager three times and inflicted injuries which included
a collapsed lung and various cuts on the hand. The manager was forced to
surrender his keys. The store premises were entered and the sum of $20,000 was
stolen. The manager was left in the store premises but after leaving the
premises the appellant phoned for an ambulance to come to the manager’s
assistance. The manager recovered after hospital treatment but has a partially
disabled hand as a result of the attack. The appellant was arrested and brought
to trial about one year after the commission of the offence.

After the plea of guilty, a police officer gave
an account of the facts to the court. In doing so he made certain observations
favourable to the accused. The following passage from the transcript is found
near the conclusion of his evidence while he was under cross-examination:

Q. Could you tell the Court, please,
Sergeant Jackson, about his attitude as such at that point and what he had to
say about it?

A. Well, when he was first arrested he
immediately admitted the offence, stating that he had done it. He was very
honest with us. He took us to his apartment and gave us the knife he had kept
for a year, in fact, was still using it. He gave us the glasses and other.
apparently he has worn. Informed us he had bought this furniture with some of
the stolen money and he definitely appeared to be remorseful, Your Honour. He
told

[Page 752]

us on a couple of occasions he wanted to go
back to see the victim to see if he had recovered, so he did show some remorse
and he did cooperate with the police.

Q. Now, as a result, do you know, Sergeant,
whether Mr. Lees has been in any difficulty with the law anywhere before
this?

A. He has never been in any difficulty as
far as the Criminal Code  is concerned to my knowledge.

Q. What about…

A. Criminal offences.

Q. Shall we include drug offences with
that?

A. That’s in the Criminal Code  that I’ve
got. It’s right at the back.

Q. Have you formed—well, as a result of
your investigation, Sergeant Jackson, can you give us some indication as to the
accused’s proclivity for repeating this type of offence?

A. Well, in my opinion, I have no way of
saying—he could go out tomorrow and do the same thing—but in my opinion I would
say I don’t think he would do it again.

The appellant then called evidence from a
psychiatrist. The psychiatrist referred to the disturbed early life of the
appellant, who was thirty-five at date of trial, and stated his opinion that
the appellant was not a violent man, that he showed genuine remorse for his
conduct and that he had learned his lesson and would be unlikely to commit
further acts of violence. Further evidence of good character was elicited from
the appellant’s employer.

The Crown then recalled the police officer.
After giving some evidence regarding the increase in armed robberies in Toronto, the following passage appears in
his evidence:

Q. Now, dealing with Mr. Lees. Am I
right in saying that you’re one of the officers that arrested him?

A. Yes, sir, I arrested him.

Q. Where did you arrest him?

A. At his place of employment.

Q. Did you subsequently go to his
apartment?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And can you tell us what happened there,
what you found or.

A. Well, we found the weapon that was used
in this offence. We found another weapon and other dis-

[Page 753]

guises and he was questioned in relation to
this other weapon and the disguises and he informed us that he had been
planning another robbery.

Q. And am I right in that when you arrested
him it was almost a year to the date from the occurrence that we’re dealing
with?

A. Yes, sir. He had told us the reason that
he had been planning another robbery had been that he’d spent all the money,
the $20,000.00 that was stolen in the first robbery.

No objection was taken to its admission and
counsel for the appellant did not cross-examine upon it.

Sentence was then imposed and since the trial
judge’s reasons are short they are reproduced in full:

I think that defence counsel has obviously
prepared his submissions carefully and ably. I cannot say that I am convinced
that this man has learned his lesson. By being involved in a shocking incident
and by being in gaol for months, he may have learned his lesson. I don’t know
whether he has or not. What the police officer testified a few minutes ago,
that a year after this unfortunate incident this man had a weapon in his
residence and a mask, and he admitted at that time to being considering a
further crime. It leaves one somewhat pessimistic. However, I do realize that
by now he may have different feelings and by the end of his sentence he may be
fully committed to living a good life.

Despite the fact that he had seriously
wounded his victim, he and his associate forced the victim to proceed to a
store and therein open the safe from which some $20,000.00 was obtained. This
offender is 35 years of age and he’s never been convicted of a criminal
offence. The factor of deterrence, in my view, outweighs any other factor in
this case and a severe sentence must be imposed, although I’ve taken a great
much into account in his favour, his previous unblemished record and his plea
of guilty. He will no doubt obtain favourable consideration for parole at some
early stage of his incarceration. I would support such consideration and I will
support it if need be. I now sentence him to eight years in penitentiary.

The appellant argued that the trial judge in
imposing sentence took into account other untried or potential offences and
increased the sentence that he would otherwise have imposed. It was contended
that this was error for it is only when an accused asks at the time of
sentencing that an

[Page 754]

offence or offences other than the ones charged
be taken into consideration that a judge may consider additional untried
offences. In support of this position, several cases were cited, they include R.
v. Harris[1],
Ontario High Court per Mulock C.J.; R. v. Huchison[2], English Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division); R. v. Cote[3], Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal; and R. v. Taylor, June 25, 1958, unreported but
noted at [1959] O.W.N. 1, Ontario Court of Appeal per Schroeder J.A., and other
cases.

These cases, however, all speak of circumstances
very different from those before us now. In each one it was clear that the
sentencing judge considered earlier offences uncharged or unproved and increased
the sentences to be imposed as a result. That is not the present case. It does
not appear to me that any potential untried offence was considered by the trial
judge in the case at bar, and it is even doubtful whether there was a possible
offence. The appellant had tendered evidence of good character. He tendered as
well evidence from the psychiatrist which went to show that he was not a danger
to the community and that a long detention would not be necessary. The trial
judge was right in receiving this evidence. It was relevant on the question of
sentence and it was entitled to serious consideration. In reply the Crown,
which had not attacked the character of the appellant in giving particulars of
the offence, gave evidence of the circumstances which were discovered upon the
appellant’s arrest about a year after the offence. This evidence was properly
admissible on the issue of the appellant’s character, conduct, and attitude,
all proper factors to be taken into consideration on sentencing. See Roach J.A.
in R. v. Warner, Urquhart, Martin & Mullen[4], at p. 321 (Ontario Court of Appeal). It was particularly relevant in this case in view
of the medical evidence adduced by the appellant upon these matters. It was
open to the trial judge to receive this evidence and to weigh it and consider

[Page 755]

it along with the evidence of good character and
the medical evidence which had been given. His reasons do not, in my opinion,
disclose any undue reliance on the reply evidence nor do they indicate any
wholesale rejection of the evidence called for the appellant. The trial judge
appears to have given fair and balanced consideration to the evidence before
him. I am unable to find any error in law upon his part and I would dismiss the
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Criminal law — Parties — Aiding and abetting — Gang rape —
Complainant identifying accused as two of her attackers — Charge denied — No
evidence accused formed common intention with those involved to commit rape —
Whether any evidence accused aided and abetted commission of offence — Criminal
Code , s. 21(1)  and (2) .

The appellants were twice tried and convicted on a
charge of rape. It was alleged that they unlawfully had sexual intercourse with
the complainant without her consent. They were sentenced to serve six years in
penitentiary. In an appeal taken following the second trial, the Manitoba Court
of Appeal found error on the part of the trial judge, but by a three to two
majority sustained the conviction by applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.
From that judgment an appeal was taken to this Court.

A gang rape of the complainant occurred late at
night in an isolated area, the site of a former dump, where members of a
motorcycle club were having a party. Some eighteen men had intercourse with the
complai­nant while she was being held by two other members of the group. She
identified the accused as two of the men who attacked her. The accused denied
the charge. They testified that they had attended a meeting of the club at the
dump earlier in the evening in question, and later were present in a beverage
room where the complainant and a friend were spending some time. Still later,
the accused delivered a quantity of beer at the dump. Dunlop saw a female
having intercourse; with whom, he could not say, but he believed the person to
be a member of the motorcycle club. After three minutes he and his co-accused
left.

The issue for the jury was a simple one—did the two
accused have intercourse with the complainant? She said that they had, and they
denied it. The judge chose,

[Page 882]

however, to instruct the jury upon parties to an
offence under s. 21 of the Code, and it was in this respect that the
convictions were challenged.

Held (Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting): The appeals should be allowed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey
JJ.: It was common ground that the trial judge erred in charg­ing the jury on
s. 21(2) of the Code, common intention, when there was no evidence that
the appellants had formed any common intention with those involved in the gang
rape to commit rape upon the complainant.

Presence at the commission of an offence can be
evidence of aiding and abetting if accompanied by other factors, such as prior
knowledge of the principal offend­er's intention to commit the offence or
attendance for the purpose of encouragement. In this case there was no evidence
that while the crime was being committed either of the accused rendered aid,
assistance, or encour­agement to the rape of the complainant. There was no
evidence of any positive act or omission to facilitate the unlawful purpose.
One could infer that the two accused knew that a party was to be held, and that
their presence at the dump was not accidental or in the nature of casual
passers-by, but that was not sufficient. A person cannot properly be convicted
of aiding and abetting in the commission of acts which he does not know may be
or are intended. One must be able to infer that the accused had prior knowledge
that an offence of the type committed was planned, i.e. that their
presence was with knowledge of the intended rape.

The evidence failed to disclose any facts as distin­guished
from surmise or suspicion, upon which a jury could conclude beyond reasonable
doubt that the accused had assumed a role which would qualify them as aiders
and abettors under s. 21(1) of the Code.

In these circumstances, the trial judge erred in
charg­ing the jury on the alternative bases of (i) principal offender and (ii) aider
and abettor.

The error, unfortunately, was compounded when the
jury, which had retired at 3:15 p.m., returned at 5:40 with the following
question: ""If the accused were aware of a rape taking place in their presence
and did nothing to prevent or persuade the discontinuance of the act, are they
considered as an accomplice to the act under law?""

[Page 883]

That question should have been answered in one word—""No.""
However, the judge, who initially intended to respond with a ""No""
answer, was persuaded, during argument, to the point of view, advanced for the
first time on behalf of the Crown, that the accused might be guilty as parties
to the offence under s. 21 of the Code.

The recharge was in error in three respects: (i) it
was not responsive to the question asked; (ii) on the facts of the case, it
might leave the jury with the impression that the accused could be parties to
the offence if they knew that an offence was being committed and failed to do
anything to hinder or prevent it; and (iii) the jury received no help in
applying the instruction given; no act or omission was identified as providing
a possible factual underpinning to the operation of s. 21.

The difficulty now faced by this Court was that it
did not know, and would never know, whether the jury found the appellants
guilty because they had had intercourse with the complainant, or by reason of
the opera­tion of subss. (1) or (2) of s. 21 of the Code. The Court did
know from the question of the jury, and its timing, that after two hours and
twenty-five minutes of deliber­ation the jury had not accepted the evidence of
the complainant as to direct participation by the appellants. Fifteen minutes
after resuming deliberation, following the recharge, the guilty verdict was
returned.

This was not an appropriate case for the application
of s. 613(1)(b)(iii). One could not say that the verdict would have been the
same in the absence of error. In the circumstances a verdict of acquittal
should be directed, rather than have the applicants undergo a third trial.

Per Beetz and Pratte JJ.: With respect to
subs. 21(2), there was agreement in the Court of Appeal—and it was not
challenged here—that the trial judge had erred in charging the jury in, that
respect. The difference in the Court of Appeal was solely as to the application
of subpara. 613(1)(b)(iii) to such error. This was not a dissent on a question
of law.

As to subs. 21(1), for the reasons given by Dickson
J., the reply of the trial judge to the question of the jury was inadequate and
amounted to a misdirection in law. One could not say, in the light of the
evidence, that this error on the part of the trial judge caused the appellants
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Therefore,

[Page 884]

subpara. 613(1)(b)(iii) should not be invoked in
respect to such error.

Per Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ., dissenting:
The third ground of dissent in the Court of Appeal did not constitute a
dissent on a question of law. Paragraph (iii) of subs. 613(1)(6) gives to a
court of appeal a discre­tionary power to dismiss an appeal from conviction,
even where there has been a wrong decision by a trial court on a question of
law if there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulting
from that error. A disagreement by a dissenting judge regarding the exercise of
that discretion is not a dissent on a question of law.

The first ground of dissent was that there was no
evidence upon which the appellants could have been found to be parties to the
offence under subs. 21(2) of the Code. Matas J.A., who delivered the
main reasons of the majority, and with whom Freedman C.J.M. con­curred, did not
disagree on this point with the reasons of Hall J.A., who delivered the reasons
of the minority. As stated by Matas J.A., with respect to the grounds of appeal
on common intention, there was merit in the argument that the comments of the
trial judge were inappropriate in the circumstances of the case. But it was
apparent from the juror's question that the mem­bers were not troubled by the
concept of common inten­tion. In any event, no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice occurred.

With respect to the second ground of dissent, it was
noted that whereas ground one referred to ""no evi­dence,"" which is an
issue of law, the second ground referred to ""insufficient evidence in
law"" to make the appellants parties to the offence. Sufficiency of
evidence is a matter for the jury. Dissent on this point was not a dissent on a
question of law.

However, as the point had been thoroughly canvassed in
argument, it was considered. The gist of the reasons of Hall J.A. was found in
his statement that the pres­ence of the accused at the dump, and their passive
observation of a girl having sexual intercourse was not sufficient in law to
make them parties to an offence under s. 21(1) of the Code. But the
statement that the appellants were merely present at the dump and were passive
observers of an act of sexual intercourse had to be based upon the evidence of
the appellants. It was for the jury to decide whether or not to accept that evi­dence.
The statement overlooked entirely other evidence on which the jury could
conclude that the appellants had aided and abetted the commission of the
offence. The

[Page 885]

jury had been properly instructed as to what was
neces­sary in order to establish aiding and abetting, The sufficiency of that
evidence was solely a matter for the determination of the jury and was not a
matter to be decided by the Court of Appeal.

As to the criticism of the trial judge for his
response to the question asked by the jury, the reasons of Matas J.A. for his
view that the Crown had satisfied the onus of showing that the trial judge did
not err in either the instructions or the answer on the question of the applica­bility
of s. 21(1)  were adopted.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1],
dismissing an appeal by the accused from their conviction for rape following a
second trial. Appeals allowed, Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

J. J. Gindin, for the appellants.

J. G. Dangerfield, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellants were twice tried and convicted on a
charge of rape. The indictment alleges that on June 26, 1975, they did
unlawfully have sexual intercourse with Brenda Ross without her consent. They
were sentenced to serve six years in penitentiary. In an appeal taken following
the second trial, the Manitoba Court of Appeal found error on the part of the
trial judge, but by a three to two majority sustained the conviction by apply­ing
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. It is from that judgment that the present
appeal is taken.

[Page 886]

The Facts

A rather detailed recital of the facts is essential to an
understanding of the issues. In June 1975, Brenda Ross was sixteen years of
age. On the night of the alleged offence, accompanied by a friend, Anne McGibney,
she went to the Waldorf Hotel in the City of Winnipeg to listen to a band and
drink beer.

A number of members of a motorcycle club known as the Spartans
were present at the hotel. The two girls were joined at their table by two
members of the club, one Hawryluk and the appel­lant Dunlop, and by a
prospective member, one Douglas. During the evening the complainant con­sumed
five or six glasses of beer. At about 11:30 p.m. she, riding on the back of
Douglas' motorcy­cle, and Anne McGibney, riding on the back of Hawryluk's
motorcycle, went briefly to the Balmoral Hotel. Leaving there, they proceeded
on the motorcycles to an isolated area, the site of a former dump, located on
Elmwood on the outskirts of Winnipeg. The Elmwood dump was favoured as a rendez-vous
by motorcyclists because of the hillocks. After arrival, the four sat on
the grass and talked for about five minutes, following which McGibney and Hawryluk
went for a walk. The complainant and Douglas remained for three or four
minutes, then Douglas left to repair his bike, leaving the complainant alone.

Lonely, she arose and went looking for McGib­ney and Hawryluk. At
this moment four men in black leather jackets bearing the Spartan emblem
arrived on motorcycles. They approached the com­plainant, picked her up by the
arms and legs, carried her to a nearby area bordering a creek and threw her on
the ground. By this time, quite a few other men, similarly dressed, arrived.
The complai­nant's clothes were torn from her, and each of the men, about
eighteen in number, had intercourse with her while she was being held by two of
the others. On direct examination the complainant was asked whether she was
able to recognize any of the men who had had intercourse, to which she replied
""Yes, those two right there"", looking at the appel­lants Dunlop and
Sylvester. The night was very dark, but the complainant explained that after
the men had laid her down a bonfire had been lighted, and she could see by the
light of the fire. At one

[Page 887]

point she was threatened with a knife. There are more unpleasant
details, but they need not be here recounted.

The following day the complainant picked Dunlop from a police
lineup as one of the men who had attacked her. Sylvester was identified in a
second lineup later the same day. Asked by Crown counsel what it was about them
that made it possible for her to recall the two men so clearly, the complainant
answered ""Well, not really that much, but I seen their faces as they were
getting on top of me."" Later, she testified that she remem­bered very
clearly the two accused, and that she was positive in her identification. She
conceded on cross-examination that neither of the two accused was among the
four men who first approached her, nor had either of them pinned her arms or
pro­duced a knife. Her sole testimony implicating the two accused was to the
effect that each of them had performed the physical act of intercourse with her
during the course of the sexual attack. The case for the Crown was put forward
on that footing.

Each of the accused gave evidence. Dunlop testified that he had
attended a meeting of the Spartan Motorcycle Club at the Elmwood dump early in
the evening in question, at which time Douglas had been introduced as a
prospective member. Later, according to his evidence, Dunlop went to the Waldorf
Hotel, joined the two girls at a table for a while, and then played pool until
he left the hotel at about 1:00 a.m. He explained that Sylvester had been asked
to bring beer to the dump for a party. He, Dunlop, accompanied Sylv­ester in
the latter's car to the Vibrations disco­theque, where they remained about
half-an-hour and then proceeded to the dump, arriving at 2:15 a.m. Upon
arrival, he said, he and Sylvester ""grabbed the beer which was four
cases,"" walked over to the top of a knoll and set down the beer. Douglas
was there. He told Sylvester that everyone was angry over the delay in
delivering the

[Page 888]

beer. Dunlop walked to the other side of the knoll and noticed a
few people down near the creek bed about twenty-five yards distant. Some of
them displayed their ire at the delay in fetching the beer, by yelling at
Dunlop and Sylvester. Dunlop saw a female having intercourse; with whom, he
could not say, but he believed the person to be a Spartan. After three minutes
he and Sylvester left. Dunlop denied having intercourse with Brenda Ross, or in
any way assisting anyone else to have intercourse with her. Sylvester's
evidence was to the same effect as that of Dunlop.

The issue for the jury was a simple one-did the two accused have
intercourse with Brenda Ross? She said that they had, and they denied it. The
issue was well formulated by the trial judge just before the conclusion of his
summing up, in these words:

If you accept the evidence of Brenda Ross, and if after
weighing all the evidence you come to the conclu­sion that you are satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the two accused did have sexual intercourse with
Brenda Ross without her consent, then you may find them both guilty as charged.

If, on the other hand you have reasonable doubt that either
one or both accused participated in this way, then you must give that
particular accused the benefit of that reasonable doubt and acquit the accused
on the charge.

That is all the case was about. The judge chose, however, to
instruct the jury upon parties to an offence under s. 21 of the Code, and
it is in this respect that the convictions are challenged. The general effect
of s. 21 is to make equally culpable

(i) the person who actually commits the offence,

(ii) any person who aids or abets in committing the offence, and
(iii) persons who form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose
leading to the commission of the offence.

Section 21(2)  of the Criminal Code 

The first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in
charging the jury on s. 21(2) of the Code, common intention, when there
was no evidence

[Page 889]

that the appellants Dunlop and Sylvester had formed any common
intention with those involved in the gang rape to commit rape upon Brenda Ross.
It is common ground that the trial judge erred in this respect. Crown counsel
concedes as much. There was no evidence that the appellants participated in a
plan or scheme to lure the com­plainant to the dump as part of the initiation
proceeding. In the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, Mr. Justice Matas, writing for
the majority of the Court, considered that there was ""merit in the
appellants' argument that the comments were inappropriate in the circumstances
of the case."" Mr. Justice Hall, writing the minority opinion, said:

In my respectful opinion, there was no evidence upon which a
jury, properly instructed, could find or infer that the accused were parties to
an offence under that subsection. In my view, it was a pure invitation to the
jury to resort to surmise, speculation and conjecture, as opposed to proper
legal inference, against which they were cautioned not to do in the general
charge.

Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code 

The second ground of appeal was set out in the formal judgment of
the Court of Appeal in this manner:

2. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in charging the Jury
with respect to Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code , as there was
insufficient evidence in law to make the Appellant ... a party to the offence.

In ascertaining the real ground upon which dissent is based, if the
formal judgment fails to make that clear, this Court may look to the written
reasons of the dissenting judges: Roy v. The King[2],
at p. 43, per Crocket J. and Savard and Lizotte v. The King[3],
at p. 23, per Taschereau J.

Mr. Justice Hall in his dissenting judgment left no doubt that
the ""insufficient evidence in law,"" of which he spoke, was
insufficient in the sense that the trial judge ought not to have charged the
jury at all with respect to s. 21(1) :

[Page 890]

The presence of the accused at the dump, and their passive
observation of a girl having sexual intercourse is not sufficient in law to
make them parties to an offence under s. 2I (1) of the Code.

The case for the Crown should have been allowed to stand or
fall on the issue of whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused were two of the Spartans who had sexual intercourse with Ross
against her will ... The charge should have stopped there.

As I read this passage, there is no suggestion that the evidence
was insufficient to support a convic­tion, which is a question of fact or, at
best, a question of mixed fact and law. That was the situation in The
Queen v. Warner[4]. The
error alleged in the dissent here is that there was insuffi­cient evidence to
go to the jury under s. 21(1) , as opposed to insufficient evidence to
support the jury's verdict. The question of whether there is sufficient
evidence to go to the jury, i.e. any evidence upon which a jury,
properly instructed, could find the appellants guilty as parties to the offence
under s. 21(1) , is a question of law, which can found an appeal to this Court
under s. 618(1)(a): The King v. Décary[5], at
p. 83, and Calder v. The Queen[6], at
pp. 896-7, per Cart­wright J.

On s. 21(1) of the Code, the jury was instructed as
follows:

Secondly, I should also instruct you on the law relat­ing to
parties to an offence. Section 21(1) of the Crimi­nal Code, reads as
follows:

Everyone is a party to an offence who:

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding
any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing it.

Abets, that word abets means encourages, supports, upholds.
It is another way of expressing a person giving assistance to someone
committing the offence. Everyone who aids and encourages the person in the
commission of the offence is as guilty as the person who commits the actual
criminal act.

[Page 891]

To find that the accused is guilty of aiding or abetting the
commission of an offence by another person, it is only necessary to show that
he understood what was being done and by some act on his part assisted or
encouraged the attainment of that act.

Mere presence at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to ground
culpability. Something more is needed: encouragement of the principal offender;
an act which facilitates the commission of the offence, such as keeping watch
on enticing the victim away, or an act which tends to prevent or hinder
interference with accomplishment of the criminal act, such as preventing the
intended victim from escaping or being ready to assist the prime culprit. Thus,
in an early work, Foster's Crown Law, p. 350, we read:

... in order to render a person an accomplice and a
principal in felony, he must be aiding and abetting at the fact, or ready to
afford assistance if necessary, and therefore if A. happeneth to be present at
a murder, for instance, and taketh no part in it, nor endeavoureth to prevent
it, nor apprehendeth the murderer, nor levyeth hue and cry after him, this
strange behaviour of his, though highly criminal, will not of itself render him
either principal or accessory.

The leading case of R. v. Coney[7] decided
that non-accidental presence at the scene of the crime was not conclusive of
aiding and abetting. The accused were present at a prize fight, then illegal,
though taking no part in the management of the fight. It did not appear that
the accused said or did anything. The chairman of the quarter sessions directed
the jury that, prize fights being illegal, all persons who went to a fight to
see the combatants strike each other, and being present when they did so, were
guilty of assault unless they were casually passing by. If they stayed at the
place, they encouraged it by their presence although they did not say or do
anything. Eight of the eleven judges hearing the case reserved were of opinion
that the direction was not correct. Two passages from the judgment of Cave J.
at p. 539 bear repeating:

[Page 892]

Now it is a general rule in the case of principals in the
second degree that there must be participation in the act, and that, although a
man is present whilst a felony is being committed, if he takes no part in it,
and does not act in concert with those who commit it, he will not be principal
in the second degree merely because he does not endeavour to prevent the
felony, or apprehend the felon.

and,

… Where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even
evidence of aiding and abetting. Where pres­ence is prima facie not
accidental it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury.

Hawkins J. in a well-known passage had this to say, p. 557:

In my opinion, to constitute an aider and abettor some
active steps must be taken by word, or action, with the intent to instigate the
principal, or principals. Encour­agement does not of necessity amount to aiding
and abetting, it may be intentional or unintentional, a man may unwittingly
encourage another in fact by his pres­ence, by misinterpreted words, or
gestures, or by his silence, or non-interference, or he may encourage inten­tionally
by expressions, gestures, or actions intended to signify approval. In the
latter case he aids and abets, in the former he does ont. It is no criminal
offence to stand by, a mere passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder.
Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime. But the fact that a
person was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the commission of a
crime, and offered no opposition to it, though he might reason-ably be expected
to prevent and had the power so to do, or at least to express his dissent,
might under some circumstances, afford cogent evidence upon which a jury would
be justified in finding that he wilfully encouraged and so aided and abetted.
But it would be purely a question for the jury whether he did so or not. So if
any number of persons arrange that a criminal offence shall take place, and it
takes place accordingly, the mere presence of any of those who so arranged it
would afford abundant evidence for the consideration of a jury of an aiding and
abetting.

[Page 893]

In this Court the question of aiding and abetting was canvassed
in Preston v. R.[8] The
appellant and another were accused of having set fire to a school. Mr. Justice
Estey delivered the majority judgment in this Court, in the course of which he
stated (p. 159) that in order to find the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting,
counselling or procuring, it was only necessary to show that he understood what
was taking place and by some act on his part encouraged or assisted in the
attainment thereof. Later he said (p. 160) that mere presence does not
constitute aiding and abetting, but presence under certain circumstances may
itself be evidence thereof. He proceeded to review the evidence and concluded,
p. 161:

If appellant's explanation was not believed by the jury there
was evidence in addition to his mere presence upon which they might well
conclude that he was guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring.
(Emphasis added.)

Two Canadian cases make the distinction be­tween presence with
prior knowledge, and acciden­tal presence. In R.v. Dick[9],
the accused was charged with the murder of her husband. Accord­ing to her
own statement, she met her husband and Bohozuk, a friend, and they went with
her in a borrowed car, her husband in the front seat and Bohozuk in the back.
The two men began to quarrel, both were drinking; Bohozuk pulled a gun and shot
Mr. Dick. It was not a happy marriage, nor were Mr. Dick and Bohozuk on best of
terms. There was some surrounding evidence casting doubt upon the
non-involvement of the accused. As Chief Justice Robertson noted, she did not
admit that there was any design, nor that she knew Bohozuk intended to shoot
Dick, nor even that she knew Bohozuk had a weapon with him. Yet the trial judge
gave only general directions on aiding and abetting to the jury. Robertson
C.J.O. concluded at pp. 432-3:

[Page 894]

Now, while it may be that a jury might infer from the
evidence a good deal that is not expressly admitted, it is not at all certain
that this jury did infer that the appellant knew more than she admits knowing
of Boho­zuk's then present purpose. This jury should have been instructed that
if they found that the appellant was no more than passively acquiescent at the
time of the shooting and that she had no reason to expect that there would be
any shooting until it actually occurred, then s. 69 did not apply.

In the result, a new trial was ordered.

In R. v. Hoggan[10], the
charge was that the accused aided and abetted in wilfully attempting to defeat
the course of justice by attempting to dissuade a witness from giving evidence.
Johnson J.A. concluded at p. 260:

There are two things that must be proved before an accused
can be convinced of being a party by aiding and abetting. It must be proved
that he had knowledge that the principal intended to commit the offence and
that the accused aided and abetted him. Where there is no knowledge that an
offence is to be committed, the presence of an accused at the scene of the
crime cannot be a circumstance which could be evidence of aiding and abetting.

The basis for Johnson J.A.'s approach to aiding

and abetting is found in Preston and Coney, both of
which he cites.

The case of R. v. Salajko[11] is
like the instant case in many respects. A girl was raped by fifteen young
men in a lonely field. Three were charged. Two of these were identified as
having had inter-course with the girl. She admitted, however, that the third
accused, Salajko, though seen to be near the girl with his pants down while she
was being raped by others, did not have intercourse with her. The Crown placed
its case against him on s. 21(1) (b) and (c) of the Criminal Code . One
might be forgiven for thinking that it was open to the jury to infer
encouragement by conduct, but the

[Page 895]

Ontario Court of Appeal thought otherwise. Chief Justice Gale,
delivering the judgment of the Court, stated that in the absence of evidence to
suggest something in the way of aiding, or counselling, or encouraging on the
part of the accused with respect to that which was being done by the others,
there was simply no evidence upon which a jury could properly arrive at a
verdict of guilty against the particular accused. The learned Chief Justice
also found error in the trial judge's charge which seemed to indicate that a
person could abet another in the commission of an offence if, know­ingly, he
stood by while the offence was being committed

Finally, there are the cases of R. v. Black[12]
and R. v. Clarkson[13]. The
victim in Black's case was conveyed to a clubhouse where he was
subjected to various sordid indignities. Many of the accused took an active
part in torturing the victim while others stood around laughing and yelling.
The British Columbia Court of Appeal confirmed the convictions, being of the
view that the spectators furnished encouragement to the perpetrators of the
outrages and their mere presence in the cir­cumstances of the case ensured
against the escape of the victim. There was thus something more than ""mere
presence"", as in R. v. Coney, supra. Most important, the trial
judge directed the jury in language drawn from the judgment of Hawkins J. in Coney
and reviewed the evidence relating to the presence of the accused in clear
terms.

In contrast to R. v. Black is the case of R. v. Clarkson,
a decision of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court. A girl was raped in a room
in a barracks in Germany by a number of soldiers. Another group of soldiers
clustered outside the door and later ""piled in"" to the room. They
remained there for a considerable time while the girl was raped. There was no
evidence that the appellants had done any physical act, or uttered any word
which involved

[Page 896]

direct physical participation or verbal
encouragement. There was no evidence that they touched the girl, or did
anything to prevent others from assist­ing her or to prevent her from escaping.
The Appeal Court held that it was not enough that the presence of the accused,
in fact, gave encouragement. ""It must be proved that the accused intended
to give encouragement; that he wilfully encouraged."" (p. 347) There
must be, the Court held, an intention to encourage and encouragement in fact.
The convictions were quashed.

The Case at Bar

In the case at bar I have great difficulty in finding any
evidence of anything more than mere presence and passive acquiescence. Presence
at the commission of an offence can be evidence of aiding and abetting if
accompanied by other factors, such as prior knowledge of the principal
offender's intention to commit the offence or attendance for the purpose of
encouragement. There was no evi­dence that while the crime was being committed
either of the accused rendered aid, assistance, or encouragement to the rape of
Brenda Ross. There was no evidence of any positive act or omission to
facilitate the unlawful purpose. One can infer that the two accused knew that a
party was to be held, and that their presence at the dump was not accidental or
in the nature of casual passers-by, but that is not sufficient. A person cannot
properly be convicted of aiding or abetting in the commis­sion of acts which he
does not know may be or are intended: per Viscount Dilhorne in D. P.
P. v. Maxwell[14], at
p. 1144. One must be able to infer that the accused had prior knowledge that an
offence of the type committed was planned, i.e. that their presence was
with knowledge of the intended rape. On this issue, the Crown elicited no
evidence.

[Page 897]

In concluding that there was evidence of a nature which would
permit the jury to draw an inference that the accused were more than merely
present at a crime and had done nothing to prevent it, Mr. Justice Matas
referred to the earlier meet­ing of the Spartans at the dump (with Sylvester
and Dunlop present) when Douglas was introduced as a prospect, the presence of
members of the group at the Waldorf beverage room where the complainant and her
friend were spending some time, the bringing of the complainant by Douglas to
the dump, the reappearance of a group of Spartans at the same location (where
the gang rape took place), the arrival of the accused with a substantial
quantity of beer, and the observation by both accused of intercourse taking
place by the complainant and one male, but with other men nearby.

The activities of Douglas are twice mentioned by Mr. Justice Matas,
but it must be recalled that Douglas was not one of the accused. Dunlop and
Sylvester bear no responsibility for what he may or may not have done. Apart
from presence earlier in the evening at the dump and at the Waldorf beverage
room, the evidence Mr. Justice Matas marshalls against Dunlop and Sylvester is
(i) their arrival at the dump with a substantial quantity of beer, and (ii)
their observation of intercourse. In my view, for the reasons I have earlier
sought to express, neither of these facts is capable in law of affording
evidence that the appellants aided and abetted the commission of the crime of
rape. They go only to mere presence and not to complicity.

With great respect, I am unable to find in the evidence to which
Mr. Justice Matas alludes, or elsewhere, any facts as distinguished from
surmise or suspicion, upon which any jury could conclude beyond reasonable
doubt that the accused had assumed a role which would qualify them as aiders
and abettors under s. 21(1) of the Code.

In these circumstances, in my view, the trial judge erred in
charging the jury on the alternative bases of (i) principal offender and (ii) aider
and abettor.

[Page 898]

Question by the Jury

The error, unfortunately, was compounded when the jury, which had
retired at 3:15 p.m., returned at 5:40 with the following question:

If the accused were aware of a rape taking place in their
presence and did nothing to prevent or persuade the discontinuance of the act,
are they considered as an accomplice to the act under law?

That question should have been answered in one word—""No.""

A person is not guilty merely because he is present at the scene
of a crime and does nothing to prevent it: Smith & Hogan, Criminal Law (4th
ed., 1978), p. 117. If there is no evidence of encouragement by him, a man's
presence at the scene of the crime will not suffice to render him liable as aider
and abettor. A person who, aware of a rape taking place in his presence, looks
on and does nothing is not, as a matter of law, an accom­plice. The classic
case is the hardened urbanite who stands around in a subway station when an
individual is murdered.

The judge here initially intended to respond to the jury's
question with a ""No"" answer, but during argument, he was persuaded to
the point of view, advanced for the first time on behalf of the Crown, that the
accused might be guilty as parties to the offence under s. 21 of the Code. As
a result, the judge recharged in these words:

Now, I have decided that the best way to reply to your query
is to refer again to a portion of the law that I gave you in respect to parties
to an offence, and to make one or two further comments on it.

Under Section 21(1) of the Criminal Code , everyone is
a party to an offence who; (a) actually commits it, (b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it—and I will come back
to that, or (c) abets any person in committing it. And abets, I told you before
means encourages, supports, upholds, is another form of giving assistance to a
person committing the offence.

Everyone who aids and encourages another person in the
commission of a criminal offence is as guilty as the

[Page 899]

person who actually commits the criminal act. To find that
an accused is guilty of aiding or abetting in the commission of an offence by
another person, it is only necessary to show that he understood what was being
done, and by some act on his part, assisted or encouraged in the attainment of
what was being done.

But when you are considering what I have said, going back to
that middle section of the definition I read, everyone is a party to an offence
who does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding another person to
commit it, I should say the phrase omitting to do anything, that phrase,
omitting to do anything means intentionally omitting to do something for the
purpose of aiding another to commit an offence, that if it had been done, would
have been prevented or hindered the person from committing an offence.
Intentionally omitting to do something for the purpose of aiding another to
commit the offence, that if it had been done, would have prevented or hindered
the person from committing the offence.

So that if you find an accused person knew that an offence
was being committed and intentionally omitted to do something, for the purpose
of aiding another to commit the offence, that if he had done it might have
hindered or actually prevented the offence, then presum­ably you can find that
the person was a party to the offence. But unless it reaches that level, then
you cannot find him a party.

I think, with respect, that this recharge is in error in three
respects: (i) it is not responsive to the question asked; (ii) on the facts of
the case, it might leave the jury with the impression that the accused could be
parties to the offence if they knew that an offence was being committed and
failed to do anything to hinder or prevent it; and (iii) the jury received no
help in applying the instruction given; no act or omission is identified as
providing a possible factual underpinning to the operation of s. 21.

Conclusion

If the trial judge was in error in charging upon s. 21(2) , which
is admitted and, as I believe, in error in his recharge on s. 21(1), what
disposition is to be made of the case? The majority view in the Manitoba Court
of Appeal was that the trial judge had not erred in his answer to the jury's
question.

[Page 900]

As to the admitted error in charging as to common intention under
s. 21(2) , Mr. Justice Matas said:

But it is apparent from the juror's question that the
members were not troubled by the concept of common intention. In any event, in light
of all the evidence and the whole charge, I am satisfied that no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.

The difficulty one faces is that we do not know, and will never
know, whether the jury found the appellants guilty because they had had
intercourse with the complainant, or by reason of the opera­tion of subss. (1)
or (2) of s. 21 of the Code. We do know from the question of the jury,
and its timing, that after two hours and twenty-five minutes of deliberation
the jury had not accepted the evidence of the complainant as to direct par­ticipation
by the appellants. Fifteen minutes after resuming deliberation, following the
recharge, the guilty verdict was returned.

I do not think this is an appropriate case for the application of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii). I am unable to say that the verdict would have been the same
in the absence of error. For the following reasons given by Mr. Justice Hall, I
would direct a verdict of acquittal, rather than have the applicants undergo a
third trial:

The accused have been subjected to two trials and a Iike
number of appeals. They have been in custody over a year. The doubt raised on
their innocence or guilt should be resolved now. The substance of the case is
their denial against the testimony of Ross, without much more. In the
circumstances, the needs of justice would be met by directing a verdict of
acquittal, rather than having the accused submit to a trial for the third time.

I would allow the appeals, set aside the judg­ment of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal, and direct a verdict of acquittal in respect of each
appellant.

[Page 901]

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—The appellants were convicted by
a jury on a charge of rape. The facts giving rise to this charge are stated in
the reasons of my brother Dickson.

Their appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manito­ba was dismissed,
Hall and O'Sullivan JJ.A. dis­sented. Their appeal to this Court is founded
upon para. (a) of subs. 618(1) of the Criminal Code , which permits
an appeal by a person convicted of an indictable offence, whose conviction is
affirmed by the court of appeal on any question of law on which a judge of the
court of appeal dissents.

Section 606 of the Code requires that where an appeal is
dismissed by the court of appeal arid a judge of that court dissents from the
judgment of the court, the formal judgment of the court shall specify any
grounds of law on which the dissent is based. The formal judgments in the
present case specified the grounds of dissent in the following way:

1. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in charging the Jury
on Section 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  when there was no evidence upon which a
Jury, properly instructed, could find or infer that the Appellant ... was a
party to the offence.

2. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in charging the Jury
with respect to Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code , as there was insufficient
evidence in law to make the Appellant ... a party to the offence.

3. That Section 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should
not be applied in order to dismiss the Appeal.

I do not think that the third ground constitutes a dissent on a
question of law. Paragraph (iii) of subs. 613(1)(b) gives to a court of appeal
a discre­tionary power to dismiss an appeal from convic­tion, even where there
has been a wrong decision by a trial court on a question of law if there has
been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulting from that error.
A disagreement by a

[Page 902]

dissenting judge regarding the exercise of that discretion is not
a dissent on a question of law. 

The first ground of dissent is that there was no evidence upon
which the appellants could have been found to be parties to the offence under
subs. 21(2) of the Code. Matas J.A., who delivered the main reasons of
the majority, and with whom Chief Justice Freedman concurred, did not disagree
on this point with the reasons of Hall J.A., who delivered the reasons of the
minority. Matas J.A. said:

With respect to the grounds of appeal on common intention (grounds
5 and 6 of notice of appeal, sec. 21(1) (sic) of the Code), I
think there is merit in the appel­lants' argument that the comments were
inappropriate in the circumstances of the case. But it is apparent from the
juror's question that the members were not troubled by the concept of common
intention. In any event, in light of all the evidence and the whole charge, I
am satisfied that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.

I agree with this statement.

The main issue in argument before this Court was with respect to
the second ground of dissent. It will be noted that whereas ground one refers
to ""no evidence,"" which is an issue of law, the second ground refers
to ""insufficient evidence in law"" to make the appellants parties to
the offence. Suffi­ciency of evidence is a matter for the jury. (The Queen
v. Warner[15].) I do
not think that the dissent on this point is a dissent on a question of law.

However, as this point was thoroughly can­vassed in argument
before the Court, I will go on to consider it. Hall J.A. dealt with this matter
as follows:

On sec. 21(1) of the Code, the jury was instructed as
follows:

[Page 903]

"" Secondly,. I should also instruct you on the law
relating to parties to an offence. Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code , reads as
follows:

'Everyone is a party to an offence who;

(a) actually permits it,

(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding
any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing it.'

Abets, that word abets means encourages, supports, upholds.
It is another way of expressing a person giving assistance to someone
committing the offence. Everyone who aids and encourages the person in the
commission of the offence is as guilty as the person who commits the actual
criminal act.

To find that the accused is guilty of aiding or abetting the
commission of an offence by another person, it is only necessary to show that
he understood what was being done and by some act on his part assisted or
encouraged the attainment of that act.""

After the jury retired to consider their verdict, they posed
a quetion [sic] to the trial judge. It reads: ""If the accused were aware
of a rape taking place in their presence and did nothing to prevent or persuade
the discontinuance of the act, are they considered as an accomplice to the act
under law?""

The trial judge responded to that question in these terms:

"" Gentlemen, I have received a
question from you in writing, which I will endeavour to respond to. I will read
it again, I have discussed it already with counsel. But you have asked, 'If the
accused were aware of a rape taking place in their presence, and did nothing to
prevent or persuade the discontinuance of the act, are they considered as an accomplice
to the act, under the law'.

Now, I have decided that the best way to reply
to your query is to refer again to a portion of the law that I gave you in
respect to parties to an offence, and to make one or two further comments on
it.

Under Section 21(1) of the Criminal Code , everyone is a
party to an offence who: a) actually commits it, b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it—and I will come back
to that, or c) abets any person in committing it. And abets, I
told you before means encourages, supports, upholds, is another form of giving
assistance to a person committing the offence.

[Page 904]

Everyone who aids and encourages another person in the
commission of a criminal offence is as guilty as the person who actually
commits the criminal act. To find that an accused is guilty of aiding or
abetting in the commission of an offence by another person, it is only
necessary to show that he understood what was being done, and by some act on
his part, assisted or encouraged in the attainment of what was being done.

But when you are considering what I have said, going back to
that middle section of the definition I read, everyone is a party to an offence
who does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding another person to
commit it, I should say the phrase omitting to do anything, that phrase,
omitting to do anything, means intentionally omitting to do something for the
purpose of aiding another to commit an offence, that if it had been done, would
have been (sic) prevented or hindered the person from committing an offence.
Intentionally omitting to do something for the purpose of aiding another to
commit the offence, that if it had been done, would have prevented or hindered
the person from committing the offence.

So that if you find an accused person knew that an offence
was being committed and intentionally omit­ted to do something, for the purpose
of aiding another to commit the offence, that if he had done it might have
hindered or actually prevented the offence, then presumably you can find that
the person was a party to the offence. But unless it reaches that level, then
you cannot find him a party.""

The question itself is indicative that, at the very least,
some one or more members of the jury were of a mind to base their decision on
the answer they were given.

The response of the trial judge was, with respect, too
general and abstract. It was out of context with the facts of the case. Does it
mean, for example, that if the two accused were aware of the rape taking place
in their presence, and intentionally stood by and did nothing, they would be
guilty as a party? If that is the principle sought to be established, I have
doubt that it is an accurate statement of law. But what evidence is there,
supportive of that proposition? At the very worst, the accused observed a girl
in the nude having sexual intercourse with a Spartan, while others were nearby.

The presence of the accused at the dump, and their passive
observation of a girl having sexual intercourse is

[Page 905]

not sufficient in law to make them parties to an offence under
Sec. 21(1) of the Code.

It is not disputed that mere presence at the scene of a crime is
not, in itself, sufficient to establish aiding or abetting the commission of an
offence, but the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it was. He charged
the jury that ""it is only necessary to show that he understood what was
being done and by some act on his part assisted or encouraged the attainment of
that act.""

This instruction is in exact accordance with the principle stated
on behalf of the majority in this Court by Estey J. in Preston v. The King[16],
at p. 159.

The gist of the reasons of Hall J.A. is found in his final
paragraph as quoted above. But the statement that the appellants were merely
present at the dump and were passive observers of an act of sexual intercourse
has to be based upon the evi­dence of the appellants. It was for the jury to
decide whether or not to accept that evidence. The statement overlooks entirely
the other evidence which was before the jury and which is summa­rized in the
following passage from the reasons of Matas J.A.:

Appellants' argument is made on the basis of accept­ing the accuseds'
evidence that they were merely deliv­ery men for a quantity of beer, they
arrived late, saw intercourse taking place and left within a few minutes
without investigating the incident. But it is impossible for this court to base
its decision solely on acceptance of appellants' version of the night's events.

The jury was entitled to consider all the evidence,
including the earlier meeting of the Spartans at the dump (with Sylvester and
Dunlop present) when Douglas was introduced as a prospect, the presence of mem­bers
of the group at the Waldorf beverage room where the complainant and her friend
were spending some time, bringing of the complainant by Douglas to the dump,
the reappearance of a group of Spartans at the same location (where the gang
rape took place), the arrival of the accused with a substantial quantity of
beer, the observation by both accused of intercourse taking place by the complainant
and one male but with other men nearby.

[Page 906]

The evidence, of which the above constitutes a bare outline,
was of a nature which would permit the jury to draw an inference that the
accused were more than merely present at a crime and had done nothing about it.
The jury could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had
assumed a role which would quali­fy them as aiders or abettors under sec. 21(2)
(sic) of the Code.

In my opinion there was evidence on which the jury could conclude
that the appellants had aided and abetted the commission of the offence. The
jury had been properly instructed as to what was necessary in order to
establish aiding and abetting. The sufficiency of that evidence was solely a
matter for the determination of the jury and was not a matter to be decided by
the Court of Appeal.

The trial judge has been criticized for his response to the
question asked by the jury, which is referred to in the passage from the
reasons of Hall J.A. which I have cited. It is said that the answer to that
question should have been a flat ""no.""

In answer to that criticism I would adopt what was said by Matas J.A.
as follows:

Counsel for appellants argued that at one stage, in the
absence of the jury, during discussion of the ques­tion put by the jury, Crown
counsel and the trial judge seemed to think that a simple ""no"" would
suffice as an answer to the juror's question. But a reading of the entire
discussion discloses that Crown counsel thought this would not meet the case
and that the trial judge on consideration decided, correctly in my opinion,
that he would have to expand his answer.

Wright, J., was not being asked a question as part of an
academic exercise but in the context of the evidence of the events of that
evening. We must assume that the jury were reasonably intelligent and
understood the definitions which had been given to them. They were not asking
of a casual passerby, who by coincidence was delivering beer and observed a
girl having intercourse with one man while other men were in the vicinity,
would become a party. The question was asked in the light of all the evidence
which the jury had heard and it

[Page 907]

is in this light that the question and answer must be
examined.

As well, the final paragraph of the answer deals specifically
with knowledge and intention. For conveni­ence I repeat it here:

""So that if you find an accused person knew that an
offence was being committed and intentionally omit­ted to do something, for the
purpose of aiding another to commit the offence, that if he had done it might
have hindered or actually prevented the offence, then presumably you can find
that the person was a party to the offence. But unless it reaches that level,
then you cannot find him a party.""

It seems to me that this comment put the situation fairly to
the jury.

In my view the Crown has satisfied the onus of showing that
the learned trial judge had not erred in either the instructions or the answer
on the question of the applicability of sec. 21(2) (sic) of the Code.

Before concluding these reasons, I might point out that,
practically at the end of his charge, the trial judge put to the jury the
following proposition which was highly favourable to the position of the
appellants:

If you accept the evidence of Brenda Ross, and if after
weighing all the evidence you come to the conclu­sion that you are satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the two accused did have sexual intercourse with
Brenda Ross without her consent, then you may find them both guilty as charged.

If, on the other hand you have reasonable doubt that either
one or both accused participated in this way, then you must give that
particular accused the benefit of that reasonable doubt and acquit the accused
on the charge.

In my opinion the appeals should be dismissed.

The judgment of Beetz and Pratte JJ. was deliv­ered by

PRATTE J.—I have had the advantage of read­ing the reasons of my
brothers Martland and Dickson; I agree that this appeal should be disposed of
in the manner proposed by my brother Dickson, but I reach this conclusion on
grounds that are somewhat narrower than those expressed in his reasons.

[Page 908]

The appeal turns on the legality of the instruc­tions given by
the trial judge to the jury as to subss. 21(1) and 21(2) Cr. C.

With respect to subs. 21(2) Cr.C ., there was agreement in
the Court of Appeal—and it was not challenged here—that the trial judge had
erred in charging the jury in that respect. The difference of opinion in the
Court of Appeal was solely as to the application of subpara. 613(1)(b)(iii) to
such error and I agree with my brother Martland that this is not a dissent on a
question of law.

As to subs. 21(1), it was submitted by appellants that the trial
judge erred in his instructions to the jury in two respects: (i) he should not
have charged them at all on subs. 21(1) because there was no evidence to
support a verdict of guilt under that subsection and (ii) he failed to respond
ade­quately to the question posed by the jury as to the precise meaning of that
subsection of the Code.

This last point which appears clearly as a ground of dissent in
the reasons for judgment was not however specifically mentioned as such in the
formal judgment of the Court of Appeal. This does not affect the jurisdiction
of this Court: Warkentin et al. v. The Queen[17].

I agree with my brother Dickson, for the reasons that he gives,
that the reply of the trial judge to the question of the jury was inadequate
and amounted to a misdirection in law. I cannot say, in the light of the
evidence, that this error on the part of the trial judge caused the appellants
no substan­tial wrong or miscarriage of justice; I would not therefore be
prepared to invoke subpara. 613(1)(b)(iii) in respect to such error.

In view of this conclusion there is no need for me to express any
opinion on the question as to whether there was evidence to justify the trial
judge charging the jury on subs. 21(1).

                   Respondent
was charged with criminal contempt of court after having threatened the
complainant in another criminal matter to which respondent had pleaded guilty.
The Crown elected to proceed by way of indictment under Part XVI of the Criminal
Code . Respondent elected trial by judge without a jury but later re‑elected
trial by magistrate and pleaded guilty. With new counsel, the respondent
appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal. His conviction was set aside
and an acquittal entered. This appeal involves consideration of the power of
the courts in Canada to deal with contempt of court in view of the provisions
of s. 8 of the Code. That section, after excluding convictions at common
law and under certain United Kingdom and pre‑Confederation enactments,
now provides: ""but nothing in this section affects the power, jurisdiction
or authority that a court, judge, justice or provincial court judge had,
immediately before the 1st day of April 1955, to impose punishment for contempt
of court"".

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Section
8 of the Code preserves the courts' inherent jurisdiction or power to
punish for contempt whether by summary procedure or by indictment. The
respondent's conduct in threatening the complainant amounted to a contempt ex
facie the court. The jurisdiction to deal with contempt ex facie has
always been vested exclusively in the superior courts and remains so. Criminal
contempt, while triable by indictment, is not triable in Canada as an
indictable offence under Part XVI of the Code and the accused,
therefore, had no right to an election. The respondent's conviction cannot
stand because his election could not vest the provincial court judge with
jurisdiction which he did not possess. When an indictment for criminal contempt
is employed in Canada, it must be direct indictment to the superior court.

 

                   Finally,
the provincial court was not precluded from relying on the contempt power under
s. 8 merely because the Crown could also have proceeded under s. 127 (2) of the
Code (obstruction of justice).

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre J.‑‑This
appeal involves consideration of the power of the courts in Canada to deal with
contempt of court, in view of the provisions of s. 8  of the Criminal Code .
That section, after excluding convictions at common law and under certain
United Kingdom and pre‑Confederation enactments, now provides: ""but
nothing in this section affects the power, jurisdiction or authority that a
court, judge, justice or provincial court judge had, immediately before the 1st
day of April 1955, to impose punishment for contempt of court"".

 

2.                The
facts may be briefly stated. The respondent was charged with theft from a purse
belonging to one Carol McRae. Upon the matter coming on for trial, the
respondent pleaded guilty. The complain­ant was present in court on this
occasion to be called as a witness. It was, of course, unnecessary to call her
after the plea of ""guilty"", but she was prepared to give evidence and
had given a statement to the police involving the respondent in the offence and
it could have been decisive. She left the court, followed by the respondent.
They entered the public elevator and he then threatened the complainant,
saying: ""she would remember this day when she got her pretty face
slashed"". The complainant reported the matter and the following charge was
laid against the accused:

 

on or about the 4th day of February, A.D., 1982 at
Calgary in the said Province, did commit criminal contempt of Court not in the
face of the Court, to wit: BY THREATENING Carol MCRAE a complainant in a
criminal matter.

 

The
Crown elected to proceed by way of indictment under Part XVI of the Code.
On February 26, 1982, the respondent elected trial by judge without a jury. On
March 30, 1982, the respondent re‑elected trial by magistrate and
thereupon pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two months' imprisonment. With
new counsel, the respondent appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal. His
conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered.

 

3.                In
the Court of Appeal, now reported (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 97, Belzil J.A.,
speaking for the Court (Moir, Belzil JJ.A. and Forsyth J. (ad hoc)) held
that the threat made in the circumstances of this case constituted a contempt ex
facie. He also held that an indictment did not lie for the common law
offence of criminal contempt. It was his view that the saving provision of s. 8
of the Code preserves only the power of the courts to punish contempt by
summary procedure and not by indictment. He said, at p. 102:

 

                   Section 8  does not purport to
preserve indictment for the common law offence of criminal contempt. By
preserving ""the power, jurisdiction or authority . . . to impose
punishment for contempt of court"", this section was intended to preserve
the power of the courts to punish contempt by the summary procedure. It
is only within the framework of this procedural power that the offence of
criminal contempt in its broadest common law definition is preserved.

 

It was
his opinion that procedure by indictment had been effectively replaced by
sections of the Code which deal with specific aspects of criminal
contempt. In reaching this conclusion, he said, at p. 104:

 

...I am of the view that s. 127(2) [of the Code],
which makes it an offence to wilfully attempt to obstruct, prevent [sic]
or defeat the course of justice, is sufficiently broad in its scope to include
all acts of contempt at common law not already covered in other related Criminal
Code  offences. If I am wrong in this, and a gap does exist, the question
should perhaps be re‑examined by Parliament.

 

As
stated above, the conviction was quashed.

 

4.                The
Crown appeals to this Court by leave and raises only one point set out in the
factum in these words:

 

Whether the Court of Appeal of Alberta erred in law in
holding that procedure by Indictment for contempt of court is not available in
Canada.

 

The
respondent was not represented before this Court, although duly notified of the
proceedings. We are indebted to counsel for the Crown who fairly put the matter
before the Court without causing prejudice to the absent respondent.

 

5.                To
summarize the position taken by the Crown, it is sufficient to say it was
asserted that the full contempt powers, not merely powers by way of summary
proceedings, had been preserved in s. 8 of the Code; that the procedure
by indictment remained available and that the existence of substantive offences
in the Code, covering matters which were triable as well in contempt
proceedings, did not oust the jurisdiction of the courts to proceed by
indictment for contempt.

 

6.                The
power to deal with contempt as part of the inherent and essential jurisdiction
of the courts has existed, it is said, as long as the courts themselves (see
Fox, The History of Contempt of Court, 1972, p. 1). This power was
necessary, and remains so, to enable the orderly conduct of the court's business
and to prevent interference with the court's proceedings. Contempt powers
existed for both superior courts and courts of inferior jurisdiction, but the
jurisdiction of the inferior courts was limited to contempt in the face, or in
the presence, of the court. The superior courts, in addition to the power to
convict and punish for contempt in the face of the court, had exclusive
jurisdiction concerning the trial and punishment of contempts ex facie,
that is, contempts committed not in the face of the court. The law on this
subject with a careful review of the relevant authorities is to be found in the
judgment of Beetz J., speaking for this Court (it was unanimous on this point),
in Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Quebec Police Commission, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 618, who reached the following conclusion, at p. 638:

 

                   Accordingly, I think it is fair to
conclude that the Anglo‑Canadian authorities on the power to punish for
contempt committed ex facie curiae have been firmly established for more
than two hundred years. According to these authorities, this power is enjoyed
exclusively by the superior courts. 

 

He went
on to say:

 

                   Such a rule is moreover justified in
principle by the following considerations. The power to punish for contempt
committed ex facie is liable to result in inquiries which may well
involve a lower court in areas which are practically impossible to define in
terms of jurisdiction and completely foreign to its own area of jurisdiction,
which by definition is limited. Such an obstacle does not arise in the case of
a court like the Superior Court, which is a court of original general
jurisdiction (art. 31 C.C.P.) with a priori jurisdiction, or
courts sitting in appeal from decisions of the Superior Court, which may in
general render the decisions which the latter would have rendered. Moreover,
the power to punish a contempt committed ex facie is necessarily bound
up with the superintending and controlling power which only a superior court
may exercise over inferior courts. This controlling power could become illusory
if, in the case of a contempt committed ex facie, an inferior court had
the right to go beyond its own particular field. There would also be the danger
of conflict between the superior and inferior courts, of the kind that formerly
existed in England between the common law and equity courts. Finally, the
inferior courts are not without any means of ensuring that their lawful orders
are observed: as Dorion C.J. notes in Denis, the superior courts may
come to their aid; see also R. v. Davies (supra) and Re Regina and
Monette.

 

7.                Historically,
the superior courts could deal with contempt ex facie by indictment: see
R. v. Revel (1719), l Str. 420, 93 E.R. 609; R. v. Fisher (1811),
2 Camp. 563, 170 E.R. 1253;  Borrie and Lowe's Law of Contempt (2nd ed.
1983). Later, it became the practice to deal with contempt ex facie by
summary procedures as well: see R. v. Almon (1765), Wilm. 243, 97 E.R.
94. Today, summary procedure has become more common and procedure by indictment
has largely fallen into disuse (see R. v. Bengert (1980), 18 C.R. (3d)
75 (B.C.C.A.), per Nemetz C.J.B.C., at p. 84). In fact, it has been said
that the last indictment for contempt ex facie in England was in 1902.

 

8.                It
has been suggested by various Canadian authorities that the proviso in s. 8 
preserved only the summary procedure for the punishment of contempt ex facie.
In the case at bar, Belzil J.A. expressed that view. He found support in R.
c. Ouellet, [1976] C.S. 503, 28 C.C.C. (2d) 338, where Hugessen A.C.J. (as
he then was) said, at p. 507 and pp. 345‑46:

 

                   Assuming that contempt, as a common
law crime, could be proceeded against by indictment in England, it remains to
determine the effect of section 8  of the Criminal Code  on any such
proceedings launched in Canada. The only reported case that I know of is R. c.
Larue‑Langlois (1971) 14 C.R. 68, a judgment of the Court of
Sessions, which is not binding on me. It is not necessary that I decide this
point for the purpose of the present decision but I have serious doubts as to
whether the reservation in section 8 of the right of a court ""to impose
punishment for contempt of court"" is adequate to permit the preferring of
an indictment for a common law crime contrary to the express prohibition of the
earlier part of the same section.

 

These
words were referred to by Martin J.A. in R. v. Cohn (1984), 4 O.A.C.
293, who said at p. 309, after reproducing the quotation above:

 

                   I share that doubt, particularly in
view of the fact that procedure by way of indictment had fallen into disuse
long before the enactment of s. 8 .

 

9.                With
the greatest deference to the contrary views expressed on this question it is
my opinion that, though now rarely employed, procedure by indictment for the
punishment of contempt ex facie, not having been specifically abolished
in Canada, is preserved by s. 8 of the Code and remains available. This
view is supported by Canadian authority. In McKeown v. The Queen, [1971]
S.C.R. 446, Laskin J. (as he then was) and Spence J., while dissenting from the
majority on the issue of whether the contempt involved in that case occurred in
the face of the Court or ex facie, dealt with the point, although the majority
did not find it necessary to do so. At page 463, Laskin J. said:

 

                   The development and general use of
the summary procedures of committal and attachment did not change the quality
of a criminal contempt, which had historically been an indictable offence, and
as well one that could be prosecuted by criminal information: see 3 Holdsworth,
History of English Law, 5th ed., 1942; pp. 392‑4, 8 Halsbury, Laws
of England, 3rd ed., 1954, p. 3; Oswald, Contempt of Court (Canadian
edition), 1911, p. 7. Although resort to indictment and criminal information
became infrequent, these procedures remained, and examples thereof are
collected in Fox, History of Contempt of Court, 1927, passim and
appendix; and see also Ziegel, ""Some Aspects of the Law of Contempt of Court
in Canada, England and the United States"", (1960) 6 McGill L.J.
228, at p. 256. As I have already indicated, indictment is still available in
this country for the trial of criminal contempts.

 

And see
as well, Hébert v. Procureur général de la Province de Québec, [1966]
B.R. 197, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 111 (Que. C.A.), and Bengert, supra. The
important point to remember for this case, however, is that at common law ‑‑
and this is what is specifically preserved by s. 8 of the Code ‑‑
the jurisdiction to deal with contempt ex facie by indictment or summary
procedure was always vested exclusively in the superior courts.

 

10.              In
the case at bar, I have no difficulty in agreeing with Belzil J.A. in the Court
of Appeal, that the conduct of the respondent in threatening the complainant
amounted to a contempt ex facie the court. The Crown chose to proceed by
indictment. The respondent, however, exercised his right of election under s.
484(1) of the Code, which provides:

 

                   484. (1) Where an
accused is charged in an information with an indictable offence other than an
offence that is mentioned in section 427, and the offence is not one over which
a magistrate has absolute jurisdiction under section 483, a magistrate may try
the accused if the accused elects to be tried by a magistrate. 

 

He
elected trial by magistrate. The result then was that the proceedings were
taken and completed in the provincial court, a court of inferior jurisdiction
without jurisdiction to deal with contempt ex facie.

 

11.              The
Crown submits that, under s. 8 of the Code, contempt is an indictable
offence within the meaning of s. 484(1) and, accordingly, an accused is
entitled to elect trial by magistrate, as set out in the section. In my view,
however, this argument rests on an erroneous characterization of the contempt
power, as preserved by s. 8 . That section does not create an indictable offence
for the purposes of the Code, but rather preserves the courts' inherent
jurisdiction or power to punish for contempt. This distinction is illustrated
in the decision of this Court in Vaillancourt v. The Queen, [1981] l
S.C.R. 69, where a fifteen‑year old youth was convicted of contempt in
the face of the court by a superior court judge for refusing to testify at a
trial. On appeal, it was argued that the judge lacked jurisdiction to deal with
the matter because of the exclusive jurisdiction of the youth court. Chouinard
J., speaking for the Court, held that, had the appellant been charged under s.
116(1) or s. 127(2) of the Code, the youth court would have had
exclusive jurisdiction. However, he referred to the difference between the
laying of criminal charges under the Code and the exercise by the Court
of its inherent jurisdiction to protect its processes through contempt
proceedings, pursuant to s. 8 of the Code. To this effect, he quoted
with approval the words of the trial judge, at p. 72:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] The first point to be
noted from reading this section is that the legislator makes a very clear
distinction between an offence contained in the Criminal Code  or in an Act or
ordinance in force, and the power, jurisdiction or authority of a court
to impose a penalty for contempt of court. He has accordingly created a very
clear distinction between offences and crimes on the one hand, and the power to
impose a penalty for contempt of court on the other.

 

While
Vaillancourt involved contempt in the face of the court, and is thus
different from the case at bar, it nonetheless provides an accurate statement
as to the true nature of the contempt power preserved under s. 8 of the Code.
It illustrates the source of the problem which arose in the case at bar. The
Crown, in proceeding as it did, was treating criminal contempt as an indictable
offence under the Code. The procedure in respect of indictable offences
enables an election for trial before the provincial court. Criminal contempt,
however, as preserved by s. 8 of the Code, is an offence derived from
the law of England and one which, according to the law of England which must be
applied here, has always been triable only in the superior courts. While it is
triable by indictment, it is not triable in Canada as an indictable offence
under Part XVI of the Code and the accused therefore has no right to an
election. It may be tried only in the superior court and, when an indictment
for criminal contempt is employed in Canada, it would seem that it would have
to be by direct indictment to the superior court.

 

12.              The
result then is that an accused, in this case the respondent, cannot by way of
election under s. 484(1) of the Code vest the provincial court with
jurisdiction which it does not possess. This is supported by the plain words of
the saving provision of the Code. It preserves for the court its
contempt powers which were derived from the common law. Jurisdiction to punish
for contempt ex facie has always been vested exclusively in the superior
courts and it remains so today. It therefore follows that the conviction of the
respondent cannot stand, the magistrate having no jurisdiction.

 

13.              As
a final note, it is my view that merely because the Crown may also have
proceeded under s. 127(2) of the Code (obstruction of justice), the
court was not precluded from relying on the contempt power under s. 8 . Support
for this view is to be found in the decision of this Court In re Gerson,
[1946] S.C.R. 538, where Rinfret C.J. stated, at p. 544:

 

                   The power to punish for contempt is
inherent in courts of superior original jurisdiction, quite independent of
enactments in codes or statutes relating to their disciplinary powers.

 

14.              For
these reasons, I would dismiss the Crown's appeal.

            Appellant
was arrested and charged with causing the death of his ex‑wife. Following
their separation in 1979 after seventeen years of marriage, the relation
between the estranged spouses became increasingly bitter and acrimonious as
they fought a long, hotly contested series of custody, access and matrimonial
property battles. On January 21, 1983, appellant's ex‑wife was
ferociously beaten and then shot to death. At trial, the Crown led direct and
circumstantial evidence to prove that the appellant had personally murdered his
ex‑wife or, alternatively, that he aided or abetted the killer and was
therefore guilty as a party to the offence pursuant to s. 21  of the Criminal
Code . The bulk of the evidence tendered by the Crown was consistent with
either theory.

 

            In
defence, appellant adduced alibi evidence and denied any involvement in the
killing. Several witnesses corroborated appellant's whereabouts at the time of
the crime.

 

            In
his charge, the trial judge instructed the jurors that the appellant could be
found guilty of murder if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he
was the principal offender or a party to the offence under s. 21 of the Code.
He explained briefly the position of the defence and spent considerable time
summarizing the Crown's evidence. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of
first degree murder contrary to s. 218 of the Code. The majority of the
Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.

 

            On
appeal to this Court, appellant contended that: (1) there was no evidentiary
basis for a direction pursuant to s. 21 of the Code; (2) the trial judge
failed to direct the jury on the application of the legal principles of parties
to an offence to the evidence of the case; (3) the trial judge erred in
directing the jury to weigh the appellant's evidence against the evidence of
other witnesses and to choose which they accepted, thereby reducing the burden
of proof; (4) the trial judge failed to summarize fairly and adequately the
evidence and the theory of the defence; and (5) the trial judge failed to
instruct the jury that a verdict of guilty must be unanimous in relation to one
or other of the alternative means of committing the offence of murder.

 

            Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.

 

            There
was an evidentiary foundation to justify putting to the jury the Crown's
alternative theory that appellant was a party to the offence under s. 21 ,
rather than a principal. Where an accused is being tried alone and there is
evidence that more than one person was involved in the commission of the
offence, it is also appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury with
respect to the provisions of s. 21 of the Code, even though the identity
of the other participant or participants is unknown and even though the precise
part played by each participant may be uncertain. Here, there was very strong
evidence connecting appellant with the crime. There was also some evidence
which, if believed, indicated that he did not commit the crime personally. The
facts were for the jury, and the trial judge was correct not to preclude the
jury from considering all the alternatives.

 

            The
trial judge adequately instructed the jury on the application of the legal
principles of s. 21  to the evidence in the case. He accurately stated the law
as to s. 21(1) and went through the evidence of each witness in turn. The fact
that he did not carve his jury charge into discrete sections in which he
reviewed the evidence consistent with appellant having personally committed the
murder, appellant having committed the murder by means of s. 21(1), and,
finally, appellant not having committed the murder at all, was not wrong. Much
of the Crown's evidence was consistent with either Crown theory, and much of
the defence evidence was consistent with either appellant's innocence or his
guilt under s. 21(1).

 

            The
contention that the trial judge erred in putting the jurors to a choice between
accepting the evidence of some witnesses or accepting appellant's evidence,
thereby reducing the burden of proof, must fail. Although one passage of the
trial judge's charge, if it stood alone, would be wrong in law, the charge,
read as a whole, made it clear that the jury was not obliged to take a binary
view of the evidence (accept or reject it) but had to give effect to reasonable
doubt.

 

            The
trial judge adequately summarized the evidence or the theory of the defence. A
trial judge is not required in his charge to paint in the details or to comment
on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of the
evidence. Here, the gist of the appellant's complaint is that the trial judge
revealed to the jurors his own perception of the accused's guilt, through undue
emphasis on the Crown's evidence and inadequate summary of the defence. The
defence evidence was simple and the Crown's case was complex, relying on
circumstantial evidence from a large number of witnesses. It is simply
inappropriate to try to measure the fairness of the charge by reference to
quantity. 

 

            Per
Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Estey, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: The trial judge did
not err in failing to instruct the jurors that they must be unanimous in the
way in which the murder was committed. Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code 
is designed to make the difference between aiding and abetting and personally
committing an offence legally irrelevant. It provides that either mode of
committing an offence is equally culpable and, indeed, that whether a person
personally commits or only aids and abets, he is guilty of that offence‑‑in
this case, murder‑‑and not some separate distinct offence. There is
no need for the Crown to specify in the charge the nature of an accused's
participation in the offence. Where there is evidence before a jury that points
to an accused either committing a crime personally or, alternatively, aiding
and abetting another to commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did one or the other, it is a matter
of indifference which alternative actually occurred. It follows that s. 21 
precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to the particular nature of the accused's
participation in the offence.

 

            Per
Lamer J.: The Crown presented two factually inconsistent theories: that the
appellant actually killed the deceased or that he aided and abetted the killer.
The overwhelming mass of the evidence against the appellant, however, was
consistent with both theories and pointed only to his participation in the
murder. The jury could not have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of one
theory to the exclusion of the other, but must have been convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the murder, either as
principal or aider and abettor. Since s. 21(1) of the Criminal Code 
makes the distinction between participation as a principal and participation as
aider and abettor legally irrelevant, it was not necessary for the jury to
decide on the form of his participation and the jury was correct in convicting.
But s. 21 does not always preclude a requirement of jury unanimity as to the
particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. Depending on
the nature of the evidence presented by the Crown, the jury unanimity issue may
arise in any case where the Crown alleges factually inconsistent theories, even
if those theories relate to the particular nature of the accused's
participation in the offence. If the Crown presents evidence which tends to
inculpate the accused under one theory and exculpate him under the other, then
the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they wish to rely on such
evidence, then they must be unanimous as to the theory they adopt. Otherwise,
the jury would be adding against the accused the inculpatory elements of
evidence which cannot stand together because they are inconsistent.

 

            Per
La Forest J.: Although alternative theories of culpability were advanced by the
Crown, there were ample grounds for the jury to find appellant guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt while remaining unsure whether he had committed the murder
himself or through another person. But there may be cases where the
interrelationship between competing Crown theories and the evidence adduced in
relation thereto will not justify a verdict of guilt. In each case, therefore,
it will be for the trial judge, having regard to the nature of the offence, the
theories of the parties, and the totality of the evidence, to realistically
assess the possibility that the evidence will be used improperly, and to direct
the jury accordingly. The present, however, is not such a case.

 

            Section
21  of the Criminal Code  is merely one example of a situation where the
Crown is relying on alternative theories of culpability to found an accused's
guilt. The fact that s. 21  makes the particular nature of the accused's
involvement in an offence legally irrelevant does not in and of itself justify
conviction on the basis of mutually exclusive or alternative theories of
culpability.

Colin Thatcher now appears before this Court requesting that the jury's guilty
verdict be set aside.

 

2                 The
position of the Crown throughout the trial was that Mr. Thatcher had murdered
Mrs. Wilson or alternatively that he caused someone else to do so and was
therefore guilty as a party to the offence pursuant to s. 21  of the Criminal
Code . Mr. Gerald N. Allbright, counsel for Mr. Thatcher, advances a number
of grounds of appeal in his factum: (i) that there existed no evidentiary basis
for a direction pursuant to s. 21 of the Code; (ii) that the trial judge
erred in failing to direct the jury on the application of the legal principles
of parties to an offence to the evidence of the case; (iii) that the trial
judge failed to summarize fairly and adequately the evidence and the theory of
the defence; (iv) that the trial judge erred in directing the jury to weigh the
evidence of Mr. Thatcher against the evidence of other witnesses and to choose
which they accepted, thereby reducing the burden of proof; and (v) that the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal erred in ruling that the curative provision found
in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code could be resorted to in the
circumstances of the case. These were all grounds in respect of which there was
dissent in the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, thereby giving rise to an
appeal to this Court as of right, pursuant to s. 618(1)(a) of the Code.

 

3                 Another
ground of appeal, in my view of more substance than those just described, was
also argued by counsel for Mr. Thatcher. It was not the subject of a dissent in
the Court of Appeal and was unanimously dismissed by that Court. Leave to argue
this ground was sought from this Court, and was granted. Counsel contended that
the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that a verdict of guilty
must be unanimous in relation to one or other of the alternative means of
committing the offence of murder. The effect of the argument, in the
circumstances of this case, was that in order to find Mr. Thatcher guilty of
murder, the jury had to be unanimous that he intentionally killed his former
wife or, alternatively, that he aided or abetted another person or persons in
her killing; it was simply not sufficient that some members of the jury would
hold to one theory and other members would hold to the other theory. That, as I
see it, is the principal issue in this appeal.

The
Facts

 

(i) Introductory

 

4                 Having
met as students at the University of Iowa, Colin Thatcher and his former wife
JoAnn were married on August 12, 1962. After their marriage, they returned to
Saskatchewan. They took up residence in Moose Jaw. Mr. Thatcher, the son of a
one‑time member of Parliament and Premier of Saskatchewan, developed over
the years an active and successful career as rancher, farmer and politician,
serving for a time as Minister of Energy and Mines in a Progressive
Conservative Government of Saskatchewan. Three children, Greg, Regan and
Stephanie, were born of the marriage. Thatcher admitted to infidelity during
the course of the marriage. The couple separated in August 1979. JoAnn, taking
the two youngest children with her, left Moose Jaw with Mr. Thatcher's best
friend, Ron Graham. Relations between the estranged spouses became increasingly
bitter and acrimonious as they fought a long, hotly contested series of
custody, access and matrimonial property battles. Colin Thatcher became
obsessed. At one juncture he spirited Regan out of the country, and was found
in contempt and ordered to pay a substantial fine. JoAnn's matrimonial property
entitlement was initially held to amount to $820,000 but the judgment was
immediately appealed. In 1980, the Thatchers were divorced. In January 1981,
JoAnn married Mr. Tony Wilson and moved into a house located across the street
from the Legislative Buildings in Regina.

 

(ii) The Spring of 1981

 

5                 On
the evening of Sunday, May 17, 1981 JoAnn Wilson was shot and wounded while in
the kitchen of her home. A bullet fired from a high‑powered rifle passed
through a triple glaze glass window and struck her in the shoulder. She was
hospitalized for about three weeks. The evidence was that JoAnn Wilson was
terrified by this attempt on her life. After the shooting, she gave up her
right to custody of Regan and, a year later, agreed to accept approximately one
half of the original court award, spread over five years. No one was charged
with the May 17, 1981 

incident.       

 

                   (iii) January
21, 1983

 

6                 At
about 6 o'clock in the evening of January 21, 1983, JoAnn Wilson came home,
drove into the garage of her home and was ferociously beaten and then shot to
death. Twenty‑seven wounds were inflicted on her head, neck, hands and
lower legs. The injuries included a broken arm, a fracture of the wrist and a
severed little left finger. A single bullet entered her skull causing death.

 

7                 Mr.
Craig Dotson testified as to the finding of the body. He stated that he left
work at the Legislative Buildings shortly before 6:00 p.m. on January 21, 1983,
and was walking home when he noted a green car with a female driver turn into
the garage at the Wilson residence. He continued walking for about a block. He
heard loud shrill screams behind him. He turned back to investigate. He heard a
single loud sharp noise and then silence. As he approached a lane near the
Wilson garage he saw a man emerge from the garage. He did not pay any
particular attention. It was dark. He was 30 to 40 feet from the individual. He
walked a little further and saw a body in a pool of blood on the floor of the
garage.

 

8                 Mr.
Dotson told the police he thought the man he momentarily observed had a beard,
was about thirty years old, five foot nine to five foot eleven in height, and
of medium build. A composite sketch prepared by the police with Mr. Dotson's
aid did not fit Colin Thatcher, whom Mr. Dotson knew as a member of the
Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly.

 

                                                                             II

 

The
Pre‑trial Proceedings

 

9                 As
stated, Mr. Thatcher was arrested on May 7, 1984 and was charged that he did
unlawfully cause the death of JoAnn Wilson contrary to s. 218  of the Criminal
Code . Section 218(1) of the Code provides:

 

                   218. (1) Every
one who commits first degree murder or second degree murder is guilty of an
indictable offence and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.

 

Sections
205(5)(a) and 212(a)(i) of the Code define culpable
homicide and murder, respectively. Section 205(5)(a) states:

 

                   205. ...

 

                   (5) A
person commits culpable homicide when he causes the death of a human being,

 

(a) by
means of an unlawful act.

 

Section
212(a)(i) provides:

 

                   212. Culpable
homicide is murder

 

(a) where
the person who causes the death of a human being

 

(i) means
to cause his death

 

Section
214 classifies murder into two types:

 

                   214. (1) Murder
is first degree murder or second degree murder.

 

                   (2) Murder
is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

 

                   (3) Without
limiting the generality of subsection (2), murder is planned and deliberate
when it is committed pursuant to an arrangement under which money or anything
of value passes or is intended to pass from one person to another, or is
promised by one person to another, as consideration for that other's causing or
assisting in causing the death of anyone or counselling or procuring another
person to do any act causing or assisting in causing that death.

 

10               A
preliminary inquiry was held in Regina, Saskatchewan, from the 25th to the 28th
of June, 1984, following which Mr. Thatcher was committed to stand trial as
charged. An indictment was ultimately preferred in the Court of Queen's Bench
for the province of Saskatchewan. In August 1984, an application was taken to
the Court of Queen's Bench requesting a change of venue and the Court directed
that the trial be held at the City of Saskatoon. 

 

11               In
September 1984, prior to the commencement of trial, defence counsel launched a
motion to the trial judge seeking an order directing the Crown to furnish
particulars to the accused ""to further describe the means by which the
accused is alleged to have caused the death of JoAnn Kay Wilson"". This
order was sought pursuant to s. 516(1)(f) of the Code. The
defence also sought an order ""directing disclosure by the prosecutor of
all intercepted private communications to which the accused is in any way a
party, or which relate in any way to the telephone or telephones of any residence
or other buildings used or frequented by the accused, or which relate directly
or indirectly to the charge facing the accused."" The judge, dismissing the
first application (reported at (1984), 42 C.R. (3d) 259), relied upon the
judgment of Martin J.A. in R. v. Govedarov, Popovic and Askov (1974), 16
C.C.C. (2d) 238 (Ont. C.A.), and adopted the following passages from that
judgment, at pp. 269‑70, as a correct statement of the law:

 

                   The
indictment had been preceded by a preliminary hearing lasting several days.
Clearly, the purpose of the application for particulars was not to require the
prosecution to provide the accused with additional details with respect to
matters referred to in the indictment in order that the accused might be more
fully informed of the act or omission charged against them but was to restrict
the prosecution to reliance on a part only of the definition of murder
contained in the Criminal Code .

 

He
concluded at p. 265:

 

                   From
the foregoing authorities I am satisfied that the accused is not entitled to an
order for the particulars he seeks. If there is evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury could find that the accused committed the offence or that he
was a party to the commission of an offence by a person or persons unknown, it
must be left to the jury to make either of such findings and their right to do
so may not be restricted by an order for particulars. The application for
particulars is accordingly dismissed.

 

The
trial judge, on the second application, for disclosure of intercepted private
communications, granted such disclosure in part.

 

                                                                            III

 

The
Case for the Crown

 

12               At
trial, the case for the Crown rested upon an evidential base of both direct and
circumstantial evidence, which I will now seek to summarize:

 

(i)                The Apparent Surveillance
Prior to the Killing

 

13               Margaret
Johannsson testified that she observed a car parked almost directly opposite
the Wilson garage on the day before the killing. The motor was not running. The
lights were out. A male individual was seated behind the wheel. The car was
blue in colour and had what appeared to be a government safety sticker on the
back bumper.

 

14               Joan
Hasz testified that she observed a blue car parked opposite the house in which
she was employed (a block west of the Wilson residence) on the three afternoons
preceding the killing. The car was placed so that it could command an
unobstructed view of the Wilson garage. It was occupied by a single male. The
motor was not running. This upset Mrs. Hasz and she informed her employer, Mr.
Adams, who watched the car for fifteen minutes. As Mrs. Hasz left for home she
decided to look at the license but could only read the numbers as the letters
were covered with mud. She memorized the numbers 292 and repeated them as she
drove home. When she arrived, she wrote them down. The occupant of the vehicle
was described as a relatively young male of medium build with a beard, wearing
a toque and what appeared to be rubber or surgical gloves. A police composite
of the person Mrs. Hasz and Mr. Adams described did not fit Mr. Thatcher. One
of the admissions of fact made on behalf of the accused was this: a 1980 Olds
Delta 88 automobile bearing Saskatchewan license plate KDW 292 and owned by the
Government of Saskatchewan was on January 10, 1983 checked out from the Central
Vehicle Agency, Regina, to W. Colin Thatcher and remained checked out to him
until it was picked up by the Regina City Police on January 27, 1983.

 

15               The
witness Charles Guillaum testified that, at a much earlier date, on the
appellant's instructions he returned a government car to the government garage.
Under the front seat of that car he found a holster for a handgun which he
turned over to the Regina City Police.

 

(ii) The Credit Card

 

16               During
their investigation immediately following the killing the police found a Shell
Oil credit card receipt lying on top of the snow some eight feet from the
southeast door of the garage. The receipt bore what appeared to be the
signature of Colin Thatcher. The owner of the service station confirmed the
purchase by Mr. Thatcher of gasoline from J. & M. Shell Service in Caron,
Saskatchewan on January 18, 1983. 

 

(iii) The Gun and the Bullet

 

17               According
to expert police testimony, JoAnn Wilson was probably struck in the head with a
.38 Special Plus P, aluminum‑jacketed, 95 grain bullet manufactured by
Winchester. The bullet was probably fired from a .38 Special or .357 Magnum
Ruger revolver. The murder weapon was never found. The proprietor of a gun shop
in Palm Springs, California, Ronald Williams, testified that on January 29,
1982 he sold Colin Thatcher a .357 calibre Ruger revolver. Thatcher picked up
the gun along with a holster and ammunition on February 20, 1982. The
ammunition consisted of two boxes of Winchester western .38 calibre Special
Plus P silver tip hollow point shells and two bags of reloaded ammunition. The
Winchester ammunition had a bullet with an aluminum jacket and a lead core. The
witness also identified the holster found by the witness, Guillaum, as being
consistent with the holster he sold to Colin Thatcher.

 

(iv) The Evidence of Lynn Mendell

 

18               The
Crown also called Lynn Mendell, of Palm Springs, California, a former
girlfriend of Colin Thatcher. Ms. Mendell described the bitterness Thatcher
constantly expressed about JoAnn Wilson, and how he maintained many times that
he wanted to kill her or arrange with someone to do it for him. She testified
that this was on his mind all the time. According to Ms. Mendell, Thatcher told
her he had met with someone in Saskatchewan whom he wanted to hire to kill
JoAnn Wilson. He eventually told her the plan fell through but that he would
have to go about it one way or another. These conversations took place in late
1980 and early 1981.

 

19               Lynn
Mendell also told the Court that in May of 1981 Thatcher phoned and told her
his ex‑wife had been shot and wounded. She testified that when he came
down to Palm Springs a few days later, he told her someone had rented a car for
him; that he, Thatcher, wore a disguise; and that he had staked out an area
that was visually accessible but, because he did not gauge the thickness of the
glass, the bullet deflected and struck JoAnn Wilson on the shoulder. According
to Ms. Mendell, he told her:

 

Gee,
I didn't gauge the thickness of the glass so the bullet obviously deflected
because I only got her in the shoulder.

 

She
also stated that Thatcher told her he left Regina and ran into roadblocks; that
he went out into the fields where he got rid of the gun, the wig, and the
overalls and then made his way back to Moose Jaw. According to Ms. Mendell, the
only thing that saved him was the fact that the police did not go to his home
to see if he were there.

 

20               Lynn
Mendell also testified she knew Thatcher had a handgun in Palm Springs. She saw
him pack that gun into a Barbie Doll shower box with newspaper, and place the
box in his suitcase prior to his leaving for Canada. A box matching that
description, with a label which showed it had been purchased in Palm Springs,
and containing old copies of the Los Angeles Times, was found by Regina
City police in a small cupboard adjoining the master bedroom of Thatcher's home
in Moose Jaw.

 

21               On
the day of the killing, Ms. Mendell said she received two calls from Thatcher,
one early and another later in the evening. During the first call Colin
Thatcher told her:

 

Well,
I'm going out now. This might be the night, stick around.

 

During
the later call he said:

 

Oh,
my God, I've just been called...Apparently JoAnn has been shot in her home and
has been killed.

 

Thatcher,
according to Ms. Mendell, came to Palm Springs a few days after the fatal
shooting. She said to him:

 

Well,
you really did it, didn't you.

 

She
said he scowled, nodded, pointed to the walls, and told her not to talk there.
Later, when they were outside the condominium, he was alleged to have said:

 

I
have to admit it is a strange feeling to have blown your wife away.

 

When
press reports of the shooting and beating appeared in the Desert Sun he
allegedly said:

 

I
don't know why they said she was beaten. I didn't beat her.

 

22               Ms.
Mendell acknowledged that she did not contact the authorities immediately after
these incidents. 

 

(v) The Evidence of Gary Anderson

 

23               Gary
Anderson testified under an agreement of immunity from prosecution. Anderson is
a farmer from the Caron district and a rural neighbour of Colin Thatcher. He
testified he had met Thatcher in the fall of 1980 and Thatcher had asked him if
he was interested in killing JoAnn Wilson for a fee of $50,000 or, if not,
whether he could find someone to do it for him. Anderson stated he knew another
person named Charlie Wilde who might be interested. Wilde suggested a third
person, Cody Crutcher, who would be willing to take on the job. Anderson stated
that Thatcher gave him $15,000 to pass on to Crutcher, and that Anderson paid
some $14,500 to Crutcher, together with a picture of JoAnn Wilson and a set of
her car keys. Nothing came of this and Anderson then arranged for a meeting
with Charlie Wilde at a farm north of Caron, Saskatchewan in the spring of
1981. At that meeting Charlie Wilde told Thatcher he would do the job himself
while visiting the United States. Before doing anything, however, Charlie Wilde
was arrested in Winnipeg on an unrelated matter.

 

24               Anderson
testified that Thatcher got him to purchase a .303 Lee Enfield rifle and some
ammunition. On May 16 or 17, 1981, prior to the wounding of Mrs. Wilson,
Anderson, at Thatcher's request, rented a car for Thatcher and turned it over
to him by dropping it off at a prearranged location. On instructions given by
Thatcher, An­derson waited to hear of the wounding of JoAnn Wilson before he
went back to get the car. Once he had heard she had been shot he returned to
the place where he had left the car, retrieved the vehicle, cleaned it and
returned it to the rental dealer. He noted that the car was dusty and that the
licence plates were smeared with mud. Anderson testified that in the fall of
1982 he again met with Thatcher and asked him how he could have missed, to
which the appellant answered that he did not know.

 

25               Anderson
further stated that when he again met Thatcher in late 1982, Thatcher turned
over a handgun to him with a request that he find a silencer for it. The gun
was a .357 calibre Magnum Security Special. Anderson was unsuccessful in
getting a workable silencer made and on January 20, 1983 he saw Thatcher and
reported that to him. At that time Thatcher told him he had been stalking his
ex‑wife for a week and that he wanted the gun back. The gun was turned
over to Thatcher on the afternoon of January 21, 1983. Earlier that morning Thatcher
asked Anderson to get him a car. Anderson turned that over to Thatcher on that
day on directions given him by Thatcher. Anderson then read in the newspaper
that JoAnn Wilson had been killed. That was his signal to retrieve the car from
where he had left it for Thatcher. He got the car back, cleaned it out, cleaned
the licence plates off, and burned the items he removed from the vehicle. In
cleaning out the car the witness testified that he removed clothing he had seen
Thatcher wearing when Anderson turned the car over to him, plus a tuft of hair
he thought came from a wig.

 

26               Finally,
Anderson testified that on May 1, 1984 he again met Thatcher at a deserted farm
near Caron. He had been provided with a body pack tape recorder to record the
conversation between himself and Thatcher. A brief extract from the
conversation follows:

 

 

 

Anderson: 
Umm, I got rid of the ah stuff outta' the car.

 

Thatcher: 
Good.

 

Anderson: 
You kinda' give me a scare there with, I found             the stuff laying and
then I wondered what the              hell, I didn't know where the hell you,
what the             hell you'd done with the gun. (Sighs).

 

Thatcher: 
Listen, don't even talk...

 

Anderson: 
Hm.

 

Thatcher: 
...like that. Don't. Don't, don't even...Walk              out this way a
little (unintelligible).

 

Anderson: 
(Grunts)

 

Thatcher: 
No. There are, there are no loose ends at all.             And ah...

 

(Muffled
noises.)

 

Thatcher: 
...y'know, they've gone at every which                     direction. Umm, is
there any way a loose end               from a couple years ago can ever
resurface?

 

Anderson: 
Ahhh.

 

Thatcher: 
From some of ahh, some of the guys tha, th, that             ah, discussing
some business with. Is there any             way can ever be a problem surface
from them?

 

Anderson: 
Mmm, y'mean the, from Vancouver and Winnipeg?              Ahh. I ah located
one of 'em.

 

Thatcher: 
The one that I met or the other one?

 

Anderson: 
Ahh, the other one.

 

Thatcher: 
Son‑of‑a‑bitch.

 

Anderson: 
Well. It's up to you.

 

Thatcher: 
Is he in, or, he's not in jail now is he, or in             any trouble?

 

Anderson: 
Not to my knowledge.

 

                   Again:

 

Thatcher: 
Okay an' just remember there are no er, no                 problems an' there
won't be unless they trip               over something an' I got no intention
of giving             them anything to trip on.

 

Anderson: 
'Kay.

 

Thatcher: 
There's no loose ends like, y'know, there's                nothin' for them t'
find. Y'know.

 

Anderson: 
It's all been...

 

Thatcher: 
All...

 

Anderson: 
...taken care of.

 

Thatcher: 
Sure. Heavens yes. Heavens yes. I'm ahh, but I             still don't trust
the bastards for bugs. Mean,             I don't know whether there's any
possibility               that that, 'ts why when we talk ah, just
assume             the bastards are listening. 

 

(vi) The Evidence of Charles Wilde

 

27               Charles
Wilde testified that in the summer of 1980 he met Gary Anderson while they were
fellow inmates in a Regina jail. Anderson later asked him if he was interested
in doing a killing. At that time Wilde told Anderson he was not interested.
Wilde later talked to his friend Cody Crutcher and they decided that, while
they would not do the killing, they would be happy to take the money offered
for it. In December 1980, Anderson, Wilde and Crutcher met in Regina. Anderson
gave Crutcher $7,500 which Crutcher split with Wilde. Shortly after that Wilde
again met with Anderson and got another $7,000 plus a picture of the intended
victim, JoAnn Wilson, and her car keys. In March 1981, Wilde met with Anderson
and Thatcher. At that time Thatcher pressed him to do the job and offered him
50 to 60 thousand dollars if he would complete the killing. He told Wilde that
his ex‑wife, her husband, and Stephanie were going to Ames, Iowa, to
visit her parents during the Easter week of 1981. He indicated that Ames would
be a good place to ""hit"" her, gave the Iowa address to Wilde, and
suggested that he, Wilde, could phone him in a few days at the Legislature, by
which time he would probably have some money available. While Wilde said he had
no intention of killing anyone, he agreed to do what was asked in order to see
if he could get some money. At a subsequent meeting with Thatcher, Thatcher
gave Wilde $4,500 to assist him in travelling to the United States where JoAnn
was visiting her parents. Shortly after, Wilde was arrested in Winnipeg for
breaking into a drugstore. Wilde acknowledged having a lengthy criminal record,
mainly for drug offences.

 

(vii) The Evidence of Richard Collver

 

28               Mr.
Collver and Mr. Thatcher both sat as members of the Saskatchewan Legislature,
the latter being then a member of the Liberal Party while Mr. Collver led the
Provincial Progressive Conservative Party. In time Mr. Collver persuaded
Thatcher to join the Conservative caucus, and the two became close personal
friends. Their friendship continued after Mr. Collver resigned as Leader of his
Party and sat as an independent Member.

 

29               Collver
testified that during the 1979 fall session of the Legislature Thatcher
repeatedly talked to him, Collver, about his marital problems, so much so that
Mr. Collver thought him obsessed‑‑he couldn't think about politics
or anything else. Collver invited Thatcher and several members of his family to
visit over Christmas at his dude ranch near Phoenix, Arizona. The following
extract from the charge of the trial judge will indicate the nature of
Collver's further evidence.

 

                   Collver
testified that the morning following their arrival he and Thatcher were talking
about Thatcher's problems over coffee. He said that Thatcher told him he had to
find someone to kill her. According to Collver he and Thatcher had previously
talked about some horrible people two lawyer friends of Collver knew in Calgary
and Edmonton. And he testified that Thatcher wanted him to phone one and get
somebody to assist him in killing his wife. Collver says he told Thatcher he
was suffering from an obsession and that he should get rid of it. When Thatcher
renewed the request at least three more times the same day, Collver asked him
to leave the ranch and he and the family departed the following morning.

 

                   The
following spring, 1980, when the Legislature was in session, Collver testified
that Thatcher again approached him about negotiating a settlement. He told
Thatcher he would be bled to death if he kept on with lawyers, but that if he
would give him a bottom line, that he, Collver, would try to negotiate a
settlement. Thatcher told him his bottom line was $400,000.00 and custody of
the two boys. Collver said he met with JoAnn and she asked him if she could bring
in a friend to assist her, who it turned out was Tony Wilson. The upshot of the
meeting was that JoAnn would accept $230,000.00 and custody of Stephanie, with
Thatcher to have custody of the two boys. Collver said he was ecstatic. He
immediately telephoned Thatcher and told him what he had achieved. According to
Collver Thatcher's reply was, ""The bitch isn't going to get
anything."" This ended the attempt by Collver to assist his friend
Thatcher.

 

30               Collver
indicated that he had not conveyed this information in any fashion to the
authorities until shortly before his testimony at the trial. He had withheld
such information after receiving legal advice to the effect that he was under
no legal duty of disclosure.

 

                                                                            IV

 

The
Defence

 

31               Seven
witnesses were called by the defence. As well, the accused testified on his own
behalf. One witness, Mr. Wayne Mantyka, a Regina newscaster, was called to
support the claim that ammunition allegedly used to commit the crime could be
obtained not only in the United States but also in Canada. The other six
witnesses were called in support of Thatcher's version of his whereabouts on
the night of the killing, as well as on the night of the first shooting.

 

32               The
credibility of these witnesses was critical to meeting the Crown's primary
submission. Regina, where Mrs. Wilson was killed, is over forty miles east of
Moose Jaw. Moose Jaw is about eighteen miles east of Thatcher's ranch in Caron.
Mr. Dotson's testimony was that he discovered the body at approximately 6:00
p.m. A test conducted by the police determined that it was possible to travel
from the victim's house in Regina to the appellant's residence in Moose Jaw in
roughly twenty‑eight minutes. Testimony indicating that Mr. Thatcher was
elsewhere would, if believed, go to rebut the allegation that he personally
murdered his ex‑wife. It would not, however, be relevant to the Crown's
alternative submission that he caused someone else to commit the act. 

 

(i) The Evidence of Mrs. Barbara Wright

 

33               Mrs.
Barbara Wright, the wife of Thatcher's farm manager, testified that she had
seen Mr. Thatcher drive into his ranch between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. on the day of
the murder. She estimated this time partly by reference to her belief that she
left work shortly after 4:00 p.m. that afternoon. She said she was in the
kitchen when Thatcher drove into the yard in his truck shortly after 5:00 p.m.
She said she did not speak to him and only observed his movements through the
window. He left after about twenty minutes. She testified that at about 7:00
p.m., Thatcher telephoned to say that Mrs. Wilson had been murdered.

 

34               In
cross‑examination, she acknowledged that her work records showed that she
was not working on the day of the murder, but she explained this discrepancy by
stating that she had exchanged shifts with a fellow employee and that this
exchange did not show up in the records. Also in cross‑examination, she
admitted that she did not give this information to the police when she was
interviewed several days after the murder. She stated that, at that time, she
did not think of Thatcher as a suspect. She also admitted to speaking with Mr.
Thatcher the night before swearing an affidavit in which similar statements
about his whereabouts were made. She denied, however, that suggestions were
made to her as to what she may have seen on the day of the murder.

 

(ii) The Evidence of Mr. Patrick Hammond

 

35               Mr.
Patrick Hammond, a railroad employee who had done a ""substantial
amount"" of work on Mr. Thatcher's vehicles, testified that he saw Mr.
Thatcher, on the day in question, driving in Moose Jaw at approximately 5:30
p.m. In cross‑examination, he acknowledged that, when he was interviewed
by the police a few days after the murder, he did not inform the police that he
saw Mr. Thatcher. He stated that he did not think this information was
important until after Mr. Thatcher was arrested and charged. Similar evidence
as to Mr. Thatcher's whereabouts was given by Mr. Hammond in support of
Thatcher's bail application.

 

(iii)               The Evidence of Mrs. Sandra
Silversides

 

36               The
defence also called Mrs. Sandra Silversides, a government employee in Moose
Jaw, as well as the appellant's constituency secretary and part‑time
housekeeper. Mrs. Silversides is the sister of Patrick Hammond. Mrs.
Silversides testified that she had arrived at the Thatcher residence in Moose
Jaw at 5 o'clock and that, while Mr. Thatcher was not at home when she arrived,
he came into the kitchen at approximately 6 o'clock to eat the Hamburger Helper
she had prepared for dinner. She further stated that she left the Thatcher
residence at 6:15 p.m. and that Gregory, Thatcher's son, called her at 7:30
that evening and asked her to come over because something had happened to his
mother. She stated that when she arrived Mr. Thatcher was sitting in the
kitchen staring at the wall.

 

37               On
cross‑examination, Mrs. Silversides admitted that she gave a statement
similar to her evidence at trial in an affidavit in support of Mr. Thatcher's
bail application and that she ""could have talked [with Thatcher] about
what happened that night"". She also stated in cross‑examination that
she was suing the police for false arrest.

 

(iv) The Thatcher Sons

 

38               Regan
Thatcher testified that he was at home with his father at the time of the
earlier shooting and also when his mother was murdered. He stated that, on the
day of the murder, he came home from school between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m., that
his father came in about 5:30 p.m. and that he, his brother, his father and
Mrs. Silversides ate dinner at about 6 o'clock.

 

39               Gregory
Thatcher testified that he arrived home from school earlier than his brother,
at about 3:45 p.m., and saw his father, who left shortly thereafter to go to
the ranch. At about 5:15 or 5:30 p.m., his father returned. His evidence as to
what occurred subsequently was similar to that given by his brother and Mrs.
Silversides.

 

(v) The Evidence of Mr. Anthony Merchant

 

40               Mr.
Merchant, a lawyer and a one‑time member of the Legislative Assembly,
testified that he became acquainted with Colin Thatcher in the early 1970's. He
subsequently became Thatcher's counsel in relation to the appellant's
matrimonial disputes.

 

41               In
addition to testifying as to Mr. Thatcher's whereabouts the night Mrs. Wilson
was wounded, Mr. Merchant testified that, on the night she was killed, one of
his partners called to tell him that there appeared to have been a shooting at
the Wilson residence. He stated that he immediately called Thatcher at his
home, at ""about 6:15 p.m."" and passed on this information. Shortly
thereafter, a reporter came to his house who told him that perhaps Mrs. Wilson
had been killed. He stated that he ""waited a bit of time"" and then
called the appellant again, ""shortly after seven o'clock"", with that
information, informed him that he was going out, and gave Thatcher a number at
which he could be reached should the police arrive. Merchant then went to the
Wilson residence and spoke to a police officer who confirmed that Mrs. Wilson
indeed had been killed. He testified that he then telephoned Thatcher again
with the news, at approximately 7:20 p.m. The next morning, he advised Thatcher
that he had a legal right to take custody of his daughter Stephanie. He
testified that he, Thatcher, and Thatcher's son Gregory, thereafter personally
attended the Kohli home, where Stephanie was staying, and that some physical
force was used to take custody of Stephanie. 

 

42               Mr.
Merchant also testified as to Mr. Thatcher's whereabouts on the night Mrs.
Wilson was wounded on May 17, 1981. He testified that he retained the original
telephone record of a call he had made to Thatcher that evening, as well as the
original record of two of the three calls to Thatcher the night Mrs. Wilson was
killed. He described three mysterious break‑ins of his office, which
resulted in the disappearance of these records, and stressed that these break‑ins
occurred after Thatcher had been arrested and after Mr. Merchant had disclosed
the existence of the records in an affidavit supporting Thatcher's bail
application. Mr. Merchant implied that they were stolen because they were
otherwise protected by the solicitor and client relationship. Mr. Merchant's
testimony proved to be incorrect. On the day following his testimony, defence counsel
addressed the court as follows:

 

Thank
you, My Lord. My Lord, just prior to calling my next witness, I wonder, there
is a matter I would like to address you as an officer of the court, and I just
mentioned it briefly to my Learned Friend and I think it should be done by way,
in my view as an officer of the court, as a brief submission so that the
evidence is clear before the Jury and there is no misconception. I received a
telephone call this morning at nine thirty from Mr. Merchant, who of course was
here yesterday, who advised me that he had checked with his partners in Regina
and that the break‑in occurred before, and I think this is very
important, and I want to clarify it, the break‑ins occurred before Mr.
Thatcher was arrested and of course that certainly wasn't what he indicated to
us in his cross‑examination to us yesterday. And as an officer of the
court I want that raised and clarified now, My Lord. Mr. Kujawa was kind enough
to agree that it would be appropriate for me to rise and address you on it at
this time. Mr. Merchant advised me of that at nine‑thirty this morning
when I was in the barrister's lounge by telephone. I wish to bring it to your
attention and the attention of the Jury.

 

(vi) The Evidence of Colin Thatcher

 

43               Colin
Thatcher testified for more than two days. With respect to the earlier
unsuccessful attempt on his ex‑wife's life, he testified that on the
evening in question he was with his son Regan at home, and that they were
opening up the swimming pool for the summer. As to the day his ex‑wife
was killed, Mr. Thatcher testified that he spent the morning of January 21 at
his ranch in Caron, that he went to his residence in Moose Jaw over the noon
hour to do some paper work and odds and ends, and that he returned between 4:00
and 4:30 in the afternoon to his ranch. He stated that he checked his cattle
for approximately half an hour and then returned home to Moose Jaw. On his way
home, in Moose Jaw, Thatcher stated that he exchanged waves with Mr. Hammond. His
testimony as to his subsequent whereabouts on that evening parallelled that
given by Mrs. Silversides, his sons and Mr. Merchant.

 

44               Thatcher
also testified as to his relationship with Lynn Mendell. He said he met her in
October, 1980 in Palm Springs, California, and that they got along well but
that she ""had a misconception...that there was some remote possibility
that we might be getting married"". He denied several aspects of her
testimony. First, he denied that he went down to Palm Springs a few days after
the first shooting, saying it was more like four or five weeks after the event.
Second, he denied telling her in relation to that shooting that he donned a
disguise, staked out a visibly accessible area and only wounded Mrs. Wilson
because he did not gauge the thickness of the kitchen window. Third, though he
testified that six or seven days after his ex‑wife was killed he went to
Palm Springs and spent some time with Ms. Mendell, he denied telling her that
it was ""a strange feeling to blow your wife away"". He testified
instead that Ms. Mendell asked him whether he killed her and he stated, ""I
cannot imagine what a strange feeling that that would be. No, of course
not."" Fourth, he denied packaging a revolver in a toy shower box and
bringing it to Canada. He described this allegation as a ""pretty good
trick"", concocted by Ms. Mendell.

 

45               With
respect to the gun and bullets, he acknowledged that he had bought a .357
Magnum Ruger revolver plus a holster and ammunition but, as stated, he denied
bringing it back to Canada. He stated that it was stolen from his condominium
in Palm Springs and he suspected a cleaning woman took it. He also admitted
using Hollow Point bullets, but only to practice shooting in the desert. He
stated he knew nothing about the holster found in his car by Mr. Guillaum; he
testified that his holster was of a different type and had his name on it.

 

46               In
his examination‑in‑chief, Thatcher stated further that he had no
explanation as to why a credit card invoice would be present eight feet from
the Wilson's garage door on the night of the murder. In cross‑examination,
he suggested that it may have been planted by someone.

 

47               With
respect to the evidence given by Gary Anderson about being asked by Thatcher to
obtain a silencer for a weapon, and as to picking up and cleaning the car and
burning items contained in it a few days after the murder, Thatcher stated that
these stories too were concocted. He said his initial contact with Mr. Anderson
grew out of an attempt in November 1980 to purchase or rent land from the
Andersons. No arrangement was concluded and the matter was left open so that
Mr. Anderson would have a chance to discuss the proposition with his mother.
Anderson contacted him a few months later to inform him that the land would be
rented to someone else. During that meeting, the conversation shifted to the
subject of Ron Graham. Thatcher testified that Anderson told him that Graham
may have been ""cutting corners"" in his construction work, and that
he, Thatcher, agreed to give Anderson some money to cover expenses while
checking out this possibility. That spring, Thatcher stated that he met Anderson
on a country road and the latter told him that two men from Calgary were coming
into town. Thatcher told Anderson where he would be the following day, and
Anderson thereafter showed up with a man Thatcher subsequently knew to be
Charlie Wilde, though he did not know Wilde ""from a bale of hay""
until the preliminary hearing. At that meeting, they told him that they could
""lay a good licking on [Ron Graham] or ...go even further than that"".
Thatcher told them that he wasn't interested in the idea, though he agreed to
pay Anderson $500 expenses in connection with the trip from Calgary. 

 

48               After
the murder, Thatcher testified that he saw Anderson in Regina in late 1982.
After exchanging a few remarks, they went to the appellant's parking space
behind the Legislature. There An­derson complained that his car had been
towed away from the Legislative grounds. Thatcher testified that he arranged
for its return, and later talked to Anderson in the car‑‑a Dodge‑‑where
inadvertently he left his top coat, scarf and gloves. He said he did not
realize this until some time later, and did not see Anderson again until May 1,
1984, the day their conversation was recorded by body‑pack.

 

49               Thatcher
also testified about this recorded conversation, and said he was speaking in
""Caron slang"". He explained various parts of the conversation to the
jury. For example, he said he believed Anderson was referring to the top coat,
scarf, and gloves, when he said: ""Umm, I got rid of the ah stuff outta'
the car."" And he, Thatcher, was referring to a Tansy Mustard Plant he
spotted in the field when he said ""son‑of‑a‑bitch""
after Anderson said ""Ahh, the other one."" Thatcher said he talked to
Anderson on this occasion because he was interested in knowing what the police
were doing and saying to Anderson. Moreover, he stated that An­derson felt
he had $500 coming to him, and that he, Thatcher, did not want a person of
Anderson's temperament on his back. Anderson, he suggested, was capable of burning
granaries or haystacks if annoyed. He wanted to keep on reasonably good terms
with him. Accordingly, on Thursday evening, just before dark, he left the sum
of $550 for Mr. Anderson at the spot where it was located by the police.

 

50               Thatcher
also denied meeting with Charlie Wilde to give him money or information about
Mrs. Wilson's travel plans so that she could be killed in the United States. He
also denied using Anderson as a go‑between to arrange to have his wife
murdered, and said he did not advance $15,000 for disbursement by Anderson.

 

51               With
respect to the evidence given by Mr. Coll­ver, Mr. Thatcher also told a
different story. Thatcher testified that on New Year's Eve his and Collver's
families went out to dinner, consumed a great deal of alcohol, and returned to
Collver's dude ranch for a New Year's Eve party. He testified that ""Dick
is the cheapest drunk in the world"" and that, the next morning, when he
went down to the kitchen, Collver was sitting there in ""that never never
land when you are still half drunk and hung over"". Thatcher stated that at
that time he sought advice from Collver on the legal options available to him
in relation to his marital problems, and that Collver told him that he could go
to court, settle, or kill his wife. Thatcher testified that Collver was not
serious about the third option, that Collver was hung over and used the third
option as a rhetorical way of attempting to persuade Thatcher to settle with
his wife.

 

52               In
his charge to the jury, the trial judge explained the position of the defence
briefly as follows: (i) that the evidence did not satisfy the duty on the Crown
to establish that Thatcher either killed JoAnn Wilson or that she was killed at
his direction; (ii) that the composite drawings were obviously not likenesses
of Thatcher; (iii) that the credit card receipt was planted on the scene by
someone who wanted to attach blame to Thatcher; (iv) that the tape recorded the
statement of Thatcher that he was at home with four people the night of the
murder; (v) that Thatcher was seen in Caron when he was supposed to be stalking
JoAnn Wilson; (vi) that ammunition of the type used to kill JoAnn was readily
available in Canada contrary to police evidence; (vii) that Lynn Mendell was
seeking money and power if she could not get Thatcher by marriage she would get
him another way; (viii) that Wilde would do anything for a dollar; (ix) that
Anderson failed on the tape because he did not dare attempt to get an admission
of guilt from Thatcher; and finally, (x) that witnesses testified that Colin
Thatcher had been in Moose Jaw and at his ranch the evening of January 21,
1983, the day of the murder.

 

                                                                             V

 

The
Charge and the Verdict

 

53               In
his charge to the jury, despite objection from counsel for the defence, the
trial judge indicated to the jury the following direction on potential
culpability:

 

At
the outset I should explain to you that there are two ways in which the offence
of murder could have been committed by this accused. If you find on the
evidence and are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Colin Thatcher did
that act or actions himself that caused the death of JoAnn Wilson, it is open
to you to find him guilty of murder. Alternatively, if you find that acts done
or performed by the accused resulted in the death of JoAnn Wilson and were done
with the intent that they cause her death, even though the actual killing was
done by another or others, it is open to you to find this accused guilty of
murder.

 

54               The
trial judge also referred the jury to s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code  and
further commented:

 

Colin
Thatcher is charged with committing the offence of murder. If you do not find
that he did the act of murder himself, he is equally guilty if you find and are
satisfied that he either aided or abetted another or others in its commission. 

 

During
the charge, the trial judge alluded to the argument of defence counsel that if
the jury accepted the evidence of even one of the witnesses who said he was in
Moose Jaw at the time of the murder, Thatcher could not have committed the
murder. Counsel also told the jury that as the Crown had not produced any
evidence that anyone else killed JoAnn Wilson it was the duty of the jury to
find him not guilty. The trial judge said:

 

With
respect, I am unable to agree with this argument. I tell you as a matter of law
that the fact that the Crown cannot adduce evidence that another individual or
individuals actually did the act, does not preclude you from finding that the
killing was done on behalf of Colin Thatcher and it is still open to you to
return a finding of guilty of murder if you so find.

 

The
judge left the jury with three possible verdicts: not guilty, guilty of first
degree murder, or guilty of second degree murder. The jury deliberated from
Friday, November 2, 1984 through until Tuesday, November 6, 1984 before
returning the verdict of guilty of the offence of first degree murder contrary
to s. 218  of the Criminal Code .

 

                                                                            VI

 

The
Court of Appeal

 

55               The
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, [1986] 2 W.W.R. 97. Hall
J.A. was of the opinion that no error of law had been shown that would justify
the Court of Appeal setting aside the conviction. The charge to the jury, when
read as a whole, was fair and correct. Hall J.A., at p. 105, held that:

 

The
direction of the trial judge to the jury, when reduced to its essence, was that
if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant either killed the
deceased himself or caused someone else to kill her, they should find him
guilty as charged. Against the background of the evidence adduced that was all
that was necessary to properly place the issue before the jury.

 

and:

 

                   In
my opinion, it would have been most unreasonable for the jury to have reached
any verdict other than it did. It is not a case where it is necessary to
consider the curative provisions of Criminal Code  contained in s. 613 .

 

56               Tallis
J.A. delivered a more lengthy judgment dismissing the appeal, in which Bayda
C.J.S. and Brownridge J.A. concurred. He found the situation in this case
somewhat analogous to R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 124, where this
Court stated, at p. 139:

 

Murder,
like other offences in the Criminal Code , such as theft, may be
committed in one of several ways. Culpable homicide may be murder under either
s. 212  or s. 213 . Both sections begin with the words ""Culpable homicide is
murder where"". Farrant was charged with murder. He might fall foul of
either section. There was evidence upon which the jury could find a forcible
confinement, and the trial judge was correct in stating that, as a matter of
law, he was obliged to put both s. 212  and 213  to the jury.

 

Tallis
J.A. also adopted the reasoning of Martin J.A. in R. v. Sparrow (1979),
51 C.C.C. (2d) 443 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 458, quoted with favour by McIntyre J. in
R. v. Isaac, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 74, at p. 81:

 

I
am of the view that it is also appropriate, where an accused is being tried
alone and there is evidence that more than one person was involved in the
commission of the offence, to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of
s. 21 of the Code, even though the identity of the other participant or
participants is unknown, and even though the precise part played by each
participant may be uncertain.

 

Tallis
J.A., at p. 167, held there was evidence on which the alternative theory of
criminal liability could have been placed before the jury for their
consideration:

 

If
the jury concluded, in the light of the description of the person at the scene,
that the appellant was not the actual killer, it was still open to them to find
that he was a party to the killing. A brief reference to some of the direct and
circumstantial evidence shows that a basis did exist for a juror to have
concluded that the actual killing was committed by someone else while the
appellant was at his home in Moose Jaw, but that the appellant had been
instrumental in the killing. 

 

With
respect to the argument that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury that they must be unanimous in the way in which the murder was committed,
Tallis J.A. observed, as a starting point, that this Court found no error in
the charge in R. v. Farrant. In that case, although the trial judge
directed the jury on alternate ways or means by which the Crown could prove
murder beyond a reasonable doubt, he did not direct the jury that they must be
unanimous as to the ways or means by which the murder was committed.

 

57               Tallis
J.A. concluded that the jury members were entitled to reach a unanimous verdict
by separate paths of reasoning and that the trial judge was not obliged to
direct the jury on unanimity in the manner contended for by counsel for Mr.
Thatcher. Tallis J.A. referred to passages from ""Alternative Elements and
Included Offences"" by Glanville Williams, [1984] C.L.J. 290, at pp.
291‑92; R. v. Tuckey (1985), 46 C.R. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Bouvier (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 264‑65. On the
contention that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the
evidence, Tallis J.A., at p. 183, said:

 

It
may fairly be inferred that the jury accepted the Crown evidence that the
appellant was involved either directly or indirectly in the killing of his
former wife. In so doing, it is clear they rejected the appellant's contention
that he was not criminally involved in the killing, and were satisfied the
Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. There was overwhelming
evidence before the jury to support their verdict. Accordingly this ground of
appeal must fail.

 

58               Vancise
J.A. wrote in dissent. He would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial
but, at p. 197, having reviewed the evidence in detail, he concluded:

 

There
is evidence which if believed, would indicate that the appellant killed or
caused the death of JoAnn Wilson.

 

He
went on, at p. 197, to say:

 

                   The
appellant denied killing his wife or causing her death. He testified at great
length and explained the comments made by Lynn Mendell with respect to
statements allegedly attributed to him, as well as the comments made by
Anderson. If those comments were believed by the jury, there was doubt,
reasonable doubt which would have resulted in his acquittal.

 

Vancise
J.A. was of the opinion the trial judge was wrong in putting s. 21  to the jury
and even if not in error in putting s. 21  to the jury, he erred in the manner
in which he instructed them on its application. He said, at p. 205:

 

                   In
my opinion, it was essential for the trial judge to instruct the jury on the
application of s. 21  to the facts in this case by dealing with the following
matters: the identity of the person seen leaving the Wilson garage; the
identity of the person in the car observed in the vicinity of the Wilson
residence; the fact that the car was assigned to the appellant; the import of
the credit card receipt; any evidence which connected the appellant to an
unknown killer; and, more importantly, the defence witnesses who placed the
appellant at home at the time of the murder. By failing to deal with the
evidence in that manner, the charge was confusing, particularly in light of the
Crown's emphasis on the appellant's guilt as principal and not as an aider and
abetter. When one couples that with the statement of the trial judge, that the
failure of the Crown to adduce evidence that another individual actually did
the act would not preclude the jury from finding that the killing was done on
behalf of the appellant was, an invitation to the jury to find, in the absence
of evidence that there was another person acting together with the appellant,
that the appellant could be an aider and abetter to the offence. Such
nondirection, in my opinion, amounts to misdirection.

 

With
respect to the contention that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury that they were required to be unanimous with respect to the guilt of
Thatcher as principal simpliciter or as an aider or abettor of the
offence, Vancise J.A., at p. 207, held:

 

                   Here
the offence could be committed by the appellant as principal or as a party as
defined by s. 21 of the Code. The appellant was charged with a single offence
carrying a single conviction and the jury need not agree on any particular way
in which the offence was committed. This ground of appeal fails.

 

Vancise
J.A. did not think the trial judge gave a fair picture of the defence. In his
view the defence of alibi was not treated fairly. The trial judge's handling of
the evidence of one of the witnesses, Mr. Merchant, and the perfunctory manner
in which he dealt with remaining defence evidence was, as I have indicated, in the
opinion of Vancise J.A., tantamount to withdrawing the fact finding function
from the jury. Another flaw, in the view of Vancise J.A., was that the jury
members were instructed to determine which of two conflicting versions of
evidence they would accept. They were instructed to accept one and reject the
other. This, in his view, constituted an error in law. 

 

                                                                            VII

 

The
Issues Before this Court

 

59               The
issues can be stated as follows:

 

(i)                No
Evidence to Support Crown's Alternate Theory

 

Was
there an evidentiary foundation to justify putting to the jury the Crown's
alternate theory of the case that Thatcher was a party to the offence under s.
21 , rather than a principal?

 

(ii)               Failure
to Relate Law to the Facts Regarding the Crown's           Alternative Theory

 

Even
if there was sufficient evidence, did the trial judge fail to instruct the jury
adequately on the application of the legal principles of s. 21  to the evidence
in the case?

 

(iii)               Jury
Unanimity as to the Material Facts

 

Did
the trial judge err by failing to instruct the jury that it had to be unanimous
in relation to either whether Thatcher personally killed the victim or whether
he aided and abetted another person to kill the victim?

 

(iv)              The
Nadeau Issue

 

Did
the trial judge err in putting the jurors to a choice between accepting the
evidence of some witnesses or accepting the evidence of Thatcher, thereby
reducing the burden of proof? Can such an error be cured by s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code ?

 

(v)               Unfair
Jury Charge

 

Did
the trial judge adequately summarize the evidence or the theory of the defence?

 

60               I
propose to deal with each of these issues in the above order. Before doing so,
I should again point out that the primary theory of the Crown was that Thatcher
personally killed JoAnn Wilson though it wished to leave open the possibility
that Thatcher may have committed the murder indirectly, by hiring someone else
to perform the physical act of killing. The trial judge, in charging the jury,
rightly gave far more emphasis to the Crown's primary theory.

 

(i)                No
Evidence to Support the Crown's Alternate Theory

 

61               There
is no merit whatsoever to this ground of appeal. At page 167 of his judgment,
Tallis J.A. cites the following evidence:

 

(i) The
jury could have inferred that the person in the car watching the Wilson
residence in the days before the murder was someone other than the appellant,
but that the car, which was identified as one checked out to the appellant, had
been supplied to this person by the appellant.

 

(ii) The
evidence of witnesses such as Collver, Mendell, Anderson and Wilde, indicated
not only that the appellant had a motive for such a killing, but that he had
been interested in hiring or getting someone else to do the actual shooting.

 

(iii) The
calibre and type of bullet found in the skull of the deceased were consistent
with the use of the appellant's .357 Ruger revolver in the shooting.

 

(iv) Anderson's
evidence that he delivered a car and the revolver on the day of the murder
support either theory.

 

62               In
addition to the above, there is the evidence of witness Dotson regarding an
individual leaving the scene of the crime at about the time of the crime. There
is also the evidence on the tape, which, if Thatcher's explanations are not
believed, are consistent with Thatcher having procured the death of his wife.
And, of course, there is the alibi evidence of Hammond, Wright, Silversides and
the Thatcher boys, which, if accepted at all, is consistent with the Crown's
alternate theory. 

 

63               In
short, there is very strong evidence, particularly in relation to the murder
weapon and the appellant's desire to kill his ex‑wife, connecting
Thatcher with the crime. There is some evidence which, if believed, points to
his not having committed the crime personally. The facts are for the jury, and
the trial judge was correct not to preclude the jury from considering all the
alternatives. There is, of course, no burden on the Crown to point to a
specific, identified person as the personal assailant of the victim. The trial
judge was cognizant of this fact and he rightly instructed the jury in the
following way:

 

It
is not your concern whether some other person or persons have neither been
charged or found guilty of the offence of murder. Nor is it your concern
whether or not the person who actually committed the crime is known. If you are
satisfied from the evidence that JoAnn Thatcher was murdered and that this
accused aided or abetted in the commission of the murder, it is open to you to
find him guilty of murder. But again if the Crown has failed to satisfy you
that Colin Thatcher either committed the murder or that someone else did so,
aided and abetted by Colin Thatcher, then you must give him the benefit of the
doubt and find him not guilty.

 

In
my view, the case meets the requirements set out by Martin J.A. in R. v.
Sparrow, supra, at p. 458 (approved by McIntyre J. in R. v. Isaac,
supra):

 

I
am of the view that it is also appropriate, where an accused is being tried
alone and there is evidence that more than one person was involved in the
commission of the offence, to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of
s. 21 of the Code, even though the identity of the other participant or
participants is unknown, and even though the precise part played by each
participant may be uncertain. It is, in my view, however, improper to charge
the jury with respect to the liability of the accused as a party under s. 21 
where there is no evidence proper to be left with the jury that more than one
person was actually involved in the commission of the offence.

 

Since
there was such evidence, the trial judge's direction concerning s. 21 of the Code
was perfectly proper.

 

(ii)               Failure
to Relate the Law to the Facts Regarding the               Crown's Alternative
Theory

 

64               The
trial judge read the contents of s. 21(1)  to the jury and referred, correctly,
to what was meant by the term ""aiding"" or ""abetting"":
""intentional encouragement or assistance in the commission of the
offence"". As stated, he pointed out that the actual perpetrator need not
be identified. He thus accurately stated the law as to s. 21(1) .

 

65               Instead
of carving his jury charge into discrete sections in which he reviewed the
evidence consistent with Thatcher having personally committed the murder,
Thatcher having committed the murder by means of s. 21(1) , and, finally,
Thatcher not having committed the murder at all, the trial judge simply went
through the evidence of each witness in turn. I do not think he was wrong in
this. Much of the Crown evidence was consistent with either Crown
theory, and much of the defence evidence was consistent with either Thatcher's
innocence or his guilt under s. 21(1) . It is not incumbent on a trial judge to
go through the evidence in a repetitive fashion which could only have bored the
jury. Nor do I think we should assume jurors are so unintelligent that they
will fail to see the obvious: the presence of a government car at the home of
the victim, when combined with evidence suggesting that the man in the car was
not Thatcher, may point to Thatcher's having aided and abetted; and surely they
can discern that the alibi evidence, if believed, when combined with the murder
weapon evidence, may point to a similar conclusion.

 

66               Furthermore,
it is obvious that the two Crown theories are not legally different
views of what happened. The whole point of s. 21(1)  is to put an aider or
abettor on the same footing as the principal. To stress the difference between
the Crown theories might leave a jury with the erroneous impression that it is
vital for the jurors to decide individually and collectively which way the
victim was killed. But the correctness of this point hinges on issue (iii),
below, and I will pursue it in that context.

 

(iii)               Jury
Unanimity as to the Material Facts

 

67               This
is the most difficult issue presented by the case. I have noted that as there
was no dissent on the point in the Court of Appeal, leave of this Court was
required and was granted.

 

68               I
begin my analysis of this issue by quoting s. 21(1)  of the Criminal
Code :

 

                   21. (1) Every
one is a party to an offence who

 

                   (a) actually
commits it,

 

                   (b) does
or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

 

                   (c) abets
any person in committing it. 

 

This
provision is designed to make the difference between aiding and abetting and
personally committing an offence legally irrelevant. It provides that either
mode of committing an offence is equally culpable and, indeed, that whether a
person personally commits or only aids and abets, he is guilty of that
offence, in this case, causing the death of JoAnn Wilson, and not some separate
distinct offence. This is in contrast with the provisions of the Code
relating to accessories after the fact or conspirators (ss. 421 and 423) which
create distinct offences for involvement falling short of personal commission.

 

69               In
Chow Bew v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 124, Locke J. (Taschereau and
Fauteux JJ. concurring) explained the effect of the predecessor provision to s.
21  at pp. 126‑27:

 

                   The
first sentence of s. 69 provides, inter alia, that every one is a party
to and guilty of an offence who actually commits it, or does or omits an act
for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence, or abets any person
in committing it. This section appeared as s. 61 when the Code was first
enacted in 1892.

 

                   As
it affects the present case, the matter is thus stated in the 10th Edition of Russell
on Crime, at p. 1853, as follows:

 

                   Thus
where several persons are together for the purpose of committing a breach of
the peace, assaulting persons who pass, and while acting together in that
common object, a fatal blow is given, it is immaterial which struck the blow,
for the blow given under such circumstances is in point of law the blow of all,
and it is unnecessary to prove which struck the blow.

 

                   There
was evidence in the present matter from which a jury might properly draw the
inference that the appellant and Cathro had meant to inflict grievous bodily injury
to Ah Wing and had aided and abetted each other in doing so for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of the offence of robbery and that his death had
resulted. If the jury chose to draw this inference, the offence was murder as
defined by s. 260, whether they or either of them meant that death should ensue
or knew that death was likely to ensue. In such circumstances, it would be a
matter of indifference which of the two struck the fatal blow or inflicted the
fatal injury, since each would be liable in law for the act of the other.

 

Locke
J.'s discussion points to one of the principal policy arguments for not
requiring jury unanimity as to which of the subsections of s. 21  grounds the
criminal liability of a particular accused: it would otherwise be open to co‑accused
to escape conviction by imbuing members of a jury with doubt as to which of the
co‑accused physically performed the criminal act, even if the jurors
entertained no doubt that any individual co‑accused either personally
committed the crime or else aided and abetted in its commission. This policy
concern was recognized long ago by Pollock C.B. in R. v. Swindall and
Osborne (1846), 2 Car. & K. 230, 175 E.R. 95, a case which predated the
abolition of the distinction between principals and accomplices.

 

70               The
Court canvassed the authorities in considerable detail in R. v. Harder,
[1956] S.C.R. 489, and articulated the proposition that it was unnecessary for
the Crown to specify in an indictment that an accused was being charged as a
party rather than as a principal simpliciter. Rand J. at p. 498 refers
to an old English case, R. v. Folkes and Ludds (1832), 1 Mood. 354, 168
E.R. 1301, in which, upon Rand J.'s view of the case, the judges held that a
defendant could be convicted by a jury on a count of having feloniously
ravished the prosecutrix ""either on the evidence going to the ravishment
or that going to his secondary role as abettor"". Kellock J. referred with
approval at pp. 500‑01 to the following passage from Sir Henri
Elzéar Taschereau's work on the Criminal Code :

 

                   The
prosecutor may, at his option, prefer an indictment against the accessories
before the fact, and aiders and abettors as principal offenders, whether the
party who actually committed the offence is indicted with them or not; R. v.
Tracey, 6 Mod. 30. For instance: A. abetted in the commission of a theft by
B. The indictment may charge A. and B. jointly or A. or B. alone as guilty of
the offence, in the ordinary form, as if they had actually stolen by one and
the same act....

 

                   In
every case where there may be a doubt whether a person be a principal or
accessory before the fact, it may be advisable to prefer the indictment against
him as a principal, as such an indictment will be sufficient whether it turn
out on the evidence that such person was a principal or accessory before the
fact, as well as where it is clear that he was either the one or the other but
it is uncertain which he was. [Emphasis added.]

 

To
the same effect, Kellock J. cites passages from Russell on Crime (10th
ed. 1950) and Archbold's Pleading, Evidence & Practice in Criminal Cases
(33rd ed. 1954).

 

71               I
should perhaps note that the old common law authorities stand for the
proposition that an indictment may charge all who are present and abet
the act as principals in the first degree. As Fauteux J. states in Harder,
at p. 492: 

 

                   At
common law, the actor or actual perpetrator of the fact and those who are,
actually or constructively, present at the commission of the offence and aid
and abet its commission, are distinguished as being respectively principal in
the first degree and principals in the second degree; yet, in all felonies in
which the punishment of the principal in the first degree and of the principals
in the second degree is the same, the indictment may charge all who are present
and abet as principals in the first degree.

 

Thus,
the common law generally drew no distinction between a principal in the first
degree (someone who actually committed the offence) and a principal in the
second degree (someone who was actually or constructively present but who only
aided and abetted in the commission of the offence) for the purposes of
indictment. The upshot of this rule was stated in East, Pleas of the Crown
(1803), vol. 1, at p. 350: ""the blow of one is, in law, the blow of
all"". The common law did, however, draw a distinction between principals
and accessories. Accessories were those who conspired with the principal in the
first degree or who aided and abetted him but were neither actually nor
constructively present at the scene of the crime. See R. v. Smith
(1876), 38 U.C.Q.B. 218, at pp. 227‑28. Thus, if Thatcher aided and
abetted, rather than personally committed, I do not think it is contended that
he was necessarily physically present at the murder. Therefore, his case might
well not fall within the old common law rule permitting one charge but two
different possible modes of participation in the offence. But this is precisely
the distinction that disappeared when Parliament abolished the common law
distinction between principals and accessories. As Fauteux J. states in Harder,
at p. 493, in relation to s. 21 's predecessor:

 

This
Imperial statute [24 & 25 Vict. c. 94], later adopted into Canadian law
(R.S.C. 1886, c. 145) practically brought to an end the distinctions between
accessories before the fact and principals in the second degree.

 

                   By
the enactment of section 61, the predecessor of section 69, these distinctions
in the substantive law entirely disappeared from our criminal laws when
codified in 1892. With them, of course, also disappeared, because being made no
longer necessary, the relevant adjective rules related to the framing of the
indictment of such persons who, not actually committing the offence charged,
were then made, by statute, principals and equally party to, guilty of and
punishable for the offence as if actually committed by them. It is unthinkable
that, getting rid of the difficulties arising out of these prior distinctions,
Parliament would, in the same breath, have created new ones by refusing to the
Crown the right to indict‑‑which right it had before, under common
and statutory law‑‑as principal simpliciter, either as a principal
in the second degree or an accessory before the fact, and this, under the
regime of this new law holding each and all particeps criminis as being
nothing less than principals.

 

72               Thus,
s. 21 has been designed to alleviate the necessity for the Crown choosing
between two different forms of participation in a criminal offence. The law
stipulates that both forms of participation are not only equally culpable, but
should be treated as one single mode of incurring criminal liability. The Crown
is not under a duty to separate the different forms of participation in a
criminal offence into different counts. Obviously, if the charge against
Thatcher had been separated into different counts, he might well have been
acquitted on each count notwithstanding that each and every juror was certain
beyond a reasonable doubt either that Thatcher personally killed his ex‑wife
or that he aided and abetted someone else who killed his ex‑wife. This is
precisely what s. 21 is designed to prevent.

 

73               In
sum, this Court has held that it is no longer necessary to specify in the
charge the nature of an accused's participation in the offence: Harder.
Moreover, if there is evidence before a jury that points to an accused either
committing a crime personally or, alternatively, aiding and abetting another to
commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused did one or the other, it is ""a matter of
indifference"" which alternative actually occurred: Chow Bew. It
follows, in my view, that s. 21 precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to
the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. Why should
the juror be compelled to make a choice on a subject which is a matter of legal
indifference?

 

74               This
conclusion, however, is said by the appellant to run counter to a recent
decision of the English Court of Appeal, R. v. Brown (1984), 79 Cr. App.
R. 115, to which I now turn. In R. v. Brown, the appellant was charged
with fraudulently inducing investments, contrary to s. 13(1)(a) of the Prevention
of Fraud (Investments) Act, 1958 (U.K.), 6 & 7 Eliz. 2, c. 45, which
provides the following:

 

                   13.‑‑(1) Any
person who, by any statement, promise or forecast which he knows to be
misleading, false or deceptive...induces or attempts to induce another person‑‑

 

                   (a) to
enter into or offer to enter into ‑‑

 

(i)
any agreement for, or with a view to, acquiring, disposing of, subscribing for
or underwriting securities...shall be guilty of an offence....

 

More
specifically, the Crown alleged that the appellant had fraudulently induced
four persons to enter into agreements for acquiring shares in a company,
knowing the agreements to be misleading. Each count with which he was charged
contained particulars of a number of different statements relied on by the
prosecution as constituting the inducement referred to in s. 13(1)(a) of
the Act. 

 

75               The
jury asked the judge two questions. The first was whether the defendant would
be guilty on a whole count if he was found guilty of only one part of that
count. The second was whether the defendant was guilty on the whole count and the
verdict unanimous if individual members found him guilty of different parts of
the count. With respect to the first question, the trial judge is said by
Eveleigh L.J. of the Court of Appeal, at p. 117, to have responded:

 

...if
you are satisfied that, with the necessary state of mind, the defendant made
the statements or representations which are alleged in the indictment in
relation to each count, it is sufficient if you find that he made one or some
or all of them but you do not have to find that he made them all.

 

With
respect to the second, more relevant, question, he stated:

 

Members
of the jury, the answer to that is this: what you have to be satisfied of in
relation to each of the counts is that the defendant dishonestly made the
statements and by making them induced the victim concerned to act in the way
set out in the count.

 

...It
does not matter that some of you are satisfied that one of the various
statements is made out, and others of you are satisfied not about that
statement being made out but that another is made out. It is sufficient if you
are all agreed that there was a dishonest inducement. So if you find some of
you are satisfied that representation A was made out, some of you are not
satisfied about that but are satisfied that representation B was made out, then
it does not matter, provided that you are all satisfied that there was the
dishonest inducement made and that it operated upon the mind of the person to
whom it was made and caused him to act in the way that he did.

 

76               The
Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred by not informing the jury
that it must be agreed that every single ingredient necessary to constitute the
offence has been established. Eveleigh L.J., at p. 119, stated:

 

                   In
a case such as that with which we are now dealing, the following principles
apply: 1. Each ingredient of the offence must be proved to the satisfaction of
each and every member of the jury .... 2. However, where a number of matters
are specified in the charge as together constituting one ingredient in the
offence, and any one of them is capable of doing so, then it is enough to
establish the ingredient that any one of them is proved; but (because of the
first principle above) any such matter must be proved to the satisfaction of
the whole jury. The jury should be directed accordingly, and it should be made
clear to them as well that they should all be satisfied that the statement upon
which they are agreed was an inducement as alleged.

 

77               The
appellant, relying on a recent article by Mark A. Gelowitz entitled ""The Thatcher
Appeal: A Question of Unanimity"" (1986), 49 C.R. (3d) 129, argues that
just as in Brown, where the English Court of Appeal held that ""each
ingredient of the offence must be proved to the satisfaction of each and every
member of the jury,"" this Court ought to hold that the nature of
Thatcher's participation must be proved to each and every juror before he can
be convicted of ""unlawfully causing"" JoAnn Wilson's death.

 

78               The
appellant accepts, as any reasonable person must, that the jurors need not be
unanimous with respect to their acceptance or rejection of each individual
piece of evidence. In a long, complicated trial it is absurd to suppose that
twelve people could form the same opinion of each item of evidence, and it is
absurd to suppose that the Crown could ever prove or explain beyond a
reasonable doubt every detail of a murder. A defendant at a murder trial should
obviously not be acquitted if some jurors think a .38 calibre bullet was used
and others think that a .357 calibre bullet was used. The appellant submits,
however, that the jurors ought to be unanimous as to the ""material
facts"" making out the offence. He does not provide a definition of
""material facts"", except to rely on Mr. Gelowitz for the proposition
that jurors must be ""in substantial agreement as to just what an accused
has done"". This argument, however, overlooks the whole point of s. 21, as
I have said, which makes the distinction between principals and aiders and
abettors legally irrelevant.

 

79               Moreover,
if Brown is correct, and this need not be decided in the present appeal,
I am far from convinced that it lays down a proposition as sweeping as the
appellant suggests. Eveleigh L.J. acknowledged that jurors could arrive at
their conclusions by different routes. Jurors ""may be able to say that,
whichever way one looks at it, the case is proved"". To be sure, Eveleigh
L.J. also articulated the propositions referred to previously. But, in my
opinion, s. 21 does not create ""ingredients"" in the offence of
murder, in the same way that each particular ""misrepresentation"" was
an ingredient in the offence of Brown. As I read Eveleigh L.J.'s
remarks, his second proposition is restricted to cases in which ""a number
of matters are specific in the charge"". This would be analogous to the
case when there were several counts in an indictment. If Thatcher had been
charged on two counts, of course unanimity would be required in respect of any
count for which he is convicted. Such a conclusion flows from the proposition
that a verdict stands for guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt, of that for which
the accused has been charged. In the present case, Thatcher was charged that he
did ""unlawfully cause the death of JoAnn Kay Wilson and did thereby commit
first degree murder"". The charge was carefully worded, and there is no
injustice in his conviction on the indictment irrespective of whether the
jurors shared the same view as to the most likely manner in which Thatcher
committed the murder. 

 

80               When
one considers the implications of the appellant's submission, it becomes even
clearer that it is without merit. In the present case there were doubtless
three alternatives in the minds of each of the jurors:

 

(a)               Thatcher personally killed his ex‑wife;

 

(b)               he aided and abetted someone else
to do so;

 

(c)               he is innocent of the crime.

 

81               The
jurors were told that if any of them had a reasonable doubt regarding (c),
Thatcher should be acquitted. Every single juror was, evidently, solidly
convinced that (c) was simply not what occurred. Each one was certain that the
true state of affairs was (a) or (b). Even if we suppose, as the appellant
would have us do, that the jurors individually went beyond thinking in terms of
(a) or (b) and specifically opted for one theory, and that some jurors thought
only (a) could have occurred and others thought only (b) could have occurred, I
am far from convinced that there would have been any injustice from convicting
Thatcher. As stated, there is no legal difference between the two. Much is made
of the fact that (a) and (b) are factually inconsistent theories, in the
sense that evidence proving (a) tends to disprove (b). But this is really only
true of one category of evidence, namely identification and alibi evidence. The
overwhelming mass of evidence against Thatcher was consistent with either
theory. In particular, the evidence tracing the murder weapon to Thatcher was
highly probative, as were his statements to various witnesses (prior to the
murder) of his intention to kill JoAnn Wilson, and his statement to Lynn
Mendell (after the murder) that he had ""blown away"" his wife.

 

82               The
appellant's suggestion would fail to achieve justice in a significant number of
cases. Suppose the evidence in a case is absolutely crystal clear that when X
and Y entered Z's house, Z was alive, and when X and Y left, Z was dead.
Suppose that in their evidence each of X and Y says that the other of them
murdered Z but each admits to having aided and abetted. Are X and Y each to be
acquitted if some of the jurors differ as to which of X and Y actually
committed the offence? I can see absolutely no reason in policy or law to
uphold such an egregious conclusion. The appellant's submission ignores the
very reason why Parliament abolished the old common law distinctions: namely,
they permitted guilty persons to go free. As Professor Peter MacKinnon points
out in, ""Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz and Stuart"" (1986), 51
C.R. (3d) 134, at p. 135, if an accused is to be acquitted in situations when
every juror is convinced that the accused committed a murder in one of two
ways, merely because the jury cannot agree on which of the two ways,
""it is difficult to imagine a situation more likely to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute ‑‑ and deservedly
so.""

 

(iv) The
Nadeau Issue

 

83               The
appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in putting the jurors to a
choice between accepting the evidence of some witnesses or accepting the
evidence of Thatcher, thereby reducing the burden of proof. This submission is
based on this Court's decision in Nadeau v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
570, where Lamer J., at pp. 572‑73, states:

 

The
accused benefits from any reasonable doubt at the outset, not merely if `the
two (2) versions are equally consistent with the evidence, are equally valid'.
Moreover the jury does not have to choose between two versions. It is not
because they would not believe the accused that they would then have to agree
with Landry's version. The jurors cannot accept his version, or any part of it,
unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having regard to all the
evidence, that the events took place in this manner; otherwise the accused is
entitled, unless a fact has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, to the
finding of fact the most favourable to him, provided of course that it is based
on evidence in the record and not mere speculation.

 

84               The
trial judge, during his charge to the jury, made specific references to the
conflict between the evidence given by Thatcher, and that of An­derson, Mendell
and Collver. He stated the following:

 

                   The
final witness for the defence was the accused, Colin Thatcher. Both his
examination‑in‑chief and cross‑examination were very lengthy.
I have been talking almost too long as it is and I do not propose to review his
evidence in detail. Much of it related to the tape recording to which he
admitted he was a party and you will determine whether you accept his version
of the meaning to be attributed to the conversation he had with Gary Anderson.

 

                   Thatcher
denies that he had anything to do with either of the two shootings of his wife
and you will weigh his testimony against the other evidence before you and
particularly I suggest against the evidence of Lynn Mendell and Anderson and
Wilde.

 

                   The
evidence of Thatcher is also in direct contradiction to that of Dick Collver
with respect to the hiring of the hit man and it will be up to you to decide
whose evidence you accept.

 

The
Crown, quite properly, concedes that the passage, if it stood alone, would be
bad in law as violating the principle in Nadeau. It submits, however,
that such remarks have to be looked at in their context within the whole of the
charge to the jury. More specifically, the Crown argues that the charge as a
whole made it clear that the jury was not obliged to take a binary view of the
evidence (accept or reject it) but had to give effect to reasonable doubt. 

 

85               By
my count, the trial judge correctly stated the reasonable doubt principle on at
least eleven occasions during his charge to the jury. One such occasion was
directly preceding the offending passages relied upon by the appellant. He
said:

 

                   I
must tell you that as a matter of law that it is not incumbent upon the accused
to adduce evidence to satisfy you that an alibi has been proven. If evidence as
to alibi raises a reasonable doubt as to the presence of Thatcher at the scene
when the murder was committed, you must give him the benefit of that doubt and
conclude he was not there.

 

Moreover,
early on in his charge he stated:

 

It
is up to you to weigh the evidence of each witness, one against the
other, and determine what you find to be true and reject what you
do not believe. [Emphasis added.]

 

When
the offending passages are read with the above and subsequent admonitions, it
is clear‑‑and, I believe, must have been clear to the jury‑‑that
the trial judge means ""accept beyond a reasonable doubt"" when he
refers to ""accepting"" Crown evidence, and means ""accept as
raising a reasonable doubt"" when he refers to ""accepting""
defence evidence. I believe there was no error made when the charge is read as
a whole. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the Crown's submissions with
respect to s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.

 

(v) Unfair
Jury Charge

 

86               The
gist of the complaint is that the trial judge revealed to the jurors his own
perception of the accused's guilt, through undue emphasis on the Crown's
evidence and inadequate summary of the defence. The defence evidence was
simple, however, and the Crown's case was complex, relying on circumstantial
evidence from a large number of witnesses. It is simply inappropriate to try to
measure the fairness of the charge by reference to quantity.

 

87               Although
there were a few unfortunate expressions used by the trial judge, a juror would
have to read in a lot to surmise that the trial judge thought Thatcher guilty
or his witnesses generally not credible, with the possible exception of Mr.
Merchant. It should be noted in this respect that at the outset of his charge
the trial judge was clear as to the respective duties of the judge and jury. He
stated:

 

                   Your
duty as jurors is to determine the guilt or innocence of this accused from the
evidence that's been placed before you. This is not a light duty because if a
crime has been committed, in this case, the murder of a female individual, it
is your obligation to so find. Likewise you have a duty to this accused to see
that he is not improperly convicted.

 

                   Your
functions and mine are separate and distinct. You are the sole arbiters of the
facts. In that area you are supreme. It is your duty and your responsibility
and yours alone to decide those facts in accordance with the oaths you took at
the outset of the trial. If I express an opinion with respect to the evidence,
and I probably will, you are free to disregard my opinion for that is your
field and you make the findings of fact in accordance with your individual
conscience.

 

88               Moreover,
the jury was instructed that it could obtain clarification or a review of any
or all of the evidence presented at trial. On the second day of their
deliberations, after requesting information the previous evening, the jury
reviewed portions of the evidence given by numerous witnesses, including
Thatcher himself. In my view, the trial judge gave a fair picture of the
defence. As Lord Goddard C.J., in R. v. Clayton‑Wright (1948), 33
Cr. App. R. 22, at p. 29, states, a trial judge is not required ""to paint
in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used or to remind
them of the whole of the evidence"". The jury deliberated for approximately
four days. They returned a verdict of guilty. In my opinion, the charge of the
trial judge cannot be read as unfair. I may add that I think there is some
merit to the Crown's argument that Thatcher would not have benefited from a
more thorough review of the defence evidence.

 

89               I
would dismiss the appeal. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

90               Lamer J.‑‑I
agree with the Chief Justice's reasons and disposition of this appeal. I
should, however, qualify my concurrence in those of his reasons addressing the
ground he refers to as ""Jury Unanimity as to the Material Facts"".

 

91               I
agree with the Chief Justice that the jury unanimity point fails. I would
suggest, however, that it fails because of the nature of the evidence in this
case. It is true that the Crown presented two factually inconsistent theories:
that the appellant actually killed the deceased or that he aided and abetted
the killer. The overwhelming mass of the evidence against the appellant,
however, was consistent with both theories and pointed only to his
participation in the murder. The jury could not have been convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt of one theory to the exclusion of the other, but must have
been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the
murder, either as principal or aider and abettor. Since, as the Chief Justice
points out, s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code  makes the distinction between
participation as a principal and participation as aider and abettor legally
irrelevant, it was not necessary for the jury to decide on the form of his
participation and the jury was correct in convicting. As Peter MacKinnon wrote
in ""Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz and Stuart"" (1986), 51 C.R.
(3d) 134, at p. 137:

 

If,
as their deliberations progress, the jurors, though not in agreement in their
assessment of the probable type of involvement, are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the only possible types of involvement establish
guilt, they should convict.

 

92               However,
I am not prepared to go so far as the Chief Justice's unqualified assertion
that ""s. 21 precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to the particular
nature of the accused's participation in the offence."" Depending on the
nature of the evidence presented by the Crown, the jury unanimity issue may
arise in any case where the Crown alleges factually inconsistent theories, even
if those theories relate to the particular nature of the accused's
participation in the offence. If the Crown presents evidence which tends to
inculpate the accused under one theory and exculpate him under the other, then
the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they wish to rely on such
evidence, then they must be unanimous as to the theory they adopt. Otherwise,
the evidence will be taken into account by some jurors to convict the accused
under one theory while the fact that the evidence exculpates the accused under
the other theory is being disregarded by the other jurors who are taking the
latter route. In effect, the jury would be adding against the accused the
inculpatory elements of evidence which cannot stand together because they are
inconsistent. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

93               La Forest J.‑‑I
am in general agreement with the reasons of the Chief Justice. I have some
concerns, not addressed by him, however, that I would wish to underline.

 

94               The
essential point in this case is that although alternative theories of
culpability were advanced by the Crown, there were ample grounds for the jury
to find Thatcher guilty beyond a reasonable doubt while remaining unsure
whether he had committed the murder himself or through another person. There
may, however, be cases where the interrelationship between competing Crown
theories and the evidence adduced in relation thereto will not justify a
verdict of guilt. In each case, therefore, it will be for the trial judge,
having regard to the nature of the offence, the theories of the parties, and
the totality of the evidence, to realistically assess the possibility that the
evidence will be used improperly, and to direct the jury accordingly. Suffice
it to say, however, the present is not such a case.

 

95               I
would also add that, in my view, s. 21  of the Criminal Code  is not
unique in this regard. Rather, it is merely one example of a situation where
the Crown is relying on alternative theories of culpability to found an
accused's guilt. The fact that s. 21  makes the particular nature of the accused's
involvement in an offence legally irrelevant does not, in my view, in and of
itself justify conviction on the basis of mutually exclusive or alternative
theories of culpability. Were it otherwise, concerns would be raised
dangerously akin to those flowing from multiplicious counts. Concerns about
multiplicity of counts and jury unanimity are functional, real concerns
embodying society's pre‑eminent desire to avoid injustice to accused
persons and, as such, cannot be explained away by the mere invocation of a
legal fiction. I cannot believe that such a result would have been in the
contemplation of Parliament in enacting s. 21 . Nor do I read the Chief
Justice's judgment as countenancing this result.

                   Appellant,
a Canadian citizen, resists extradition to the United States on a charge of
child stealing contrary to Ohio law on the ground that she was acquitted in
respect of the charge of kidnapping for the same offence under federal U.S.
law. She claims that it violated her rights under ss. 7  and 11 (h) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as well as the provisions of the
extradition treaty between Canada and the United States. The defence was
rejected by the extradition judge, the judge who reviewed the case on habeas
corpus and the Ontario Court of Appeal.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   (1)
The Jurisdictional Issue

 

                   This
Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to s. 719(5)  of the Criminal
Code . Having regard to the history of the section, it is clear that it was
intended to give to the courts of appeal and to this Court a right of appeal in
habeas corpus proceedings, including proceedings upon a writ of habeas
corpus arising out of a claim for extradition. In enacting this provision,
Parliament obviously overlooked s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act. It must,
however, be taken to have been superseded by s. 719. To the extent that there
is a conflict between s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act and s. 719 of the Code,
then, s. 40 has been impliedly repealed.

                   (2)
The Extradition and Charter Issues 

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: An extradition hearing is
not a trial. It is simply a hearing to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence of an alleged extradition crime to warrant the Government under its
treaty obligations to surrender a fugitive to a foreign country for trial by
the authorities there for an offence committed within its jurisdiction. Thus,
the judge at an extradition hearing has no jurisdiction to deal with defences
that could be raised at trial unless, of course, the Act or the treaty
otherwise provides. Here, article 4(1)(i) of the extradition treaty between
Canada and the United States expressly provides that extradition shall not be
granted ""When the person whose surrender is sought is being proceeded
against, or has been tried and discharged or punished in the territory of the
requested State for the offense for which his extradition is requested"".
If the parties had considered that double jeopardy in the requesting state
should be a valid defence at an extradition hearing, the treaty would have
referred to it since the parties evidently adverted to the issue.

 

                   Section
11 (h) of the Charter  does not apply to an extradition hearing.
There can be no doubt that the actions undertaken by the Government of Canada
in extradition as in other matters are subject to scrutiny under the Charter 
(s. 32 ). But the Charter  does not govern the actions of a foreign
country. In particular the Charter  cannot be given extraterritorial
effect to govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign country are to be
conducted. Section 11  relates to charges laid by the governments referred to in
s. 32  of the Charter . An extradition hearing does not fall within that
description.

 

                   It
does not follow that the Charter  has no application to extradition.
While the general extradition procedure constitutes a reasonable limit, under
s. 1  of the Charter , on the right not to be surrendered for trial, that
a fugitive may have the manner in which the procedures are conducted in Canada
and the conditions under which a fugitive is surrendered can invite Charter 
scrutiny. The pre‑eminence of the Constitution must be recognized; the
treaty, the extradition hearing in this country and the exercise of the
executive discretion to surrender a fugitive must all conform to the
requirements of the Charter , including the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

                   Generally,
there is nothing unjust in surrendering to a foreign country a person accused
of having committed a crime there for trial in accordance with the ordinary
procedures prevailing in that country, even though those procedures may not
meet the specific constitutional requirements for trial in this country. But
the courts may intervene if the executive's decision to surrender a fugitive
would, in the particular circumstances of a case, violate the principles of
fundamental justice. This is, however, a jurisdiction that must be exercised
with caution. The discretion to make the decision to surrender is primarily
that of the executive and this is an area where it is likely to be far better
informed than the courts, and where the courts must be extremely circumspect so
as to avoid interfering unduly in decisions that involve the good faith and
honour of this country in its relations with other states. In a word, judicial
intervention must be limited to cases of real substance. Finally, barring
obvious or urgent circumstances, the courts should not ordinarily intervene
before the executive has made an order of surrender.

 

                   In
the case at bar, the surrender of the appellant did not constitute a breach of
s. 7  of the Charter . The attempt by state authorities to enforce their
own laws did not violate the principles of fundamental justice by reason only
that the federal authorities, in attempting to enforce their laws, prosecuted
her for an offence bearing some similarity to that for which the state
prosecution was initiated. The two offences contain different elements, and
different interests were involved with different prosecutorial authorities
following their own paths. Therefore, there was nothing sufficiently oppressive
in this situation to warrant refusing surrender on the basis that such
prosecution, ipso facto, violates the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   Per Lamer
J.: The Charter  does not govern the actions of a foreign country and, in
particular, cannot govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign country are to
be conducted. Therefore, the Charter  should not, save special
circumstances, be given extraterritorial effect by refusing to conduct a
hearing or surrender a person on the grounds that the prospective trial in the
foreign country would be in violation of its provisions. But the Charter 
does apply to the extradition proceedings taking place in Canada. These
proceedings are in the nature of a preliminary inquiry and there is no reason
why a person undergoing such an inquiry for the purpose of determining whether
there is sufficient evidence to put that person on trial in a foreign country
should be denied the protection that would be afforded that same person at his
preliminary inquiry for a charge to be tried in a Canadian court. Thus, ss. 7
to 14 of the Charter  are applicable to these proceedings in so far as
they would apply to a preliminary inquiry.

 

                   The
plea of autrefois acquit, whether raised under s. 11 (h) or s. 7,
is premature at the stage of the preliminary inquiry and should generally be
raised at the trial. But this plea could be raised at the extradition hearing
when the foreign country where the trial is to take place does not allow it, as
in this case, between federal and state prosecutions. Here, however,
appellant's plea of autrefois acquit could not succeed because the two
offences involve quite different elements.

 

                   Per Wilson
J.: A Canadian citizen who is the subject of extradition proceedings in Canada
is entitled to the benefit of the Charter  in those proceedings.
Charter  rights are enshrined in our Constitution as part of the supreme law
of Canada and must be recognized and given effect in any judicial proceeding in
Canada unless a reasonable limit justified under s. 1  has been imposed upon
them. Although the recognition of Charter  rights in the extradition
proceedings in Canada may have repercussions abroad, it does not give
extraterritorial effect to the Charter  and does not constitute an
interference with the processes of the foreign court. In the present case,
appellant was entitled to plead ss. 7  and 11 (h) as a defence to the extradition
court's grant of an order committing her to prison to await the decision of the
executive branch of government whether or not to surrender. But she failed to
demonstrate that the federal and the state offences were the same offence, and
thus failed to establish that her Charter  rights would have been
violated if the order sought by the respondents was made.

                   The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ. was
delivered by

 

1.                La Forest J.‑‑The
appellant, Helen Susan Schmidt, resists extradition to the United States on a
charge of child stealing contrary to the law of the State of Ohio on the ground
that she was acquitted in respect of the same activity of a charge of
kidnapping under federal law of the United States. This she claims violates her
rights under ss. 7  and 11 (h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  as well as the provisions of the Canada‑United States
extradition treaty; see Canada Treaty Series 1976, No. 3. This defence
was rejected by the extradition judge, the judge who reviewed the case on habeas
corpus and the Ontario Court of Appeal. From the latter judgment, she was
given leave to appeal to this Court.

 

Facts

 

2.                On
August 28, 1980, Schmidt, with the assistance of her son, Charles Gress, and a
friend of his, Paul Hildebrand, is alleged to have abducted a two‑year
old girl, Denise Gravely, from a Cleveland sidewalk. Schmidt took the child
with her to New York State, where she kept her for almost two years, raising
her as her daughter. In the interim, the child's father committed suicide,
allegedly as a result of his inability to discover his child's whereabouts.

 

3.                On
March 22, 1982, Schmidt attended a family reunion in Buffalo, New York,
accompanied by Denise. Another son of hers, Donald Gress, was also at the
reunion. By sheer coincidence, Donald Gress not only came from Cleveland but
knew the child's parents and had helped to search for her after her abduction.
Following the reunion, he told Cleveland police of Denise's whereabouts and she
was returned to her mother on March 26, 1982.

 

4.                Following
her arrest, Schmidt was charged with the federal offence of kidnapping and the
state offence of child‑stealing. Grand juries returned indictments on
both charges, on March 29, 1982 on the state charge and on March 31, 1982 on
the federal charge.

 

5.                The
two charges have some similarities but they also have important differences.
The federal offence under the United States Code, Title 18 reads:

 

§ 1201. Kidnapping

 

(a) Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles,
decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or
otherwise any person, except in the case of a minor by the parent thereof,
when:

 

(1) the person is willfully transported in interstate
or foreign commerce;

 

(2) any such act against the person is done within
the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States;

 

(3) any such act against the person is done within
the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section
101(36) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1301(36));
or

 

(4) the person is a foreign official, an
internationally protected person, or an official guest as those terms are
defined in section 1116(b) of this title,

 

shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years
or for life.

 

The
offence under the Revised Code of Ohio reads:

 

§ 2905.04‑‑Child Stealing

 

(A) No person, by any means, and with purpose to
withhold a child under the age of fourteen or mentally incompetent from the
legal custody of his parent, guardian or custodian, shall remove such child
from the place where he is found.

 

(B) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under
this section that the actor reasonably believed that his conduct was necessary
to preserve the child's health or welfare.

 

6.                On
July 26, 1982, Schmidt was tried on the federal charge by a judge and jury. She
admitted the abduction, but contended that she had taken part in it in the
belief that Denise was the illegitimate daughter of her son Donald Gress, and
that she had been abandoned by her father and was living with her natural
mother ""in a home of ill repute"". On July 30, 1982, the jury found
Schmidt not guilty and she was acquitted. 

 

7.                On
August 6, 1982, while the state offence of child‑stealing was still
pending, Schmidt, who is a Canadian citizen, left the United States and came to
Canada. She was arrested in Kirkland Lake, Ontario on August 30, 1982 and extradition
proceedings against her were begun pursuant to the Canada‑United States
extradition treaty.

 

8.                I
should add that Schmidt's counsel argues that if Schmidt is returned to Ohio,
she will not have the benefit of raising her previous federal prosecution in
bar of her prosecution under state law. While under the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States, a person is protected from double jeopardy
against federal prosecutions, that provision does not apply to the states
although at some point the cruelty of harassment by multiple prosecutions by a
state would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: see Bartkus
v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959). It is clear, however, that the Fourteenth
Amendment does not automatically protect an individual from being prosecuted
under a state law although the accused was earlier tried and acquitted of an
offence under federal law. Thus in Bartkus v. Illinois, supra,
the accused was tried and acquitted under a federal law of robbing a federally
insured bank. He was later tried and convicted on substantially the same
evidence in an Illinois state court for violating an Illinois robbery statute.
On an action to test the constitutionality of the second prosecution, the
Supreme Court of the United States held that the Illinois prosecution did not
violate the due process clause.

 

The
Courts Below

 

9.                At
the extradition hearing, Collins Dist. Ct. J., having found that the
requirements of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21, had
been met, considered whether s. 11 (h) of the Charter  would be
violated by an order committing Schmidt to prison to await the Government's
decision on the request for her surrender. He held, however, that the Charter 
only applied within the boundaries of Canada. He also noted that it had already
been held in Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C.
(3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) that the extradition process itself was a reasonable limit
on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter . Finally, he
refused to consider the common law plea of autrefois acquit or the
American doctrine of double jeopardy on the ground that they were not within
the scope of his jurisdiction as an extradition judge. Accordingly, he ordered
Schmidt's committal for surrender to the United States.

 

10.              In
a proceeding on a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid
before Steele J. (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 399, 147 D.L.R. (3d) 616, 4 C.C.C. (3d)
409, 4 C.R.R. 323, Schmidt's principal argument was that she should not have
been committed because such committal violated the principle of autrefois
acquit, either under the Charter  or at common law.

 

11.              Steele
J. held that at common law and under the Extradition Act , Schmidt was
not entitled to plead autrefois acquit. Section 3 of the Act, he noted,
incorporates the extradition treaty, article 2 of which provides that
extradition is to be ordered for certain named offences that are offences in
both the requesting and the requested State. He pointed out that no defences
are provided for. In his opinion, the fact that a defence might be raised to a
charge in Canada is not a valid reason for refusing extradition. Indeed, since
article 4(1)(i) of the treaty provides that extradition is not to be ordered
where a fugitive has been previously tried in the requested state, the raising
of autrefois acquit or convict where the fugitive has been tried
in the requesting state is implicitly ruled out. In any event, federal and
state charges in this case differed from one another and the defence,
therefore, had no application.

 

12.              As
to the Charter , Rauca, supra, having already determined
that extradition was a reasonable infringement on the right to remain in
Canada, any argument that specific aspects of extradition are contrary to the Charter 
were, in Steele J.'s opinion, ruled out. ""[I]f the Extradition Act 
is a proper infringement upon the rights of the individual to remain in Canada,
then I do not see how the details of whatever rights there may be within the Extradition
Act  can be overridden by the provisions of the Charter .""

 

13.              Finally,
he held that because an extradition judge has the same powers as a magistrate
on a preliminary inquiry, autrefois acquit, as a defence on the merits,
could only be raised at trial, and consequently could not properly be raised
before an extradition judge any more than before a magistrate on a preliminary
inquiry.

 

14.              In
the Ontario Court of Appeal (1984), 44 O.R. (2d) 777, 7 D.L.R. (4th) 95, 10
C.C.C. (3d) 564, 2 O.A.C. 336, Lacourcière J.A. held that the statutory plea of
autrefois acquit under s. 535  of the Criminal Code  was not
available at an extradition hearing. Under s. 13 of the Extradition Act ,
the extradition judge has the same powers as a justice at a preliminary
inquiry. The powers of a justice under Part XV of the Code are
statutory, and do not include the authority to entertain special pleas. The
special plea of autrefois acquit could only be raised on arraignment for
an indictable offence under Part XVII of the Code and not at a
preliminary inquiry or an extradition hearing. Nor, he held, could a common law
plea in the nature of res judicata or issue estoppel be raised. Such
pleas are defences on the merits, also to be dealt with at trial. 

 

15.              Lacourcière
J.A. held that it was possible that article 8 of the treaty, which acknowledged
the right of a fugitive to all remedies and recourses provided by the law of
the requested state, permitted the raising of a Charter  issue. However,
he did not find it necessary to decide the point since in his view, the federal
and state offences in this case were not the same, and Schmidt therefore had
not been acquitted of ""the offence"" as required by s. 11 (h) of
the Charter .

 

16.              The
appeal was, therefore, dismissed. Leave was then granted to appeal to this
Court, [1984] 1 S.C.R. xiii.

 

Jurisdiction
of this Court

 

17.              Before
addressing the substantive issues raised by the appellant, it is first
necessary to consider an issue raised by the respondent, namely, whether this
Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. This issue arises out of the fact
that there is an apparent conflict between s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. S‑19, as amended, and s. 719(5) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34.

 

18.              Taken
by itself, s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act makes it clear that no appeal
lies in habeas corpus proceedings in extradition matters. It reads:

 

                   40. No appeal to
the Supreme Court lies under section 38 or 39 from a judgment in a criminal
cause, in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari
or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge, or in proceedings for or
upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of a claim for extradition made
under a treaty. [Emphasis added.]

 

In Re
Lazier (1899), 29 S.C.R. 630, this Court held that, by virtue of the
forerunner of this provision, the Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal from habeas corpus proceedings in an extradition matter. As here,
the attempted appeal was from a provincial court of appeal: see also Gaynor
and Greene v. United States of America (1905), 36 S.C.R. 247, at p. 249.

 

19.              In
1965, however, s. 719  of the Criminal Code  was enacted (S.C. 1964‑65,
c. 53). It provided for appeals from decisions in proceedings involving
extraordinary remedies and, in particular, under s. 719(5) from a judgment in a
habeas corpus proceeding to a provincial court of appeal and thence to
this Court. Section 719(5) reads:

 

                   (5) Where a judgment is issued
on the return of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, an appeal
therefrom lies to the court of appeal, and from a judgment of the court of
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, with the leave of that court, at the
instance of the applicant or the Attorney General of the province concerned or
the Attorney General of Canada, but not at the instance of any other party.

 

20.              To
understand the interrelationship of the two provisions, it is essential to
examine their history. When the precursor of s. 40 was passed, Parliament was
then guided by a general policy of preventing prolonged litigation in criminal
matters by restricting appeals. For many years Parliament made no provision for
appeals from habeas corpus proceedings to provincial courts of appeal,
though appeals to the Supreme Court were, in some circumstances, possible (see Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, ss. 57 and 58). The policy appears to have
been particularly marked in relation to extradition matters; see Gaynor and
Greene, supra, at p. 249, and the predecessors of s. 40 of the Supreme
Court Act ensured that such appeals could not be entertained in the Supreme
Court either.

 

21.              There
were instances, however, where provincial courts of appeal overlooked the fact
that there was no provision for appeal from habeas corpus hearings in extradition
matters; see, for example, in Ontario, Re Low (1932), 41 O.W.N. 468, and
in Quebec, Ecrement v. Séguin (1921), 39 C.C.C. 113. In Re Storgoff,
[1945] S.C.R. 526, however, this Court made it clear that there was no appeal
to these courts from a decision on habeas corpus, but it was only later
that this ruling was applied to extradition cases: see Re Wattebled
(1952), 106 C.C.C. 200 (Que. C.A.); Re Johnston and Shane (1959), 18
D.L.R. (2d) 102 (Ont. C.A.)

 

22.              Over
the past several decades, however, Parliamentary attitude towards criminal
appeals has changed, and such appeals have been provided on a much more
extended basis. The right of the Crown to appeal against an acquittal is an
example. More specifically, three years after the last mentioned case, Johnston
and Shane, was decided, in November 1962 a Bill was introduced in the House
of Commons to provide an appeal from habeas corpus proceedings.
Provisions of this Bill, as amended, now appear in s. 719  of the Criminal
Code . Given that the recent cases holding that there was no appeal from habeas
corpus proceedings were extradition cases, and given that habeas corpus
was the only means of reviewing extradition cases, it is reasonable to assume
that appeals from judgments in habeas corpus in extradition cases were
intended to be comprised in s. 719 . 

 

23.              This
development was traced by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Re Federal Republic
of Germany and Rauca, supra, which concluded its examination of this
issue with the following passage, at p. 396:

 

                   Having regard to the history of the
amendment of the Code, we think it is clear that s. 719  was intended to
give a general right of appeal in habeas corpus proceedings, including
proceedings upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of a claim for
extradition, and is not restricted to habeas corpus proceedings under
the Criminal Code . We hold, therefore, that the appellant has the right
to appeal to this court.

 

The
Court of Appeal of British Columbia soon adopted this reasoning in Re Meier
and The Queen (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 210.

 

24.              If
one concludes that there is an appeal to a provincial court of appeal from habeas
corpus in an extradition matter, one must equally conclude that a
subsequent appeal may be brought to this Court because s. 719  creates an
integrated scheme. In enacting this provision, Parliament obviously overlooked
s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act. It must, however, be taken to have been
superseded by the later provision. To the extent that there is conflict between
s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act and s. 719 of the Code, then, s.
40 has been impliedly repealed. I should perhaps say that in dealing with this
issue in my book Extradition To and From Canada (2nd ed. 1977), at pp.
131‑32, I did not advert to the intertwined judicial and legislative
history of the two provisions.

 

25.              I,
therefore, hold that this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal.

 

The Non‑Charter
Extradition Issues

 

26.              I
shall deal with the non‑Charter  arguments on extradition before
addressing the Charter  issues. It may be useful at the outset, however,
to recall precisely what extradition is. Extradition is the surrender by one
state to another, on request, of persons accused or convicted of committing a
crime in the state seeking the surrender. This is ordinarily done pursuant to a
treaty or other arrangement between these states acting in their sovereign
capacity and obviously engages their honour and good faith. A surrender under
these treaties is primarily an executive act. Charter  considerations and
international implications apart, it is under domestic law in the discretion of
the executive to surrender or not to surrender a fugitive requested by another
state.

 

27.              However,
as Laskin J. (as he then was) noted in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.
Hernandez, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228, at p. 245, concern for the liberty of the
individual has not been overlooked in these rather special proceedings. That is
why provision is made in the treaties and in the Extradition Act  to
ensure that, before the discretion to surrender can be exercised, a judicial
hearing must be held for the purpose of determining whether there is such
evidence of the crime alleged to have been committed in the foreign country as
would, according to the law of Canada, justify his or her committal for trial
if it had been committed here. If so, the judge commits the fugitive for
surrender, and the executive may then exercise its discretion to surrender; if
not, he or she is discharged (s. 18 of the Act). The hearing is similar to a
preliminary hearing, the presiding judge being ordained by s. 13 of the Act to
hear the case in the same manner, ""as nearly as may be"", as at a
preliminary hearing for a crime committed in this country.

 

28.              The
hearing thus protects the individual in this country from being surrendered for
trial for a crime in a foreign country unless prima facie evidence is
produced that he or she has done something there that would constitute a crime
mentioned in the treaty if committed here. It must be emphasized that this
hearing is not a trial and no attempt should be made to make it one. The trial,
when held, will be in the foreign country according to its laws for an alleged
crime committed there, and it should require no demonstration that such a
prosecution is wholly within the competence of that country. A judge at an
extradition hearing has no jurisdiction to deal with defences that could be
raised at trial unless, of course, the Act or the treaty otherwise provides.

 

29.              Counsel
for Schmidt argued, however, that the principle of double jeopardy is so
fundamental to our criminal law that in providing that an extradition hearing
should be conducted ""as nearly as may be"" like a preliminary hearing,
Parliament must have intended to import into the extradition hearing some way
of presenting defences to prevent a person from being twice prosecuted for the
same offence. That, however, would seem to me to import trial procedures into
the hearing, an approach that is out of keeping with extradition law generally.
In domestic law, such pleas can be made at trial. In extradition matters, too,
these are issues that can be raised at the trial in the foreign country. In my
view, the reference to a procedure that is the same ""as nearly as may
be"" as a preliminary hearing is intended to accommodate the differences
between the two types of proceedings, such as, for example, the provisions in
the treaty and the Act for presenting evidence by depositions.

 

30.              This
conclusion is supportable both in principle and on practical grounds. In
principle, as Hagarty J. long ago reminded us, the country seeking
surrender under a treaty must be trusted with the trial of offences; see Re
Burley (1865), 1 C.L.J. 34 (C.L. Ch.) It should not be forgotten
either that the good faith of this country in honouring its international
obligations is involved. 

 

31.              As
well, an attempt by courts to consider defences more appropriately dealt with
at trial could seriously affect the efficient working of a salutary system
devised by states for the mutual surrender of suspected wrongdoers. In
particular, a proper determination of pleas such as autrefois acquit and
res judicata presents difficult problems requiring an in‑depth
knowledge of facts and law that are best dealt with at trial. This is
especially so in extradition matters where it is necessary to prove the foreign
law as a fact if such defences are permitted, and where only sufficient facts
are presented as are necessary to justify the committal of the fugitive.

 

32.              That
the parties to the present treaty must have looked at the situation in this way
is apparent from a treaty provision upon which counsel for Schmidt relies.
Article 4(1)(i) expressly provides that extradition shall not be granted ""‑‑When
the person whose surrender is sought is being proceeded against, or has been
tried and discharged or punished in the territory of the requested State
for the offense for which his extradition is requested"" (emphasis added).
If the parties had considered that double jeopardy in the requesting
state should be a valid defence at an extradition hearing, one would have
thought the treaty would have referred to it since the parties evidently
adverted to the issue. The truth is that the parties obviously understood the
practical difficulties of providing for such a defence at the hearing, leaving
it, like other trial matters, to be dealt with in the requesting country. That
is what is done under most of the treaties. When states wish to provide for a
defence of autrefois acquit in circumstances where the fugitive has
already been tried in the requesting state, or elsewhere for that matter, they
expressly provide for it; see, for example, the extradition treaty with Israel,
article 4, Canada Treaty Series 1969, No. 25. I do not, therefore,
accept the dicta to the contrary expressed in Atkinson v. United
States of America Government, [1971] A.C. 197. I might add that I see
nothing in the principle set forth in article 2 of the treaty (that the offence
concerned must be a crime in both countries) that affects the foregoing
reasoning.

 

33.              Finally,
in the course of the oral argument counsel referred to the early English case
of Re Windsor (1865), 6 B. & S. 522, 122 E.R. 1288 (K.B.), where it
appears to have been thought that extradition could not be granted for state
crimes in the United States but, as Duff J. said in Re Collins (No. 3)
(1905), 10 C.C.C. 80 (B.C.S.C.), this view was based on a misconception of the
division of legislative power in the United States and has never been followed.

 

Section
11 (h) of the Charter 

 

34.              The
appellant's major arguments, however, relate to the Charter . Counsel
submitted that the child stealing charge is substantially the same as the
kidnapping charge and that consequently the appellant is protected from being
tried under the child stealing charge under s. 11 (h) of the Charter ,
which reads as follows:

 

                   11. Any person charged
with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(h) if finally acquitted of the offence, not
to be tried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the
offence, not to be tried or punished for it again;

 

35.              There
can be no doubt that the actions undertaken by the Government of Canada in
extradition as in other matters are subject to scrutiny under the Charter 
(s. 32 ). Equally, though, there cannot be any doubt that the Charter  does
not govern the actions of a foreign country; see, for example, Spencer v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 278. In particular the Charter  cannot be
given extraterritorial effect to govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign
country are to be conducted.

 

36.              These
propositions must, I think, be kept firmly in mind in examining the right
protected by s. 11 (h). The right is that of a person charged with an
offence not to be tried for the offence again if he or she has already been finally
acquitted of the offence. The Government of Canada, to which the Charter 
applies, is not trying the fugitive. An extradition hearing, we saw, is not a
trial. It is simply a hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence
of an alleged extradition crime to warrant the Government under its treaty
obligations to surrender a fugitive to a foreign country for trial by the
authorities there for an offence committed within its jurisdiction. To repeat,
s. 11 (h) was not intended to be given extraterritorial application so as
to govern criminal processes in another country. It was intended to govern
trials conducted by the governments of this country mentioned in s. 32 . Here no
trial is being conducted by the Government of Canada. If a trial is to be held,
it will be conducted by a foreign government in a foreign country for an
offence under its laws.

 

37.              Fundamentally,
what the appellant seeks to do is to restructure the extradition hearing (which
is simply one to determine a condition precedent to the executive's power to
surrender, i.e., whether there is a prima facie case that an alleged
extradition crime was committed) into a quite different proceeding to determine
whether the foreign trial meets the standards of a trial conducted in this
country. I agree with the extradition judge, Collins Dist. Ct. J., that he had
no jurisdiction to do this. 

 

38.              This
approach is supported by the whole structure of s. 11 . Not only is a fugitive
at an extradition hearing not being charged with an offence, certainly not by
the Government of Canada, several of the rights of a ""person charged with
an offence"" can simply have no application to extradition. These include
the right to be presumed innocent (s. 11 (d)) and the right to a jury
trial (s. 11 (f)), both of which do not exist in a number of countries
with which we have extradition treaties. How could Canada surrender fugitives
to those countries to be tried there if such issues could be raised at an
extradition hearing? Nor can these provisions be isolated. To say that some
provisions of s. 11  apply to extradition hearings, while others do not,
involves giving varying meanings to ""any person charged with an
offence"" in the opening words of the section. In my view, Tallis J.A. was
correct in saying in R. v. Heit (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Sask. C.A.),
at p. 100, that the expression must have a constant meaning throughout, one
that harmonizes with the various paragraphs of the section.

 

39.              Briefly
stated, I think s. 11  relates to charges laid by the governments referred to in
s. 32  of the Charter . An extradition hearing does not fall within that
description. It is interesting that the courts of the United States have
arrived at a similar result under their constitution. The Fifth Amendment right
not ""to be twice put in jeopardy"", has been held to be available only
in the United States: see Re Ryan, 360 F. Supp. 270 (E.D. N.Y. 1973).

 

40.              I
would not, however, wish to be interpreted as saying that some of the interests
involved in s. 11 , such as the right to bail (s. 11 (e)), are not
similarly protected at an extradition hearing under other provisions of the Charter ;
consider the interplay between s. 7  (the right to liberty) and s. 15  (equality
before the law).

 

41.              I
am, therefore, of the view that s. 11 (h) of the Charter  does not
apply to an extradition hearing.

 

Section
7  of the Charter 

 

42.              As
will be evident from what I have already said, I am far from thinking that the Charter 
has no application to extradition. The surrender of a person to a foreign
country may obviously affect a number of Charter  rights. In Rauca,
supra, for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized that
extradition intruded on a citizen's right under s. 6  to remain in Canada,
although it also found that the beneficial aspects of the procedure in
preventing malefactors from evading justice, a procedure widely adopted all
over the world, were sufficient to sustain it as a reasonable limit under s. 1 
of the Charter . Section 6  was not raised in this case, though Schmidt is
a Canadian citizen, no doubt because her counsel believed, as I do, that it was
properly disposed of in the Rauca case. However, it does not follow from
the fact that the procedure is generally justifiable that the manner in which
the procedures are conducted in Canada and the conditions under which a
fugitive is surrendered can never invite Charter  scrutiny. The pre‑eminence
of the Constitution must be recognized; the treaty, the extradition hearing in
this country and the exercise of the executive discretion to surrender a
fugitive must all conform to the requirements of the Charter , including
the principles of fundamental justice.

 

43.              No
issue was raised that Canadian officials did anything improper in the conduct
of the proceedings. Nor was any objection raised in this Court about the nature
of the extradition procedure itself, the objection raised below that the
fugitive offender had a right under s. 7  of the Charter  to cross‑examine
deponents on affidavits submitted in support of the extradition application
having, in my view, rightly been abandoned.

 

44.              What
is squarely in issue here is whether the surrender of a fugitive by the
Government of Canada to the United States for the purpose of having her tried
for a state crime which bears some similarity to a federal crime for which she
has already been tried and acquitted in respect of the same transaction
violates s. 7  of the Charter , which reads as follows:

 

                   7. Everyone has
the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be
deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

45.              In
so far as any general objection might be made that extradition interferes with
the right to life, liberty and security of the person is concerned, such
objection would be met by considerations similar to those adopted in Rauca
in respect of s. 6  of the Charter . The real question is whether the
fugitive in the circumstances of this case would, by virtue of her proposed
extradition, be deprived of this right in a manner that did not conform to the
principles of fundamental justice.

 

46.              I
should at the outset say that the surrender of a fugitive to a foreign country
is subject to Charter  scrutiny notwithstanding that such surrender
primarily involves the exercise of executive discretion. In Operation
Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, Dickson J. (now C.J.)
made it clear that ""the executive branch of the Canadian government is
duty bound to act in accordance with the dictates of the Charter ""
(p. 455) and that even ""disputes of a political or foreign policy nature
may be properly cognizable by the courts"" (p. 459); see also Wilson J. at
p. 464. 

 

47.              I
have no doubt either that in some circumstances the manner in which the foreign
state will deal with the fugitive on surrender, whether that course of conduct
is justifiable or not under the law of that country, may be such that it would
violate the principles of fundamental justice to surrender an accused under
those circumstances. To make the point, I need only refer to a case that arose
before the European Commission on Human Rights, Altun v. Germany (1983),
5 E.H.R.R. 611, where it was established that prosecution in the requesting
country might involve the infliction of torture. Situations falling far short
of this may well arise where the nature of the criminal procedures or penalties
in a foreign country sufficiently shocks the conscience as to make a decision
to surrender a fugitive for trial there one that breaches the principles of
fundamental justice enshrined in s. 7 . I might say, however, that in most
cases, at least, judicial intervention should await the exercise of executive
discretion. For the decision to surrender is that of the executive authorities,
not the courts, and it should not be lightly assumed that they will overlook
their duty to obey constitutional norms by surrendering an individual to a
foreign country under circumstances where doing so would be fundamentally
unjust.

 

48.              I
hasten to add, however, that I see nothing unjust in surrendering to a foreign
country a person accused of having committed a crime there for trial in the
ordinary way in accordance with the system for the administration of justice
prevailing in that country simply because that system is substantially
different from ours with different checks and balances. The judicial process in
a foreign country must not be subjected to finicky evaluations against the rules
governing the legal process in this country. A judicial system is not, for
example, fundamentally unjust‑‑indeed it may in its practical
workings be as just as ours‑‑because it functions on the basis of
an investigatory system without a presumption of innocence or, generally,
because its procedural or evidentiary safeguards have none of the rigours of
our system.

 

49.              What
has to be determined is whether or not, in the particular circumstances of the
case, surrender of a fugitive for a trial offends against the basic demands of
justice. In determining that issue, the courts must begin with the notion that
the executive must first have determined that the general system for the
administration of justice in the foreign country sufficiently corresponds to
our concepts of justice to warrant entering into the treaty in the first place,
and must have recognized that it too has a duty to ensure that its actions
comply with constitutional standards. Blind judicial deference to executive
judgment cannot, of course, be expected. The courts have the duty to uphold the
Constitution. Nonetheless, this is an area where the executive is likely to be
far better informed than the courts, and where the courts must be extremely
circumspect so as to avoid interfering unduly in decisions that involve the
good faith and honour of this country in its relations with other states. In a
word, judicial intervention must be limited to cases of real substance.

 

50.              It
is not beside the point to observe that any other approach would seriously
impair the effective functioning of a salutary system for preventing criminals
from evading the demands of justice in one country by escaping to another. In a
world where modern communications make international and transnational criminal
activity and evasion ever easier, no demonstration is required of the need for
a reasonably effective system for the surrender of fugitives from one country
to another untrammelled by excessive technicality or fastidious demands that
foreign systems comply with our constitutional standards. A decision to
surrender a fugitive for trial in a foreign country cannot be faulted as
fundamentally unjust because the operation of the foreign law in the particular
circumstances has not been subjected to scrutiny to see if it will conform to
the standards of our system of justice.

 

51.              I
would add that the lessons of history should not be overlooked. Sir Edward
Clarke instructs us that in the early 19th century the English judges, by
strict and narrow interpretation, almost completely nullified the operation of
the few extradition treaties then in existence: see A Treatise Upon the Law
of Extradition (4th ed. 1903), c. V. Following the enactment of the British
Extradition Act, 1870 (U.K.), 33 & 34 Vict., c. 52, upon which ours
is modelled, this approach was reversed. The present system of extradition
works because courts give the treaties a fair and liberal interpretation with a
view to fulfilling Canada's obligations, reducing the technicalities of
criminal law to a minimum and trusting the courts in the foreign country to
give the fugitive a fair trial, including such matters as giving proper weight
to the evidence and adequate consideration of available defences and the
dictates of due process generally.

 

52.              That
the approach I have suggested is not unreasonable is evident from the
experience of the United States, with its rather similar constitution. The
application of that country's experience, it is true, must be viewed in light
of the ""political question"" doctrine under which wide judicial deference
is accorded to certain executive decisions, including those in the field of
foreign relations, an issue not yet resolved in this country although it has
been the subject of some discussion in this Court; see the remarks of Wilson J.
in Operation Dismantle Inc., supra, at p. 464. However, the
courts of that country, while recognizing the pre‑eminent role of the
executive in this area, have noted that all branches of government are subject
to the supremacy of the Constitution and that the judiciary may have a useful
role to play: see Holmes v. Laird, 459 F.2d 1211 (D.C. Cir. 1972), certiorari
denied 409 U.S. 869. In particular, they have stated that an extradition
hearing must conform to the requirements of due process: see Gallina v.
Fraser, 177 F. Supp. 856 (D. Conn. 1959), aff'd 278 F.2d 77 (2d Cir. 1960),
certiorari denied 364 U.S. 851.

 

53.              It
is clear, however, that the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution
are not to be exported to other countries, even where American citizens are
involved. In the leading case of Neely v. Henkel (No. 1), 180 U.S. 109
(1901), the United States Supreme Court was faced with the task of reconciling
its laws governing extradition to Cuba with the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution of the United States. Harlan J., giving the judgment of the court,
had this to say at p. 122: 

 

                   It is contended that the act of June
6, 1900, is unconstitutional and void in that it does not secure to the
accused, when surrendered to a foreign country for trial in its tribunals, all
of the rights, privileges and immunities that are guaranteed by the
Constitution to persons charged with the commission in this country of crime
against the United States. Allusion is here made to the provisions of the
Federal Constitution relating to the writ of habeas corpus bills of
attainder, ex post facto laws, trial by jury for crimes, and generally
to the fundamental guarantees of life, liberty and property embodied in that
instrument. The answer to this suggestion is that those provisions have no
relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the United States
against the laws of a foreign country.

 

At page
123, he continued:

 

                   In connection with the above
proposition, we are reminded of the fact that the appellant is a citizen of the
United States. But such citizenship does not give him an immunity to commit
crime in other countries, nor entitle him to demand, of right, a trial in any
other mode than that allowed to its own people by the country whose laws he has
violated and from whose justice he has fled. When an American citizen commits a
crime in a foreign country he cannot complain if required to submit to such
modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe
for its own people, unless a different mode be provided for by treaty
stipulations between that country and the United States.

 

This
course has been followed ever since. In Gallina v. Fraser, supra,
for example, the Federal Court of Appeal (2d Cir.) refused to give effect to an
objection that returning to Italy a fugitive who had been convicted in
absentia in accordance with that country's traditional process violated the
due process clause. Again, in Holmes v. Laird, supra, that court
also refused to countenance objections to a request to surrender an accused
based on several constitutional grounds, including speedy trial and
representation by effective counsel of his choice.

 

54.              In
the latter case, the court underlined the practical problems associated with
adopting another course. It had this to say at p. 1218:

 

                   It is evident that if appellants'
point were to be entertained, an in‑depth examination of the West German
trial record would become an indispensable forerunner of any endeavor to
resolve their claims on the merits. We need not pause to reflect on the
difficulties ‑‑practical or otherwise‑‑of such an
undertaking for appellants' contention that the Constitution has the effect
asserted is doomed, we think, by the Supreme Court's holding in Neely v.
Henkel.

 

The
present case reveals that such fears are not unrealistic. As we have seen, the
courts below engaged in a thorough examination of the trial record in the
federal prosecution for kidnapping and detailed arguments from that record were
made in this Court. It requires little imagination to conclude that if against
a background of widely divergent systems of law such a procedure were
introduced into any significant number of extradition cases, an effective
system of extradition could well be jeopardized. Judicial intervention in this
area must, therefore, as I have stated, be restricted to compelling situations
bearing in mind that the executive has the first responsibility in this area
and that judicial intervention conveys in Lord Russell C.J.'s phrase in Re
Arton, [1896] 1 Q.B. 108, at p. 115, ""a reflection of the gravest
possible kind, not only upon the motive and actions of the responsible
Government, but also impliedly upon the judicial authorities of a neighbouring
and friendly Power"".

 

55.              Though
the arguments made on behalf of Schmidt were largely based on s. 11 (h)
of the Charter , those arguments may also be framed in terms of s. 7 , and
indeed reliance was placed on that provision as well. Counsel contended that
her extradition would deprive her of her right to liberty and security with
respect to a matter for which she could not be brought to trial in Canada. As I
noted previously, I do not think our constitutional standards can be imposed on
other countries. A person who is accused of violating the laws of a foreign
country within its jurisdiction cannot, it seems to me, rightly complain that
she has been deprived of her liberty and security in a manner inconsistent with
the principles of fundamental justice simply because she is to be surrendered
to that country for trial in accordance with its traditional procedures, even
though those procedures may not meet the specific constitutional requirements
for trial in this country. In particular, I do not think we should attempt to
export our particular version of the technical pleas of autrefois acquit
and res judicata to a foreign country. Still less do I think that these
should be raised at an extradition hearing, where to rely on such pleas, in a
setting where foreign law must be proved and where facts may have to be
established under procedural and evidentiary rules different from those of the
requesting state, invites importing into extradition proceedings factors which
the experience of over a hundred years establishes to be unwise.

 

56.              I
find it unnecessary, then, to explore whether the foreign courts should, on
such evidence as we now have, give effect to the pleas of autrefois acquit
and res judicata. This is not to say that the underlying considerations
involved in these pleas are to be ignored in considering whether the executive
should refuse to surrender on the grounds that such surrender would violate the
principles of fundamental justice. Repeated attempts by the same prosecutorial
authorities to prosecute a person for the same offence may, in certain
circumstances, well amount to harassment sufficiently oppressive that surrender
of such a person would violate those principles. As I mentioned earlier,
however, the courts should intervene only in compelling situations.

 

57.              The
present case does not seem to me to meet this standard. I cannot accede to the
proposition that the attempt by state authorities to enforce their own laws
violates those principles by reason only that the federal authorities, in
attempting to enforce their laws, prosecuted her for an offence similar to that
for which the state prosecution was initiated. This is far from being a clear‑cut
situation. The two offences involve quite different elements. The kidnapping
offence is aimed at regulating interstate and foreign commerce, and maritime
jurisdiction, as well as internationally protected persons. The state action is
aimed at public order within the state, and is designed particularly to protect
young persons. Various other elements and defences appear in one provision but
not the other. Different interests are involved with different prosecutorial authorities
following their own paths. Similar situations may exist in this country; see Multiple
Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161; R. v. Chiasson
(1982), 135 D.L.R. (3d) 499 (N.B.C.A.), aff'd [1984] 1 S.C.R. 266. They do not
generally arise in as acute a fashion here because criminal law is exclusively
vested in Parliament, but on the other hand the same prosecutorial authorities
are often involved.

 

58.              I
am not troubled by the possibility that had the prosecution for the state
offence been tried with the federal offence, Schmidt might well have been
acquitted of the state offence. The fact is, of course, that this could not
have happened. The federal court had no jurisdiction over the state offence.
The only way the state authorities could enforce their laws was by prosecuting
in their own courts. I see nothing sufficiently oppressive in this situation to
warrant refusing surrender on the basis that such a prosecution, ipso facto,
violates the principles of fundamental justice. It is interesting that, as we
saw, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that successive
prosecutions at the federal and state level do not automatically offend against
the due process clause, the spirit and content of which bears some resemblance
to s. 7  of the Charter , although the courts would act to prevent
oppressive behaviour; see United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377 (1922); Bartkus
v. Illinois, supra; Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187
(1959).

 

59.              For
these reasons, I do not think that surrendering the appellant Schmidt under
these circumstances constitutes a breach of s. 7  of the Charter .

 

Conclusion

 

60.              I
would dismiss the appeal. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

61.              Lamer J.‑‑I
agree with Justice La Forest for the reasons given by him that this Court has
jurisdiction to hear this appeal. I also agree with La Forest J. when he
states, at p. 518, that:

 

                   There can be no doubt that the
actions undertaken by the Government of Canada in extradition as in other
matters are subject to scrutiny under the Charter  (s. 32 ). Equally,
though, there cannot be any doubt that the Charter  does not govern the
actions of a foreign country; see, for example, Spencer v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 278. In particular the Charter  cannot be given
extraterritorial effect to govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign country
are to be conducted.

 

I also
agree with him when he says (at p. 522):

 

                   I have no doubt either that in some
circumstances the manner in which the foreign state will deal with the fugitive
on surrender, whether that course of conduct is justifiable or not under the
law of that country, may be such that it would violate the principles of
fundamental justice to surrender an accused under those circumstances.

 

62.              I
therefore share the view that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
should not, save special circumstances, be given extraterritorial effect by
refusing to conduct a hearing or surrender a person on the grounds that the
prospective trial would be in violation thereof. Sharing the view of La Forest
J. that the Charter  applies to the proceedings taking place in Canada, I
am however of the view that a person undergoing extradition proceedings is a
""person charged with an offence"" as that term is used in s. 11  of the
Charter . Indeed, I do not see why a person undergoing such an inquiry
for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient evidence to put that
person on trial in a foreign country should be denied the protection that would
be afforded that same person at his preliminary inquiry for a charge to be
tried in a Canadian court. Therefore, as the proceedings in Canada are in the
nature of a preliminary inquiry, those rights of ss. 7  to 14 , including s. 11 ,
guaranteed accused at that stage of the criminal proceedings in Canada are also
guaranteed to those being subjected to extradition proceedings. Some obviously
do not apply to preliminary inquiries and should normally not apply to
extradition proceedings. That is the case of a plea of autrefois acquit,
whether raised under s. 11 (h) or s. 7 . Such a plea is generally
considered to be premature at the stage of the preliminary inquiry and should
generally be raised at the trial (R. v. Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, at
pp. 507‑08). But what if the foreign country where the trial is to take
place does not allow pleas of autrefois acquit as between, as in this
case, federal and state prosecutions? Should this not be a situation where we
should allow the plea to be raised at this phase of the proceedings because we
feel that, to use the words of La Forest J., ""it would violate the principles
of fundamental justice to surrender an accused under those circumstances""?
As regards autrefois acquit or convict I think so. But this
finding will not enure to the benefit of appellant as I share the view of La
Forest J. that in this case that special plea should not succeed because
""The two offences involve quite different elements.""

 

63.              I
would accordingly dismiss this appeal. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

64.              Wilson J.‑‑I
have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleague, Justice La Forest, but am
unable to concur in them although I concur in his proposed disposition of the
appeal.

 

65.              In
my view, no question arises in this case of the extradition court giving the Charter
of Rights and Freedoms extraterritorial effect so as to govern the criminal
process in another country or of the extradition court entertaining defences on
the merits to the foreign charge. The issue, in my respectful view, is whether
a Canadian citizen who is the subject of extradition proceedings in a Canadian
court can plead the Charter  in those Canadian proceedings. I would have
thought that he or she clearly can.

 

66.              The
appellant pleads ss. 11 (h) and 7  not, I emphasize, as a defence in the
projected trial in the State of Ohio, but as a defence to the extradition
court's grant of an order committing her to prison to await the decision of the
executive branch of government whether or not to surrender her to the U.S.
authorities. Her argument in a nutshell is that the extradition court would be
violating her ss. 11 (h) and 7  rights if it made such an order.

 

67.              This
Court held in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1
S.C.R. 177, that the deportation of any person in Canada (let alone a Canadian
citizen) to a country where his or her life, liberty or security of the person
was threatened would constitute a violation of s. 7  if the deportation order
was not made in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. It is
clear from Singh that it is the process in Canada which must
comply with fundamental justice. The appellant submits that to permit her
extradition to the United States to face a trial on a charge on which she has
already been tried and acquitted would be contrary to the principles of
fundamental justice and, in particular, to the principle reflected in s. 11 (h).
We know that that principle will not avail the appellant in the Ohio court. It
is not a defence there. But the question is: is it a defence to the
respondents' claim for an order committing the appellant to prison to await the
discretionary decision of the Executive? This, it seems to me, is the question
before us. A similar question will confront the Executive when it has to decide
whether or not to make the extradition order since acts of the Executive are
also subject to Charter  review: see Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The
Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441. But that is not before us: only the issue as it
relates to the Canadian court proceedings is before us.

 

68.              My
point of departure from La Forest J. is that he appears to think that the
recognition of Charter  rights in the Canadian proceedings would be to
give extraterritorial effect to the Charter  and constitute an
interference with the processes of the foreign court. I must respectfully
disagree. If the Court refuses to commit the appellant to prison for extradition
in the discretion of the Executive because to do so would violate the
appellant's Charter  rights, the Charter  is not being given
extraterritorial effect. The effect is right here in Canada, in the Canadian
proceedings, although it will, of course, have repercussions abroad. But there
is nothing wrong in this. We would not permit a Canadian citizen to be
extradited for torture in a foreign land on the basis that to refuse to permit
it would be to give the Charter  extraterritorial effect. We did not take
that approach in Singh or in Operation Dismantle. If the
participation of a Canadian court or the Canadian Government is required in
order to facilitate extradition so that suspected criminals may be brought to
justice in other countries, it seems to me that we must face up to the question
whether such persons have the benefit of the Charter  or not in the
Canadian proceedings. We must, in other words, decide whether Canada's
treaty obligations override Charter  rights in respect of the Canadian
proceedings or whether Charter  rights must be recognized in those
proceedings whether or not similar rights are available to the person in the
foreign proceedings for which he or she may be ordered extradited.

 

69.              In
my view, Charter  rights which are enshrined in our Constitution as part
of the supreme law of Canada must be recognized and given effect in any
judicial proceeding in Canada unless a reasonable limit justified under s. 1 
has been imposed upon them. The Ontario Court of Appeal has held that the
extradition process is itself a reasonable limit: see Re Federal Republic of
Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) I do not find it
necessary to express a view on this very important question in this case since
I think the appellant has failed to establish that the offence in Ohio is the
same offence as the offence under the United States Code.

 

70.              In
approaching the issue of the sameness of the offences I think it is important
for the Canadian court to apply its mind first to the question of what law is
properly applicable to determine whether two offences in foreign jurisdictions
are or are not the same. It seems to me that two steps are required. First, the
meaning, purpose and effect of each of the foreign laws must be independently
ascertained. This is done, I believe, under Canadian conflict of laws rules by
reference to the law of the respective foreign jurisdictions. Expert evidence
will have to be adduced in the Canadian court. Second, the foreign laws would
then be compared in light of their respective meaning, purpose and effect to
determine whether or not the offences created under them are the same. This
would be done, in my view, by resort to Canadian domestic law, in this case the
law set out by this Court in R. v. Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480. While it
is entirely appropriate for the foreign law to interpret and explain the
nature, purpose and effect of its own offences, the comparison of these
offences for purposes of the application of the Canadian double jeopardy
principle would seem to be peculiarly for Canadian law. I do not believe,
however, that the two steps can be collapsed into one. 

 

71.              The
witness Spiros Gonakis, who was qualified as an expert witness in both Ohio and
federal criminal law, was prepared to collapse them into one and gave his
expert opinion not only as to the nature of the two foreign offences under
review but also as to the degree of their identity for double jeopardy purposes,
even although he acknowledged that double jeopardy was not a defence to the
Ohio charge under Ohio law. He testified that the two offences were the same.
He acknowledged, however, that the essential elements of the offences were not
the same and that the defences to the charges were different. Steele J.
therefore disregarded his opinion as to their sameness and so also did the
Court of Appeal.

 

72.              It
seems to me that counsel for the appellant failed at the extradition hearing to
discharge the burden that was his under ss. 7 and 11(h) of the Charter
of showing that the federal and Ohio offences were the same offence. In
failing to establish that, he failed to establish that the appellant's Charter 
rights would be violated if the order sought by the respondents was made.
This is determinative of the issues in the case.

 

73.              For
these reasons I agree with the disposition of the appeal proposed by La Forest
J. I also agree with La Forest J. for the reasons given by him that this Court
had jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.

 

74.              I
have now had the benefit also of the reasons of my colleague, Justice Lamer,
and, while I am in complete agreement with him as to the applicability of the Charter 
to the appellant's extradition proceedings (leaving aside s. 1 ), I have
some reservations about his view that a person, by virtue of being the subject
of extradition proceedings in Canada, is a ""person charged with an
offence"" in Canada within the meaning of the opening words of s. 11 . I
rely rather on the fact that the opening words of s. 11  are not subject to
geographical limitation. The appellant is indisputably a ""person charged
with an offence"", albeit not in Canada but in Ohio, i.e., the offence of
child‑stealing, but she is a person ""in Canada"" entitled to the
protection of ss. 7  and 11 (h) in any proceedings being conducted in
Canada with a view to such a charge, whether such proceeding itself partakes of
a trial or not. It is on this basis that I conclude somewhat tentatively that
the appellant would have been entitled to the protection of s. 11 (h)
(subject, of course, to the application of s. 1  which I leave open) had she
been able to discharge the burden of showing that she was charged with the same
offence in Ohio as she had been acquitted of under the United States Code.
If, however, there is doubt as to whether the appellant falls within the strict
wording of s. 11 (h), it would seem to me that she clearly falls within
the broader language of s. 7  and is entitled to the protection of that section
in the extradition proceedings subject again to the application of s. 1 .

                   Respondent
is alleged to have killed his wife at their home in Argentina. Shortly after
his entry to Canada, a warrant of apprehension under the Extradition Act 
was issued and he was arrested on November 30, 1982. Held in custody until the
extradition hearing, he was set free on February 1, 1983 when appellant failed
to produce the necessary documentation within two months of the arrest as
required by article XIV of the extradition treaty between Canada and Argentina.
In June 1984, appellant made a second request for extradition and respondent
was again arrested. At the outset of the extradition hearing on December 10,
1984, respondent made an application to have the proceedings stayed on two
grounds: (1) that there was an infringement of s. 11 (b) of the Charter 
(trial within a reasonable time); and (2) that the extradition proceedings
constituted an abuse of process. The extradition judge found that respondent's
right under s. 11 (b) had been infringed, and pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the
Charter , dismissed the application for extradition and discharged him.
The extradition judge held that in the absence of any reasonable explanation,
the seventeen‑month delay between the discharge of the respondent because
of evidentiary problems in the first extradition proceedings and the
institution of the second proceedings was inordinate.

 

                   Held (Lamer
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted to the
extradition judge to continue the proceedings in accordance with the law.

 

                                                (1) The
Jurisdictional Issue

 

                   This
Court has jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal pursuant to s. 41 of the
Supreme Court Act. In dismissing the application for extradition and
discharging the respondent, the superior court judge, acting as an extradition
judge, made a final judgment within the meaning of s. 41. The decision of this
Court in United States of America v. Link and Green, [1955] S.C.R. 183,
which reached the opposite conclusion, is inconsistent with the reasoning of
this Court in more recent cases and should no longer be followed.

                   (2)   The
Charter  and the Abuse of Process Issues

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: The extradition judge
erred in dismissing the application for extradition on the ground that the
respondent's right under s. 11 (b) of the Charter  has been
infringed. Section 11  has no application to extradition hearings. It relates
only to charges laid by the governments referred to in s. 32  of the Charter .
Respondent was, of course, never charged in Canada by any of the governments to
which the Charter  applies. The prosecution for the offence was within
the jurisdiction of Argentina.

 

                   Further,
s. 11(b) did not apply to the respondent by virtue of article V of the
extradition treaty which provides that extradition shall not take place if
""exemption from prosecution or punishment has been acquired by lapse of
time, according to the laws of the state applying or applied to"". This
provision was intended to bring into operation statutes of limitations that
exist in some countries prohibiting prosecution for certain crimes after a
stated lapse of time. Section 11(b) is not an exemption in that sense.
It would require much stronger words to expand the application of our
constitutional standards for expeditious prosecutions to the international
arena.

 

                   The
contentions that the proceedings should be stayed because the seventeen‑month
delay between respondent's discharge following the first extradition hearing
and the initiation of the second constitute an abuse of process or a breach of
s. 7  of the Charter  must fail. First, the power to grant a stay for
abuse of process, which can be exercised only in the clearest of cases, is not
vested in a judge at an extradition hearing. Second, s. 7 had no application in
this case because the delay cannot be attributed to Canadian authorities, which
is a prerequisite to the application of the Charter  by virtue of s. 32 .
The delay arose because of problems by the Argentinian authorities in framing
the evidence in a form acceptable under Canadian law. Third, the delay in the
present circumstances did not constitute an abuse of process or a contravention
of the principles of fundamental justice. One cannot view delay resulting from
the complexity involved in dealing with activities that reach across national
boundaries and involve different systems of law and several levels of
bureaucracies in the same way as that resulting in local prosecutions.

 

                   In
any event, an extradition judge has no jurisdiction to deal with these issues
and to grant the appropriate remedies. The role of the extradition judge is a
modest one: absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose
of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima
facie case that the extradition crime has been committed. The procedure
bears a considerable affinity to a preliminary hearing, and the judge's powers
have some similarity to those of a magistrate presiding at such a hearing. He
has no jurisdiction to deal with defences that could be raised at trial and he
has no Charter  jurisdiction. The fact that an extradition judge is often
a superior court judge does not alter the matter.

 

                   In
the rare cases where the actions of Canadian officials in the extradition
proceedings may give rise to the need for Charter  review, the
proceedings are to be reviewed by superior courts by means of a writ of habeas
corpus. A court in habeas corpus proceedings is ordinarily confined
to questions of jurisdiction, but as such proceedings are contemplated by
Parliament as the sole means of review in extradition proceedings, a court in habeas
corpus proceedings is obviously the court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of s. 24  of the Charter .

 

                   Finally,
there is nothing offensive to fundamental justice in surrendering in accordance
with our extradition procedures an accused to a foreign country for trial in
accordance with its traditional judicial processes for a crime alleged to have
been committed there. Our courts must assume that he will be given a fair trial
in the foreign country. There may be situations where it would be unjust to
surrender a fugitive either because of the general condition of the
governmental and judicial apparatus or, more likely, because some particular
individual may be subjected to oppressive treatment. In such cases, the courts
may, as guardians of the Constitution, on occasion have a useful role to play
in reviewing the executive's exercise of discretion to surrender a fugitive.
But it is obviously an area in which courts must tread with caution. The
decision to surrender and the responsibility for the conduct of external
relations, including the performance of Canada's obligations under extradition
treaties, is vested in the executive.

 

                   Per Wilson
J.: Section 11  of the Charter  is applicable to extradition proceedings
and s. 11 (b) can properly be invoked when the delay in pursuing
extradition in Canada is unreasonable. But any delay relied on under s. 11 (b)
must be delay caused by the Canadian authorities because under the principles
of comity the Canadian court cannot require the foreign authorities to account
for their delay. In the present case, the delay was due in large part to the
conduct of the Argentinian authorities and the extradition judge therefore was
in error in discharging the respondent on the basis of s. 11 (b).

 

                   Respondent's
argument that the delay in the extradition proceedings constituted an abuse of
process or a violation of s. 7  of the Charter  must also fail since the
essence of respondent's complaint was again the delay caused in large part by
the Argentinian authorities.

 

                   An
application may be made to an extradition judge under s. 24(1)  of the Charter 
if, as in this case, he is also a superior court judge. 

 

                   Per Lamer
J. (dissenting): Section 11  of the Charter  generally applies to
extradition proceedings taking place in Canada in so far as it would apply to a
preliminary inquiry. The right to be tried within a reasonable time is one of
the rights guaranteed by s. 11  which is applicable to a preliminary inquiry and
an extradition hearing. The liberty and security of the person subjected to the
extradition hearing are affected by the holding of a hearing, and the
principles of fundamental justice require that that hearing be resolved in a
speedy manner. In the case at bar, the computation of time for the purposes of
s. 11 (b) started to run when the first extradition proceedings were
instituted. If the seventeen‑month delay between the discharge of the
respondent in the first hearing and the institution of the second proceedings
is unexplained, such delay constitutes an infringement of the right to be tried
within a reasonable time under s. 11 (b). It is irrelevant whether that
delay was due to the acts of the Argentinian or the Canadian authorities.

 

                   An
extradition judge is not a court of competent jurisdiction within the meaning
of s. 24(1) of the Char‑ ter and an applicant should normally seek
remedy in the superior court. However, as a matter of practice, an application
under s. 24(1)  can be made to the extradition judge if he is also a superior
court judge. At the time of the application in this case, the law as to who had
jurisdiction under s. 24(1)  was not clear, and it might well be that, as a
result, the authorities did not attempt to explain and justify the otherwise
unacceptable delay. Consequently, the matters should be remitted to the
superior court judge presiding at the extradition proceedings for completion of
the s. 24(1)  hearing and, subject to the decision on that issue, to terminate
the extradition proceedings either way.

1.                La Forest J.‑‑This
appeal concerns the application of ss. 7  and 11 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to extradition proceedings. These provisions
read as follows:

 

                   7. Everyone has
the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be
deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

                   11. Any person

appeal also raises the question of which courts have jurisdiction respecting
breaches of the Charter  in relation to extradition matters.

 

Facts

 

3.                On
November 8, 1976, the respondent Hector Mellino is alleged to have shot and
killed his wife at their home in Mendoza, Argentina. A warrant for his arrest
was then issued by the appellant Republic of Argentina on June 27, 1977.

 

4.                In
1979, Mellino was arrested in Uruguay and extradition proceedings were begun
against him. However Argentina was unable to supply the necessary documentation
within the time stipulated in its extradition treaty with Uruguay, and Mellino
was accordingly released after two to three weeks' imprisonment.

 

5.                Mellino
later made his way to the United States and eventually entered Canada in the
Fall of 1982. On November 22, 1982, he was arrested in Calgary under the Immigration
Act. Two days later, on November 24, 1982, a warrant for his apprehension
was issued under the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21, and he
was arrested on November 30. On December 6, 1982, Mellino was ordered to be
held in custody until his extradition hearing, which was set for February 14,
1983. However, he was set free on February 1, 1983. By that time, two months
had elapsed from the time of his apprehension, a period that brought into play
article XIV of the extradition treaty between Canada and Argentina, which
provides for a fugitive's release unless sufficient evidence is produced within
that time to warrant his committal for surrender; see Statutes of Canada,
1894, p. xlii, at p. xlvii. Article XIV also makes provision for an extension
of time but an application for this purpose by the Government of Canada to
Brennan J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta was dismissed and Mellino
was set free.

 

6.                Mellino
then applied for convention refugee status under the Immigration Act,
and was granted that status on December 1, 1983. However, from some time during
the Spring of 1983 up to the first half of 1984, meetings were held between
officials of the Department of Justice of Canada and of Argentina regarding the
preparation of evidence in a form admissible in a Canadian extradition hearing.

 

7.                On
June 19, 1984, Argentina made a second request for extradition. On June 29, a
warrant of apprehension was issued by Rowbotham J., and on or about July 17,
1984, Mellino was again arrested. The extradition hearing was set for September
10, 1984, but on August 31 the Government of Canada applied to Dixon J. for an
extension of time on the ground that a necessary witness, an Argentinian
official, would be absent. The application was refused, but a further
application on the same grounds to Quigley J. on September 10 was successful,
and the extradition hearing was set for October 30, 1984. Subsequently, another
application for an extension of time was made, this time, however, by counsel
for Mellino. The application was granted and the hearing adjourned to December
10, 1984, by which date Mellino had been in custody for nearly five months.

 

8.                At
the commencement of the extradition hearing on December 10, 1984, an
application was made on behalf of Mellino to the presiding judge, Waite J., to
have the proceedings stayed on two grounds: first, that there was an infringement
of s. 11 (b) of the Charter  (trial within a reasonable time), and
second, that the extradition proceedings constituted an abuse of process. On
December 11, 1984, Waite J. found that Mellino's right under s. 11 (b) of
the Charter  had been infringed or denied, and pursuant to s. 24(1)  of
the Charter  dismissed the application for extradition and discharged
Mellino. At the time of his discharge no evidence had been presented in support
of the request for extradition. 

 

9.                Waite
J. held that in the absence of any satisfactory or reasonable explanation, the
17‑month delay between the discharge of Mellino because of evidentiary
problems in the first extradition proceedings on February 1, 1983, and the
institution of the second proceedings on June 29, 1984, was inordinate,
especially having regard to the relatively simple requirements of the Act and
the treaty, and the fact that Mellino's identity had been known to the
Argentinian authorities since at least 1977. He noted that the second proceedings
could not continue on September 10 as originally scheduled because of further
evidentiary problems including the departure from Canada of an essential
Argentinian witness. In his view, the delay in the proceedings was unreasonable
within the meaning of s. 11 (b) of the Charter , particularly
since, as article XIV of the treaty indicated, in extradition proceedings, time
was of the essence.

 

10.              In
dismissing the application and discharging Mellino pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter ,
Waite J. rejected the argument that a judge in an extradition proceeding
was not a court of competent jurisdiction. An extradition judge was equivalent
to a magistrate on a preliminary inquiry in the sense that he exercised the
same powers and applied the same test to the evidence. But in other senses, the
extradition judge had a much broader jurisdiction. First, he had additional
powers under treaty and by statute. Second, he did not sit as a persona
designata but as a court of law properly constituted. Finally, he was and
remained a judge of a superior court with the jurisdiction and powers
appertaining to that position.

 

11.              Application
for leave to this Court was granted on April 4, 1985, [1985] 1 S.C.R. xii.

 

The
Jurisdiction of this Court

 

12.              This
appeal is brought under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
S‑19, which in broad terms empowers this Court to grant leave to appeal
from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a
province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in a particular
case. The Act again underscores the breadth of the provision in s. 2(1) by defining
""the court appealed from"" as ""the court from which the appeal is
brought directly to the Supreme Court, whether such court is one of original
jurisdiction or a court of appeal"", and ""final judgment"" as
""any judgment, rule, order or decision that determines in whole or in part
any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial
proceeding"". On a plain reading of these provisions, I would have thought
it obvious that s. 41 applied to the present case. The decision of Waite J., from
which this appeal is taken, finally dismissed the application for extradition
on the ground that s. 11 (b) of the Charter  had been infringed.

 

13.              A
difficulty arises because in United States of America v. Link and Green,
[1955] S.C.R. 183, this Court, in an oral judgment, held that it had no
jurisdiction under s. 41 to grant leave from a refusal of an extradition judge
to commit a fugitive because in its view this was not a ""judgment""
within the meaning of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. Counsel for
Argentina pointed out some factual distinctions between that case and the
present, but in my view he rightly stressed the different contexts in which the
two cases were decided. As I noted in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
500, released contemporaneously with this case, the prevailing legislative
policy at the time Link and Green was decided was against providing
appeals in extradition cases. Equally, if not more important, most appeals to
this Court were then as of right and, possibly as a defensive measure, the
Court tended to interpret restrictively those areas of appeal over which it had
control. As well, of course, this Court had just recently assumed the role of
final court of appeal for Canada and the implications of this fact had not yet
been fully apprehended.

 

14.              While
there were portents of things to come (see Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.
Hernandez, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228, at pp. 231, 232, 240 and 243), a clear
break with the earlier approach was not made until Hill v. The Queen,
[1977] 1 S.C.R. 827. In that case, the Court refused to follow its earlier
decision in Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60, and held that it had
jurisdiction under s. 41 to hear an appeal against sentence. Pigeon J., for the
majority, noted at p. 850 that s. 41 was enacted substantially in its present
form when appeals to the Privy Council (which had had unlimited jurisdiction
with special leave) were abolished and this Court was made truly supreme. It
was apparent, he added, ""that the new provision was intended to effect the
change from a limited specific jurisdiction to a broad general
jurisdiction"". Laskin C.J., in dissent but not on this point, gave further
emphasis to the expanded jurisdiction under s. 41 by saying, at pp. 831‑32,
that he ""would not exclude cases from the leave jurisdiction of this Court
unless it is quite plain that they have been excluded by statute"". Similar
sentiments were expressed by the present Chief Justice, then Dickson J., in R.
v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368. After a detailed review of the evolution
of the interpretation of s. 41, he concluded that ""Hill mandated an
expansive reading of s. 41(1), the better to enable this Court to discharge its
role at the apex of the Canadian judicial system, as the court of last resort
for all Canadians"" (p. 404).

 

15.              It
will be obvious from the foregoing that Link and Green is inconsistent
with the reasoning in more recent cases in this Court and should no longer be
followed. I conclude, therefore, that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain
the present appeal. 

 

Section
11 (b) of the Charter 

 

16.              Waite
J. treated the matter in the same way as if Mellino had been charged before him
with a criminal offence in Canada, and held that s. 11 (b) had been
violated. Mellino was, of course, never charged in Canada by any of the
governments to which the Charter  applies (s. 32 ). Rather he was charged
with an offence in Argentina by the government of that country in respect of an
act that took place wholly in Argentina. The prosecution for the offence was,
therefore, wholly within the jurisdiction of Argentina. As I indicated in Schmidt,
supra, s. 11  of the Charter  has no application to extradition
hearings. It is interesting that the courts of the United States have
interpreted the Sixth Amendment of their Constitution guaranteeing speedy
trials as not applying to extradition proceedings: see Jhirad v. Ferrandina,
536 F.2d 478 (2d Cir. 1976); Sabatier v. Dabrowski, 586 F.2d 866 (1st
Cir. 1978); Matter of Burt, 737 F.2d 1477 (7th Cir. 1984).

 

17.              Counsel
for Mellino, however, argued that s. 11 (b) of the Charter  applied
to Mellino by virtue of article V of the treaty which provides that extradition
shall not take place if ""exemption from prosecution or punishment has been
acquired by lapse of time, according to the laws of the state applying or
applied to"". This provision was obviously intended to bring into operation
statutes of limitations that exist in some countries prohibiting prosecution
for certain crimes after a stated lapse of time; for an example, see R. v.
Brixton Prison (Governor of), Ex parte Van der Auwera, [1907] 2 K.B. 157.
Such statutes are relatively easy to apply at an extradition hearing; one
simply has to compute the time in accordance with the provisions of the
statute. Section 11 (b), on the other hand, is not an exemption in that
sense. It gives a Charter  remedy for delay when a prosecution has been
initiated; no fixed time is involved. One must take into account such matters
as whether the delay is unreasonable having regard to the time particular
procedures ordinarily take. In extradition matters, this would surely require
an inquiry into how proceedings are conducted in the foreign country and
involve comparing them with ours. As well, a thorough examination of the facts
surrounding the delay would have to be made, a function, as I explained in Schmidt,
supra, wholly out of keeping with extradition proceedings. It would
require much stronger words than these to persuade me that a treaty provision
of this kind was intended to expand the application of our constitutional
standards for expeditious prosecutions to the international arena. In the
present case, it would require considerable adaptations to apply s. 11 (b)
to the relevant delay. The delay principally complained of is the time elapsed
between the time Mellino was discharged following the first extradition hearing
and the initiation of the second.

 

18.              I
conclude, therefore, that the extradition judge erred in discharging Mellino on
this ground.

 

Abuse of
Process and s. 7  of the Charter 

 

19.              At
the hearing and on this appeal, counsel for Mellino also argued that the delay
in the proceedings constituted an abuse of process. For this position, he
particularly relied on R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128. There, Dickson
C.J., writing for the Court, adopted the view expressed by Dubin J.A. in R.
v. Young (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 329, that at common
law there existed a discretionary power in a trial judge to stay proceedings in
a criminal case for abuse of process

 

where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate
those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of
fair play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings. [pp. 136‑37]

 

Dickson
C.J., however, expressly repeated the caveat made in Young that this is
""a power which can be exercised only in the `clearest of cases'"".

 

20.              It
should be observed, however, that, according to those cases, the power to grant
a stay for abuse of process is vested in the trial judge, not in a judge at a
preliminary hearing. Charter  considerations apart, a judge at
extradition hearing is in a position more closely related to that of a
magistrate at a preliminary hearing. Such matters are to be dealt with at the
trial in the foreign country like other defences. That approach has been
followed in Canada from the development of extradition procedures as one can
see from the often quoted passage of Hagarty C.J. in R. v. Morton and
Thompson (1868), 19 U.C.C.P. 9, at p. 20:

 

                   I have always felt disposed to give
the fairest and most liberal interpretation to the provisions of an arrangement
like this Extradition Treaty, entered into by two nations professing a common
civilization, with a thousand miles of conterminous boundary. They properly
agree that their respective territories shall not be the asylum for those who
commit crimes abhorrent to the laws of both communities. They agree to
surrender, on demand, such persons, to be dealt with according to the laws they
are said to have violated. I have neither the right nor the desire to doubt
that, when surrendered, they will be legally and fairly dealt with. We are not
asked here to pronounce on their guilt or to commit them for trial: all this is
left to the foreign tribunal. We in effect only send them to be examined before
the magistrate, who will decide if a case be made out for their commitment;
just as we send an offender against our own laws to appear on a warrant granted
on the testimony of witnesses he has never seen. 

 

21.              In
this Court, counsel intertwined his contention that there was an abuse of
process with an argument based on s. 7  of the Charter . As with the
simple abuse of process argument, this argument, too, assumes that an
extradition judge has jurisdiction to deal with the issue and grant the
appropriate remedies. It also assumes that the delay can be attributed to
officials of the Canadian government, which I would have thought was a
prerequisite to the application of the Charter  by virtue of s. 32 : see RWDSU
v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573. However, quite apart from
these assumptions, which I shall address later, I am unable to accept this
argument.

 

22.              On
the particular facts of this case, there would be a breach of s. 7  only if
there had been an abuse of process, and that demands that the circumstances
here were such as could be categorized as the ""clearest of cases"". I
do not think this is such a case. The five‑year delay between the laying
of charges against Mellino and his arrest is not in issue. The extradition
process began soon after his arrival in Canada. Immediately following his
arrest, a warrant of apprehension under the Extradition Act  was issued,
and an extradition hearing was scheduled. When Argentina failed to produce the
necessary documentation within two months of Mellino's arrest, he was
discharged as required by the treaty. It is the delay that followed that is
said to constitute an abuse of process. Since an extradition is not a trial,
new proceedings may be initiated on the same or new evidence. Seventeen months
after his discharge, Mellino was again arrested following a second request for
his extradition by Argentina. During these months, Mellino was free. There is
no evidence that he was being harassed or interfered with by officials. So far
as the delay might be thought to affect his defence to the charge, that,
primarily owing to his own actions, was already five years old and his ultimate
defence was, therefore, unlikely to have been prejudiced by the lapse of
another 17 months; see in this context Jhirad v. Ferrandina, supra.
In my view, there was no abuse of process or contravention of s. 7 . I should
perhaps add that while Waite J. found the delay to have been unreasonable
for the purposes of s. 11 (b) of the Charter  (a ground already
disposed of), he made no finding that such delay constituted an abuse of
process or contra‑ vened the principles of fundamental justice.

 

23.              In
assessing the issue, a court must not overlook that extradition proceedings
must be approached with a view to conform with Canada's international
obligations. The courts have on many occasions reiterated that the requirements
and technicalities of the criminal law apply only to a limited extent in
extradition proceedings. One cannot view delay resulting from the complexity
involved in dealing with activities that reach across national boundaries and
involve different systems of law and several levels of bureaucracies in the
same way as that in local prosecutions. This is especially so when one
considers that extradition proceedings are but a small part of the many and
variegated responsibilities of diplomatic officials. It is interesting that the
time schedule set forth in article XIV has been described as hectic and
criticized as too onerous: see V. E. Hartley Booth, British Extradition Law
and Procedure (1980), vol. 1, at p. 42.

 

24.              At
all events, the assumption by a Canadian court of responsibility for
supervising the conduct of the diplomatic and prosecutorial officials of a
foreign state strikes me as being in fundamental conflict with the principle of
comity on which extradition is based. Some protection is afforded the fugitive
by article XIV, which provides for his release if the evidence is not
forthcoming within a certain period. This, however, does not make time of the
essence in the manner contemplated by the trial judge. The article simply
ensures that a fugitive is not imprisoned indefinitely pending the presentation
of evidence. Since a discharge at an extradition hearing for lack of evidence,
like that at a preliminary hearing, is not final, it has long been recognized that
new proceedings may be instituted on new, or even on the same evidence before
the judge at the original hearing or another judge: see, for example, Attorney‑General
of Hong Kong v. Kwok‑A‑Sing (1873), L.R. 5 P.C. 179; Re
Harsha (No. 2) (1906), 11 C.C.C. 62 (Ont. H.C.); Armstrong v. State of
Wisconsin, [1972] F.C. 1228 (C.A.) This was recognized by the judge and the
parties, who acted on that basis.

 

25.              The
record does not show that the delay was attributable to Canadian authorities,
which as already stated appears necessary to trigger s. 7 : see s. 32 . So far as
one can gather, delays arose because of problems by the Argentinian authorities
in framing the evidence in a form acceptable under Canadian law. The delay did
not arise out of the conduct of the Canadian proceedings. There is no
suggestion that the necessary documentary evidence was available before the
date of the second request for extradition.

 

26.              Finally,
counsel for Mellino relied on cases based on s. 17 of the Fugitive Offenders
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑32, which gives the courts power to review
whether a surrender under that Act would be unjust or oppressive. But this is
done in a completely different context. Surrender under that Act is not made
under treaty obligation but as a matter of courtesy to Commonwealth countries.
Consequently, Parliament has felt free to expressly authorize the courts not
only to review on these grounds but to impose greater evidentiary demands on
those seeking surrender. These tasks, I might add, would generally be easier to
perform than they would be at an extradition hearing because Commonwealth
countries are heirs to the British criminal justice system.

 

27.              In
my view, there was no abuse of process or contravention of s. 7 . 

 

The
Jurisdiction of the Extradition Judge

 

28.              The
foregoing is sufficient to dispose of the case, but it raises a further and
important issue that merits attention. The extradition judge took the view that
he enjoyed a much broader jurisdiction than that possessed by a magistrate
presiding at a preliminary hearing under the Criminal Code . He was not,
he affirmed, sitting as a persona designata but as a court of law and,
as such, retained all his powers and jurisdiction as a judge of a superior
court except to the extent that the treaty or a statute otherwise provided.

 

29.              I
cannot accept this proposition. It seems to me to ignore the modest function of
an extradition hearing which (barring minimal statutory and treaty exceptions)
is merely to determine whether the relevant crime falls within the appropriate
treaty and whether the evidence presented is sufficient to justify the
executive surrendering the fugitive to the requesting country for trial there.
Responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, including the
performance of Canada's obligations under extradition treaties, is, of course,
vested in the executive. I repeat: the role of the extradition judge is a
modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose
of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima
facie case that the extradition crime has been committed. The procedure
bears a considerable affinity to a preliminary hearing, and the judge's powers
have some similarity to those of a magistrate presiding at such a hearing, who,
as this Court held in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, has no
power to administer Charter  remedies. Indeed, the reasoning in Mills
appears to me to be even more applicable to an extradition judge.

 

30.              The
fact that an extradition judge is often a superior court judge does not alter
the matter. This has nothing to do with the issue of persona designata,
which was discussed in Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
v. Ranville, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 518, but rather with what the judge is
authorized to do under the Act. The Act clearly spells out the duties of an
extradition judge and it would be strange if his powers differed in accordance
with whether he was a superior court judge, a county court judge or a
commissioner. This reasoning has been adopted in relation to an extradition
judge's power to grant bail: see, for example, Re Global Communications Ltd.
and Attorney‑General for Canada (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.)
It is interesting that in England extradition hearings are held before
magistrates. When the Extradition Act  (which was closely patterned on
the English Act) was enacted over 100 years ago in Canada, jurisdiction was no
doubt assigned to the superior and county court judges and commissioners
because of the conditions prevailing in the country at the time. Many of the
justices of the peace at the time may have been thought not to be equal to the
task. There is nothing to suggest that judges acting in extradition matters
were to be given any greater powers than those traditionally possessed by the
English magistrates.

 

31.              In
particular, it is not the business of an extradition judge to assume
responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the
evidence for an extradition hearing. This would seem to me to be in breach of
the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. A foreign
state obviously has jurisdiction over the actions of its officials, although,
no doubt, the executive of this country must, on occasion, consider such
matters in exercising its discretion to surrender a fugitive.

 

32.              Nor
is an extradition judge empowered to weigh the ultimate issue of whether delay
will affect the trial of the action in the foreign country. The treaty places
Canada under an obligation to surrender the fugitive for trial in the
requesting country where such issues are to be considered. The assumption that
the requesting state will give the fugitive a fair trial according to its laws
underlies the whole theory and practice of extradition and our courts have over
many years made it abundantly clear that an extradition judge should not give
effect to any suggestion that the proceedings are oppressive or that the
fugitive will not be given a fair trial or give proper weight to the evidence.
In truth, the assumption by an extradition judge that delay or other defences
would not be given appropriate consideration by the foreign court is even more
offensive than the assumption of control over the actions of foreign diplomatic
and prosecutorial officials. It amounts to a serious adverse reflection not
only on a foreign government to whom Canada has a treaty obligation but on its
judicial authorities concerning matters that are exclusively within their
competence.

 

33.              It
would cripple the operation of our extradition arrangements if extradition
judges were to arrogate the power to consider defences that should properly be
raised at trial. How would we react to foreign courts exercising this kind of
pre‑emptive jurisdiction in relation to trials in this country? There
are, as well, practical considerations such as the limited information
available to an extradition judge and his jurisdictional inability to obtain
it: see, for example, Re Insull, [1933] 3 D.L.R. 709 (Ont. S.C.); Re
United States of America and Smith (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 540 (Ont. C.A.),
at p. 551; United States of America v. Beaurone (1983), 27 Sask. R. 136
(Q.B.), at p. 138. In Schmidt, supra, allusion was made that the
general extradition procedure constituted a reasonable limit under s. 1 on the
right a fugitive may have not to be surrendered for trial: see in this context Re
Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.)
I also noted there that I see nothing offensive to fundamental justice in
surrendering in accordance with our extradition procedures an accused to a
foreign country for trial in accordance with its traditional judicial processes
for a crime alleged to have been committed there. There may, it is true,
conceivably be situations where it would be unjust to surrender a fugitive
either because of the general condition of the governmental and judicial
apparatus or, more likely, because some particular individual may be subjected
to oppressive treatment. These are judgments, however, that are pre‑eminently
within the authority and competence of the executive to make. The courts may,
as guardians of the Constitution, on occasion have a useful role to play in
reviewing such decisions, but it is obviously an area in which courts must
tread with caution. 

 

34.              Situations
may, as is alleged in the present case, also conceivably arise where the
Canadian officials who carry out the prosecution on behalf of the foreign
state, do so in a manner that violates fundamental justice. In such cases,
fundamental justice considerations may come into play that call for Charter 
review. However, not every delay raises such considerations; all the
circumstances must be weighed; see in this context the American case of Matter
of Burt, supra. It should also be noted that releasing a fugitive in
such circumstances raises a serious problem. Is Canada to be absolved of its
treaty obligation to a foreign state to surrender a fugitive because Canadian
officials have been derelict in performing their duties regarding the request
for surrender duly made by that state? This consideration, however, principally
underlines the importance officials must attach to these matters. Theirs,
acting on behalf of the executive, is the duty to carry out Canada's
obligations. The courts, on the other hand, have the duty to ensure that
actions of Canadian officials meet the standards of the Charter . Because
of the seriousness of the matter, however, a court should not lightly attribute
responsibility for delay to Canadian officials. In the present case what little
there is on the record that could be looked upon as involving any lapses on the
part of Canadian officials is highly tenuous. What the record reveals, instead,
is that the delays came about from the difficulty experienced by the
Argentinian authorities in organizing the evidence in a form acceptable under
Canadian procedures. The circumstances are not, in my view, sufficiently
lengthy or inconvenient as to make surrender under these circumstances
sufficiently oppressive as to violate the principles of fundamental justice.

 

35.              In
the rare cases where the actions of Canadian executives or officials may give
rise to the need for Charter  review, I do not think the extradition
judge has Charter  jurisdiction. For reasons of efficiency, the Act and
the treaty have strictly confined his role. Parliament has indicated how
extradition proceedings are to be reviewed‑‑by superior courts by
means of the writ of habeas corpus. A court in habeas corpus
proceedings is ordinarily confined to questions of jurisdiction, but as such
proceedings are contemplated by Parliament as the sole means of review in
extradition proceedings, and from which, moreover, it has provided appeals to
the Court of Appeal and to this Court, a court in habeas corpus
proceedings is obviously the court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes
of s. 24  of the Charter . It is interesting that a somewhat similar
approach has been taken in the United States. In Matter of Burt, supra,
the United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, held that the merits of a
petitioner's due process claim could be considered as part of a habeas
corpus review. The court thus put it, at p. 1484:

 

                   We hold that federal courts
undertaking habeas corpus review of extraditions have the authority to consider
not only procedural defects in the extradition procedures that are of
constitutional dimension, but also the substantive conduct of the United States
in undertaking its decision to extradite if such conduct violates
constitutional rights.

 

36.              Not
only are the actions of Canadian officials in relation to extradition
proceedings subject to review under the Charter , so too as I noted in Schmidt,
supra, is the executive's exercise of discretion in surrendering a
fugitive. However, this jurisdiction, as I there observed, must be exercised
with the utmost circumspection consistent with the executive's pre‑eminent
position in matters of external relations. The courts may intervene if the
decision to surrender a fugitive for trial in a foreign country would in the
particular circumstances violate the principles of fundamental justice. But, as
already noted, it does not violate such principles to surrender a person to be
tried for a crime he is alleged to have committed in a foreign country in the
absence of exceptional circumstances. Our courts must assume that he will be
given a fair trial in the foreign country. Matters of due process generally are
to be left for the courts to determine at the trial there as they would be if
he were to be tried here. Attempts to pre‑empt decisions on such matters,
whether arising through delay or otherwise, would directly conflict with the
principles of comity on which extradition is based; for a similar view in the
United States, see Jhirad v. Ferrandina, supra. Should there be
circumstances so substantial as to give rise to questions whether surrendering
a fugitive would constitute a breach of fundamental justice, the extradition
judge should bring them to the attention of the executive; see Royal
Government of Greece v. Brixton Prison Governor, [1969] 3 All E.R. 1337
(H.L.)

 

37.              Finally,
in exercising jurisdiction over executive action, a court must firmly keep in
mind that it is in the executive that the discretion to surrender a fugitive is
vested. Consequently, barring obvious or urgent circumstances, the executive
should not be pre‑empted. In cases where the feared wrong may be avoided
by interstate arrangements, it may be doubted that the courts should ordinarily
intervene before the executive has made an order of surrender. As already
mentioned, the primary responsibility for the conduct of external relations
must lie with the executive. The executive may well be able to obtain
sufficient assurances from the foreign country to ensure compliance with the
requirements of fundamental justice. It would, of course, be open to the courts
to review any such arrangements to ensure compliance with Charter 
requirements. However, a court would have to be extremely circumspect in taking
such a course. It should not lightly assume that the executive has ignored its
undoubted duty to ensure that its actions conform to constitutional
requirements or that a foreign country would not act in good faith in complying
with such assurances.

 

38.              It
is clear in any event that these issues are not to be dealt with by the
extradition judge.

 

Conclusion

 

39.              For
these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of Waite J. and
remit the matter to an extradition judge to continue the proceedings in
accordance with the law. 

 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

40.              Lamer J. (dissenting)‑‑I
have read the reasons of my colleague Justice La Forest and agree with him that
this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal. I also agree with him that
this matter should be remitted below albeit for a different purpose.

 

41.              As
I discussed in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, s. 11  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  generally applies to the extradition hearing
in so far as it would apply to a preliminary inquiry. In my view, s. 11 (b)
is one of the rights guaranteed by s. 11  which is applicable to a preliminary
inquiry and an extradition hearing. The liberty and security of the person
subjected to the extradition hearing are affected by the holding of a hearing,
and the principles of fundamental justice require that that hearing be resolved
in a speedy manner.

 

42.              The
delay at issue here is the 17‑month delay between the discharge of
Mellino because of evidentiary problems in the first extradition proceedings
and the institution of the second proceedings. As this Court held in Carter
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 981, at p. 985 with respect to the
computation of time under s. 11 (b):

 

                   As I have indicated in Mills v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, which has been handed down this same day,
the time frame to be considered in computing trial within a reasonable time
generally runs only from the moment a person is charged. In passing, I might
add that I say ""generally"" because there might be exceptional
circumstances under which the time might run prior to the actual charge on
which the accused will be tried. As an example, if the Crown withdraws the
charge to substitute a different one but for the same transaction, the
computation of time might well commence as of the first charge.

 

The
computation of time for the purposes of s. 11 (b) thus started to run
when the first extradition proceedings were instituted. I am of the view that
the 17‑month delay between the discharge of the respondent in the first
hearing and the institution of the second proceedings, if unexplained,
constitutes an infringement of the right to be tried within a reasonable time
under s. 11 (b). It is in my view irrelevant whether that delay was due
to the acts of the Argentinian or the Canadian authorities, as the respondent's
right is no less infringed whatever may be the source of the delay. Further,
both governments are in a sense partners in the undertaking and it could be
said that there is a domestication of the conduct of the Argentinian
authorities.

 

43.              As
I discussed in United States v. Allard, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 564, an
extradition judge is not a court of competent jurisdiction under s. 24(1)  and
applicants should seek remedy in the superior court. The extradition judge in
this case, however, was a judge of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, which is
a superior court. As in Allard, I think that, as a matter of practice,
an application under s. 24(1)  can be made to the extradition judge if he is
also a superior court judge. At the time of the application in this case,
however, the law as to who had jurisdiction under s. 24(1)  was not clear, and
it might well be that, as a result, the authorities did not attempt to explain
and justify the otherwise unacceptable delay. This being so, I would allow the
appeal and send matters back to Waite J. so that he can complete the s. 24(1) 
hearing and, subject to his decision on that issue, terminate the extradition
proceedings either way. 

 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

44.              Wilson J.‑‑I
agree with Justice La Forest for the reasons given by him that this Court has
jurisdiction to hear this appeal. I disagree with him, however, for the reasons
I gave in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, that s. 11  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  has no application to extradition
proceedings. I think that Charter  rights may be pleaded in such
proceedings and that (subject to the application of s. 1  which I leave open)
there could undoubtedly come a point at which the delay in pursuing extradition
in Canada would be unreasonable and s. 11 (b) could properly be invoked.
I do not believe, however, that this is such a case.

 

45.              A
lapse of time which might be unreasonable and constitute a violation of s. 11 (b)
in a purely domestic proceeding may, in my view, be fairly justified in a
proceeding with foreign elements. But I do not think it appropriate for a
Canadian court to call a foreign state to account for delay caused by it.
To this extent I agree with La Forest J. as to the role of international
comity. The Canadian court seized of the extradition proceedings can call the
Canadian authorities to account and demand of them an explanation for any
seemingly unreasonable delay but it cannot, in my view, do the same with the
authorities in a foreign country. Accordingly, unlike my colleague Justice
Lamer, I believe that any delay relied on under s. 11 (b) must be delay
caused by the Canadian authorities. The reason for this conclusion is, in
essence, that an assessment of the reasonableness or otherwise of a delay
presupposes the right to demand an explanation for it. If this right is not
there, no assessment can be made. It cannot be determined whether the foreign
delay was reasonable or not. That delay cannot therefore be considered under s.
11 (b).

 

46.              This
case and United States v. Allard, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 564 (released
contemporaneously herewith), are distinguishable from Schmidt (also
released contemporaneously) in this respect. No breach of international comity
is involved in Schmidt. No autonomous foreign authority is being called
to account in Schmidt. No foreign law is being criticized in Schmidt.
The only issue in Schmidt is the scope of our own constitutional
protections. Are they available to a person involved in Canadian extradition
proceedings?

 

47.              For
the respondent to succeed in this case he would, in my view, have to establish
that the delay caused by the Canadian authorities was unreasonable. Since I do
not see how he could possibly discharge that burden on the facts of this case,
I agree with La Forest J. that the extradition judge was in error in
discharging Mellino on the basis that his s. 11 (b) right had been
violated.

 

48.              With
respect to Mellino's argument that the delay in the extradition proceedings
constituted an abuse of process or a violation of s. 7  of the Charter ,
again for the reasons I gave in Schmidt, I think it was perfectly open
to the accused to raise these issues in the extradition proceedings. However,
since the essence of the complaint is again the delay which was in large part
due to the conduct of the Argentinian authorities, the argument based on abuse
of process or s. 7  of the Charter  must also fail.

 

49.              On
the issue of the jurisdiction of the extradition court judge, I agree with
Lamer J. that an application may be made to such a judge under s. 24(1)  of the Charter 
if, as in this case, he is also a superior court judge.

 

50.              I
would allow the appeal and remit the matter back to Waite J. to continue the
extradition proceedings in accordance with law.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Sexual assault ‑‑ Charge to jury ‑‑
Defence of mistake of fact ‑‑ Should the trial judge, in every
sexual assault case, instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an
honest, though mistaken, belief in consent ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, ss. 244(4), 246.1(1)(a).

 

                   Evidence
‑‑ Admissibility ‑‑ Similar fact evidence ‑‑
Accused convicted of sexual assault ‑‑ Whether or not evidence of
accused's making a sexual proposition to complainant's roommate admissible ‑‑
If inadmis‑ sible, whether or not s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code
applicable to save conviction.

 

                   The
accused was charged with sexual assault under s. 246.1(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . At trial, the complainant testified that the accused, a complete
stranger to her, gained entry to her apartment early one morning by pretending
to be a friend of her roommate. When the complainant asked him to leave under
threat of screaming, the accused put one hand over her mouth and with the other
hand took hold of her hair, pulled her away from the door and forced her to the
floor. He threatened her, struck her once in order to ensure her submission and
then sexually assaulted her. The complainant was terrified and lay still,
afraid that if she struggled the accused would hurt her. After a while, the
accused got dressed and left.

 

                   In
her testimony, the roommate indicated that she arrived shortly after the
incident, found the complainant terribly upset and noticed a bruise over her
eye. She also testified that she had met the accused the month before when she
served him as a customer at the convenience store where she worked. She saw him
twice in the subsequent days and, on the second occasion, they went to the
apartment. The accused saw pictures of the complainant and indicated that he
would be interested in meeting her. When he then told the roommate that he
wished to sleep with her, she refused and asked him to leave. When he refused
to do so, she left the apartment and he followed a few minutes later. As they
walked towards the bus stop, the accused pinned her to the wall and told her
that he could never love her, he could only hurt her.

 

                   In
defence, the accused conceded identity and argued that the complainant had
consented or, in the alternative, that he believed she had consented. He did
not testify or call any witnesses. The basis of the accused's alternative
argument was alleged inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony.

 

                   After
hearing all the evidence the trial judge instructed the jury that before the
accused could be found guilty of the offence of sexual assault they had to
conclude that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
engaged in intentional touching of a sexual nature without the complainant's
consent. The jury found the defendant guilty as charged but the Court of Appeal
allowed the accused's appeal and ordered a new trial. The Court found that the
trial judge had failed to instruct the jury on an essential element of the
offence‑‑that the accused knew that the com­plain­ant was not
consenting or was reckless as to whether she consented or not‑‑and
felt that it could not apply the curative provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  in such a case. This appeal is to determine (1)
whether the trial judge in a sexual assault case must always instruct the
jurors that the Crown has to satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused knew the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether
she consented or not; and (2) whether the admission of the roommate's evidence
that the accused had made a sexual proposition to her violated the
""similar fact"" evidence exclusionary rule.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

 

                                           (1) The
Trial Judge's Instruction

 

                   There
must be evidence that gives an air of reality to the accused's submission that
he believed the complainant was consenting before the issue goes to the
jury. In cases where there is nothing in the Crown's case to indicate that the
accused honestly believed in the complainant's consent, the accused bears an
evidentiary burden to introduce sufficient evidence if he wishes the issue to
reach the jury. Where there is sufficient evidence, adduced by either the Crown
or the defence, to put the issue before the jury, the Crown then bears the
burden of persuading the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the
complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she was consenting
or not.

 

                   Section
244(4) of the Code is a legislative affirmation of the law previously
enunciated as to the sufficiency of evidence required to raise the defence of
mistaken belief in consent. It makes it clear that the trial judge should not
in every case instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest,
though mistaken, belief in consent. The trial judge should only give such an
instruction when certain threshold requirements have been met: first, s. 244(4)
requires the accused to allege an honest belief in consent; and second, the
trial judge should only put the issue of honest belief to the jury if he is
satisfied ""that there is sufficient evidence and that if believed by the
jury the evidence would constitute a defence"". The section is not intended
to impose the burden of proof of such defence on the accused but merely to
affirm the preconditions that must be met before the trial judge is required to
put the issue to the jury. Also, s. 244(4) still contemplates that an honest
but unreasonable belief in consent will constitute a defence. Nevertheless, it
directs the jury to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds as
an important evidentiary factor in determining whether the accused had an
honest belief in consent.

 

                   Applying
the statutory test to the evidence in this case, the trial judge was right to
charge the jury without reference to the defence of mistake of fact. There was
not a sufficient factual basis in this case for the accused's allegation that
he believed the complainant consented.

 

                                             (2) The
Similar Fact Evidence

 

                   Evidence
of the accused's discreditable conduct on past occasions that tended to show
his bad disposition is inadmissible unless it is so probative of an issue in
the case as to outweigh the prejudice caused. The similar fact evidence
exclusionary rule can extend to acts other than criminal acts. In the present
case, the admission of the roommate's evidence that the accused had made a
sexual proposition to her did not violate the ""similar fact"" evidence
exclusionary rule. The probative value of the evidence outweighed its
prejudicial value. The bulk of the roommate's testimony was highly relevant to
the case. It provided, among other things, the background for the circumstances
in which the assault occurred. It was also arguable that it had some relevance
to the question of motive and intent. The evidence was thus of some probative
value. While there was some element in the accused's conduct with the roommate
which could be characterized as discreditable, the prejudice caused to the
accused by the roommate's evidence was minimal because, when the roommate
indicated that she was not interested in sleeping with him, the accused did not
force himself upon her but desisted. In any event, even if the evidence should
not have been admitted, the conviction should stand by virtue of the proviso of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. Given the persuasive nature of the
evidence, the jury's verdict would necessarily have been the same even if the
alleged error of law had not occurred.

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal rendered March 3, 1986, allowing
the accused's appeal from his conviction on a charge of sexual assault and
ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.

K. Stewart and Sarah Welch, for the appellant.

 

                   Morris
Manning, Q.C., and Paul B. Schabas, for the respondent.

 

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                Wilson J.‑‑The
accused was charged with the offence of sexual assault under s. 246.1(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code . The main issue is whether a trial judge in a
sexual assault case must always instruct the jury that the Crown has to satisfy
them beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the complainant was not
consenting or was reckless as to whether she consented or not.

 

1. The
Facts

 

2.                The
complainant was nineteen years old and had completed her high school education
in a small Ontario town. Some three months before the incident she had moved to
Toronto. She was living with a girlfriend, Eileen, also nineteen years old, in
a flat in a house. The complainant usually worked a day shift from 10:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m as a waitress in a restaurant. The roommate worked the night shift
from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. at a nearby convenience store.

 

3.                In
late November, 1983, the roommate met the accused, whose first name is Jim,
when she served him as a customer at the convenience store. On a subsequent
night the accused spent six hours at the convenience store conversing with the
roommate. During their conversation the roommate spoke about the complainant
and mentioned that they rarely saw each other because of their different work
shifts.

 

4.                On
December 3, 1983, a man who gave his name as Jim telephoned the apartment where
the two young women lived. (At the time of his arrest on December 8, 1983, the
accused had a book with the phone number written in it.) The complainant
answered the phone. The man asked for the roommate but was told that she was at
work. The caller asked if he could come over anyway. The complainant did
not know the telephone caller and said no. She told the caller that her
boyfriend Doug was coming over shortly. The man said, ""If I can't have
you, I'll go and get Eileen.""

 

5.                On
a subsequent occasion the accused, uninvited, met the roommate as she was
warming up her car after getting off work in the morning. He indicated that he
wanted to talk. After some discussion they decided to go back to the roommate's
apartment. The complainant was not at home. In the living‑room the
accused saw pictures of the complainant and indicated that he would be
interested in meeting her. The accused and the roommate had a lengthy
conversation. The accused asked the roommate if he could sleep with her. She
refused. He briefly put his arms around her. She asked him repeatedly to leave.
He refused. She left the apartment and went out onto the front porch. After a
few minutes he came out. The accused decided to take the bus home. The roommate
was walking with the accused towards the bus stop when be pinned her up against
a wall and stated that he could never love her, he could only hurt her. He told
her to take him home by car which she did.

 

6.                On
December 6, 1983, the accused telephoned the roommate Eileen at the apartment.
She told the accused that both she and the complainant were going to work that
night. The roommate left for work at 10:30 p.m. The complainant worked from
5:00 p.m. until 12:00 p.m. This was not her usual shift. The complainant returned
home from work at 12:30 a.m. and went to sleep in her bedroom.

 

7.                The
complainant testified that at about 4:30 a.m. she was awakened by knocking at
the apartment door. She was not expecting anybody. She got up. She was wearing
a blue night‑gown and underpants. She went to the front door. This door,
which opened into the living‑room, was locked.

 

8.                The
complainant asked who was there and the accused replied that it was Bruce. He
said that he was a friend of Eileen's and that he had something for her from
Eileen. (Eileen had not seen the accused that night, nor had she sent him
over.) The complainant asked repeatedly what he had but he would not say. He
said the complainant should let him in and he would give it to her. The
complainant tried three or four times to telephone Eileen at work to find out
if she had sent somebody over. The line was always busy. (Eileen was involved
in a lengthy conversation with her boyfriend.) The complainant thought her
roommate could be playing a joke on her although she had never done anything
like that before. She unlocked and opened the door. The accused entered the
living‑room. The complainant had never seen him before. He appeared to
have been drinking. She asked the accused who he was and what he had for her
but got no response. She asked ""Who are you, Bruce?"" The accused
replied ""Bruce, the bad guy."" The accused did not interfere when the
complainant attempted, again unsuccessfully, to telephone her roommate. The accused
used the telephone himself. While the complainant could not recall the
substance of the accused's telephone conversation she had the impression he was
talking to his brother. He said something about meeting his lawyer the next
morning. At the end he said ""Tell your wife I love her.""

 

9.                The
complainant went to the door and told the accused to leave. Instead of making
any move to leave he asked if he could sleep with her. At this point the
complainant became afraid. She told the accused that if he did not leave she
was going to scream whereupon the accused put one hand over her mouth and with
the other hand took hold of her hair and pulled her away from the door. He put
her on her back on the floor and lay down on top of her. The complainant tried
to push the accused off. He told her the more she fought the harder it was
going to be for Eileen to find her, that she would never look the same again.
The complainant was terrified and lay still.

 

10.              The
accused sat on the victim's chest with his knees spread across her arms so that
she could not move. She begged him not to go on with what he was doing and to
leave her alone. The accused reached behind himself and pushed the com­plain­ant's
underpants down, ripping them in the process. He put his finger into her
vagina. The complainant was crying. She felt helpless. In cross‑examination
she testified that perhaps she should have struggled harder but she was
frightened, shaking and confused. She was afraid that if she struggled the
accused would hurt her.

 

11.              The
accused lay down on the victim and tried to kiss her. She attempted to turn
away but he held the back of her head by the hair so that she could not move.
She tried to bite his lips. The accused tore her night‑dress and pushed
it off her. He then began to take his clothes off. The complainant pleaded with
him not to do it. The complainant was going to scream. The accused stuffed a
piece of clothing in her mouth to stifle the scream. The accused struck her
with his hand across the eyebrow. He told her that if she tried to scream, he
was going to see to it that she never talked again. She lay motionless while
the accused finished undressing himself.

 

12.              The
accused straddled the victim's chest and put his penis in her mouth. His penis
was not in her mouth very long and he did not ejaculate. He lay down on top of
her again. The complainant had crossed her legs. The accused shoved his knee
between her legs forcing them apart. He put his penis into her vagina. The
complainant could not be sure whether the accused ejaculated during intercourse
or not (subsequent forensic testing uncovered no semen or sperm in swabs taken
from the victim). The accused stopped after a while and got dressed. As he was
getting dressed, he turned to the complainant and said ""You're just like
her. You're just like all the rest."" The complainant asked him what he
meant by that. He said ""You're my sixth."" He brought the complainant
with him to the kitchen. He had a glass of water and drank from a coke bottle.

 

13.              The
complainant told the accused that her roommate would be home soon. The accused
told the complainant to phone the roommate at work and ask what time she was
coming home from work. The accused was standing behind the complainant with his
hand on her neck during the phone call. The complainant asked her roommate when
she would be home. The roommate said she would be home at the usual time. The
roommate testified that the complainant sounded anxious.

 

14.              The
accused persisted in asking the complainant if he could return the next night
and she finally agreed in order to get him out of the apartment. The accused
asked where Eileen or Doug would be if he came. The reference to Doug, whom the
complainant had not referred to at any time during the incident, made the
complainant remember the call of December 3, 1983 from the man who had
identified himself as Jim. She asked the accused if he was Jim but he said
nothing. The accused left at 5:15 or 5:30 a.m. After dressing the com­plain­ant
telephoned her roommate once again. The roommate testified that the complainant
sounded frightened.

 

15.              The
complainant went to her room and curled up on her bed. When the roommate got
home at 6:45 a.m. she found the complainant terribly upset. She noticed a
bruise on the complainant's eye. When the police constable arrived at 8:16 a.m.
he also noted that the complainant seemed upset and a little incoherent. The
complainant gave the policeman her torn nightgown and underwear. She showed him
the coke bottle, glass and telephone (for the purpose of fingerprinting).

 

16.              Doctor
Lloyd Gordon examined the complainant at the emergency department of the
Wellesley Hospital on December 7, 1983 at 11:15 a.m. He found a red mark over
her left eyebrow. It was a mild abrasion such as might be caused by a moderate
slap. The complainant also spoke of tenderness in the tailbone. Doctor Gordon
noted, upon a vaginal examination of the complainant, that her cervix was
slightly red. This was consistent with forced sexual intercourse. In cross‑examination
he testified that it was also consistent with energetic sexual intercourse.

 

2. The
Trial

 

17.              At
trial the accused conceded identity. However, he argued that the complainant
had consented or, in the alternative, that he believed she had consented. The
accused did not testify nor did he call any witnesses.

 

18.              The
basis of the accused's argument that the complainant had consented or that he
thought she had consented was alleged inconsistencies in the complainant's
testimony. He identified as an inconsistency the complainant's testimony at the
preliminary hearing that the accused had held her hair during the entire
incident. At trial, on the other hand, she admitted that he had reduced his
hold on her hair at various points. Defence counsel contended that there were
three variations as to how the apartment door was closed, i.e., whether the accused
sort of kicked it shut, whether he tapped it closed or whether it closed by
itself. The complainant did not mention the accused's comments that she was
like all the rest and that she was his sixth to the police or at the
preliminary hearing. She recalled the comment some six months later. Defence
counsel also pointed to the fact that the complainant did not scream, that
there was a lack of injury to the genital area except for the redness of the
cervix (which could be explained by a number of things) and the lack of
apparent injuries to the complainant other than an abrasion above the left
eyebrow and a sore tailbone. 

 

19.              After
hearing all the evidence the trial judge instructed the jury that before the
accused could be found guilty of the offence of sexual assault they must
conclude that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
engaged in intentional touching of a sexual nature without the consent of the
complainant. The jury found the defendant guilty as charged.

 

3. The
Court of Appeal

 

20.              An
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was successful and a new trial was
ordered. The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had failed to instruct
the jury on an essential element of the offence, namely that the accused knew
that the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she
consented or not. This failure was compounded by the judge's direction to the
jury on intent‑‑""the only intent, the only mental element you
need consider is the accused's intention to touch the complainant.""
Although the members of the Court of Appeal indicated that they had little
doubt as to what the answer would have been had the proper instruction been
given to the jury, they felt that they could not apply the curative provisions
of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code where there was a failure to
instruct the jury on an essential element of the offence.

 

4. The
Legislation

 

21.              This
accused was charged under the new sexual assault provisions of the Criminal
Code . Several sections are relevant. The offence is set out in
s. 246.1(1) (a) which provides:

 

                   246.1 (1) Every
one who commits a sexual assault is guilty of

 

(a) an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years;

 

The
definition of assault is found in s. 244(1) of the Code:

 

                   244. (1) A
person commits an assault when

 

(a) without the consent of another person,
he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

 

This
definition applies in respect of s. 246.1(1) (a) by virtue of s. 244(2):

 

                   244. ...

 

                   (2) This section applies to all
forms of assault, including sexual assault...

 

22.              An
element of assault is the absence of the complainant's consent. Section 244(3)
provides:

 

                   (3) For the purposes of this
section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not
resist by reason of

 

(a) the application of force to the
complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

(b) threats or fear of the application of
force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

Section
244(4), which applies to both assault and sexual assault, provides:

 

                   (4) Where an accused alleges
that he believed the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject‑matter
of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and
that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall
instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the
determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to consider the presence
or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

 

5. The
Issues

 

(a) Should
the trial judge, in every sexual assault case, instruct the jury to consider
whether the accused had an honest, though mistaken, belief in consent?

 

(b) Did
the admission of the roommate's evidence that the accused had made a sexual
proposition to her violate the ""similar fact"" evidence exclusionary
rule? 

 

6.                When
should the trial judge instruct the jury to                    consider
whether the accused had an honest though                    mistaken
belief in consent?

 

23.              Counsel
for the accused argues that the accused's knowledge that the complainant is not
consenting is an essential element of the offence. Therefore, the trial judge
must in every case tell the jury that the Crown must satisfy them beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting
or was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not before they can
convict. The accused need not introduce any evidence on this issue. Counsel for
the defence submits in addition that s. 244(4) codifies the defence of mistake
of fact. Under this defence sufficient evidence must be introduced before the
trial judge can instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest
but mistaken belief that the complainant was consenting when determining his
guilt or innocence. In other words, according to defence counsel, the issue of
the accused's alleged honest but mistaken belief may come before the jury in
two ways‑‑as an element of the offence or as a defence. It is self‑evident
that if the accused's counsel is correct, s. 244(4) is rendered redundant. If
the issue of honest but mistaken belief is always going to reach the jury as an
element of the offence, what does it matter if sometimes it will also reach the
jury as a defence? The accused's counsel argues that his position is mandated
by previous decisions of this Court.

 

24.              The
previous decisions of this Court, in particular Pappajohn v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, and Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570,
establish several propositions. First, the mens rea for rape includes
knowledge that the woman is not consenting or recklessness as to whether she is
consenting or not. Dickson J. (as he then was) stated in Pappajohn, supra,
at pp. 139‑40:

 

                   The mens rea which is
required, and its nature and extent, will vary with the particular crime; it
can only be determined by detailed examination of the actus reus of the
offence. Speaking generally, at least where the circumstance is not
""morally indifferent"", the mental element must be proved with respect
to all circumstances and consequences that form part of the actus reus.
It follows that, in a case of alleged rape, where a fact or circumstance is not
known to, or is misapprehended by, the accused, leading to a mistaken but
honest belief in the consent of the woman, his act is not culpable in relation
to that element of the offence:

 

...for if the actus reus includes surrounding
circumstances, it cannot be said to be intentional unless all its elements,
including those circumstances, are known. (Glanville Williams, Criminal Law,
The General Part, at p. 141). (Emphasis added.)

 

                   Taking these principles, then, what
is the mental element required under s. l43 of the Criminal Code  on a
charge of rape? This crime was historically regarded as an offence of physical
violence. Blackstone defined rape as ""the carnal knowledge of a woman
forcibly and against her will"" (Commentaries, supra, at p.
210). A more comprehensive definition of rape at common law is found in
Archbold, Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (38th ed.) (1937), at
para. 2871:

 

Rape consists in having unlawful sexual intercourse with
a woman without her consent by force, fear or fraud (citing 1 East's Pleas
of the Crown 434 and 1 Hale's Pleas of the Crown 627).

 

Section 143 of our Code, in brief, defines rape
as an act of sexual intercourse with a female person without her consent, or
with consent if that consent is extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm. It
will be seen that the statutory definition does not depart in any significant
way from the common law definition. For all practical purposes, the Criminal
Code  merely codifies the common law. The essence of the crime consists in
the commission of an act of sexual intercourse where a woman's consent, or
genuine consent, has been withheld.

 

                   The actus reus of rape is
complete upon (a) an act of sexual intercourse; (b) without consent. An
affirmative finding as to each of these elements does not finish the inquiry,
however, for, as I have indicated, the requirement that there be a guilty
intention must also be satisfied. The important question then arises as to
whether at common law, and under s. 143 of the Code, the guilty intention
for rape extends to the element of consent. In principle, it would seem that it
should, as intention as to consent is central to responsibility; a man should
only be punished where he proceeds with an act of violation in the knowledge
that consent is withheld, or in a state of recklessness as to whether
willingness is present. The intention to commit the act of intercourse, and to
commit that act in the absence of consent, are two separate and distinct
elements of the offence.

 

McIntyre
J. confirmed this view in Sansregret, supra, at p. 581:

 

I would conclude then that the mens rea for rape
under s. 143(a) of the Code must involve knowledge that the woman
is not consenting, or recklessness as to whether she is consenting or not, and
for s. 143(b)(i), knowledge that the consent was given because of
threats or fear of bodily harm, or recklessness as to its nature. It would
follow, as has been held by the majority of this Court in Pappajohn,
that an honest belief on the part of the accused, even though unreasonably
held, that the woman was consenting to intercourse freely and voluntarily and
not because of threats, would negate the mens rea under s. 143(b)(i)
of the Code and entitle the accused to an acquittal. 

 

25.              Traditionally
the Court has described this mens rea requirement as a defence of
mistake of fact available to the accused. This is how McIntyre J., speaking for
the majority, described it in Pappajohn, supra. Dickson J.
felt that it was clearer and more accurate to describe knowledge of lack of
consent as part of the mens rea. He stated in Pappajohn at p.
148:

 

Mistake is a defence, then, where it prevents an accused
from having the mens rea which the law requires for the very crime with
which he is charged. Mistake of fact is more accurately seen as a negation of
guilty intention than as the affirmation of a positive defence. It avails an
accused who acts innocently, pursuant to a flawed perception of the facts, and
nonetheless commits the actus reus of an offence.

 

McIntyre
J. confirmed this reasoning in Sansregret, supra, at p. 580:

 

                   The defence of mistake of fact has
been said to rest on the proposition that the mistaken belief, honestly held,
deprives the accused of the requisite mens rea for the offence.

 

26.              Although
there has been some difference of view on the Court as to whether the accused's
knowledge of lack of consent is to be described as an element of the offence or
as a defence of mistake of fact, the Court has been unanimous in its agreement
on one proposition‑‑there must be evidence that gives an air of
reality to the accused's argument that he believed the complainant was
consenting before the issue goes to the jury. In addition, I believe that
previous case law establishes the proposition that, where there is sufficient
evidence for the issue to go to the jury, the Crown bears the burden of persuading
the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the complainant was
not consenting or was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not. Using
the language of Glanville Williams in Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd
ed. 1961), at pp. 871‑910, there are two separate burdens in relation to
the issue of honest but mistaken belief‑‑the evidentiary burden and
the burden of persuasion. Evidence must be introduced that satisfies the judge
that the issue should be put to the jury. This evidence may be introduced by
the Crown or by the defence. The accused bears the evidentiary burden only in
the limited sense that, if there is nothing in the Crown's case to indicate
that the accused honestly believed in the complainant's consent, then the accused
will have to introduce evidence if he wishes the issue to reach the jury. Once
the issue is put to the jury the Crown bears the risk of not being able to
persuade the jury of the accused's guilt.

 

27.              McIntyre
J., discussing the defence of mistake of fact in Pappajohn, supra,
mentioned the evidentiary burden at pp. 126‑28:

 

This, however, does not mean that the trial judge
becomes bound to put every defence suggested to him by counsel. Before any
obligation arises to put defences, there must be in the evidence some basis
upon which the defence can rest and it is only where such an evidentiary basis
is present that a trial judge must put a defence. Indeed, where it is not
present he should not put a defence for to do so would only be to confuse.

 

                   What is the standard which the judge
must apply in considering this question? Ordinarily, when there is any evidence
of a matter of fact, the proof of which may be relevant to the guilt or
innocence of an accused, the trial judge must leave that evidence to the jury
so that they may reach their own conclusion upon it. Where, however, the trial
judge is asked to put a specific defence to the jury, he is not concerned only
with the existence or non‑existence of evidence of fact. He must
consider, assuming that the evidence relied upon by the accused to support a
defence is true, whether that evidence is sufficient to justify the putting of
the defence. This question has been considered frequently in the courts: See Wu
v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 609, and Kelsey v. The Queen, [1953] 1
S.C.R. 220. The test to be applied has, in my opinion, been set down by Fauteux
J., as he then was, in Kelsey v. The Queen.

 

The allotment of any substance to an argument or of any
value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial judge from mentioning
such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some
evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the
grievance.

 

In addition, I would refer to the words of Judson J.,
speaking for the majority, in R. v. Workman and Huculak, [1963] S.C.R.
266 where he said:

 

I can see no possible ground for any instruction that,
on any view of the evidence Huculak could be an accessory after the fact and
not a principal. Before this could be done, there must be found in the record
some evidence which would convey a sense of reality in the submission (Kelsey
v. The Queen, 105 C.C.C. 97 at p. 102, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220 at p. 226, 16
C.R. 119 at p. 125). Failure of counsel to raise the matter does not relieve
the trial judge of his duty to place a possible defence before the jury but
there must be something beyond fantasy to suggest the existence of the duty. 

 

                   It seems to me that the trial judge,
in the passage above quoted from his ruling on this question, has applied that
test. He has heard all the evidence. He heard the argument advanced by counsel.
He considered the whole matter with counsel's argument in mind and he
concluded, ""I do not recognize in the evidence any sufficient basis of
fact to leave the defence of mistake of fact to the jury"". In my view, he
directed himself correctly in law.

 

                   In relating the law to the facts of
any case, we must keep in mind what it is that the trial judge must look for in
the evidence in deciding whether there is, in the words of Fauteux J.,
""some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument,
and in the grievance"". In this case, to convey such a sense of reality,
there must be some evidence which, if believed, would support the existence of
a mistaken but honest belief that the complainant was in fact consenting to the
acts of intercourse which admittedly occurred. This requires a more detailed
recital of the evidence than would ordinarily be necessary.

 

28.              Dickson
J., speaking of knowledge of lack of consent as an essential element of the
offence, also held in Pappajohn, supra, that there must be
evidence on this issue. He stated at p. 148:

 

Mistake is a defence, then, where it prevents an accused
from having the mens rea which the law requires for the very crime with
which he is charged. Mistake of fact is more accurately seen as a negation of
guilty intention than as the affirmation of a positive defence. It avails an
accused who acts innocently, pursuant to a flawed perception of the facts, and
nonetheless commits the actus reus of an offence. Mistake is a defence
though, in the sense that it is raised as an issue by an accused. The Crown is
rarely possessed of knowledge of the subjective factors which may have caused
an accused to entertain a belief in a fallacious set of facts.

 

                   If I am correct that: (i) s. 143  of
the Criminal Code  imports a mens rea requirement, and (ii) the mens
rea of rape includes intention, or recklessness as to non‑consent of
the complainant, a mistake that negatives intention or recklessness entitles
the accused to an acquittal.

 

And he
continues his thought at pp. 149‑50:

 

In any event, it is clear that the defence is available
only where there is sufficient evidence presented by an accused, by his
testimony or by the circumstances in which the act occurred, to found the plea.

 

He
further stated at p. 158:

 

If there was ""some"" evidence to ""convey a
sense of reality"" to a defence of mistake as to consent, then the jury
ought to have been instructed to consider that plea. Kelsey v. The Queen,
[1953] 1 S.C.R. 220, at p. 226.

 

29.              There
is nothing in Sansregret, supra, which modifies or overrules the
proposition that there is an evidentiary burden on the accused. In Sans‑
regret the accused was tried before a judge without a jury. The line
between the evidentiary burden and the burden of persuasion tends to be blurred
in such a case. The trial judge found that the complainant consented out of
fear and that the accused blinded himself to the obvious and made no inquiry as
to the nature of the consent which was given. The mens rea for rape
involves a knowledge that the woman is consenting because of threats or fear of
bodily harm, or recklessness as to its nature. Therefore, McIntyre J. said at
p. 587:

 

                   In my view, it was error on the part
of the trial judge to give effect to the `mistake of fact' defence in these
circumstances where she had found that the com­plain­ant consented out of fear
and the appellant was wilfully blind to the existing circumstances, seeing only
what he wished to see. Where the accused is deliberately ignorant as a result
of blinding himself to reality the law presumes knowledge, in this case
knowledge of the nature of the consent. There was therefore no room for the
operation of this defence.

 

30.              There
is an evidentiary burden on the accused but (and this, in my opinion, is the
important point) if there is sufficient evidence to put the issue before the
jury, then the Crown has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that
the accused did not have an honest belief as to consent. The defence of mistake,
as Dickson J. pointed out in Pappajohn, is simply a denial of mens
rea which does not involve the accused in a burden of proof. He does,
however, have to adduce sufficient evidence to put the defence in issue.
Glanville Williams, supra, at pp. 909‑10, expresses his view that
the defence of mistake of fact means that the accused has an evidentiary burden
but not a persuasive burden.

 

31.              These
conclusions about the nature of the ""honest but mistaken belief""
argument are, in my view, consistent with the general tenor of the criminal
law. In Woolmington v. D.P.P., [1935] A.C. 462, the House of Lords
stated that when a defence to a charge of murder is accident or provocation,
the burden of satisfying the jury still rests on the prosecution. Viscount
Sankey L.C. uttered his famous words at p. 481:

 

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one
golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to
prove the prisoner's guilt subject ... to the defence of insanity and subject
also to any statutory exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the
case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the
prosecution or the prisoner,...the prosecution has not made out the case and
the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where
the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the
prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down
can be entertained.

 

32.              In
Mancini v. D.P.P., [1942] A.C. 1, the House of Lords further clarified
their position. The House of Lords pointed out that the judge need not deal in
his charge with the issues of accident or provocation merely because the
defences are raised. There must be some evidence of accident or provocation
that may be true. Then, and only then, must the judge deal with the issue in
his summing‑up and then, and only then, must the jury find in favour of
the accused unless the Crown satisfies them beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defence is untrue.

 

33.              The
clearest recognition by the Supreme Court of Canada of the distinction between
an evidentiary and persuasive burden is found in Latour v. The King,
[1951] S.C.R. 19. In that case the Court was dealing with the pleas of self‑defence
and provocation in the context of a murder charge. The Court quoted Woolmington,
supra, and Mancini, supra, and stated at p. 27:

 

For, once properly instructed as to what the law
recognizes as ingredients of self‑defence or of provocation, the accurate
question for the jury is not whether the accused has established such
ingredients but whether the evidence indicates them. And they, then,
must be directed that, should they find affirmatively or be left in doubt on
the question put to them, the accused is entitled, in the case of self‑defence
to a complete acquittal, or in the case of provocation to an acquittal of the
major offence of murder.

 

34.              The
courts then have consistently held that the ultimate burden of proof is on the
Crown. The legislature has occasionally provided otherwise. Section 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, for example, required the accused to disprove the intent to
traffic upon proof of possession. This provision was held to be
unconstitutional in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, because it
violated the presumption of innocence protected by s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

35.              It
is against this background that the new sexual assault provisions of the Criminal
Code  should be considered. In my view, the inclusion of s. 244(4)  in the Code
makes it clear that the trial judge should not in every case instruct the
jury to consider whether the accused had an honest, though mistaken, belief in
consent. The trial judge should only give such an instruction when certain
threshold requirements have been met. These requirements are totally consistent
with the previous case law. First, s. 244(4) requires the accused to allege an
honest belief in consent. Second, the trial judge should only put the issue of
honest belief to the jury if he is satisfied ""that there is sufficient
evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a
defence"". This is consistent with this Court's view that the trial judge
should instruct the jury to consider whether the accused had an honest belief
as to consent only where there was evidence to support such a plea. When s.
244(4) states that the trial judge should consider whether the evidence would
constitute a defence, the defence referred to is, in my view, the defence of
mistake of fact. The section is not intended to impose the burden of proof of
such defence on the accused but merely to affirm the pre‑conditions that
must be met before the trial judge is required to put the issue to the jury.

 

36.              Courts
of Appeal have had the opportunity to consider the issue of honest, though
mistaken, belief in the context of the new sexual assault provisions. They have
concluded that s. 244(4) is a legislative affirmation of the law previously
enunciated as to the sufficiency of evidence required to raise the defence of
mistaken belief in consent. There must be evidence which gives an air of
reality to the defence of mistake of fact before the court will consider it:
see R. v. Cook (1985), 46 C.R. (3d) 128 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. White
(1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (B.C.C.A.); and R. v. Moreau (1986), 26 C.C.C.
(3d) 359 (Ont. C.A.) The Ontario Court of Appeal decision in Moreau was
delivered subsequent to its decision in this case.

 

37.              Once
the trial judge decides to put the issue of honest belief to the jury, s.
244(4) states that, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the
determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, the trial judge shall
instruct the jury to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for
that belief. In my view, this part of s. 244(4) reflects the view expressed by
Dickson J. in Pappajohn, supra, at p. 156 that:

 

...the accused's statement that he was mistaken is not
likely to be believed unless the mistake is, to the jury, reasonable. The jury
will be concerned to consider the reasonableness of any grounds found, or asserted
to be available, to support the defence of mistake. Although ""reasonable
grounds"" is not a precondition to the availability of a plea of honest
belief in consent, those grounds determine the weight to be given the defence.
The reasonableness, or otherwise, of the accused's belief is only evidence for,
or against, the view that the belief was actually held and the intent was,
therefore, lacking.

 

                                                                    ...

 

In Textbook of Criminal Law, at p. 102, Professor
Glanville Williams states the view, with which I am in agreement, that it is
proper for the trial judge to tell the jury ""that if they think the
alleged belief was unreasonable, that may be one factor leading them to
conclude that it was not really held; but they must look at the facts as a
whole"". It will be a rare day when the jury is satisfied as to the
existence of an unreasonable belief.

 

38.              It
seems to me, therefore, that s. 244(4) still contemplates that an honest but
unreasonable belief in consent will constitute a defence. Nevertheless, it
directs the jury to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds as
an important evidentiary factor in determining whether the accused had an
honest belief in consent. This was the view of s. 244(4) taken by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. White, supra, and the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Moreau, supra. It is also the view taken
by the academic commentators: see D. Watt, The New Offences Against the
Person: The Provisions of Bill C‑127 (1984), at p. 83; G. Parker,
""The ""New"" Sexual Offences"" (1983), 31 C.R. (3d) 317, at
pp. 320‑21, although some arrived at this conclusion with reluctance:
see, for example, C. Boyle, Sexual Assault (1984), at p. 79.

 

39.              Applying
the statutory test to the evidence in this case, I find that there was no error
in the trial judge's charge to the jury. The trial judge must be taken to have
gone through the exercise mandated by s. 244(4) of considering whether its
threshold requirements had been met and, finding they had not, instructed the
jury without reference to the defence of mistake of fact. There is not, in my
view, a sufficient factual basis in this case for the accused's allegation that
he believed the com­plain­ant consented. There is no air of reality to it. The
accused did not testify. He called no witnesses. The accused and the
complainant did not know each other. The complainant suffered physical injury.
The complainant did not scream because of threats of violence and because of
actual violence. The complainant's version of events has been consistent. The
inconsistencies pointed to by the accused are trivial.

 

7.                Did
the admission of the roommate's evidence that             the accused
had made a sexual proposition to her                    violate the
""similar fact"" evidence exclusionary                    rule?

 

40.              The
second issue the accused raises is the admissibility of the evidence of the
roommate Eileen to the effect that the accused had made a physical approach
towards her and indicated that he wished to sleep with her. He argues that this
evidence should have been excluded because of the ""similar fact""
evidence rule. The rule is an exclusionary rule and an exception to the general
and fundamental principle that all relevant evidence is admissible. A general
statement of the exclusionary rule is that evidence of the accused's
discreditable conduct on past occasions tended to show his bad disposition is
inadmissible unless it is so probative of an issue or issues in the case as to
outweigh the prejudice caused: see Cross on Evidence (6th ed. 1985) at
p. 311. A very useful overview of the similar fact evidence rule is contained
in Sweitzer v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949, at pp. 952‑54:

 

                   The question of the admissibility of
similar fact evidence has been the subject of much legal writing to be found in
the decided cases and textbooks and in the academic articles and commentaries.
The general principle stated by Lord Herschell in Makin v. The Attorney‑General
for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57, at p. 65, has been largely accepted as
the basis for the admission of this evidence. He said:

 

                   In their Lordships' opinion the
principles which must govern the decision of the case are clear, though the
application of them is by no means free from difficulty. It is undoubtedly not
competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the
accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the
indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a
person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the
offence for which he is being tried. On the other hand, the mere fact that the
evidence adduced tends to shew the commission of other crimes does not render
it inadmissible if it be relevant to an issue before the jury, and it may be so
relevant if it bears upon the question whether the acts alleged to constitute
the crime charged in the indictment were designed or accidental, or to rebut a
defence which would otherwise be open to the accused. The statement of these
general principles is easy, but it is obvious that it may often be very difficult
to draw the line and to decide whether a particular piece of evidence is on the
one side or the other.

 

                   Over the years in seeking to apply
this principle judges have tended to create a list of categories or types of
cases in which similar fact evidence could be admitted, generally by reference
to the purpose for which the evidence was adduced. Evidence of similar facts
has been adduced to prove intent, to prove a system, to prove a plan, to show
malice, to rebut the defence of accident or mistake, to prove identity, to
rebut the defence of innocent association, and for other similar and related
purposes. This list is not complete.

 

                                                                    ...

 

The general principle enunciated in the Makin case
by Lord Herschell, should be borne in mind in approaching this problem. The
categories, while sometimes useful, remain only as illustrations of the
application of that general rule. 

 

41.              All
parties agree that the evidence of the roommate Eileen is relevant and
therefore admissible unless (a) it falls within the scope of the ""similar
fact"" evidence rule; and (b) it meets the criteria for exclusion contained
in that rule.

 

42.              Does
the evidence fall within the scope of the rule? In answering this question, we
need to decide whether the accused's conduct was discreditable. The accused's
conduct towards Eileen was not criminal. In the passage from Makin v.
Attorney‑General for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57, Lord Herschell
refers only to ""criminal acts"" and ""criminal conduct or
character"". It appears, however, that discreditable conduct extends beyond
criminal acts. This was the view taken by the English Court of Appeal in R.
v. Barrington, [1981] 1 All E.R. 1132. In that case, the prosecution sought
to bolster the evidence of three young complainants of indecency by the accused
with evidence from three other girls. The evidence of these girls indicated
that the accused had gone through much the same process of recruiting the girls
supposedly for babysitting and showing them pornographic magazines and
photographs. It was not, however, alleged that any acts of criminal conduct or
indecency took place. The court treated this as similar fact evidence. It
decided that the evidence could be properly admitted because its features were
strikingly similar to the circumstances surrounding the offence charged and
because there was no suggestion that its prejudicial effect outweighed its
probative value. Given that the similar fact evidence rule can extend to acts
other than criminal acts, it falls to consider whether the probative value
outweighs the prejudicial value of the evidence; see Sweitzer, supra.

 

43.              In
discussing the probative value we must consider the degree of relevance to the
facts in issue and the strength of the inference that can be drawn. The bulk of
Eileen's testimony is, of course, highly relevant to the case. It provides the
background for the circumstances in which the assault occurred. It makes it
clear how the respondent came to arrive at the complainant's doorstep on the
morning in question, how he knew to use Eileen's name, why he might be
interested in the victim, and why he could have anticipated that the
complainant would be home alone at the relevant time.

 

44.              The
evidence of the proposition made to Eileen makes the narrative clearer as it
indicates the note on which the first visit to the apartment ended. It makes
consistent and credible Eileen's assertion that she did not send the accused
over to see the complainant on the morning in question. Further, it is arguable
that it has some relevance to the question of motive and intent. The Crown
suggests that the accused, rebuffed by the roommate Eileen, had a motive for
turning his attention to the complainant, a woman in whom he had earlier
indicated an interest. The degree of probative value required varies with the
prejudicial effect of the admission of the evidence. The probative value of
evidence may increase if there is a degree of similarity in circumstances and
proximity in time and place. However, admissibility does not turn on such a
striking similarity: see L. H. Hoffmann, ""Similar Facts After Boardman""
(1975), 91 L.Q.R. 193, at p. 201. In my view, the evidence here is of
some, though not of great, probative value.

 

45.              Is
the evidence prejudicial? In this case, the conduct towards the roommate Eileen
is certainly not as discreditable as, for example, the conduct involved in Barrington,
supra. In fact, it might be argued that the accused's conduct was not
discreditable and hence not prejudicial at all. He propositioned a woman. When
she indicated that she was not interested, he desisted. He did not force
himself upon her. However, there are elements of the incident which could be
characterized as discreditable. After Eileen indicated that she would not sleep
with the accused he put his arms around her. She asked him to leave repeatedly
and he repeatedly refused. She finally felt she had to leave and go to the
outside porch. When they were walking to the bus stop, he pinned her against
the wall. He said he could never love her, he could only hurt her. Although
this is capable of an innocent interpretation, it is also capable of a sinister
interpretation. The evidence causes prejudice but it causes very little
prejudice because the accused desisted. I would conclude, therefore, on balance
that the evidence was properly admitted.

 

46.              Even
if I am wrong in this and the evidence should not have been admitted, the
conviction, in my view, should stand by virtue of the saving proviso of s.
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. Given the persuasive nature of the
evidence in this case the jury's verdict would necessarily have been the same
(see Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739) even if the alleged error
of law had not occurred.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Charge to jury ‑‑ Rape and indecent assault ‑‑
Defence of mistake of fact ‑‑ Mistaken belief in consent ‑‑
Whether the defence should have been left with the jury ‑‑ Whether
trial judge properly charged the jury.

 

                   At
the trial of the accused on charges of rape, attempted rape and indecent
assault, the evidence indicated that the complainant, a prostitute, agreed to
provide her services to Laybourn for a certain price. She testified that they
went to a hotel room and on entering she discovered the other two accused and
objected to their presence. Illingworth sought to engage the favours of the
complainant. She quoted her price and told him to come back in twenty minutes.
Bulmer and Illingworth then left but returned shortly after. A discussion
followed and Illingworth told the complainant that she would have to provide
her services without payment. Frightened, she performed various sexual acts
with all three. She denied giving consent and receiving payment. There was no
physical violence other than the various sexual acts. Bulmer did not give
evidence. Laybourn and Illingworth testified that price was discussed with the
complainant after Bulmer and Illingworth returned to the room and that she
finally agreed to have sex with them for twenty dollars each. No threats were
made. The occupant of an adjoining room testified that he heard two accused
leave and return. He also heard the woman complaining about their presence. Her
voice seemed normal at first, but as time passed it took on a whining,
wheedling tone. There was also discussion about price.

 

                   In
defence, the appellants took the position that the complainant had consented to
the acts. Counsel made the alternative submission that Laybourn had held an
honest but mistaken belief in consent. The trial judge left the defence to the
jury and told the jury that all three could rely upon the defence. The jury
returned verdicts of guilty of rape against both Laybourn and Illingworth.
Bulmer was acquitted of rape, but convicted of indecent assault. The majority
of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants' appeals. The appeal here is to
determine (1) whether on the facts of this case the defence of honest but
mistaken belief should have been left with the jury, and (2) whether the charge
to the jury was correct.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and McIntyre, Wilson, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: When the defence of
honest but mistaken belief in consent‑‑or for that matter any other
defence‑‑is raised, two distinct steps are involved. The first step
for the trial judge is to decide if the defence should be put to the jury. To
leave the defence to the jury, there must be evidence before the court that gives
an air of reality to the defence. In such cases, the second step requires the
trial judge to explain the law to the jury, review the relevant evidence, and
leave the jury with the issue of guilt or innocence. The jury must consider all
the evidence, and they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt in the case
of a rape charge that there was no consent before they may convict. Where they
find there was consent or honest belief in consent, or if they have a doubt on
either issue, they must acquit. They should be told as well that the belief, if
honestly held, need not be based on reasonable grounds. In cases arising since
the enactment of s. 244(4)  of the Criminal Code , they should also be
directed that, when considering all the evidence relating to the question of
the honesty of the accused's asserted belief in consent, they must consider the
presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

 

                   There
was evidence in this case to lend an air of reality to the defence of honest
but mistaken belief in consent and the trial judge was not in error in deciding
to put the defence to the jury. However, in dealing with the defence, the trial
judge was clearly wrong in the supplementary charge to leave the jury with the
impression that there must be reasonable grounds for the honest but mistaken
belief before the defence could prevail.

 

                   Per Lamer
J.: A mere assertion by counsel that the accused believed the victim was
consenting would not meet the ""air of reality"" test. But the test
should not be understood as going so far as enabling a trial judge to choose
not to leave the defence of honest belief with the jury in cases where an
accused has taken the stand and asserted under oath that he honestly believed
in consent. An accused's oath to the effect that he honestly believed in
consent is always some evidence, and its probative value in any given case
belongs to the jury and not to the trial judge.

                   The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and McIntyre, Wilson, Le Dain and La Forest JJ. was
delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre J.‑‑This
case involves an appeal from two convictions of rape and one of indecent assault.
There are two issues involved. The first, whether on the facts of this case the
defence of mistake of fact should have been left with the jury, and the second,
whether the charge to the jury on the question was correct.

 

2.                The
complainant was a prostitute. Late on the evening of July 13, 1980, the three
appellants were together in the appellant Bulmer's hotel room. Laybourn left
and picked up the complainant on the street. According to the complainant, they
discussed sexual acts and prices and struck a bargain. She agreed to provide
her services for eighty dollars. They returned to Bulmer's room and on entering
discovered the other two. The complainant objected to their presence and they
left. Before leaving, Illingworth sought to engage the favours of the
complainant. She quoted her price and told him to come back in twenty minutes.
When they left, Laybourn gave her eighty dollars. The other two returned to the
room in a few minutes and Bulmer, learning that Laybourn had paid eighty
dollars, said that the complainant was not worth that sum. He told her to
return the money, which she did. She was frightened and Illingworth told her
she would have to perform without payment. She then performed various sexual
acts with the three appellants, asserting that she did so only out of fear. She
denied giving consent. The police arrived at the room after some time and she
left with them complaining of rape. She said there was no physical violence
other than the various sexual acts and she received no payment.

 

3.                Laybourn
and Illingworth gave evidence. Bulmer did not. Laybourn confirmed the
complainant's story of the departure and quick return of Illingworth and
Bulmer. Then, according to his evidence, a discussion occurred. The complainant
wanted sixty dollars from each man. They said they would pay her twenty dollars
each. Laybourn told her she could take twenty dollars or leave. She seemed
`jumpy' but didn't leave. She then asked if she could go when she had finished
with them and he replied that she could go at once if she wished. She agreed to
a price of twenty dollars from each man and various sexual acts, including
intercourse, followed. No threats were made. Generally, Illingworth's evidence
supported Laybourn's.

 

4.                Evidence
of what went on in the hotel room was also given by one Jones who occupied an
adjoining room. From conversation overheard, he concluded that the woman was a
prostitute. He heard Bulmer and Illingworth leave, go down the hall, and
return. He heard the woman complain at the presence of the two men in the room
and he heard conversation including a male voice saying, ""you are in a
tough business baby and you have got to learn to take it"". At first, her
voice seemed normal, but as time passed it took on a whining, wheedling tone.
There was discussion about price, the woman saying she wanted sixty dollars
each and a male voice saying they would pay her twenty dollars.

 

5.                At
trial, the appellants took the position that the complainant had consented to
the acts. Counsel made the alternative submission that Laybourn had held an
honest but mistaken belief in consent. The trial judge left the defence to the
jury and told the jury that all three could rely upon the defence. The jury
returned verdicts of guilty of rape against both Laybourn and Illingworth.
Bulmer was acquitted of rape, but convicted of indecent assault. An appeal to
the British Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed, with Lambert J.A.
dissenting: (1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 256. This appeal is taken, under s. 618(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code , on the basis of the dissent.

 

6.                In
the Court of Appeal (Taggart, Craig and Lambert JJ.A.), Taggart J.A. was of the
view that the trial judge was right in leaving the defence of mistake of fact
to the jury. He considered that the jury would not be misled by the charge;
that the trial judge's instructions would not leave the jury with the
impression that the appellants were obliged to show that their mistaken belief
in consent was a reasonable one. Craig J.A. considered that the defence of
mistake of fact should not have been put to the jury. In this case, he said,
the issue was consent or no consent and there was no basis in the evidence for
a defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. He agreed with Taggart
J.A., however, that taken as a whole, the trial judge's charge to the jury was
adequate.

 

7.                Lambert
J.A. in his dissent was of the view that in the circumstances of this case the
judge was required to put the defence of mistake of fact to the jury. He
considered, however, that the defence was incorrectly put. The dissent is
recorded in the formal order of the Court of Appeal in these terms:

 

1. THAT the learned trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent
required something more than a genuine belief in consent in the mind of the
accused and in instructing the jury that there must be some objective evidence
from which an inference could be drawn that the complainant might be
consenting.

 

2. THAT the learned trial judge erred in leaving
with the jury, the impression that there must be reasonable grounds to support
the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.

 

8.                The
appellants raised three grounds of appeal in a revised factum which was filed
on behalf of all three. The first issue raised alleges error on the part of the
trial judge, upon the same basis as that mentioned in ground No. 1 of the
dissent of Lambert J.A. The other two grounds raised points not dealt with
below, which required the leave of this Court. They were expressed in the
factum thus: 

 

2. The Learned Trial Judge was without jurisdiction
to conduct a joint trial against the Applicants as the Crown had proceeded
against each of the Applicants severally.

 

3. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law having
embarked on a trial of the Applicants, in directing the Jury that they acted
jointly and further in not directing the Jury that the actions and words in
fact evidence of each one could not be used against each of the others.

 

An
application for leave to appeal in respect of both grounds was refused. The
Court did not feel it necessary to call upon counsel for the Crown on that
application. The appeal then turned on the ""mistake of fact"" issue.
The appellants argued that the trial judge was in error in instructing the jury
that the defence required objective evidence, apart from the testimony of the
accused, to support the proposition that the complainant may have been
consenting. The Crown contended that if the defence was open on the evidence,
then the judge's charge was adequate and did not confuse the jury.

 

The Law
Generally

 

9.                The
defence of mistake of fact is of long standing in law and was referred to as a
settled principle by Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England
in the latter part of the eighteenth century. At page 25 of vol. 4 of the Commentaries
(Beacon Press, Boston, 1962), the following appears under the marginal note
""Ignorance or mistake"":

 

                   Fifthly; ignorance or mistake
is another defect of will; when a man, intending to do a lawful act, does that
which is unlawful. For here the deed and the will acting separately, there is
not that conjunction between them, which is necessary to form a criminal act.
But this must be an ignorance or mistake of fact, and not an error in point of
law. As if a man intending to kill a thief or housebreaker in his own house,
`under circumstances which would justify that act,' by mistake kills one of his
own family, this is no criminal action; but if a man thinks he has a right to
kill a person excommunicated or outlawed, wherever he meets him, and does so,
this is wilful murder. For a mistake in point of law, which every person of
discretion not only may, but is bound and presumed to know, is in criminal
cases no sort of defence. Ignorantia juris, quod quisque tenetur scire,
neminem excusat, is as well the maxim of our own law, as it was of the
Roman.

 

The
defence has been variously described and may be conveniently stated in these
terms. If an accused entertains an honest belief in the existence of a set of
circumstances which, if they existed at the time of the commission of an
otherwise criminal act, would have justified his act and rendered it non‑criminal,
he is entitled to an acquittal. The law on this question as far as Canada is concerned
has been stated authoritatively in Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 120. Dickson J. (as he then was), writing on this point with the
concurrence of the majority of the Court, held that the defence was available
in Canada, that it goes to the question of whether the accused had the
necessary mens rea for the commission of the crime involved, and that
the mistaken belief upon which the defence rests need not be reasonable, if
honestly held. The subject has been further explored by my colleague, Wilson
J., in her reasons for judgment in R. v. Robertson, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 918
(judgment delivered concurrently), with whose observations I agree. Our task
then is to inquire whether in the circumstances of the case at bar the defence
ought to have been put to the jury, and when it was put, was it done correctly?

 

10.              It
is well settled law that in his charge the trial judge must put to the jury all
defences that may arise upon the evidence, whether they have been raised by
counsel for the defence or not. In doing so, he is obliged to explain the law
respecting the defence and to refer the jury to the evidence which may be
relevant on that issue. Before putting the defence, however, the trial judge
must decide whether in the facts before him the defence arises on the evidence.
It is only when he decides this question in favour of the defence that he must
leave it to the jury, for a trial judge is not bound to put every defence
suggested by counsel in the absence of some evidentiary base. Indeed, he should
not do so, for to put a wholly unsupported defence would only cause confusion.

 

11.              This
question was dealt with in some detail in Pappajohn.  The majority of
the Court were of the view that a defence should be put when there was evidence
before the Court which would give an air of reality to the defence. While
Dickson and Estey JJ. dissented from the majority on the question of
whether such evidence existed, they expressed no disapproval of the test for putting
the defence adopted by the majority. At page 127 in the Pappajohn case,
the matter was discussed and such cases as Wu v. The King, [1934] S.C.R.
609; Kelsey v. The Queen, [1953] l S.C.R. 220; and Workman v. The
Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 266, were cited.

 

12.              In
discussing the application of the ""air of reality"" test in the Pappajohn
case, I said, at p. 133:

 

To require the putting of the alternative defence of
mistaken belief in consent, there must be, in my opinion, some evidence beyond
the mere assertion of belief in consent by counsel for the appellant. This
evidence must appear from or be supported by sources other than the appellant
in order to give it any air of reality. 

 

These
words appear, on occasion, to have been misunderstood, but I do not withdraw
them. There will not be an air of reality about a mere statement that ""I
thought she was consenting"" not supported to some degree by other evidence
or circumstances arising in the case. If that mere assertion were sufficient to
require a trial judge to put the ""mistake of fact"" defence, it would
be a simple matter in any rape case to make such an assertion and, regardless
of all other circumstances, require the defence to be put. It must be
remembered that at this stage of the proceedings the trial judge is not in any
way concerned with the question of guilt or innocence. He is not concerned with
the weight of evidence or with the credibility of evidence. The question he
must answer is this. In all the circumstances of this case, is there any
reality in the defence? To answer this question, he must consider all the
evidence, all the circumstances. The statement of the accused alleging a
mistaken belief will be a factor but will not by itself be decisive, and even
in its total absence, other circumstances might dictate the putting of the
defence. This view finds support in the passage from the Heilbron Report (Great
Britain, Report of the Advisory Group on the Law of Rape (1975))
referred to by Dickson J., at p. 155 in Pappajohn, in these terms:

 

                   66. Morgan's case did not
decide, as some critics seem to have thought, that an accused person was
entitled to be acquitted, however ridiculous his story might be, nor did it
decide that the reasonableness or unreasonableness of his belief was
irrelevant. Furthermore it is a mistaken assumption that a man is entitled
to be acquitted simply because he asserts this belief, without more.
[Emphasis added.]

 

13.              When
the defence of mistake of fact‑‑or for that matter any other
defence‑‑is raised, two distinct steps are involved. The first step
for the trial judge is to decide if the defence should be put to the jury. It
is on this question, as I have said, that the ""air of reality"" test
is applied. It has nothing to do with the jury and is not a factor for its
consideration. If it is decided to put the defence, the second step requires the
trial judge to explain the law to the jury, review the relevant evidence, and
leave the jury with the issue of guilt or innocence. The jury must consider all
the evidence, and they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt in the case
of a rape charge that there was no consent before they may convict. Where they
find there was consent or honest belief in consent, or if they have a doubt on
either issue, they must acquit. They should be told as well that the belief, if
honestly held, need not be based on reasonable grounds. Before going further,
it should be observed that, since the decision of this Court in Pappajohn,
the Criminal Code  has been amended by the addition of s. 244(4) , which
provides:

 

                   (4) Where an accused alleges
that he believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the
subject‑matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is
sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would
constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence
relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to
consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

 

This
section, in my view, does not change the law as applied in Pappajohn. It
does not require that the mistaken belief be reasonable or reasonably held. It
simply makes it clear that in determining the issue of the honesty of the
asserted belief, the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the belief
are relevant factors for the jury's consideration. This approach was, I
suggest, foreshadowed in Pappajohn by Dickson J., at pp. 155‑56,
where he said:

 

                   Perpetuation of fictions does little
for the jury system or the integrity of criminal justice. The ongoing debate in
the courts and learned journals as to whether mistake must be reasonable is
conceptually important in the orderly development of the criminal law, but in
my view, practically unimportant because the accused's statement that he was
mistaken is not likely to be believed unless the mistake is, to the jury,
reasonable. The jury will be concerned to consider the reasonableness of any
grounds found, or asserted to be available, to support the defence of mistake.
Although ""reasonable grounds"" is not a precondition to the
availability of a plea of honest belief in consent, those grounds determine the
weight to be given the defence. The reasonableness, or otherwise, of the
accused's belief is only evidence for, or against, the view that the belief was
actually held and the intent was, therefore, lacking.

 

14.              The
jury should then be instructed, in accordance with s. 244(4) of the Code,
that when considering all the evidence relating to the question of the honesty
of the accused's asserted belief in consent they must consider the presence or
absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

 

Application
to this Case

 

15.              In
the Court of Appeal, Taggart and Lambert JJ.A., while differing in the result,
were both of the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the
putting of the defence to the jury. I am in agreement with that view. From the
evidence it is clear that when the complainant was picked up on the street by
Laybourn, after some discussion she did consent to sexual intercourse with
Laybourn. This consent would, of course, not extend to the others, and it may
well be that she withdrew her consent on learning that the others wished to
participate in the evening's activities. But there was other evidence, that of
the witness Jones in the adjoining room which told of bargaining regarding
price, and conversation that could be considered equivocal at times but which
could raise questions on the issue of whether, and to what extent, she may have
consented, or to what extent the appellants may have understood her to be
consenting. I would agree, as I have said, with Taggart and Lambert JJ.A. that
there was then sufficient evidence to lend an air of reality to the defence of
mistake of fact and the trial judge was not in error in deciding to put the
defence to the jury. 

 

16.              The
two points on which Lambert J.A. dissented in the Court of Appeal have been set
out above. In summary, he was of the view that the trial judge was in error in
telling the jury that more than a genuine belief in consent in the mind of the
accused was required to support the defence and that there must be some objective
evidence supporting the belief that the complainant might be consenting and, as
well, that there was error on the part of the trial judge in leaving the jury
with the impression that there must be reasonable grounds for the honest but
mistaken belief before the defence could prevail. Lambert J.A. based his
dissent not upon the main charge but upon a supplementary charge requested by
the jury after they had commenced their deliberations. On their return to the
courtroom, after some evidence had been read back at the jury's request, the
following occurred:

 

THE COURT: Thank you. Now, that's the evidence of                          Mr.
Jones that you asked for.

 

                   Mr. Foreman, you've given me another
question which is not quite as simple as the last one and you've asked for
further address to the jury on the matter of reasonable belief. I'm hard
pressed to do that. Is there anything specific that you're concerned about?

 

MR. FOREMAN: My lord, I believe when you were                            addressing
us this morning on the definition of        reasonable belief that you were
going quite                  quickly.

 

THE COURT: Okay, I'll go over it again. You                                      realize,
of course, when I instructed you on        honest belief, this is the third
position as                       opposed to‑‑opposed to the
consent being        asserted by the Accused, denied by the                       complainant,
this is something over and above   that scenario, and that's where it is. If
you                                 find there is some evidence that might
assist       you in concluding that, even though the girl                                wasn't
consenting, you accepted that, if there     is some basis upon which
the Accused thought she                was consenting, that would be a
defence, but     that has to be based on something more than                            something
in his mind, it has to be based on        something else, some evidence
from which an              inference can be drawn that she might be        consenting.

 

                   I will read again‑‑I
dealt with the ingredients of the crime of rape as being complete upon (a) an
act of sexual intercourse, (b) without consent. An affirmative finding as to
each of these elements in this case does not end the matter, as a defence is
not evidence that the Accused believed Laybourn‑‑believed Ms.
Schmidt to be consenting to the sexual intercourse.

 

                   The commission of a crime voluntarily
directed by a willing mind, this we call mens rea. This consists of some
positive state of mind such as an intention or the knowledge of the
wrongfulness of the act or reckless disregard of the consequences which must be
proved by the prosecution. The mental element may be established by inference
on the nature of the act committed or by additional evidence. You will be
concerned to consider the reasonableness of any grounds found or asserted to be
available to support the Accused's belief. Reasonable grounds is not a pre‑condition
to the availability of honest belief and consent, those grounds determine the
weight to be given to the evidence. The reasonableness or otherwise of the
Accused's belief is only evidence for or against the view that the belief was
actually held and the intent was therefore lacking. So if you conclude that the
Accused or any of them honestly believed Ms. Schmidt was consenting to the acts
of intercourse and that then that necessary mental element would be lacking and
you would acquit.

 

                   Now, this is‑‑that is
only, of course, when there is some reasonable grounds to support the belief
because it can hardly be an honest belief if it isn't based on anything to
support the belief and it's not sufficient to say I believe she was opposing
the rape, it has to be something else, something you can glean from the
evidence to support that position. [Emphasis added.]

 

17.              The
words of the foreman of the jury, quoted above, revealed that the jury was
concerned on the question of reasonable belief. It was therefore important that
the trial judge direct the jury fully on the question so that any
misapprehension on their part could be dispelled. Lambert J.A. noted this point
and, referring to the two emphasized passages in the part of the charge quoted
above, he said, at pp. 276‑77:

 

                   The first passage is wrong. The
defence of honest belief does not have to be based on something more than
something in his mind. The trial judge should not put the ""air of
reality"" question to the jury. That is for him. Once he has decided to put
the defence to the jury, the ""air of reality"" question is over. All
that is then required is for the jury to decide on the evidence whether the
accused honestly believed in consent, in his own mind. There does not have to be
""evidence from which an inference could be drawn that she might be
consenting."" That diverts the jury from the question that is truly before
them, namely: did the accused believe that the complainant consented?

 

                   The second passage is also wrong.
There do not have to be reasonable grounds to support the belief. It can be an
honest belief even if there are no reasonable grounds. I do not think that the
previous paragraph can modify the impression that this last paragraph must have
had on the jury. I doubt if what the trial judge actually said was
""...it's not sufficient to say I believe she was opposing the
rape...""

 

18.              As
I have indicated, I agree with Lambert J.A. that the ""air of reality""
test is for the judge and does not concern the jury. The issue facing the jury
with respect to the defence which had been put to them related to the honesty
of the appellants' asserted belief in consent. It was said to be error on the
part of the trial judge to say that the belief entertained by the appellants
had to be based on something from which the inference could be drawn that there
might be a consent. In this, the trial judge may well have been confusing the
""air of reality"" test, which is for him alone, with the ""reasonable
doubt"" test, which is for the jury, and his words may well have diverted
the jury from their true task which was to answer the question: Did the accused
believe that the complainant consented? Regardless of its effect on them,
however, the second passage attacked by Lambert J.A. is clearly wrong and, as
he said, amounts to serious misdirection. I am unable to say that this specific
direction that there must be some reasonable ground to support the asserted
belief, being the last words the jury heard on the subject, would not override
the earlier correct direction. I would, accordingly, allow the appeal and
direct a new trial. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

19.              Lamer J.‑‑I
have read the reasons for judgment of my colleague Justice McIntyre and, for
the reasons he sets out, I agree that this appeal should succeed. I wish to
add, however, the following qualifications to certain statements made in his
reasons.

 

20.              I
agree with McIntyre J. that ""a trial judge is not bound to put every
defence suggested by counsel in the absence of some evidentiary base""
(p. 789) and that ""to put a wholly unsupported defence would only
cause confusion"" (p. 790) amongst the jurors. In addition, I do not take
issue with the ""air of reality"" test referred to in Pappajohn v.
The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, by McIntyre J.

 

21.              With
respect, however, I have difficulties with his application of the ""air of
reality"" test. In Pappajohn, he said, at p. 133:

 

To require the putting of the alternative defence of
mistaken belief in consent, there must be, in my opinion, some evidence beyond
the mere assertion of belief in consent by counsel for the appellant. This
evidence must appear from or be supported by sources other than the appellant
in order to give it any air of reality.

 

In his
reasons in this case, he says (at p. 790):

 

These words [air of reality] appear, on occasion, to
have been misunderstood, but I do not withdraw them. There will not be an air
of reality about a mere statement that ""I thought she was consenting""
not supported to some degree by other evidence or circumstances arising in the
case. If that mere assertion were sufficient to require a trial judge to put
the `mistake of fact' defence, it would be a simple matter in any rape case to
make such an assertion and, regardless of all other circumstances, require the
defence to be put.

 

22.              If
this means that the trial judge is not required to put the defence to the jury
merely because the accused's lawyer has referred to the defence in argument,
then I agree. There must be some evidence supporting the defence before it is
to be put to the jury. However, I must respectfully take issue with the
""air of reality"" norm if it is to be understood as going so far as
enabling the trial judge to choose not to leave the defence of honest belief
with the jury even in a case where the accused has taken the stand and asserted
under oath that he or she honestly believed in consent. An accused's oath to
the effect that he or she honestly believed in consent is always some evidence,
and its probative value in any given case belongs to the jury and not to the
trial judge. It is, of course, open to the trial judge to comment on the probative
value of the evidence, but the jury remains the master of the facts. The trial
judge must not usurp the role of the jury by removing the evidence from the
jury's consideration on the ground that, in his or her view, the defence lacks
an ""air of reality"".

 

23.              Writing
for the majority of this Court in Mezzo v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
802, in the context of directed verdicts, McIntyre J. said, at p. 844:

 

When, however, he [Lord Widgery C.J. in R. v.
Turnbull, [1976] 3 All E.R. 549 (C.A.)] introduces the suggestion that the
trial judge should consider the quality of the evidence and, where he finds it
wanting, take the case from the jury, he enters more controversial ground and
authorizes the trial judge to encroach upon the jury's territory. Such a step
blurs or even obliterates the clear line separating the functions of judge and
jury. Questions of credibility and the weight that should be given to evidence
are peculiarly the province of the jury. The term `quality', as applied by Lord
Widgery C.J., is really nothing more than a synonym for `weight'. To consider
it, the trial judge exceeds his function.

 

The
combined effect of McIntyre J.'s test in this case for withdrawing a defence
from the jury and the majority's test in Mezzo for withdrawing the case
would lead to incongruous results. Where the only evidence on the questions of
consent and belief in consent is the testimony of the complainant and that of
the accused, the complainant's allegation of no consent must go to the jury (Mezzo)
but the accused's defence of honest belief in consent may be withdrawn from the
jury unless it is supported by other evidence or circumstances (this case). The
old common law rule in sexual assault cases that the trial judge must instruct
the jury that it is unsafe to convict in the absence of corroboration of the
complainant's testimony (which was abolished by s. 246.4  of the Criminal
Code ) would in effect be replaced by a rule requiring corroboration of the
accused's testimony. Such a requirement will often work an injustice to the
accused. Clearly the best, and quite often the only, evidence of the accused's
subjective belief will be his or her testimony, and there is no basis in law or
in principle for requiring corroboration. In addition, this Court decided in Pappajohn
that the accused's belief must be honest but need not be reasonable. As a
result, there clearly cannot be a requirement that the accused's belief be
supported by the circumstances before it can be submitted to the jury. As Dickson
J., as he then was, wrote, at p. 156: 

 

It will be a rare day when a jury is satisfied as to the
existence of an unreasonable belief. If the claim of mistake does not raise a
reasonable doubt as to guilt, and all other elements of the crime have been proved,
then the trier of fact will not give effect to the defence. But, if there is
any evidence that there was such an honest belief, regardless of whether it is
reasonable, the jury must be entrusted with the task of assessing the
credibility of the plea.

 

24.              I
should, in passing, add that in my view the issue of mistaken belief in consent
should also be submitted to the jury in all cases where the accused testifies
at trial that the complainant consented. The accused's testimony that the
complainant consented must be taken to mean that he believed that the
complainant consented. As a result, if the jury believes the complainant and
concludes that the complainant did not consent, that does not end the matter,
for the accused's assertion cannot be disposed of completely unless
consideration is then given to his or her being honestly mistaken in believing
that the complainant consented.

 

25.              Finally,
I wish to add that I do not believe that this view of the ""air of
reality"" test will open the floodgates to claims of honest mistake as to
consent in sexual assault cases. An accused who wishes to raise the defence in
the absence of any other evidence supporting an honest mistake will be required
to take the stand and will run the risks of cross‑examination. In
addition, I do not think that the jury will be fooled by false claims of the
defence. Juries are constantly assessing and then discarding defences because
they lack an air of reality and do not raise a reasonable doubt. Sexual offence
cases are no different.

 

26.              Subject
to these reservations, I agree with McIntyre J.'s reasons and would accordingly
allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

on appeal from the nova scotia supreme court, appeal division

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Scope of authority of
the military police ‑‑ Breathalyzers ‑‑ Failure to
provide breath samples ‑‑ Demand made by a military policeman to a
civilian outside a military base following a traffic violation on the base ‑‑
Whether military policeman a ""peace officer"" within the meaning of s.
2(f) of the Criminal Code ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
ss. 2(f), 235 ‑‑ National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑4,

s. 22.01 ‑‑ Defence Establishment Trespass Regulations, C.R.C.
1978, c. 1047, ss. 2, 3, 28(1).

 








                   The accused, a civilian, was seen driving out of a
military base at an excessive speed and was followed by two military policemen
and detained on a public highway. After observing the accused's staggering, his
glassy eyes, and the strong smell of alcohol on his breath, the military police
brought the accused to a police station and asked him to provide a breath
sample. The accused refused. He was then charged with refusing to comply with a
breathalyzer demand contrary to s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code . At
trial, the accused was acquitted. The judge found that the military police
officer was not a peace officer as defined in s. 2 (f) of the Criminal
Code  and that, therefore, he was not authorized to issue a breathalyzer
demand to a civilian. The Crown's appeal by way of a stated case was allowed.
The Court of Appeal held that any person appointed under s. 134  of the National
Defence Act  is a ""peace officer"" for all purposes of the Criminal
Code . This appeal is to determine whether a military police officer is a
""peace offi‑ cer"" within the meaning of s. 2 (f) of
the Criminal Code  when he is purporting to exercise authority over a
civilian who is not subject to the Code of Service Discipline.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The military policeman had no authority under s. 2(f)(i)
of the Code to demand that the accused provide a breathalyzer sample.
That section, which prescribes that ""peace officer"" includes
""officers and men of the Canadian Forces who are appointed for the purposes
of section 134  of the National Defence Act "", does not extend the
authority of military police to act as ""peace officers"" throughout a
province and in relation to all residents of a province, duplicating the role
and function of the civil police. Section 2 of the Code serves only to
grant additional powers to enforce the criminal law to persons who must
otherwise operate within the limits of their statutory or common law sources of
authority. In the case of military policemen, the purposes of s. 134  are clear:
the section provides that they may exercise authority over persons subject to
the Code of Service Discipline. That is the full extent of the grant of power.
Section 2 (f)(i) must be construed, therefore, as extending to persons
appointed for the purposes of s. 134  of the National Defence Act  the
additional authority to enforce the Criminal Code , but only in relation
to persons subject to the Code of Service Discipline.

 

                   The authority to demand that the accused provide a
breathalyzer sample can be derived in this case, however, from the definition
of ""peace officer"" in s. 2(f)(ii) of the Code. Section
2 (f)(ii) establishes that ""officers and men"" of the Canadian
Forces are peace officers when ""employed on duties that the Governor in
Council, in regulations made under the National Defence Act  for the
purposes of this paragraph, has prescribed to be of such a kind as to
necessitate that the officers and men performing them have the powers of peace
officers"". Under s. 22.01(2) of the Queen's Regulations and Orders for
the Canadian Forces, made under the National Defence Act  for the
purposes of s. 2(f)(ii) of the Code, military policemen have the
powers of peace officers when they perform any lawful duties ""as a result
of a specific order or established military custom or practice"" when those
duties are related to certain matters including the maintenance and protection
of law and order and the protection of property or persons. Here, the officer
had authority under the Government Property Traffic Regulations to
enforce the applicable speed limits against a civilian driving on the base and,
having stopped him for the purposes of enforcing the speed limit, the officer
derived further authority from s. 28(1) of the Defence Establishment
Trespass Regulations. This section, which applies to persons not subject to
the Code of Service Discipline, prescribes that a military policeman is
""authorized to arrest without warrant any person found committing any
criminal offence ... on or with respect to any defence establishment or whom on
reasonable and probable ground he believes to have committed such
offence . . . ."" A military police officer who has
clear statutory authority to enforce the law and who is sent out on a patrol on
a base is abiding by ""established military practice"" in fulfilling
his role by attempting to enforce the law and he meets the conditions imposed
by s. 22.01(2). Therefore, when s. 22.01(2) of the Queen's Regulations and
Orders for the Canadian Forces is read with s. 28(1) of the Defence
Establishment Trespass Regulations, the arresting officer was a peace
officer within the meaning of s. 2(f)(ii) of the Code and he was
entitled to invoke the statutory authorization of s. 235(1) of the Code.
The fact that the accused was arrested outside the military base did not
deprive the military policeman of his authority. Given the instantaneous police
warning to the accused to stop his vehicle and the detention immediately
outside the gates of the base, there was such a clear nexus between the offence
committed on the base and the detention off the base that the military police
retained their status and authority as peace officers.

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑The sole issue raised in this appeal is
whether a military police officer is a ""peace officer"" within the
meaning of s. 2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, as
amended, when he or she is purporting to exercise authority over a civilian who
is not subject to the Code of Service Discipline. Although the point is a
narrow one, it is important to define the scope of authority of the military
police with clarity so as to avoid a confusing overlapping of jurisdiction with
the civil police.

The Facts

 

2.                John Patrick Nolan was driving a brown
Chevrolet van on the grounds of Canadian Forces Base Shearwater. The van was
observed by Private Steven Ettinger, a military police officer appointed under
s. 134 of the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑4, as
amended. Private Ettinger was on patrol in a marked military police truck and
was accompanied by Corporal Chevrier. When observed by Private Ettinger, the
brown van was travelling out the main gates of C.F.B. Shearwater at
approximately 50 kilometres per hour in a 15 kilometres per hour speed zone.
The two military police officers pursued the van through the gate, activated
the siren and emergency lights on the police vehicle, and stopped the van on
the public highway.

 

3.                Mr. Nolan was the driver and only
occupant of the van. He was asked by the military police officers to step out
of the van. Private Ettinger testified that Mr. Nolan staggered slightly, that
his eyes were glassy, that his breath smelled strongly of alcohol, and that Mr.
Nolan appeared to be unsteady when he stooped to pick up his driver's license
which had fallen to the ground. Corporal Chevrier testified to similar effect.
Prompted by these observations, the military police officers placed Mr. Nolan
in the back seat of the military police truck, drove him to the Military Police
Section of C.F.B. Shearwater and Private Ettinger there issued a breathalyzer
demand. The trial judge found as a fact that Private Ettinger had reasonable
and probable grounds to issue the breathalyzer demand. Mr. Nolan was then
driven to the Dartmouth Police Station where a breathalyzer technician was
available to administer the test, but the appellant refused to take the
breathalyzer test. No breathalyzer demand was ever issued to Mr. Nolan by a
civilian police officer.

 

4.                It is common ground that Mr. Nolan was a
civilian at the time of his detention by the military police officers and that
he was not subject to the Code of Service Discipline.

 

5.                An Information was sworn charging that
Mr. Nolan:

 

At or near C.F.B.
Shearwater, in the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on or about the 5th day of
June, 1981, did unlawfully, without reasonable excuse, refuse to comply with a
demand made to him by a peace officer, to provide samples of his breath suitable
to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the proportion, if
any, of alcohol in his blood, contrary to Section 235(2)  of the Criminal Code .

 

AND FURTHER

 

At the same time and place
aforesaid, did unlawfully have the control of a motor vehicle while his ability
to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to Section
234  of the Criminal Code .

 

It is clear that the first charge could only be supported if the Crown
could show that Private Ettinger was a ""peace officer"" when he made
the breathalyzer demand.

The Relevant Statutes and Regulations

 

6.                The question whether an individual is a
""peace officer"" for the purposes of enforcing the Criminal Code 
must be answered by reference to the definition of ""peace officer""
contained in s. 2 of the Code:

 

                   2. In this Act

 

                                                                    ...

 

""peace officer""
includes

 

(a) a mayor,
warden, reeve, sheriff, deputy sheriff, sheriff's officer and justice of the
peace,

 

(b) a warden,
deputy warden, instructor, keeper, gaoler, guard and any other officer or
permanent employee of a prison;

 

(c) a police
officer, police constable, bailiff, constable, or other person employed for the
preservation and maintenance of the public peace or for the service or
execution of civil process,

 

(d) an officer
or person having the powers of a customs or excise officer when performing any
duty in the administration of the Customs Act  or the Excise Act ,

 

(d.1) a person
appointed or designated as a fishery officer under the Fisheries Act
when performing any of his duties or functions pursuant to that Act,

 

(e) the pilot
in command of an aircraft

 

(i) registered in
Canada under regulations made under the Aeronautics Act , or

 

(ii) leased without
crew and operated by a person who is qualified under regulations made under the
Aeronautics Act  to be registered as owner of an aircraft registered in
Canada under those regulations,

 

while the aircraft is in
flight, and

 

(f) officers
and men of the Canadian Forces who are

 

(i) appointed for the
purposes of section 134  of the National Defence Act , or

 

(ii) employed on
duties that the Governor in Council, in regulations made under the National
Defence Act  for the purposes of this paragraph, has prescribed to be of
such a kind as to necessitate that the officers and men performing them have
the powers of peace officers;

 

7.                Of particular relevance to the present
case is s. 2(f) of that definition which defines specifically when
members of the Canadian Forces may be classed as ""peace officers"".
Section 2(f)(i) refers the reader to s. 134  of the National Defence
Act , which at the relevant time read:

 

                   134. Such officers and men as are appointed under regulations for the
purposes of this section may

 

(a) detain or
arrest without a warrant any person who is subject to the Code of Service
Discipline, regardless of the rank or status of that person, who has committed,
is found committing, is suspected of being about to commit, or is suspected of
or charged under this Act with having committed a service offence;

 

(b) (Repealed,
Chapter 13, s. 73.1, Statutes of Canada, 1972); and

 

(c) exercise
such other powers for carrying out the Code of Service Discipline as are
prescribed in regulations made by the Governor in Council.

 

Section 2 (f)(ii) of the Criminal Code  definition of
""peace officer"" refers to ""regulations made under the National
Defence Act  for the purposes of this paragraph"". The applicable
regulations are found in the Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian
Forces, passed pursuant to s. 12(1)  of the National Defence Act  and
amended by Order in Council, P.C. 1976‑1799, July 13, 1976 (hereinafter Queen's
Regulations):

 

22.01‑‑OFFICERS
AND MEN‑‑PEACE OFFICERS

 

(1)  Section 2  of the
Criminal Code  provides in part that ""peace officer"" includes:

 

""(f) officers
and men of the Canadian Forces who are

 

(i)  appointed for
the purposes of section 134  of the National Defence Act , or

 

(ii) employed on duties
that the Governor in Council, in regulations made under the National Defence
Act  for the purposes of this paragraph, has prescribed to be of such a kind
as to necessitate that the officers and men  performing them have the powers of
peace officers;"".

 

(2) For the purposes of
subparagraph (f)(ii) of the definition of ""peace officer"" in section
2  of the Criminal Code , it is hereby prescribed that any lawful duties
performed as a result of a specific order or established military custom or
practice, that are related to any of the following matters are of such a kind
as to necessitate that the officers and men performing them have the powers of
peace officers:

 

(a)  the maintenance
or restoration of law and order;

 

(b)  the protection
of property;

 

(c)  the protection
of persons;

 

(d)  the arrest or
custody of persons;

 

(e)  the apprehension
of persons who have escaped from lawful custody or confinement;

 

(f)  the enforcement
of warrants issued by the Minister pursuant to section 218  of the National
Defence Act ;

 

(g)  the enforcement
of the Customs Act  and regulations made thereunder, or

 

(h)  the enforcement
of the Boating Restriction Regulations and the Small Vessel
Regulations.

 

8.                The facts of the present appeal are such
that certain sections of the Defence Establishment Trespass Regulations,
C.R.C. 1978, c. 1047 (here­inafter Trespass Regulations) are also
relevant:

 

                   2. In
these Regulations,

 

                                                                    ...

 

""security guard""
means any peace officer, security policeman, provost, military policeman or member
of the Corps of Commissionaires, and includes any officer or man of the
Canadian Forces or employee of the Department of National Defence or of the
Defence Research Board who has been assigned duties relating to the enforcement
of these Regulations. (agent de sûreté)

 

 

 

                   3. These
Regulations do not apply to any person who is subject to the Code of Service
Discipline, but apply to all other persons except as provided in section 29 of
these Regulations.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   28.(1) Every
security guard is authorized to arrest without warrant any person found
committing any criminal offence or infraction of these Regulations on or with
respect to any defence establishment or whom on reasonable and probable ground
he believes to have committed such offence or such infraction.

 

                   (2) Where
the use of force is necessary to effect an arrest, a security guard shall use
no more force than is necessary in the circumstances.

 

                   29. Notwithstanding
anything contained in these Regulations, the officer in command or person in
charge of a defence establishment may in respect of such establishment, in his
sole discretion, and from time to time, exempt any person from the application
of these Regulations, but such exemption shall be in writing and shall be for
such period, not exceeding three months, as may be specified therein. 

 

                                                                   III

 

Procedural History

 

                   1. Provincial Magistrate's Court

 

9.                Mr. Nolan was tried on the Information
before Judge Elmer J. MacDonald of the Provincial Magistrate's Court in
Dartmouth. The appellant pleaded not guilty on both counts. After the close of
the case for the Crown, Defence Counsel made a motion for non‑suit in
relation to Count One. The case was adjourned and written submissions from the
Crown and the Defence Counsel were received. When the Court reconvened, the
trial judge dismissed the motion for non‑suit. Counsel for the accused
presented no evidence relating to either charge on the Information.

 

10.              Judge MacDonald found Mr. Nolan not guilty
on both counts. He held that Private Ettinger was not a peace officer as
defined in the Criminal Code  and that, therefore, he was not authorized
to issue a breathalyzer demand to a civilian under s. 235 of the Code.
The Judge further held that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that the
appellant had been driving while impaired.

 

11.              The Crown applied to Judge MacDonald to
state a case. He did so, setting out his findings of fact and agreeing to the
question as set by the Crown:

 

Did I err in law in
holding that a military police officer appointed pursuant to Section 134 of the
National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑4, as amended, is not a
peace officer within the meaning of Section 2 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1970, c. C‑34, as amended, when exercising powers in relation to
persons not subject to the Code of Service Discipline?

 

The Stated Case clearly referred only to Count One of the Information.
The not guilty verdict on the Second Count was not appealed.

 

                   2.    The Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal
Division

 

12.              A three‑judge panel of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held unanimously that Judge
MacDonald had indeed erred in his interpretation of the definition of
""peace offi‑ cer"" in s. 2  of the Criminal Code :
(1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 417. In a concise opinion, Hart J.A. relied solely upon
s. 2(f)(i) of the Code, and held that any person appointed under
s. 134  of the National Defence Act  is a ""peace officer"" for
all purposes of the Criminal Code . He rejected the argument that the
words in s. 2 (f)(i) ""appointed for the purposes of section 134  of
the National Defence Act "" should be read as words of limitation.
Military police officers appointed under that section were not limited to
acting as ""peace offi‑ cers"" when carrying out specific
duties under the National Defence Act  or subordinate authority.

 

13.              It followed that, in Justice Hart's view,
the Magistrate had erred in holding that the military police officer, Private
Ettinger, was not a ""peace officer"" for the purposes of enforcing s.
235  of the Criminal Code . He was vested with the authority to make a
breathalyzer demand. The acquittal was therefore set aside and the case
remitted to the trial judge.

 

                   3. Supreme Court of Canada

 

14.              Leave to appeal was granted by this Court,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. ix. By motion, the appellant asked the Court to issue an order nunc
pro tunc extending the time within which service and filing of a notice of
appeal was required. The order was issued, and notice of appeal was filed
subsequently.

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Definition of ""Peace Officer"" in s. 2 (f)(i) of the
Criminal Code 

 

15.              Section 2 (f) of the Criminal
Code  was introduced by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1972, S.C.
1972, c. 13. Prior to that amending legislation, the s. 2  definition of
""peace officer"" contained no reference to military personnel. The
scope of authority of military police was established solely by s. 134  of the National
Defence Act , and by regulations made thereunder, specifically by s. 22.02
of the Queen's Regulations. Section 134  provided that military police
could exercise authority over only those persons ""subject to the Code of
Service Discipline"". That Code consists of Parts IV‑IX of the National
Defence Act  and it is designed primarily to regulate the conduct of members
of the Canadian Armed Forces. Those subject to the Code are set out in s. 55(1) 
of the National Defence Act . It bears reiteration that the trial judge
found as a fact that the appellant, Mr. Nolan, was not subject to the Code.

 

16.              Under s. 134(b) of the Act prior to
the 1972 amendments, military police had been granted specific authority to
issue a breathalyzer demand pursuant to s. 235  of the Criminal Code , but
only ""in respect of any person subject to the Code of Service
Discipline"":

 

                   134. Such officers and men as are appointed under regulations for the
purposes of this section may

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) exercise
the authority vested in a peace officer under section 235  of the Criminal
Code  in respect of any person subject to the Code of Service Discipline....

 

This paragraph was repealed in 1972 and the new para. (f) was
added to the definition of ""peace officer"" in s. 2  of the Criminal
Code . As we have seen, s. 2 (f)(i) thereafter included in the
definition of ""peace officer"" all ""officers and men of the
Canadian Forces"" who are ""appointed for the purposes of section 134 
of the National Defence Act "". It was the opinion of the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appeal Division, that these amendments were intended to broaden
the scope of authority of military police. Military police officers would no
longer be limited to exercising authority over persons subject to the Code of
Service Discipline, but could act as ""peace officers"" in relation to
all residents of Canada. Hart J.A. stated at p. 420:

 

The obvious intention of
this amendment was to cloak these trained [military] policemen with authority
to deal with persons not subject to the Code of Service Discipline. Although it
may not be desirable that this authority be exercised on too broad a basis,
Parliament has, in my opinion, created peace officers under the Criminal
Code  of all military personnel appointed under s. 134  of the National
Defence Act  to carry out police duties within the Armed Forces. They have
been vested with power to exercise their duties as peace officers not only when
dealing with members of the Armed Forces but also with other persons not subject
to the Code of Service Discipline.

 

No other court in Canada has adopted such a broad interpretation of s.
2 (f)(i) and it should be underscored that the Nova Scotia Court itself
stated that ""it may not be desirable that this authority [of military
police] be exercised on too broad a basis."" Although he argued for a very
broad interpretation of s. 2 (f)(i), even the respondent Attorney General
in this case argued in his factum that it would be ""contrary to his
interest"" to submit that the military police could ""exercise a
general jurisdiction throughout the Province"". He asked that the
""judgment in the case at bar be confined to the particular circumstances
of this case"".

 

17.              The view that the 1972 amendments to the National
Defence Act  and the Criminal Code  were intended to broaden the scope
of authority of the military police was rejected expressly by the Supreme Court
of British Columbia in R. v. Smith (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 418. Andrews
J. held that the words in s. 2 (f)(i) ""appointed for the purposes of
section 134  of the National Defence Act "" served not only to direct
attention to the source of authority of the ""peace officer"", but also
imposed an important limitation upon that authority (at p. 424):

 

                   In this
case the words ""for the purposes of section 134  of the National Defence
Act "" must . . . be taken to mean something. Section 134  of the National
Defence Act  clearly limits the scope of the purposes of this section to a
grant of authority to an officer or man appointed thereunder to deal only
with persons subject to the Code of Service Discipline. [Emphasis in
original.]

 

This interpretation of s. 2(f)(i) of the Code was upheld
by the B.C. Court of Appeal (1983), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 250, and it is entirely
consistent with the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in R. v.
Harvey (1979), 18 A.R. 382, where Clement J.A. held, at p. 386:

 

                   The
jurisdiction of [the military police officer] is both defined and limited by
the terms of s. 134  of the National Defence Act  which is imported by
reference into the definitions given by s. 2  of the Criminal Code . The
military police are empowered as police officers with respect to persons who
are subject to the Code of Service Discipline.

 

Callaghan J. of the Ontario High Court reached the same conclusion in R.
v. Pile (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 268, at p. 272.

 

18.              The weight of authority points, therefore,
to the conclusion that s. 2 (f)(i) does not extend the authority of
military police to act as ""peace officers"" throughout a province and
in relation to all residents of a province, duplicating the role and function
of the civil police. Of course, the mere preponderance of authority is not
sufficient in itself to justify a particular conclusion before this Court,
unless that authority is grounded in reason and fairness. In the present case,
however, authority, common sense and principle all lead to the same conclusion.

 

19.              On the level of principle, it is important
to remember that the definition of ""peace officer"" in s. 2  of the Criminal
Code  is not designed to create a police force. It simply provides that
certain persons who derive their authority from other sources will be treated
as ""peace officers"" as well, enabling them to enforce the Criminal
Code  within the scope of their pre‑existing authority, and to benefit
from certain protections granted only to ""peace officers"". Any
broader reading of s. 2  could lead to considerable constitutional difficulties.
Section 92(14)  of the Constitution Act, 1867  provides that the
administration of justice falls within provincial legislative competence. See Di
Iorio v. Warden of the Montreal Jail, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 152, and Attorney
General of Quebec and Keable v. Attorney General of Canada, [1979] 1 S.C.R.
218. Although the ability of the federal Parliament to create a national police
force has never been challenged and any such exercise of authority is
presumptively valid, to treat s. 2  of the Criminal Code  as a broad grant
of authority to thousands of persons to act as ""peace officers"" in
any circumstances could well prompt a constitutional challenge. In the context
of division of powers, legislation should be interpreted, when possible, so
that it is not ultra vires. The assessment of legislation under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  is, of course, subject to different
considerations. See Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Ltd.,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 110. 

 

20.              I would therefore conclude that the
definition of ""peace officer"" in s. 2  of the Criminal Code 
serves only to grant additional powers to enforce the criminal law to persons
who must otherwise operate within the limits of their statutory or common law
sources of authority.

 

21.              This interpretation is buttressed by a
close textual analysis of s. 2 (f) itself. Like Andrews J. of the British
Columbia Supreme Court, I am convinced that the words in s. 2 (f)(i),
""appointed for the purposes of section 134  of the National Defence Act ""
must indeed ""mean something"". The respondent Crown submits that
""for the purposes of section 134 "" means nothing more than ""under
section 134 "". The reference is simply to describe those members of the
Armed Forces‑‑military police‑‑who are ""peace
officers"" within the meaning of s. 2 (f)(i). No limitation of
authority is implied. I cannot agree with that interpretation. Section 2(f)(i)
of the Code speaks of the purposes of s. 134 , not merely of the
group defined by s. 134 . The purposes of s. 134  are clear: the section provides
that officers and men appointed under regulations pursuant to the section may
exercise authority over persons subject to the Code of Service Discipline. That
is the full extent of the grant of power. Under this reading, s. 2(f)(i)
of the Code allows such officers and men the additional authority to
enforce the Criminal Code  but only in relation to persons referred to in
s. 134  itself.

 

22.              The context of s. 2(f)(i) of the Code
lends further support to this interpretation. Under section 2(c),
persons ""employed for the preservation and maintenance of the public peace
or for the service or execution of civil process"" are peace officers.
Section 2(d) states that an officer or person ""having the powers of
a customs or excise officer"" is a peace officer ""when performing any
duty in the administration of the Customs Act  or the Excise Act "".
In section 2(d.1) it is established that a ""fishery officer""
is a peace officer ""when performing any of his duties or functions""
under the Fisheries Act. Similarly, under s. 2 (e) the pilot of an
aircraft registered in Canada is a peace officer ""while the aircraft is in
flight"". All military personnel are peace officers, under s. 2 (f)(ii),
when they are employed on duties prescribed by regulation that necessitate the
powers of a peace officer. Thus, it will be seen that s. 2 (f)(i) falls
within a series of definitions all of which contain express functional or
temporal limitations. In this context, it is difficult to imagine that the
words in s. 2 (f)(i), ""for the purposes of section 134  of the National
Defence Act "" are not to be treated as words of limitation.

 

23.              Finally, it must be stressed that a
reading of s. 2 (f)(i) that recognizes no limitation on the power of
military police to act as ""peace officers"" would have the effect of
broadening considerably the power of the military police to arrest without
warrant. That power is granted by s. 134  of the National Defence Act .
In R. v. Dean (1965), 47 C.R. 311, at p. 319 (Ont. C.A.), Laskin J.A. warned
that ""the Courts ought not to adopt a construction to enlarge the power to
arrest without warrant unless the construction is plainly demanded by the words
used in the relevant statute"". I would endorse that view without
reservation. As emphasized by Le Dain J. in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1
S.C.R. 613, at p. 644, when a citizen is confronted with police authority,
there is always a strong element of ""psychological compulsion"" in any
police demand. Although this ""compulsion"" may be useful in the
maintenance of a peaceful society, the citizen should not be subject to the
demands of a confusing array of authority figures. One of the hallmarks of our
free and democratic society is the relatively low level of interference by
officers of the state in the daily lives of the Canadian people. The exigencies
of crime prevention and detection do not require an interpretation of s. 2 (f)(i)
of the Criminal Code  that would permit military police officers to
exercise the powers of a ""peace officer"" in relation to all Canadians
and throughout the country. I would therefore read s. 2 (f)(i) as
according to persons appointed for the purposes of s. 134  of the National
Defence Act  the additional powers of peace officers under the Criminal
Code , but only in relation to men and women subject to the Code of Service
Discipline.

 

24.              The arresting military police officer in
the present case could not derive authority from s. 2 (f)(i) to
demand of Mr. Nolan, a civilian, that he provide a breathalyzer sample. It remains
to be seen whether such authority can be derived from the definition of
""peace officer"" in s. 2 (f)(ii) of the Criminal Code .

 

                                                                    V

 

The Definition of ""Peace Officer"" in s. 2 (f)(ii) of
the Criminal Code 

 

25.              As I have indicated, the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appeal Division, held in the instant case that the arresting
military police officer had derived his authority from s. 2 (f)(i) of the
Criminal Code . It was therefore unnecessary to discuss s. 2 (f)(ii).
Indeed, the only reported case which explores s. 2 (f)(ii) in any detail
is R. v. Pile, supra, a decision of Callaghan J. The facts in Pile
were very similar to those of the case at bar. The accused was observed driving
on a military base by a military police officer. The officer had reasonable and
probable grounds to believe that the accused was impaired by alcohol. The
military police officer followed the accused off the base and arrested him on a
public highway. In these circumstances, Callaghan J. held that the arresting
officer was a peace officer within the meaning of s. 2 (f)(ii) of the Criminal
Code . I agree, but my reasons for so concluding are somewhat different than
those advanced by Callaghan J. 

 

26.              Section 2 (f)(ii) of the Criminal
Code  establishes that any ""officer or man"" of the Canadian
Forces is a peace officer when

 

(ii) employed on
duties that the Governor in Council, in regulations made under the National
Defence Act  for the purposes of this paragraph, has prescribed to be of
such a kind as to necessitate that the officers and men performing them have
the powers of peace officers;

 

The Governor in Council has promulgated such regulations in s. 22.01(2)
of the Queen's Regulations which, for the sake of convenience, I will
set out again:

 

                   (2) For
the purposes of subparagraph (f)(ii) of the definition of ""peace
officer"" in section 2  of the Criminal Code , it is hereby prescribed
that any lawful duties performed as a result of a specific order or established
military custom or practice, that are related to any of the following matters
are of such a kind as to necessitate that the officers and men performing them
have the powers of peace officers:

 

(a)  the maintenance
or restoration of law and order;

 

(b)  the protection
of property;

 

(c)  the protection
of persons;

 

(d)  the arrest or
custody of persons;

 

(e)  the apprehension
of persons who have escaped from lawful custody or confinement;

 

(f)  the enforcement
of warrants issued by the Minister pursuant to section 218  of the National
Defence Act ;

 

(g)  the enforcement
of the Customs Act  and regulations made thereunder, or

 

(h)  the enforcement
of the Boating Restriction Regulations and the Small Vessel
Regulations.

 

There can be no doubt that the detection and arrest of inebriated
drivers falls within the ""matters"" enumerated in s. 22.01(2). It
could be said to relate to the maintenance or restoration of law and order, to
the protection of property, or to the protection of persons. It certainly
relates to the arrest or custody of persons. That is not the final hurdle,
however, for the regulation imposes further conditions upon military personnel
claiming to act as peace officers under s. 2(f)(ii) of the Code.
A member of the armed forces is not given leave by s. 22.01(2) of the Queen's
Regulations to act as a peace officer in all circumstances. Military
personnel only fall within the definition when they are performing ""lawful
duties"" that are the ""result of a specific order or established
military custom or practice"".

 

27.              It is therefore necessary to determine
whether a demand made to a civilian driver for a breath sample falls within the
scope of the lawful duties of a military police officer and whether the officer
in the case at bar was acting pursuant to a specific order or established
military custom or practice. To deal with these issues properly it is important
to remember that when Mr. Nolan was observed by the military police officer,
Mr. Nolan was driving at 50 kilometres per hour in a 15 kilometres per hour
speed zone on C.F.B. Shearwater. Mr. Nolan was committing an infraction on the
base, and the officer of course had authority to enforce the applicable speed
limits against a civilian driving on the base (Government Property Traffic
Regulations, C.R.C. 1978, c. 887).

 

28.              Having stopped Mr. Nolan for the purposes
of enforcing a speed limit, the officer derived further authority from the Trespass
Regulations. These Trespass Regulations expressly do not apply to
any person who is subject to the Code of Service Discipline, but they apply to
all other persons, with certain stipulated exceptions. (See sections 3 and 29
of the Trespass Regulations.) They did apply to Mr. Nolan.

 

29.              Section 28(1) of the Trespass
Regulations provides:

 

                   28.(1) Every
security guard is authorized to arrest without warrant any person found
committing any criminal offence or infraction of these Regulations on or with
respect to any defence establishment or whom on reasonable and probable ground
he believes to have committed such offence or infraction.

 

The definition of ""security guard"" in s. 2 of the Trespass
Regulations includes the ""military policeman"". There can be no
doubt that the military police officer in the present case had the authority of
a ""security guard"" under the Trespass Regulations. The facts
found at trial established that he also had reasonable and probable grounds to
believe that a criminal offence had been committed. Finally, the suspected
criminal infraction of driving while impaired by alcohol took place on a
""defence establishment"", fulfilling the last requirement of s. 28(1)
of the Trespass Regulations. The military police officer in the instant
case therefore had statutory authority to arrest Mr. Nolan without warrant to
enforce the criminal law. 

 

30.              I have no difficulty in concluding as well
that a military police officer who has clear statutory authority to enforce the
law and who is sent out on a routine patrol on a base is abiding by established
military practice in fulfilling his role by attempting to enforce the law. The
military police officer in the present case therefore met the final condition
imposed by s. 22.01(2) of the Queen's Regulations. He was acting
""as a result of a specific order or established military custom or
practice"".

 

31.              In summary, the authority vested in the
military police by virtue of s. 28(1) of the Trespass Regulations was
sufficient to fulfil the requirements of s. 22.01(2) of the Queen's
Regulations: the military police officer was performing ""lawful
duties"" flowing from a ""specific order or established military custom
or practice"". To perform those duties of enforcing the criminal law
against civilians on a military base, it was necessary, furthermore, to have
the powers of a peace officer. I have already emphasized that the detection of
inebriated drivers clearly falls within a number of the enumerated
""matters"" in s. 22.01(2). I would conclude, therefore, that the
arresting officer was a peace officer within the meaning of s. 2 (f)(ii)
of the Criminal Code  when read with s. 22.01(2) of the Queen's
Regulations and s. 28(1) of the Trespass Regulations. Being a
""peace officer"", the military police officer in the instant case was
entitled to invoke the statutory authorization of s. 235(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and to issue a breathalyzer demand. I expressly leave aside the
question what authority is vested in military personnel for the purposes of
Part XI of the National Defence Act  which relates to extraordinary use
of the military in aid of the civil power. That question clearly is not raised
on the facts of the case at bar.

 

32.              One issue must yet be resolved. Although
the offence took place on a defence establishment, the actual detention of the
accused occurred on a public highway after the military police had followed Mr.
Nolan out of the gates of the base. The question arises whether the military
police retained their status and authority as peace officers once they left
C.F.B. Shearwater. On the particular facts of the instant case, I have no
difficulty in concluding that they did. The accused was seen committing a
traffic offence on the base. The officers only saw the accused as he was
speeding out of the gates of the base and, in order to enforce the law, the
military police officers had to follow Mr. Nolan off the base. There is
absolutely no evidence that the accused attempted to evade the military police,
so the circumstances do not really raise the issue of ""hot pursuit"".
Given the instantaneous police warning to the accused to stop his vehicle and
the detention immediately outside the gates of the base, there was such a clear
nexus between the offence committed on the base and the detention off the base
that I am convinced that the military police retained their status and
authority as peace officers.

                   This
appeal raised the question of the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter 
in the context of the right to counsel in s. 10 (b). Respondent was
arrested for theft and possession of a stolen car and armed robbery. The
arresting officer read him his rights from a card twice because of a flippant
remark respondent had made following the first reading. Even though respondent
then indicated that he was not going to say anything until he saw his lawyer,
the officers continued to question him. Respondent did not directly request to
use the telephone and the officers did not volunteer the use of it. Respondent
did not speak to his lawyer until his lawyer called him at the police station
that evening. The trial judge, in convicting the respondent, relied on a
statement made by him in reply to a barbed question asked before his lawyer had
made contact with him. The trial judge held that, even if the right to counsel
had been infringed, the admission of the statements would not bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. The Court of Appeal unanimously
allowed respondent's appeal, quashed the convictions and ordered a new trial.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Section
10 (b) imposes at least two duties on the police in addition to the duty
to inform the detainee of his rights. First, the police must provide the
detainee with a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to retain and
instruct counsel without delay. The duty to facilitate contact with counsel
includes the duty to offer the respondent the use of the telephone. Although
circumstances might exist where it is particularly urgent for the police to
continue with their investigation before it is possible to facilitate a
detainee's communication with counsel, there was no such urgency here.
Secondly, the police must cease questioning the detainee until he has had a
reasonable opportunity to retain and instruct counsel. The purpose of the right
to counsel is to allow the detainee not only to be informed of his rights and
obligations under the law but, equally if not more important, to obtain advice
as to how to exercise those rights. The police officers here correctly informed
the respondent of his right to remain silent and the main function of counsel
would be to confirm the existence of that right and then to advise him as to
how to exercise it. For the right to counsel to be effective, the detainee must
have access to this advice before he is questioned or otherwise required to
provide evidence. This aspect of the respondent's right to counsel was clearly
infringed, and again, there was no urgency to justify immediate questioning.

 

                   Respondent
did not waive his right to counsel by answering the police officer's questions.
A person may implicitly waive his rights under s. 10 (b), but the
standard is very high and was not met here.

 

                   Section
24(2)  requires that the evidence must have been ""obtained in a manner that
infringed"" the Charter . A sufficient relationship or connection
between the violation and the evidence is made out where, as here, the evidence
was obtained as a direct consequence of the violation of the Charter .

 

                   Finally,
the evidence, to be excluded, must be such that its admission would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. Respondent's right to counsel was
very seriously violated. The police officers simply ignored the rights they had
read to him and his expressed desire to exercise the right to silence and the
right to counsel. Their action was not justified by any urgency. The evidence,
too, was self‑incriminatory: its use following a denial of the right to
counsel will generally go to the very fairness of the trial and thus will
generally bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The admission of
the evidence, in light of the seriousness of the violation and the effect of
the evidence on the fairness of the trial, could not be justified on the ground
that the offence involved was serious and that respondent's guilt was clearly
established by the statement sought to be excluded.

Facts

 

2.                On
October 26, 1982, there was a robbery at a Mac's Milk store in Toronto.
According to the store owner and an employee, the robber was armed with a gun
and a knife and he wore a grey sweat‑shirt with a hood. The store owner
and the employee could not positively identify the gun, the knife or the sweat‑shirt
found in the car driven by the respondent at the time of his arrest, except to
say that the sweat‑shirt was similar in colour. An eyewitness saw a man
running from the store to a car, and he noted the licence number of the car.
The car had been stolen a few hours previously.

 

3.                On
October 28, two days after the robbery, police officers MacIver and Train,
acting on information received, attended at E & R Simonizing on Caledonia
Road in Toronto at around 1:30 p.m. Both officers were in plain clothes. At
approximately 2:33 p.m., the respondent drove up to the premises in a car which
answered the description of the stolen car used in the armed robbery.

 

4.                The
respondent left the car and proceeded to the office premises where Train was
waiting. MacIver, who had been waiting in the parking lot, investigated the
car. He saw a gun butt protruding from under the driver's seat. He put the gun
into his hip pocket, and he then followed the respondent into the office. When
the respondent entered the office, Train greeted him with ""Hi Ron"".
The respondent asked ""Do I know you?"" At that stage, both officers
identified themselves as police officers and showed the respondent their
badges. They searched and handcuffed the respondent.

 

5.                At
2:40 p.m., Train arrested the respondent for theft and possession of the stolen
car and for the armed robbery of the Mac's Milk store. He read him his rights
from a card which was issued to all police officers when the Charter  was
proclaimed. The card from which the constable read stated as follows:

 

 

 

CHARTER
OF RIGHTS 

 

1.  NOTICE
UPON ARREST

 

I am arresting you for         
(briefly describe reasons for arrest)

 

2.  RIGHT
TO COUNSEL

 

It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay.

 

Do you understand?

 

                                       CAUTION TO
CHARGED PERSON

 

You (are charged, will be charged) with         
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? You are not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say may be given in
evidence.

 

                           SECONDARY CAUTION TO
CHARGED PERSON

 

If you have spoken to any police officer or to anyone
with authority or if any such person has spoken to you in connection with this
case, I want it clearly understood that I do not want it to influence you in
making any statement.

 

6.                The
respondent made a flippant remark at the reading of the caution and the right
to counsel to the effect that ""It sounds like an American T.V.
program"". Train re‑read the whole card to the respondent and, at
that time, the respondent said: 

 

                   Prove it. I ain't saying anything
until I see my lawyer. I want to see my lawyer.

 

7.                MacIver
then questioned the respondent as follows:

 

Q.  What is your full name?

 

A. Ronald Charles Manninen.

 

Q. Where is your address?

 

A. Ain't got one.

 

Q. Where is the knife that you had along with this
(showing the respondent the CO2 gun found in the car) when you
ripped off the Mac's Milk on Wilson Avenue?

 

A. He's lying. When I was in the store I only had
the gun. The knife was in the tool box in the car.

 

This
last answer was relied on by the trial judge in convicting the respondent on
the charge of armed robbery.

 

8.                MacIver
then returned to the car where he found two knives and the grey sweat‑shirt.
While MacIver was out of the room, Train asked the respondent the following
questions:

 

Q. What is your business here, Ron?

 

A. (No response.)

 

Q. Do you know someone that works here?

 

A. No. Why?

 

Q. Why did you come to this place?

 

A. (No response.)

 

MacIver
returned to the office, showed the respondent the two knives he had found in
the car and had the following conversation with the respondent:

 

Q. What are these for?

 

A. What the fuck do you think they are for? Are you
fucking stupid?

 

Q. You tell me what they are for, and is this
yours? (showing the grey sweat‑top)

 

A. Of course it's mine. You fuckers are really
stupid. Don't bother me anymore. I'm not saying anything until I see my lawyer.
Just fuck off. You fuckers have to prove it.

 

9.                Train
had gone out on MacIver's return to check the trunk of the car and he stated
that he had not heard the respondent repeat that he was not saying anything until
he saw his lawyer.

 

10.              There
was an operating telephone in the small office where the respondent was
arrested and the police officers used it in the course of the afternoon. The
respondent did not make a direct request to use the telephone and the police
officers did not volunteer the use of the telephone to the respondent. The
trial judge made the following finding:

 

                   I find the police had no desire to
have him call a lawyer, and intended to call a lawyer back at the station when
the arrest was completed.

 

The
respondent did not speak to his lawyer until the lawyer called him at the
police station at 8:35 p.m. 

 

Judgments

 

County
Court

 

11.              At
his trial, the respondent sought the exclusion of the statements under s. 24(2) 
of the Charter  on the basis that his right to counsel under s. 10 (b)
had been infringed. Trotter Co. Ct. J. held a voir dire to determine the
admissibility of the statements. He held that, even if the right to counsel had
been infringed, the admission of the statements would not bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. Accordingly, he admitted the
statements and he relied upon those statements in convicting the respondent of
armed robbery and use of a fire‑arm while committing an indictable
offence.

 

Ontario
Court of Appeal

 

12.              In
a unanimous judgment delivered by MacKinnon A.C.J.O., the Ontario Court of
Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal, quashed the convictions and directed a
new trial on those charges: (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 193.

 

13.              The
Court first held that the conduct of the police officers had seriously
infringed the respondent's rights under s. 10 (b) of the Charter .
The respondent clearly asserted his right to remain silent and his desire to
consult his lawyer, but the police officer ignored that assertion and commenced
questioning him. There was a telephone immediately at hand, and no urgency or
emergency that would justify the failure to make it available to the
respondent. The conduct of the police officers was such as to render the reading
to the respondent of his Charter  rights a mere ritual without
significance or meaning.

 

14.              The
breach of the respondent's rights was described by the Court as wilful and
deliberate. There was no quality of inadvertance or ignorance, and no
suggestion of emergency or urgency. The disregard of the respondent's right to
consult counsel had devastating consequences for him. The evidence should be
excluded, even though the offence was a serious one and the respondent's guilt
was clearly established by his answer.

 

15.              The
Court allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. It ordered a new trial on
the basis that there was some other evidence to support the convictions.

 

The Law

 

16.              Section
24(2)  of the Charter  provides:

 

                   24. ...

 

                   (2) Where, in proceedings under
subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that
infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter , the
evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the
circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.

 

17.              As
I indicated in my judgment in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p.
276, there are three prerequisites to the exclusion of evidence under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter :

 

(1)  that the applicant's rights or freedoms, as                                                    guaranteed
by the Charter , have been       infringed or denied,

 

(2)  that the evidence was obtained in a manner                                                 that
infringed or denied any rights or           freedoms guaranteed by the Charter ,
and

 

(3)  that, having regard to all the                                                                        circumstances,
the admission of the            evidence in the proceedings would bring the                        administration
of justice into disrepute.

 

1. Violation
of the Right to Counsel

 

18.              Section
10 (b) of the Charter  provides:

 

                   10. Everyone has
the right on arrest or detention

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay
and to be informed of that right; . . .

 

19.              It
is not disputed that the respondent was informed of his right to retain and
instruct counsel without delay. Further, the sufficiency of the communication
is not challenged.

 

20.              The
respondent's comment on being informed of his right to counsel was:

 

                   Prove it. I ain't saying anything
until I see my lawyer. I want to see my lawyer.

 

Since
there could hardly be a clearer assertion of the desire to exercise the right
to counsel, it is not necessary in this appeal to decide whether an arrested or
detained person is required to positively assert his right to counsel before a
correlative obligation is imposed on the police.

 

21.              In
my view, s. 10 (b) imposes at least two duties on the police in addition
to the duty to inform the detainee of his rights. First, the police must
provide the detainee with a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay. The detainee is in the control of
the police and he cannot exercise his right to counsel unless the police
provide him with a reasonable opportunity to do so. This aspect of the right to
counsel was recognized in Canadian law well before the advent of the Charter .
In Brownridge v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 926, a case decided under the Canadian
Bill of Rights, Laskin J., as he then was, wrote at pp. 952‑53:

 

The right to retain and instruct counsel without delay
can only have meaning to an arrested or detained person if it is taken as
raising a correlative obligation upon the police authorities to facilitate
contact with counsel. This means allowing him upon his request to use the
telephone for that purpose if one is available.

 

The duty
to facilitate contact with counsel has been consistently acknowledged under s.
10 (b) of the Charter  by the lower courts: R. v. Nelson
(1982), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 147 (Man. Q.B.); R. v. Anderson (1984), 10 C.C.C.
(3d) 417 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Dombrowski (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 164 (Sask.
C.A.), and the Ontario Court of Appeal in this case. In Dombrowski, the
Court held that, where a telephone is available at an earlier occasion, there
is no justification for delaying the opportunity to contact counsel until
arrival at the police station.

 

22.              In
my view, this aspect of the right to counsel was clearly infringed in this
case. The respondent clearly asserted his right to remain silent and his desire
to consult his lawyer. There was a telephone immediately at hand in the office,
which the officers used for their own purposes. It was not necessary for the
respondent to make an express request to use the telephone. The duty to
facilitate contact with counsel included the duty to offer the respondent the
use of the telephone. Of course, there may be circumstances in which it is
particularly urgent that the police continue with an investigation before it is
possible to facilitate a detainee's communication with counsel. There was no
urgency in the circumstances surrounding the offences in this case.

 

23.              Further,
s. 10(b) imposes on the police the duty to cease questioning or
otherwise attempting to elicit evidence from the detainee until he has had a
reasonable opportunity to retain and instruct counsel. The purpose of the right
to counsel is to allow the detainee not only to be informed of his rights and
obligations under the law but, equally if not more important, to obtain advice
as to how to exercise those rights. In this case, the police officers correctly
informed the respondent of his right to remain silent and the main function of
counsel would be to confirm the existence of that right and then to advise him
as to how to exercise it. For the right to counsel to be effective, the
detainee must have access to this advice before he is questioned or otherwise
required to provide evidence. I discussed the duty imposed on the police in the
context of a breathalyzer demand in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613,
at p. 624:

 

                   I do not want to be taken here as
giving an exhaustive definition of the s. 10(b) rights and will limit my
comments in that respect to what is strictly required for the disposition of
this case. In my view, s. 10(b) requires at least that the authorities
inform the detainee of his rights, not prevent him in any way from exercising
them and, where a detainee is required to provide evidence which may be
incriminating and refusal to comply is punishable as a criminal offence, as is
the case under s. 235 of the Code, s. 10(b) also imposes a
duty not to call upon the detainee to provide that evidence without first
informing him of his s. 10(b) rights and providing him with a reasonable
opportunity and time to retain and instruct counsel. [Emphasis added.]

 

This
passage was cited by Wilson J. in Clarkson v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
383, at p. 394, in the context of confessions, and I agree that this duty is
equally applicable in that context. The Ontario Court of Appeal came to the
same conclusion in Anderson, supra, and in R. v. Esposito
(1985), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 88, at p. 97:

 

If the suspect states that he wishes to retain counsel
all questioning must cease until he has been afforded the opportunity of
consulting counsel.... 

 

24.              This
aspect of the respondent's right to counsel was clearly infringed in the
circumstances of this case. Immediately after the respondent's clear assertion
of his right to remain silent and his desire to consult his lawyer, the police
officer commenced his questioning as if the respondent had expressed no such
desire. Again, there may be circumstances in which it is particularly urgent
that the police proceed with their questioning of the detainee before providing
him with a reasonable opportunity to retain and instruct counsel, but there was
no such urgency in this case.

 

25.              The
Crown contends that there was no infringement of the right to counsel because
the respondent had waived his right by answering the police officer's
questions. While a person may implicitly waive his rights under s. 10(b),
the standard will be very high (Clarkson, supra, at pp. 394‑95).
In my view, the respondent's conduct did not constitute an implied waiver of
his right to counsel. It seems that he did not intend to waive his right, as he
clearly asserted it at the beginning and at the end of the questioning. Rather,
the form of the questioning was such as to elicit involuntary answers. The
police officer asked two innocuous questions followed by a baiting question
which led the respondent to incriminate himself. In addition, where a detainee
has positively asserted his desire to exercise his right to counsel and the
police have ignored his request and have proceeded to question him, he is
likely to feel that his right has no effect and that he must answer. Finally, the
respondent had the right not to be asked questions, and he must not be held to
have implicitly waived that right simply because he answered the questions.
Otherwise, the right not to be asked questions would only exist where the
detainee refused to answer and, thus, where there is no need for any remedy or
exclusionary rule.

 

26.              For
these reasons, I would conclude that the respondent's rights under s. 10(b)
were infringed.

 

2.                Relationship
Between the Violation and the Evidence

 

27.              Section
24(2)  requires that the evidence must have been ""obtained in a manner that
infringed"" the Charter . There must thus be some relationship or
connection between the violation and the evidence. In my view, a sufficient
relationship or connection is obviously made out where, as in this case, the
evidence was obtained as a direct consequence of the violation of the Charter 
(Therens, supra, at pp. 621‑22 per Estey J., at p.
624 per Lamer J. and at p. 649 per Le Dain J.) It is not
necessary to define with any greater precision the nature of the relationship
or connection required.

 

3.                Bringing
the Administration of Justice into                     Disrepute

 

28.              The
final requirement for the exclusion of the evidence is that the admission of
the evidence in the proceedings must bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. The Court discussed the nature of that inquiry, the guidelines to be
followed and the factors to be considered in its recent decision in R. v.
Collins, supra, and I need only apply that discussion to the facts
of this case.

 

29.              The
first point that must be made is that the violation of the respondent's right
to counsel was very serious. The respondent clearly asserted his right to
remain silent and to consult his lawyer. There was a telephone at hand. There
was no urgency which would justify the immediate questioning or the denial of
the opportunity to contact his lawyer. In effect, the police officers simply
ignored the rights they had read to him and his assertion of the right to
silence and the right to counsel. The Ontario Court of Appeal characterized
this violation as ""wilful and deliberate"" and as an ""open and
flagrant disregard of the [respondent's] rights"", and I fully agree.

 

30.              Further,
the evidence obtained was self‑incriminatory. As I stated in Collins,
supra, the use of self‑incriminatory evidence obtained following a
denial of the right to counsel will generally go to the very fairness of the
trial and thus will generally bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

31.              It
is true that the offence was a serious one and that the respondent's guilt is
clearly established by the statement sought to be excluded, but that cannot
justify the admission of the evidence in light of the seriousness of the
violation and the effect of the evidence on the fairness of the trial.

 

Conclusion

 

32.              I
agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal that the evidence should have been
excluded and, for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal, I agree that a new
trial should be ordered on the charges of armed robbery and use of a fire‑arm
while committing an indictable offence.

 

33.              I
would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft—Possession of stolen
goods—Doctrine of recent possession—No evidence establishing date of the
theft—Trial judge’s finding of fact regarding date of theft unreasonable—Charge
to jury—Whether trial judge erred in law regarding recency—Criteria to
establish recent possession—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended, s.
312(1).

Appellant was charged of illegal possession
of a stolen “safety standards certificate” contrary to s. 312(1)  of the Criminal
Code . The evidence adduced at trial indicated that (1) on June 3, 1977,
appellant presented the stolen certificate to a licence bureau and (2) the
certificate could have been stolen as far back as 50 to 55 weeks prior to that
date. There was no evidence of exactly when the certificate had been stolen.
The trial judge, however, after explaining the doctrine of recent possession to
the jury, instructed them that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the certificate was stolen on or about June 3, 1977, and that shortly after that
theft the certificate was in the possession of the appellant, they could find
the appellant guilty. The appellant was convicted and his appeal to the Court
of Appeal dismissed. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

The theft need not have happened on or about
June 3, 1977, for the possession on that date to be “recent”. Had the jury
acquitted, there was reversible error in the trial judge’s charge that the
Crown could have invoked successfully as regards recency. There was also, as a
matter of law, no evidence upon which the jury could predicate a finding,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the theft had taken place on or about June 3, 1977. The trial judge’s charge in
relation to the intricate facts and amounting to non-direction brought about an
unneces-

[Page 898]

sary and unreasonable finding of fact by the
jury which was itself, as a matter of law, wrong. It was incumbent upon him to
assist the jurors in their task of determining the time frame within which they
could, as a matter of law, establish the approximate moment of the theft. Here,
he should have directed them that, as a question of law, they could not determine
the moment of the theft as being more recent than some 50 weeks prior to June
3, 1977. Having done so, he should then have given them the usual instructions
as to how “recency” is to be determined.

R. v. Killam (1973),
12 C.C.C. (2d) 114, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing
appellant’s appeal from his conviction for possession of stolen property.
Appeal allowed.

Charles Ryall, for the appellant.

Bonnie J. Wein, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—The appellant was convicted by a jury
in the City of Welland of illegal possession of a stolen “Safety Standards
Certificate” the property of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
knowing that it had been obtained by theft contrary to s. 312(1)  of the Criminal
Code . He had also been tried at the same time but acquitted on another
count of the same indictment for having uttered a forged document; that count
related to the same document. He appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. That appeal was
dismissed without reasons. The appellant now comes to this Court on three
grounds.

One of these grounds should in my view succeed
and an Order for a new trial should ensue. Given the circumstances of the case,
I need not and do not intend to address the other two grounds. I will therefore
set out only those facts relevant to that ground which is framed by appellant
as follows:

Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that it was
not reversible error on the part of the

[Page 899]

Learned Trial Judge in inviting the jury,
in his charge, to consider the Doctrine of Recent Possession in the absence of
evidence establishing the date of the theft and, also, in finding that there
was sufficient circumstantial evidence establishing the date of theft without
providing reasons in terms of days, months, or years?

The facts, which became apparent during the
trial, were that the appellant on June 3, 1977 presented a Safety Standards Certificate, No. 2036898, to a licence
bureau for the purpose of effecting the transfer of ownership of a motor
vehicle from his father to himself. The certificate had been stolen from the
owner of a service station, one J.K., who was an authorized agent of the
Ministry of Transport and Communications of Ontario for the issuance of such
Safety Standards Certificates. The stolen certificate used by the appellant
contained forged signatures of qualified inspectors. J.K. became aware of the
theft of the certificate in the fall of 1977. There was no evidence of exactly
when the certificate had been stolen.

There is evidence that the station was in
possession of booklets of certificates since 1974. The booklets were purchased
by the station from the Government five at a time. Each booklet contained
twenty certificates. As the station proceeded to an average of two inspections
a week, each booklet lasted roughly ten weeks, and the batch of five, close to
a year. The certificates were numbered and used in order except the occasional
occurrence where a certificate would not be completed before one or two
consecutively numbered certificates would be; but this would be exceptional,
and would happen only when the owner of the automobile would leave his car at
the station longer than the time required for the inspection, usually a day,
and a subsequent inspection on another car would be made and the corresponding
certificate completed. In any event, this would have no bearing on the rate at
which the booklets would be used.

It was not until September 1977 that the
operator of the station noticed that four certificates were missing from the
book currently in use, that containing certificates numbered 3264861 to

[Page 900]

3264880. An investigation was carried out in
November and other certificates were found missing as far back as four
previously used booklets. It is difficult, upon a mere reading of the
transcript, and I imagine even more so a mere hearing of the evidence, to grasp
with some clarity the chronology of events, as the various booklets were not
introduced into evidence in an order that followed the chronology of their
probable use at the station, and, more important, of their arrival at the
station in batches.For convenience, I have numbered as 1 to 7 the booklets put
in evidence by the Crown and I have indicated the booklets from which there
were certificates stolen.

The evidence adduced at trial establishes that
there were 16 stolen certificate forms, one of which is the certificate bearing
number 2036898, the certificate relevant to this case.

As a first observation, one can see that the
stolen certificate in possession of appellant on the 3rd of June was from a
booklet that was in use in

[Page 901]

the weeks of May and June of 1977. Furthermore,
it is only in November that, following J.K.’s discovering in September that
four certificates had been stolen from booklet No. 7, the Government
investigation revealed the disappearance of the other certificates in booklets
that had been previously in use as far back as some 45 to 50 weeks prior to
September, when considering booklet No. 3, that from which the certificate in
this case was stolen.

It is therefore, in my view, evident that,
putting matters at best for the Crown’s case, the only certainty one can
reasonably have as regards the time-frame during which the theft could have
occurred is that it could have happened any time as of the moment of the
booklet’s arrival at the station and the moment that certificate would normally
come up for use.

The certificate would normally have been used,
considering its number, not long after the certificate issued on the 30th of
June. In any event we know that the theft must of necessity have occurred on or
prior to the 3rd of June, for it was on the 3rd of June tendered by appellant
to the licence bureau.

We do not know, at least the evidence does not
tell us so, when booklet No. 3 arrived at the station. So the only time limit
one can reasonably put to the time-frame running prior to the 3rd of June
during which the theft could have occurred is the approximate time of arrival
at the station of booklet No. 3. As the only evidence on that point is the fact
that the booklets arrived in batches of five coupled to the frequency of the
inspections, certificate 2036898 that was in possession of the appellant on the 3rd of June 1977 could have been stolen as
far back as 50 to 55 weeks prior to that date. Indeed no one said in Court that
booklet No. 1 (2036841 to 2036860) was the first booklet of the batch of five
that booklet No. 3 was part of, though one might be tempted to assume from the
numbers on the certificates of booklets No. 1 to No. 6 that this would be
so, and that the theft could have happened some 30 to 35 weeks earlier. But the
accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, and the determination of the
recency of his possession of the stolen certificate must be in

[Page 902]

regard of a theft that might have happened 50 to
55 weeks earlier.

The trial judge’s charge included instructions
on the doctrine of recent possession. He clearly and very accurately explained
to the jury the doctrine save that he did not in any way explain that it was
incumbent upon them to determine, granting the accused the benefit of any
reasonable doubt, the moment at which the theft took place and then apply to
that finding, and to the other factual findings they will have made, the
criteria that are used to establish whether a possession is “recent”, which
are, having regard to the nature of the object, “its rareness, the readiness in
which it can, and is likely to, pass from hand to hand, the ease of its
identification and the likelihood of transferability” (per Bull J.A., in
R. v. Killam (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 114 (B.C.C.A.) at p. 131) and
such other factors.

What the trial judge told them concerning
“recency” is contained in the following passage of his charge:

There is a doctrine which the Crown
referred to as the Doctrine of Recent Possession and, on a charge of having
possession of property, knowing that it was obtained by the commission in
Canada of an offence punishable by indictment, if it is proved that the
property has been stolen, and that, shortly after the theft, the property or
the stolen property was in possession of the accused person, such possession of
stolen property by the accused, if it’s unexplained, raises a presumption of
fact; not of law, but a presumption of fact, that the accused person committed
the offence of having possession of that stolen property, knowing that it was
stolen. And, upon such unexplained possession, a jury may, but not must, find
the accused person guilty. Now, I reiterate that you may, not necessarily must,
find the person guilty in the absence of an explanation.

…

Now, if, therefore, after considering all
of the evidence and the arguments of counsel and my charge, you come to the
conclusion that the prosecution has proved to your satisfaction, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the certificate was stolen from the place alleged on the
Third of June, 1977, and, shortly after that theft, the certificate was in the
possession of the accused, you may, although not must, in the absence of a
reasonable

[Page 903]

explanation, find the accused guilty of the
offence with which he is charged.

…

So, on the charge of possession, it is
incumbent upon the Crown to prove, firstly, that that certificate was stolen
and, secondly, that it was stolen on or about the Third day of June, 1977, and,
uh, that it was in the possession of the accused and the accused knew that it
was stolen. Those are the three ingredients that the Crown must prove.

The jury then put to the judge the following
question:

If the accused does not offer a reasonable
explanation of where he obtained the Safety Certificate, in law, give us an
explanation of whether or not it can, may or should be assumed that the accused
is guilty as charged.

Following this question, the trial judge
reiterated what he had said on the doctrine generally and, as regards recency,
then said the following:

Now, with regard to the second count, of
possession, let me just read it to you exactly as I gave it to you because I am
very careful not to ad-lib, it is too important, about the doctrine of recent
possession.

“On a charge of having possession of
property, knowing that it was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment,
if it is proved that the property has been stolen,”

and you don’t have to worry about that: we
know that the certificate was stolen. I don’t think the defense serviously [sic]
denys [sic] the fact that the certificate was stolen.

“…And that, shortly after the theft, the
stolen property was in the possession of the accused person, such person…”

Had the jury acquitted, there was, in my view,
reversible error in this charge that the Crown could have invoked successfully
as regards recency. Indeed the theft need not have happened on or about the 3rd
day of June 1977 for the possession on that date to be “recent”. But the jury
did not acquit, and therefore the question is whether appellant can invoke an
error which in effect appears to have resulted in the judge setting a higher
burden of proof on the Crown as a prerequisite to the doctrine applying? The
answer

[Page 904]

would clearly be no, were it not for the fact
that I find, as a matter of law, that there is no evidence upon which the jury
could predicate a finding that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the theft had taken
place on or about the 3rd day of June 1977. That finding, as I have indicated,
cannot be supported by the evidence. Whilst the initial error of law as regards
the Crown’s burden of proof cannot itself inure to the benefit of the accused,
other shortcomings of the judge’s charge in relation to the intricate facts and
amounting to non-direction brought about an unnecessary and unreasonable
finding of fact by the jury which was itself, as a matter of law, wrong; this
latter error should inure to the benefit of the appellant by causing the
conviction to be quashed, whilst the initial error should inure to the benefit
of the respondent by this appeal resulting not in an acquittal but in an order
for a new trial, for I am of the view that, though there was no evidence upon
which the jury could find that the theft had taken place on or about the 3rd of
June 1977, there was nonetheless evidence upon which the jury could well have
reasonably found the possession to be recent.

Though the trial was a short one, the facts were
very tricky, as illustrated by the few facts I refer to in this opinion. It
must be remembered that evidence was being adduced in support not only of the
charge of possession but also of a charge of uttering a forged document, for
the latter of which the accused was acquitted. On this charge recency of
possession was also an important factor in determining whether the appellant
knew that the document he was using was a forgery. But the relevant evidence to
that end was quite different as it related not so much to the moment of the
theft but rather and mainly to the moment at which the forgery could not have
occurred without the knowledge of the accused. I need not consider the matter
in detail as the verdict of acquittal on that count is not under appeal. Be it
sufficient that I illustrate the matter by the following. The certificate
tendered by the appellant contained on the

[Page 905]

face of it the following notice which was in large
print:


 
  
  NOTICE:
  
  
  THE MINISTRY CANNOT TRANSFER A PERMIT ON THE
  BASIS OF A CERTIFICATE THAT WAS MADE MORE THAN 36 DAYS BEFORE THE DATE OF
  APPLICATION.
  
 


It also contained an odometer reading indicating
11,983, probably miles, as the vehicle was a 1971 model. These two facts are
very relevant in relation to the time span during which the certificate could
not have been forged without the appellant knowing it, but of very little, if
of any, relevance in determining the moment of the theft. Relevant to both charges,
recency of possession by appellant was to be computed for one charge (uttering)
in relation to the moment it could or could not have been forged without his
knowledge and, for the other (possession), in relation to the moment of the
theft.

The trial judge did not in any way relate the
facts to those different issues and warn the jury of the different time factors
applicable to each of the two counts; nor did he refer to the limitation, which
I have alluded to earlier, that one must of necessity put to the probative
value of the evidence when establishing the moment of the theft of the
certificate. All he said of the facts is the following:

Now, I don’t think, ladies and gentlemen,
that I have to review the evidence. The evidence is quite clear.

Mr. Kelly gave evidence that he owned this
inspection station, that he noticed that there were some certificates taken
from the book. He reported it to the inspector who came down. Mr. Kelly’s
evidence shows that, I think sufficiently, that the instrument that we are
concerned about here, Safety Standards Certificate #6898, was stolen from his
place of business.

Mr. Aliberti and Mr. Turner say that the
signatures on that certificate are not theirs. You recall it was I think either
Mr. Turner or Mr. Aliberti said that it couldn’t have been at the Canadian Tire
Station because at that time they were not in business and it couldn’t

[Page 906]

have been at A.J. Hecker’s because he had
ceased to do business before the First of June, and that the Canadian Tire
Store didn’t start its inspection until sometime around the Twelfth of June.

You will recall the evidence of the lady
who owned the agency where licenses are transferred, that the accused came into
her premises and had the car changed over, that he signed his name as
purchaser. The accused doesn’t deny this because he says in his statement that
he went to her place with the Safety Standards Certificate and got a transfer
of the Toyota car, using this
Safety Standards Certificate, from his father’s name into his. The issue still
remains, with regard to Count #2, whether or not he knew that that was a stolen
Safety Standards Certificate.

With respect, I am of the view that it was
incumbent upon the trial judge to assist the jurors in their difficult task by
determining the timeframe within which they could, as a matter of law,
establish the approximate moment of the theft; in fact, given the particular
facts of this case and the fact that the trial was proceeding on two counts, he
should have directed them that, as a question of law, they could not determine
the moment of the theft as being more recent than some 50 weeks prior to the
3rd of June, 1977. Having done so he should then have given them the usual
instructions as to how “recency” is to be determined.

I am not in the least unmindful of the fact that
the trial judge’s task was not made the easier by the nature of the evidence
tendered and the manner in which it was adduced and argued. But I am
nevertheless unable to come to the conclusion that, had he addressed those
issues as I think he should have, a jury could not reasonably have acquitted.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and order a new trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NEW
BRUNSWICK

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Proof required to
indicate accused’s membership in a conspiracy before hearsay exception becomes
applicable—Charge to jury—Criminal Code , s. 423(1) (d).

Criminal law—Evidence—Hearsay—Conspirators’
exception—Proof required to indicate accused’s membership in a conspiracy
before hearsay exception becomes applicable.

Respondent was acquitted of the charge of
conspiring to import a narcotic even though there was evidence upon which the
jury could have found him guilty. The Court of Appeal upheld this acquittal.
This appeal is to determine if the trial judge properly instructed the jury on
the standard of proof required to prove the membership of a party in a
conspiracy in order to permit reliance upon the conspirators’ exception to the
hearsay rule.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

In order to convict an accused upon a charge
of conspiracy, the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that (1)
the conspiracy existed and (2) the accused was a member of it. In deciding the
issue of membership, the hearsay exception may be relied upon only after direct
evidence against the accused raises the probability of the accused’s membership
in the conspiracy. Here, the trial judge directed that proof beyond a
reasonable doubt was required when conspiracy was at issue, but did not
indicate that a lesser standard of proof could apply regarding the preliminary
issue of membership in the conspiracy as it relates to the application of the
hearsay exception. The jury, in effect, was left with the direction that the
more onerous standard applied before the hearsay exception could be relied
upon.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for New
Brunswick (1980), 31 N.B.R. (2d) 371, 75 A.P.R. 371, dismissing a Crown appeal
from an acquittal on a charge of conspiring to import a narcotic contrary to
s. 423(2) (d) of the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed.

S.R. Fainstein, for the appellant.

J.C. Letcher (amicus curiae), for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal raises the question of
what standard of proof is required on the issue of an accused’s membership in a
conspiracy before what is known as the “conspirators’ exception” to the hearsay
rule may be brought into play to make admissible against the accused the acts
and declarations of his fellow-conspirators performed or made in pursuance of
the conspiracy.

The respondent was tried along with one Gauvin
before judge and jury on an indictment which provided:

ROBERT JAMES CARTER and FIDELE ARMAND
GAUVIN stand charged that between the 1st day of August, A.D., 1978 and the 1st
day of November, A.D., 1978, both dates inclusive, at or near Dieppe in the
County of Westmorland and Province of New Brunswick they unlawfully did
conspire together, the one with the other, and with Robert Hatto and Charles
Allum of Roxbury in the state of Massachusetts, U.S.A., and with others
unknown, to commit the indictable offence of importation into Canada of a
narcotic, to wit: Cannabis (marihuana), contrary to section 5,
subsection 1 of the Narcotic Control Act of Canada and amendments thereto,
thereby committing an offence contrary to section 423(1) (d) of the
Criminal Code  of Canada and amendments thereto.

The Crown’s theory was that the marihuana was to
be imported into Canada from
the United States. The
respondent was to provide the neces-

[Page 940]

sary funds and vehicles to be used as transport.
Gauvin was to make the contacts and arrange the purchase in the United States. Allum (unindicted) was to
find sources of drugs in the United States, and Hatto (also unindicted) was to be engaged in bringing the
drugs into Canada. Evidence was
led by the Crown of: extensive movement of two motor vehicles kept under
suveillance by the police; the interception of telephone conversations between
the various alleged conspirators; trips to the United States by the
conspirators; the obtaining of sums of American currency by Carter; and the
detention of one of the motor vehicles in which was found a concealed
compartment containing traces of marihuana. In sum, there was evidence upon
which a properly instructed jury could have returned a verdict of guilt. The
jury, however, acquitted the respondent and the Court of Appeal dismissed the
Crown’s appeal. The Crown appealed to this Court by leave. The respondent
Carter, although given notice of these proceedings, did not participate in the
appeal[1], but
the Attorney General for New Brunswick arranged for the appearance of an amicus curiae, who filed a
factum on behalf of the respondent and advanced argument in this Court.

The trial judge, after giving the jury
instructions on the general nature of the crime of conspiracy, to which no
exception was taken before us, said:

And so, you are going to have to face the
problem of saying “Was Robert Carter a party to a conspiracy?” “Was Fidele
Gauvin a party to a conspiracy?” And you are going to have to keep separate,
evidence which applies to Robert Carter, and evidence which applies to Fidele
Gauvin.

I am going to ask you to consider your
verdict in stages. First of all, the first question you are going to have to
ask yourself, does the evidence convince you that there was a conspiracy to
import marihuana. Not that these people were party to it, but was there a conspiracy,

[Page 941]

which led up to the facts you have heard
and the events you have heard, to import marihuana.

If you decide there was an agreement among
somebody to do it, then the next question, “Was Robert Carter a party to that
conspiracy? Was he a part of the agreement?” And separately, “Was Fidele Gauvin
a party to the agreement?” As I have said you may find both not guilty or one
guilty and one innocent, or both guilty. Because if you believe that they did
acts [sic] or that they did agree you are going to have to reach that
conclusion from a variety of individual acts.

If you decide “Yes” to all those questions.
“Yes, there was a conspiracy”, “Yes, Robert Carter was a party to it”, and “Yes
Fidele Gauvin was a party to it”. Then and only then, may you consider evidence
of acts by Robert Carter and words by Robert Carter as evidence against Fidele
Gauvin, or vice versa.

Later he said:

And so we have ruled and do rule that much
of what was said by one is not evidence against the other. Much of what is done
by one or the other in the absence of the other party is not evidence against
the absent party. Unless you find that there was a conspiracy, that each was a
party to the conspiracy, and then, any act done by one or anything said by one
in furtherance of that conspiracy is evidence against the other. But to reach
that stage you must first ask yourself those three questions, otherwise, all
the evidence is going to have to be kept in compartments, some applying to
Robert Carter, some applying to Fidele Gauvin.

These directions were attacked by the appellant.
In the Court of Appeal, it was argued that the effect of the trial judge’s
words was to instruct the jury that the Crown was required to prove, beyond a
reasonable doubt, membership of the respondent in the conspiracy in order to
permit reliance upon the conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule. This, it
was said, was an error in law imposing upon the Crown a heavier burden of proof
on that issue than is required. Limerick J.A., speaking for the Court, was of
the view that some authorities required proof of an accused’s membership in the
conspiracy on a prima facie basis. He considered that prima facie in
relation to proof of facts under the

[Page 942]

Criminal Code  meant
“proof beyond a reasonable doubt unless displaced by further evidence or other
evidence which raises a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused”. He
referred to R. v. Proud-lock, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525, where, after saying
that an accused in criminal proceedings must prove any matter in respect of
which he bore the burden of proof by a balance of probability, Pigeon J. said
[at pp. 548-49]:

Such is not the situation when all the
presumption does is to establish a prima facie case. The burden of proof
does not shift. The accused does not have to “establish” a defence or an
excuse, all he has to do is to raise a reasonable doubt. If there is nothing in
the evidence adduced by the Crown from which a reasonable doubt can arise, then
the accused will necessarily have the burden of adducing evidence if he is to
escape conviction.

Limerick J.A. then noted that the respondent
Carter did not testify on his own behalf and, accordingly, failed to rebut any prima
facie case made out against him by the Crown. He said, as well [at
p. 376]:

If they did consider that evidence against
Carter [the evidence of the acts and declarations of other conspirators] there
is no merit in this ground of appeal as the suggested correction in the charge
would not have altered the verdict of the jury. If on the other hand, the jury
did not consider the acts and words of Gauvin and Allum in furtherance of the
conspiracy, particularly the telephone conversations between them, as evidence
against the respondent, the verdict of not guilty can only mean that the jury did
not consider the Crown had established a prima facie case against the
respondent.

In this Court only one point was taken and it
was expressed in these words in the Crown’s factum.

This case raises the following question:
“Where an accused is charged with a conspiracy, what degree of proof must be
adduced that he and a particular actor or declarant were both involved in that
conspiracy, before the latter’s acts or declarations are admissible against
him?”

The Crown argued that where the existence of a
conspiracy had been shown proof of the member-

[Page 943]

ship of an accused, to permit reliance upon the
conspirators’ hearsay exception, required only some evidence of membership
directly admissible against him. The proposition was stated in the Crown factum
in these words:

It is respectfully submitted that the only
precondition that must be satisfied before the trier of fact is entitled to
consider the acts and declarations of co-conspirators of the accused, against
that accused, is that it can be said of each of them, that some evidence has
been adduced against him, independent of the acts and declarations of others
which tends to show that he was involved in the conspiracy.

The amicus curiae, while contending that
no special form of words was required to charge the jury on this point,
recognized that the Crown had a lesser burden than that of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt in establishing membership in a conspiracy. He argued,
however, that the jury had been adequately directed on this issue, saying in
his factum:

The jury in the case at bar were clearly
instructed by the trial judge that before they could consider the acts or
declarations of Carter and/or Gauvin as evidence against the other, they must
find; (a) that there was a conspiracy and (b) that each was a member of that
conspiracy by independent evidence against him. And (without using legal
terminology) only then would the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule
operate.

There was therefore no error in this respect and
the Crown’s appeal should fail. On this background the issue finds its way
here.

There are many expositions of the conspirators’
exception to the hearsay rule which attempt to resolve the logical problem
inherent in its application. The problem may be simply stated. Where an accused
is charged with the crime of conspiracy, proof of his agreement in the illegal
design alleged, that is, his participation or membership in the conspiracy, is
sufficient for a conviction. The conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule
may be applied to afford evidence of the accused’s membership through acts and
declarations of fellow members of the conspiracy performed and made in

[Page 944]

pursuance of the objects of the conspiracy. The
exception, however, depends on the preliminary fact of membership in the same
conspiracy. Membership must therefore be proven before the exception is
operative. Since membership is the gist of the offence, however, once that is
proven the hearsay exception appears to be unnecessary.

It is only if the preliminary proof of
membership is on a standard less than the ordinary standard in criminal cases
that this exception can be brought into operation without, at the same time,
disposing of the final issue in the matter. Once the membership has been
established on a lesser burden, then the hearsay evidence made admissible by
the application of the exception may be considered by the trier of fact on the
issue of proof of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. While the rule in
general terms is simple to state, the difficulty arises in its practical
application. Who should make the preliminary finding of membership, and what
standard of proof is appropriate at that stage?

In attempting to deal with this question, judges
are confronted, on the one hand, with the well‑settled rule that
recognizes the agency principle in connection with conspiracy at criminal law,
but must, nonetheless, be deeply sensible of the grave injustice which could
result from the application of the conspirators* exception to the hearsay rule
to a person not, in fact, shown to be a member of the conspiracy. The approach
generally adopted has been to take the matter in two stages, and to require a
determination in the case of each accused of the issue of his membership in the
conspiracy, on the basis of evidence directly admissible against him before
permitting the application of the exception in order to reach a determination
of the larger issue of his guilt, or innocence, on the charge in the
indictment.

It has been suggested that a clear distinction
between the two stages be maintained by appropriating to the trial judge the
function of determining this preliminary question of fact: see Carbo v.
United States, 314 F. 2d 718 (1963). In this way,

[Page 945]

after a voir dire the trial judge rules
on the question and either excludes the operation of the exception or directs
the jury to apply it. This method has not found favour in Canada and has not been adopted. It was
rejected by Martin J.A. in Hobart et al. v. R. (1982), 25 C.R. (3d) 214,
where he said, speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, at pp. 228-29:

Faced with the inherent difficulty posed by
the coincidence of the preliminary fact upon which the admissibility against an
accused of acts and declarations of alleged co‑conspirators depends, and
the ultimate issue, some American courts have evolved a somewhat different
approach, which is exemplified in the decision of the United States Court of
Appeals, Ninth Circuit, in Carbo v. U.S. (1963), 314 F. (2d) 718.

Under this approach the judge determines
the admissibility of the declarations of alleged co-conspirators in furtherance
of the conspiracy. The judge admits the declarations as evidence if he is
satisfied that, accepting the independent evidence as credible, a prima facie
case (that is, one which would support a finding that the accused was a
participant in the conspiracy) has been made out. Thereafter, it is the jury’s
function to determine whether the evidence, including the declarations, is
credible and convincing beyond a reasonable doubt (p. 737). As I understand the
rule, once the judge decides that a prima facie case has been made out by
independent evidence (evidence other than the declarations of alleged
co-conspirators), the independent evidence and the hearsay declarations of
alleged co-conspirators are submitted to the jury on an equal footing, without
any direction that the jury must find from the independent evidence that the
accused was a party to the conspiracy before using the declarations of alleged
co‑conspirators against him.

The approach in Carbo v. U.S.,
supra, has the apparent advantage of greatly simplifying the judge’s charge.
That advantage may, however, be more apparent than real and may only serve to
conceal the underlying and intractable problem.

Moreover, the perceived simplicity of the
Carbo approach is, in my view, counterbalanced by the fact that the jury is
deprived of the assistance of the judge in sorting out the evidence directly
admissible against an accused and consequently, are left free to connect the
accused with the conspiracy by hearsay evidence.

Although the rule adopted in Carbo does
not prevent the judge from separating the evidence directly admissible against
the accused from the acts and declarations

[Page 946]

of alleged co-conspirators, such an
exercise is meaningless where the evidence directly admissible against an
accused and the hearsay acts and declarations of alleged co‑conspirators
go to the jury on the same basis; such a separation is contrary to the entire
approach in that case.

It is true, of course, that under the rule
propounded in Carbo v. U.S., supra, the accused has the protection that
the judge has already determined that there is sufficient independent evidence
to support a finding by the jury that the accused was a party to the
conspiracy. The jury may, nonetheless, find the independent evidence sparse and
quite unconvincing, and use a hearsay declaration of apparently devastating
force to connect the accused with the conspiracy.

I am in agreement with Martin J.A. in his
rejection of the voir dire approach. I also agree with the concluding
comment, quoted from his judgment in Hobart above, to the effect that
the jury, despite the fact that the purpose of the Carbo approach is to
separate the two issues, might well confuse the two and use the hearsay
declarations to connect the accused with the conspiracy. The same danger, of
course, applies where the jury must make this preliminary finding of membership
in the conspiracy. They may equate proof of membership for the limited purpose
of the application of the hearsay exception with proof of guilt of the accused
upon the indictment. For this reason, it is my opinion that extreme care must
be taken to keep the two issues separate and this involves the preservation of
a two-stage approach in the charge to the jury.

The trial judge must bear in mind that in order
to convict an accused upon a charge of conspiracy the jury, or other trier of
fact, must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy alleged
in the indictment existed, and that the accused was a member of it. In deciding
the issue of membership for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence on
the charge contained in the indictment, the hearsay exception may be brought
into effect, but only where there is some evidence of the accused’s membership
in the conspiracy directly admissible against him without reliance upon the
hearsay exception raising the probability

[Page 947]

of his membership. It is not necessary that the
directly admissible evidence be adduced first before any evidence of the acts
and declarations of other conspirators may be received. The exigencies of the
trial would make a chronological separation of the evidence impossible. At the
end of the day, however, before the hearsay exception may apply, such evidence
on the threshold issue of membership of the accused in the conspiracy must be
present. In charging the jury on this question, the trial judge should instruct
them to consider whether on all the evidence they are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed. If they
are not satisfied, then the accused charged with participation in the
conspiracy must be acquitted. If, however, they conclude that a conspiracy as
alleged did exist, they must then review the evidence and decide whether, on
the basis of the evidence directly receivable against the accused, a
probability is raised that he was a member of the conspiracy. If this
conclusion is reached, they then become entitled to apply hearsay exception and
consider evidence of the acts and declarations performed and made by the co‑conspirators
in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy as evidence against the accused
on the issue of his guilt. This evidence, taken with the other evidence, may be
sufficient to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was a
member of the conspiracy and that he is accordingly guilty. They should be
told, however, that this ultimate determination is for them alone and that the
mere fact that they have found sufficient evidence directly admissible against
the accused to enable them to consider his participation in the conspiracy
probable, and to apply the hearsay exception, does not make a conviction
automatic. They should be clearly told that it is only after they have become
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence on both
issues, that is, the existence of the conspiracy and the accused’s membership
in it, that they may convict, and that it is open to them, if they think it
right or if they are not satisfied, to acquit the accused, even after reaching
their initial determination of probable membership in the conspiracy which
enabled the application of the hearsay exception. The trial judge should point
out to the jury, as well, the evidence directly admissible

[Page 948]

against the accused on the threshold issue of
his membership in the conspiracy to assist them in that determination. In my
view, this approach is generally consistent with the approach adopted by Martin
J.A. in R. v. Baron and Wertman (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 525, and Hobart
v. R., supra, in which case the general principles involved in the
treatment of this question are set out and discussed and the authorities are
collected.

Turning to the case at bar, it is my opinion
that the trial judge in his charge left with the jury the idea that they would
have to be satisfied, according to the ordinary criminal standard of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, on the preliminary issue of membership of the
accused in the conspiracy. In this, he imposed upon the Crown a higher burden
of proof on the issue than that required by law. He charged the jury early in
his charge on the general requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and in
the extract from his charge, reproduced above, he used the expression “does the
evidence convince you that there was a conspiracy”. This referred, of course,
to the existence of the conspiracy but, in going on to deal with the question
of Carter’s membership in the conspiracy, he gave no indication that any lesser
standard of proof could apply and, in my view, the effect of this omission,
taken with the earlier instruction on the general requirement for proof beyond
a reasonable doubt, was that the jury were left with the direction to apply the
reasonable doubt standard on this preliminary issue of membership. In my
opinion, the jury was thus misinstructed and the Crown put to a standard of
proof greater than that required by law on the threshold issue of membership in
the conspiracy. I would, accordingly, allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

Appeal allowed and a new trial ordered.

Whether information supplied by applicant is privileged — Point in time when
solicitor-client relationship arises.

In order to obtain proof that an applicant for legal aid
committed an indictable offence by incorrectly reporting a lower income in
order to be eligible for such services, two peace officers presented themselves
at a legal aid bureau with a search warrant. This warrant related to certain
documents, including an «Application for Legal Aid» form which contained, inter alia, information on applicant's
financial situation. The search was made in the presence of the syndic of the
Bar and the police

[page 861]

officers agreed to receive the documents in a sealed
envelope without examining them. Appellants' application for certiorari to quash the seizure on the
ground that the documents seized were protected by solicitor-client privilege
was dismissed both in the Superior Court and in the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

All information which a person must provide in order
to obtain legal advice and which is given in confidence for that purpose enjoys
the privileges attached to confidentiality. This confidentiality attaches to
all communications made within the framework of the solicitor-client
relationship, to the lawyer as well as to his employees. It arises even before
the retainer is established, as soon as the client takes the first steps in
approaching a law firm. It may be invoked in any circumstances where such
communications are likely to be disclosed without the client's consent.
However, communications which are criminal in themselves or that are made with
a view to obtaining legal advice to facilitate the commission of a crime will
not be privileged.

A justice of the peace has no jurisdiction to order
the seizure of documents that would not be admissible in evidence in court on
the ground that they are privileged. Before authorizing a search of a lawyer's
office, he should even refuse to issue the warrant unless he is satisfied that
there is no reasonable alternative to the search. If he issues it, he should
attach terms of execution to the warrant designed to protect the right to
confidentiality of the lawyer's clients as much as possible.

In the case at bar, the communications made by the
applicant with respect to his financial means are criminal in themselves since
they constitute the material element of the crime charged. These communications
are accordingly not protected by the privilege and the justice had jurisdiction
to order the seizure. However, all other information contained in the ""Application
for Legal Aid"" form remains protected. The search was the only reasonable
alternative and the procedure followed during the seizure was proper and valid.

English version of the judgment
of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—A
citizen who lies about his financial means in order to obtain legal aid is
committing a crime. This appeal concerns the right of the police to be
authorized by a search warrant to search a legal aid bureau and seize the form
filled out by the citizen at his interview, for purposes of proving that this
crime was committed. This issue raises several others, including, in
particular, the scope of and procedures for exercising the authority to search
lawyers' offices, in view of the confidential nature of their clients' files.
This appeal will also give everyone an opportunity to note the deficiencies in
the law in this area and the limited ability of the courts to compensate for them
since their role is not primarily legislative.

RETURNABLE

We do not know the wording of
the information that led respondent justice of the peace to authorize the
search and seizure of the documents described in the warrant; however, at the
hearing counsel agreed to admit for purposes of this appeal that the contents
of the information were as set out in the warrant.

The syndic of the Bar*
intervened when the warrant was being executed and, as a result, the two mis en
cause police officers did not search the premises, but agreed to receive,
without even examining them, since they were in a sealed envelope,
documents they were told were those they were looking for. No one has yet seen
what the envelope contains, not even the judges of this Court, and everyone
agreed not to open the envelope before being authorized to do so by a judgment
of this Court. All are agreed, moreover, that it contains two forms completed
by Marcellin Ledoux and by a lawyer employed by the Centre communautaire
juridique de Montréal [Montreal Community Legal Centre], together with a notice
of refusal, and that the information contained in this application for legal
aid concerns the matters found in the following printed form:

[page 865]

 [page 866]

[1]

It should be noted that at the bottom of the form the lawyer is
asked to enter his ""professional notes"" on the back of the document.

This form must be completed by those applying for legal aid. This
is a requirement of the Act (Legal Aid Act, R.S.Q. 1977, c. A-14).

64. An application for legal aid must set forth the financial
condition of the applicant and the basis of his claim, all the information
determined in the regulations and any additional relevant information required
by the corporation.

This requirement is aimed at allowing the bureau director to
determine whether an applicant is eligible having regard to s. 63 of the same
Act, the pertinent part of which reads as follows:

63. The general manager shall, within the scope of the
regulations, grant legal aid to any economically under-privileged person establishing the probable existence of a
right.

Those who do not comply with the requirement will be deprived of
the services of a lawyer paid by the bureau, in the same way as those who do
not meet the eligibility criteria.

[page 867]

It should also be noted that the information on the first page of
the form deals principally with the financial situation of the applicant for
purposes of determining whether he is eligible for aid as an economically
underprivileged person, and that the professional notes on the reverse concern
the probable existence of the basis of his claim. These professional
notes could very well record the applicant's account of the facts which
lead him to apply for aid and on which the bureau will decide the probable
existence of the basis of his right.

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT

After the documents had been seized and sealed, Mr. Descôteaux
and the legal aid bureau (le Centre communautaire juridique de Montréal)
presented to a judge of the Superior Court, district of Montreal, a motion for
the issuance of a writ of certiorari requesting that the seizure be
quashed on the grounds of nullity and requesting the Superior Court judge to
order the justice of the peace to return the sealed envelope and its contents
to them.

The motion was dismissed, but the judge amended the wording of
the warrant, stating that [TRANSLATION]
""the words 'other documents concerning this case' should be struck
out and no longer regarded as forming part of the said search warrant"".

The Superior Court judge stated that he was of the view that
solicitor-client privilege could be invoked as soon as confidentiality was
threatened, ""without waiting until the person or persons disregarding the
privilege attempted to tender the information thus obtained as evidence"".
He found, however, that the documents seized were not privileged since they had
been prepared before the solicitor-client relationship came into existence
([1978] C.S. 792, at p. 799):

[TRANSLATION] Returning
now to the problem raised by applicants, I have come to the conclusion that the
documents seized, namely two legal aid application forms and one refusal form,
are not privileged. The application for
legal aid is nothing more or less than a descriptive form filled out by a person wishing to obtain legal aid to let the organization know that he
meets the eligibility requirements.
There is no relationship at all

[page 868]

between the information contained in this form, which deals
with the applicant's civil status, matrimonial status and financial situation,
and the information he may provide to his counsel in order to obtain legal
advice or representation in litigation. Moreover, there is not even a
solicitor-client relationship at the time this form is completed, and the
retainer does not come into existence until the applicant has been accepted by
the appropriate authority, which, in so doing, will have decided that he meets
the eligibility requirements. It is only after this administrative decision has
been made that there will be created between the applicant citizen and the
legal aid lawyer this type of privileged relationship that is scrupulously
protected by the common law.

I am unable to arrive at any other conclusion, since it seems
clear to me that these documents are records of an administrative nature that
are necessary precisely because of the nature of the services sought by the
applicant. Finally, I think that the ""declaration"" which the
applicant must sign in the presence of a witness and which appears at the
bottom of the ""application for legal aid"" confirms my opinion that
this document is not privileged:

I declare that this information is true and I undertake to
inform your bureau or corporation of any change in my economic situation.

I have been informed of my right to be represented by a lawyer
of my choice and I have chosen to be represented by:

A lawyer employed full-time by the corporation/a lawyer in private
practice.

There is not yet any solicitor-client relationship; at the
very most the applicant has expressed his desire to have a lawyer who is
employed by the legal aid bureau or a private practitioner, without any further
information concerning his identity. Moreover, the undertaking by the applicant
to inform the ""bureau"" or the ""corporation"" of any change
in his economic situation indicates most clearly, in my view, that this type of
information is not regarded by the applicant himself as confidential or as
forming part of the consultation or legal advice sought from a lawyer whose
identity he does not yet know. This seems to me sufficient to dispose of the
case of the legal aid application forms, and the same comments apply, it goes
without saying, to the notice of refusal. These documents, owing to their very
nature and to the position the citizen is in when they are filled out, do not
fall within the category of privileged communications . . .

(Emphasis added.)

[page 869]

Finally, I repeat, the Superior
Court judge amended the warrant by striking out the words ""other documents
concerning this case"" on the ground that the authorization to search and
seize conferred by those words was too general and imprecise.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL

The Court of Appeal adopted
the conclusions of the Superior Court judge, together with his reasons. To
these Bélanger J.A. added on behalf
of the Court that in any event solicitor-client privilege could not have
operated to protect the communication, since the latter was precisely what had
been resorted to in order to mislead a representative of the legal aid bureau.
On that matter, he stated the following:

[TRANSLATION] In the
case at bar the communications or documents that are alleged to be confidential
are those referred to in the charge as having been used in the commission of the offence in question. Apart from common law principles, they are no more privileged
than if the same information and
documents had been used to mislead the lawyer himself in order to
fraudulently obtain his services on special
terms. In either case I do not think
that false communications made to the eventual victim who will have to bear the cost of the services are confidential in any way. In short, a
communication made to a
representative of the Commission des services juridiques [Legal Services
Commission] is in no way confidential if it
is an element of an offence committed to the latter's prejudice, since
in such circumstances there is no confidentiality between solicitor and client.

I think that at this point I
should state my findings in the case at bar; I shall give reasons for them
later.

In my view it was correctly
decided that it is not necessary to wait for the trial or preliminary inquiry
at which the communication is to be adduced or sought in evidence before
raising its confidentiality. With all due respect for the opposite view, I am
of the opinion, however, that in principle information concerning one's
financial means the basis of the claim, and any other information required by
the corporation or the regulations (Legal
Aid Act, s. 64) which a person applying for legal aid must
provide in order to obtain the services of a

[page 870]

lawyer is, except in the exceptional cases I shall deal with
later, privileged. I share the opinion of the Quebec Court of Appeal, however,
that, in the case at bar, the information concerning Marcellin Ledoux's
financial means had lost the benefit of being privileged since, as alleged in
the search warrant, it was communicated with a view to criminally obtaining a
benefit and, consequently, fell within one of the common law exceptions to the
principle of privilege. But since it is alleged that the crime was committed by
means of false pretences only with respect to the applicant's financial means,
the professional notes, which concern the basis of his claim, remain
privileged.

I do not intend to repeat here everything that others have said,
on numerous occasions and very clearly and completely, about solicitor-client
privilege, or about the issuance and execution of search warrants.

I think, however, that I should make a few remarks about the
existence and effects of a person's right to have his communications with his
lawyer kept confidential; I shall then deal more particularly with the search
power provided for in the Criminal Code .

THE RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIALITY

It is not necessary to demonstrate the existence of a person's
right to have communications with his lawyer kept confidential. Its existence
has been affirmed numerous times and was recently reconfirmed by this Court in Solosky v. The Queen, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 821, where Dickson J. stated (at p. 839):

One may depart from the
current concept of privilege and approach the case on the broader basis
that (i) the right to communicate in confidence with one's legal adviser is
a fundamental civil and legal right, founded upon
the unique relationship of solicitor and client, and (ii) a person
confined to prison retains all of his
civil rights, other than those expressly or impliedly taken from him by law.

[page 871]

There is no denying that a person has a right to communicate with
a legal adviser in all confidence, a right that is ""founded upon the
unique relationship of solicitor and client""
(Solosky, supra). It is a
personal and extra-patrimonial right which follows a citizen throughout his
dealings with others. Like other personal, extra-patrimonial rights, it gives
rise to preventive or curative remedies provided for by law, depending on the
nature of the aggression threatening it or of which it was the object. Thus a
lawyer who communicates a confidential communication to others without his
client's authorization could be sued by his client for damages; or a third
party who had accidentally seen the contents of a lawyer's file could be
prohibited by injunction from disclosing them[2].

Owing to its importance, in addition to these general remedies
available to the holder, various statutes, both federal and provincial,
recognize this right by giving it additional, specific protection.

These include, for example, statutes governing the practice of
the profession of barrister or advocate (in Quebec, the Act respecting
the Barreau du Québec, R.S.Q. 1977, c. B-1, s. 131)[3]
and certain provincial charters of rights (in Quebec, the Charter of human rights and freedoms, R.S.Q.
1977, c. C-12, s. 9)[4].

[page 872]

It is again owing to the
importance of this right that certain statutes contain special provisions
applicable in situations where, were it not for those special provisions, there
would be undue interference with the right to confidentiality. An example of
such concern for that right can be found in the safeguards set out in s. 232 of
the Income Tax Act, 1970-71-72
(Can.), c. 63.

There is no doubt that this
right belonging to a person in his dealings with others, including the State,
is part of our Quebec public law as well as of the common law.

Although we recognize numerous
applications of it today, the right to confidentiality did not first appear
until the 16th century, and then did so as a rule of evidence (see, inter
alia, Berd v. Lovelace (1577), 21 E.R.
33; Dennis v. Codrington (1580),
21 E.R. 53).

The rule of evidence is well
known; it has often been stated, This Court referred to it again recently in Solosky.
That decision sets out the conditions precedent to the existence of the
privilege, as well as its limits and exceptions. It should be pointed out that
the substantive conditions precedent to the existence of the privilege, which
the judges have gradually established and defined, are in fact the substantive
conditions precedent to the existence of the right to confidentiality, the
former being merely the earliest manifestation of the latter. There is no need
to list those conditions exhaustively here or to review all the nuances that
have been developed by the courts over the years. It will be sufficient to
review them in broad outline and to emphasize certain aspects of particular
relevance to this appeal.

The following statement by
Wigmore (8 Wigmore, Evidence, para.
2292 (McNaughton rev, 1961)) of the rule of evidence is a good summary, in my
view, of the substantive conditions precedent to the existence of the right of
the lawyer's client to confidentiality:

Where legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional
legal adviser in his capacity as such, the communications relating to that
purpose, made in confidence

[page 873]

by the client, are at his instance permanently protected from
disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, except the protection be waived.

Seeking advice from a legal adviser includes consulting those who
assist him professionally (for example, his secretary or articling student) and
who have as such had access to the communications made by the client for the
purpose of obtaining legal advice.

There are exceptions. It is not sufficient to speak to a lawyer
or one of his associates for everything to become confidential from that point
on. The communication must be made to the lawyer or his assistants in their
professional capacity; the relationship must be a professional one at the exact
moment of the communication. Communications made in order to facilitate the
commission of a crime or fraud will not be confidential either, regardless of
whether or not the lawyer is acting in good faith.

THE SUBSTANTIVE RULE

Although the right to confidentiality first took the form of a
rule of evidence, it is now recognized as having a much broader scope, as can
be seen from the manner in which this Court dealt with the issues raised in Solosky.

Solosky was an inmate at Millhaven penitentiary. He was seeking a
declaration that henceforth all properly identified items of solicitor-client
correspondence would be forwarded to their respective destinations unopened.

The inmates' right to confidentiality conflicted with the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
P-6, and more particularly with Regulation 2.18 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations, allowing
the director of the institution to order censorship of correspondence to the
extent considered necessary

[page 874]

or desirable for
the security of the institution.
On behalf of this
Court Dickson J., stated the
following (at p.
841):

Counsel for the Crown submits there are three alternative
interpretations of the scope of Regulations 2.17 and 2.18 which may govern the
extent of the authority of the institutional head in dealing with an envelope
which appears to have originated from a solicitor, or to be addressed to a
solicitor, in circumstances where the institutional head has reason to believe
that the unrestricted and unexamined passage of mail to or from the particular
inmate in question represents a danger to the safety and security of the
institution:

(a) he may nonetheless permit the letter to be delivered
unopened and unexamined to the inmate;

(b) he may suspend the inmate's privilege to receive mail, in
respect of that letter, pursuant to sections 2.17 and 2.18 of the Penitentiary
Service Regulations.

(c) he may order that the envelope be subject to opening and
examination to the minimum extent necessary to establish whether it is properly
the subject of solicitor-client privilege.

Counsel contends that to interpret the Regulations as
requiring the first of these alternatives is to leave the institutional head
without the authority he requires to control the potential passage of
contraband, or of correspondence which may endanger the safety of the
institution, under the guise of confidential communications passing between
inmate and solicitor. I agree. I would also reject the second as providing no
solution. I agree that the third alternative represents that interpretation of
the scope of the Regulations which permits to an inmate the maximum opportunity
to communicate with his solicitor through the mails that is consistent with the
requirement to maintain the safety and security of the institution.

In my view, the ""minimum extent necessary to establish
whether it is properly the subject of solicitor-client privilege"" should
be interpreted in such manner that (i) the contents of an envelope may be
inspected for contraband; (ii) in limited circumstances, the communication may
be read to ensure that it, in fact, contains a confidential communication
between solicitor and client written for the purpose of seeking or giving legal
advice; (iii) the letter should only be read if there are reasonable and probable
grounds for believing the contrary, and then only to the extent necessary to
determine the bona fides of the communication; (iv) the authorized
penitentiary official who examines the envelope, upon ascertaining that the
envelope contains nothing in breach of

[page 875]

security, is under a duty at law to maintain the confidentiality
of the communication. Paragraph 7c. of Directive 219 underlines this point.

It is quite apparent that the Court in that case applied a
standard that has nothing to do with the rule of evidence, the privilege, since
there was never any question of testimony before a tribunal or court. The Court
in fact, in my view, applied a substantive rule, without actually formulating
it, and, consequently, recognized implicitly that the right to confidentiality,
which had long ago given rise to a rule of evidence, had also since given rise
to a substantive rule.

It would, I think, be useful for us to formulate this substantive
rule, as the judges formerly did with the rule of evidence; it could, in my
view, be stated as follows:

1. The confidentiality of communications between solicitor and
client may be raised in any circumstances where such communications are likely
to be disclosed without the client's consent.

2. Unless the law provides otherwise, when and to the extent
that the legitimate exercise of a right would interfere with another person's
right to have his communications with his lawyer kept confidential, the
resulting conflict should be resolved in favour of protecting the confidentiality.

3. When the law gives someone the authority to do something
which, in the circumstances of the case, might interfere with that
confidentiality, the decision to do so and the choice of means of exercising
that authority should be determined with a view to not interfering with it
except to the extent absolutely necessary in order to achieve the ends sought
by the enabling legislation.

4. Acts providing otherwise in situations under paragraph 2
and enabling legislation referred to in paragraph 3 must be interpreted
restrictively.

[page 876]

THE RULE OF EVIDENCE

The rule of evidence is
formulated by Cross (Cross on
Evidence, 5th ed., 1979) as
follows (at p. 282):

In civil and criminal
cases, confidential communications passing
between a client and his legal adviser need not be given in evidence
by the client and, without the client's consent, may not be given in evidence
by the legal adviser in a judicial proceeding ...

The rule of evidence does not
in any way prevent a third party witness (I am referring here to someone other
than an agent of the client or the lawyer) from introducing in evidence
confidential communications made by a client to his lawyer. It is important to
note, however, that before allowing such evidence to be introduced and in determining
to what extent to allow it, the judge must satisfy himself, through the
application of the substantive rule (No. 3), that what is being sought to be
proved by the communications is important to the outcome of the case and that
there is no reasonable alternative form of evidence that could be used for that
purpose.

CONFIDENTIALITY IN THE CASE
AT BAR

In the case at bar the
principal issue is to determine when the solicitor-client relationship, which
confers the confidentiality protected by the substantive rule and the rule of
evidence, arises.

The Superior Court judge, as we
have seen, was of the view that this relationship, and consequently the right
to confidentiality, did not arise until the legal aid applicant had been
accepted, that is, until the retainer was established.

When dealing with the right to
confidentiality it is necessary, in my view, to distinguish between the moment
when the retainer is established and the moment when the solicitor-client
relationship arises. The latter arises as soon as the potential client has his
first dealings with the lawyer's office in order to obtain legal advice.

The items of information that a
lawyer requires from a person in order to decide if he will agree to

[page 877]

advise or represent him are
just as much communications made in order to obtain legal advice as any
information communicated to him subsequently. It has long been recognized that
even if the lawyer does not agree to advise the person seeking his services,
communications made by the person to the lawyer or his staff for that purpose
are nonetheless privileged (Minter v. Priest, [1930] A.C. 558; Phipson
on Evidence, 12th ed., 1976, p. 244, No. 589; 8 Wigmore, Evidence
(McNaughton rev. 1961), p. 587, para. 2304).

Moreover, the same applies not
only to information given before the retainer is perfected concerning the legal
problem itself, but also to information concerning the client's ability to pay
the lawyer and any other information which a lawyer is reasonably entitled to
require before accepting the retainer. First, this information of an
administrative nature is just as related to the establishment of the
professional relationship as any other information; this is especially clear
when, as in the case at bar, the legal aid applicant ""must set forth
[his] financial means . . . and the basis of his claim"". In addition,
information of this nature that a person gives his lawyer for that purpose may
also be highly confidential and would have been kept secret by that person were
it not for that person's need of the assistance of a legal adviser.

For example, the legal aid form
requires the applicant to provide information concerning his dependants. A
person could thus be forced to disclose to the legal aid bureau a paternity
that had until then been kept secret, in order to establish his onerous
financial obligations and consequently his limited means. One can imagine,
given the form the applicant must complete, numerous other situations where the
information given would be highly personal.

I therefore do not think that a
distinction should be made between information that must be given in order to
establish the probable existence of a valid claim and that given to establish
eligibility from the point of view of financial means, since, on

[page 878]

the one hand, information
concerning the person's financial situation may be just as highly confidential
as any other information and since, on the other hand, the fact of being unable
to meet the eligibility requirements respecting financial means is no less fatal
to the ability to obtain the services sought.

The issue we are concerned with
was recently raised in Alberta in R. v. Littlechild (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 406.

An individual was charged with
having defrauded a store by using an N.S.F. cheque. In order to prove that the
accused knew that his bank had ordered a suspension of all operations
concerning his bank accounts and that consequently he knew that his cheque
would not be honoured, the Crown wished to introduce in evidence communications
that the accused had made previously to a legal aid bureau employee.

During an interview and on a
form similar to the one involved in the case at bar, the accused had provided
certain information concerning his financial means to this employee, who was
not a lawyer, in order to establish his eligibility for the legal aid bureau's
services. According to the Crown, part of this information dealt in particular
with the fact that the accused knew that he no longer had access to the funds
in his bank accounts.

The trial judge refused on his
own motion to allow the Crown to introduce these communications in evidence.

The Attorney General appealed.

Laycraft J.A., rendering
judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, stated the following (at pp.
411-12):

A number of cases establish the principle that
solicitor-client privilege extends both to communications between the agents of
a client and his solicitor and to communications between a client and agents of
the solicitor. In Wheeler v. Le Marchant (1881), 17 Ch. D. 675 at p. 682, Jessel,
M.R., said:

The actual communication to the solicitor by the client is of
course protected, and it is equally protected whether it is made by the client in person or is

[page 879]

made by an agent on behalf of the client, and whether it is
made to the solicitor in person or to a clerk or subordinate of the solicitor
who acts in his place and under his direction.

In Lyell v. Kennedy (1884),
27 Ch. D. 1, Cotton, L.J., said at p. 19:

But then this privilege is confined to that which is
communicated to or by that man [the client] by or to the solicitors or their
agents, or any persons who can be treated properly as agents of the solicitors.
We have therefore thought it right, in order to prevent an evasion of what is
the proper view of the law by the use of that word 'agents,' to require that
the Defendant shall put in a further affidavit stating whether the agents
mentioned were his agents, or whether they were the agents of the solicitors
and persons so employed by the solicitor as to be his agents, including such
agents as every solicitor's clerk may be said to be, who would all be entitled
to the protection given to solicitors. Subject, then, to that alteration, we
think that the protection claimed is in law good.

In R. v. Chaney (1908),
13 C.C.C. 289, 17 Man. R. 467 (Man. C.A.), police had a person falsely pose as
a representative of the accused's solicitor in order to obtain a statement from
the accused. The Court held that the person obtaining the statement must be
treated as though he was the solicitor's agent as he represented himself to be,
and that the evidence was therefore inadmissible on the ground of privilege.

Recent Canadian cases also holding that solicitor-client
privilege extends to communications through the intermediary of an agent are Susan Hosiery Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue,
[1969] 2 Ex. C.R. 27, [1969] C.T.C. 353, and Re Alcan-Colony Contracting Ltd. et al. and
Minister of National Revenue (1971), 18 D.L.R. (3d) 32, [1971] 2
O.R. 365.

It is not a factor against the existence of privilege that
the communication between the respondent and the Legal Aid officer which is
sought to be introduced in evidence related to the respondent's effort to
obtain counsel rather than to advice given for the purpose of the actual
defence. In Wheeler v. Le Marchant,
supra, Jessel, M.R., said at p. 682:

So again, a communication with a solicitor for the purpose of
obtaining legal advice is protected though it relates to a dealing which is not
the subject of litigation, provided it be a communication made to the

[page 880]

solicitor in that character and for the purpose.[5]

This principle has been stated earlier in broader terms in Minet v.
Morgan (1873), 8 Ch. App. 361, by Lord Selbourne, L.C., at p. 368:

But there is a later authority by that most accurate and
learned Judge, Sir R. T.
Kindersley-Lawrence v. Campbell, 4 Drew. 485, 490 [62 E.R. 186 at 188], which contains a statement of
the Vice-Chancellor's view of the principle and also of the rule which in 1859
had come to be well settled and established in this Court on the foundation of
that principle. He says: 'It is not now necessary, as it formerly was, for the
purpose of obtaining production that the communications should be made either
during or relating to an actual or even to an expected litigation. It is
sufficient if they pass as professional communications in a professional
capacity.' I can only say that I entirely agree with the views both of the
principle and of its proper extension taken in these later authorities. 

It is also clear that solicitor-client privilege can extend
to conversations in which a person makes disclosures while seeking to retain a
solicitor, though in fact the retainer is not perfected. In Minter v, Priest, [1930] A.C. 558 at p. 573, Viscount Dunedin said:

Now, if a man goes to a solicitor, as a solicitor, to consult
and does consult him, though the end of the interview may lead to the
conclusion that he does not engage him as his solicitor or expect that he
should act as his solicitor, nevertheless the interview is held as a privileged
occasion.

It follows from the authorities referred to above that
conversations with a solicitor's agents held for the purpose of retaining him
would also be privileged, even though the solicitor was not then, or ever,
retained. In my view, the principle protects from disclosure a conversation
between an applicant for legal aid and the non-lawyer official of the Legal Aid
Society who interviews him to see if he is qualified.

The privilege protecting from disclosure communications
between solicitor and client is a fundamental right—as fundamental as the right
to counsel itself since the right can exist only imperfectly without the
privilege. The Courts should be astute to protect both. As long ago as Pearson v. Foster (1885), 15 Q.B.D. 114,

[page 881]

Brett, M.R., warned that free and confident communication within the solicitor-client relationship is
so vital a part of the right to counsel that the privilege ought not to
be 'frittered away'. At pp. 119-20 he said:

The privilege with regard to
confidential communications between solicitor and client for professional purposes
ought to be preserved, and not frittered away. The reason of the privilege is
that there may be that free and confident communication between solicitor and client which lies at the foundation of the use
and service of the solicitor to the client ...

(Emphasis added.)

I am fully in agreement with
the conclusions of the Alberta Court of Appeal. It is only fair to mention, in
passing, that the judgment of the Superior Court judge in the case at bar was
rendered prior to that decision.

Confidential communications,
whether they relate to financial means or to the legal problem itself, lose
that character if and to the extent that they were made for the purpose of
obtaining legal advice to facilitate the commission of a crime.

The same is true a fortiori where, as in the case at bar, the communication itself is the material
element (actus reus) of the crime; this is all the more evident where
the victim of the crime is precisely the office of the lawyer to whom the
communication was made.

This exception has been
recognized for a very long time. The case most frequently referred to is R. v. Cox and Railton (1884), 14 Q.B.D. 153, where Stephen J. stated (at
p. 167):

The reason on which the rule is said to rest cannot include
the case of communications, criminal in themselves, or intended to
further any criminal purpose, for the
protection of such communications cannot possibly be otherwise than
injurious to the interests of justice, and to those of the administration of
justice. Nor do such communications fall
within the terms of the rule. A communication in furtherance of a
criminal purpose does not 'come into the ordinary scope of professional
employment.'

(Emphasis added.)

In the case at bar, the
communications dealing with Marcellin Ledoux's financial means are, according
to the search warrant, ""criminal in

[page 882]

themselves"", to use
Stephen J.'s words, and will not benefit as such from the protection they would
otherwise have been afforded by the substantive rule and the rule of evidence,
had they been confidential.

THE SEARCH WARRANT PROVIDED
FOR IN S. 443(1)(b) OF THE CRIMINAL CODE AND THE RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIALITY

I do not intend to examine all
the questions raised by the interpretation of s. 443  and the determination of
the duties and powers it confers on the justice of the peace. Nor is it
necessary for the purposes of this appeal that we consider the things that can
be searched for and seized under s. 443(1)(a) or (c). It is sufficient for the
purposes of this appeal to make certain general observations, that suggests a
mere reading of s. 443(1)(b).

We know that, save certain
exceptions, one cannot go into someone else's house without a warrant, even in
order to search for evidence of a crime, Section 443  permits such entry on
certain conditions, but subjects such an activity to a certain degree of
judicial control. It provides that the person designated by the justice in the
warrant may search the premises for the things described in the warrant and, if
they are found, seize them and carry them before the justice. The only
restriction on the type of things the search for and seizure of which a justice
of the peace may authorize by warrant is that they be one of the things described
in paras. (a), (b) and (c) of
s. 443(1):

443. (1) A justice who is satisfied
by information upon oath in Form 1, that there is reasonable ground to believe
that there is in a building, receptacle or place

(a) anything upon or in respect of which any offence against
this Act has been or is suspected to have been committed,

(b) anything that there is reasonable ground to believe will afford evidence with respect to the
commission of an offence against this Act, or

(c) anything that there is reasonable
ground to believe is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any offence against the person for which a person
may be arrested without warrant,

may at any time issue a warrant under his hand authorizing a person named therein or a peace officer
to search

[page 883]

the building, receptacle
or place for any such thing, and to seize and carry it before the
justice who issued the warrant or some other justice for the same territorial
division to be dealt with by him according to law.

In the case at bar we are thus concerned with something provided
for in para. (b), that is, something that is likely to ""afford evidence
with respect to the commission of an offence"" in a legal proceeding.

Moreover, the legislation does not make any distinction with
respect to the nature of the premises sought to be searched. One may therefore
search anywhere for what is provided for under para. (b) of the section,
including in a lawyer's offices.

Indeed the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace to
authorize a search thus does not depend on the nature of the place sought to be
searched but on a reasonable belief that there are to be found on the premises
things covered by para. (b) of s. 443(1).

It then becomes necessary to reconcile the authority to search, a
right that society has assumed as being essential to the suppression of crime,
with the right to confidentiality, a right that society recognizes as essential
for the better administration of justice.

The right to confidentiality enjoyed by a lawyer's client does
not, by virtue of the substantive rule, interfere with the jurisdiction
of the justice of the peace to authorize the search, but might do so by virtue
of the rule of evidence. At the very most, in the present state of the law, the
substantive rule requires that a justice of the peace be more demanding before
authorizing a search of a lawyer's office or one of his files and will lead
him, where necessary, to set out special procedures for the execution of the
warrant in order to limit to what is absolutely inevitable the breach of
confidentiality.

This leads us to a consideration of the effect of the right to
confidentiality on searches, first as a rule of evidence and then as a
substantive rule. The rule of evidence affects the jurisdiction of the

[page 884]

justice of the peace, while the
substantive rule affects how he exercises it.

(a) As a rule of evidence

Some courts have been unwilling
to recognize that a justice of the peace has the right to refuse a search
warrant on the sole ground that what is sought to be seized could never
subsequently be received in evidence because it is protected by
solicitor-client privilege. (See R. v. Colvin, Ex parte Merrick et al. (1970),
1 C.C.C. (2d) 8; Re B.X. Development Ltd. and The Queen (1976), 36
C.R.N.S. 313 (B.C. S.C.); Re Alder et al. and The Queen (1977), 37
C.C.C. (2d) 234; Attorney General of Quebec v. T., G., W., R. and C. (1977),
2 C.R. (3d) 30).

Others have ruled that he has
such a right, either at the time the warrant is being issued (Re Director of
Investigation and Research and Canada Safeway Ltd. (1972), 26 D.L.R. (3d)
745; Re Director of Investigation and Research and Shell Canada Ltd. (1975),
22 C.C.C. (2d) 70; Re Borden & Elliott and The Queen (1975), 30
C.C.C. (2d) 337 (Ont. S.C.); Re Presswood and Delzotto (1975), 36
C.R.N.S. 322; Re B.X. Development and The Queen (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d)
14 (B.C. C.A.)), or at the time of an application under s. 446(3) to have the
things seized returned (Re Steel and The Queen (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 278;
Re B and The Queen (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 235).

It is not necessary to review
all the decisions to the effect that the justice of the peace can do this at
the time the warrant is being issued. It is sufficient, in my view, to quote
here in this connection what was said by Southey J. of the Supreme Court of
Ontario at trial in Re Borden & Elliott and The Queen (1975), 30
C.C.C. (2d) 337, since I agree with his critical analysis of these decisions
and his conclusions (the Ontario Court of Appeal, hearing an appeal in that
case, chose not to rule on the question and the appeal was decided on another
ground). Southey J. stated the following (at pp. 341-43):

The first question to be decided is whether a search warrant issued under s. 443  of the Criminal
Code 

[page 885]

overrides the solicitor-and-client privilege and can be used
to give authority to a peace officer to search for and seize documents which
are subject to that privilege. The relevant provisions of s. 443  reads [sic]
as follows:

443(1) A justice who is satisfied by information upon oath in
Form 1, that there is reasonable ground to believe that there is in a building,
receptacle or place

[…]

(b) anything that there is reasonable ground to believe will
afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence against this Act,
or

[…]

may at any time issue a warrant under his hand authorizing a
person named therein or a peace officer to search the building, receptacle or
place for any such thing, and to seize and carry it before the justice who
issued the warrant or some other justice for the same territorial division to
be dealt with by him according to law.

The position of the applicants is that a Justice has no
jurisdiction to issue a warrant with respect to documents subject to the
solicitor-and-client privilege, because the issuance of warrants is limited
under s. 443  to documents which the Justice has reasonable grounds to believe
will afford evidence of the offence charged. As documents covered by the
solicitor-and-client privilege would not be admissible at trial, the Justice
could not believe that such documents would afford evidence of the offence.
This was the basis of the decision of Judge Rice in the Provincial Court
(Criminal Division) in Re Steel and The
Queen (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 278, 6 O.R. (2d) 644, 29 C.R.N.S. 355.

In R. v. Colvin, Ex p.
Merrick et al. (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 8, [1970] 3 O.R. 612, Osier,
J., quashed a search warrant on the ground that the Justice should not have
been satisfied on the information that there were reasonable grounds for believing
that there was in the building in question anything that would afford evidence
with respect to the commission of an offence. He went on to state in obiter, however, that he would not be
prepared to quash a warrant simply because the possibility existed that the
material in question might be covered by the solicitor-and-client privilege,
because that privilege is a rule of evidence and not a rule of property. It was
his view that the privilege could only be asserted by way of

[page 886]

objection to the introduction of the allegedly privileged
material in evidence at the appropriate time.

Almost five years after the decision of Osier, J., the Federal
Court of Appeal held in Re Director of
Investigation and Research and Shell Canada Ltd. (1975), 22 C.C.C.
(2d) 70, 55 D.L.R. (3d) 713, 18 C.P.R. (2d) 155, [[1975] F.C. 184], that the
authority given to the Director of Investigation under s. 10 of the Combines Investigation Act to enter
premises on which he believes evidence may be found relating to a matter under
inquiry and to examine and copy documents that may afford such evidence, does
not override the solicitor-and-client privilege.

Chief Justice Jackett, with whom the other members of the
Court agreed, made the following statement at pp. 78-9 C.C.C., pp. 721-2 D.L.R.
[p. 193 [1975] F.C.]:

... it has been recognized from very early times that the
protection, civil and criminal, afforded to the individual by our law is
dependent upon his having the aid and guidance of those skilled in the law
untrammelled by any apprehension that the full and frank disclosure by him of
all his facts and thoughts to his legal advisor might somehow become available
to third persons so as to be used against him.

He then continued at p. 79 C.C.C., p. 722 D.L.R., [p. 194
F.C.]:

I fully realize that the protection of the confidentiality of
the solicitor-and-client relationship has, heretofore, manifested itself
mainly, if not entirely, in the privilege afforded to the client against the
compulsory revelation of communications between solicitor and client in the
giving of evidence in Court or in the judicial process of discovery. In my
view, however, this privilege is a mere manifestation of a fundamental
principle upon which our judicial system is based, which principle would be breached
just as clearly, and with equal injury to our judicial system, by the
compulsory form of preprosecution discovery envisaged by the Combines Investigation Act as it would
be by evidence in Court or by judicial discovery.

Thurlow, J., added the following at p. 80 C.C.C., p. 723
D.L.R., [p. 195 [1975] F.C.]:

Secondly, it appears to me that the confidential character of
such communications, whether oral or in writing, comes into existence at the
time when the communications are made. As the right to protection

[page 887]

for the confidence, commonly referred to as legal professional
privilege, is not dependent on there being litigation in progress or even in
contemplation at the time the communications take place, it seems to me that
the right to have the communications protected must also arise at that time and
be capable of being asserted on any later occasion when the confidence may be
in jeopardy at the hands of anyone purporting to exercise the authority of the
law.

The reasoning of Chief Justice Jackett and Thurlow, J., in the
case of an inquiry under the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-23, is even more compelling, in my view, in the case of a search warrant
issued by a Justice under s. 443  of the Criminal Code . If the privilege
could not be invoked to prevent the seizure and examination of documents under
a search warrant, the Crown would be free in any case to seize and examine the
files and brief of defence counsel in a criminal prosecution. It would be small
comfort indeed to the accused and to his counsel to discover that his only
protection in such a case was to prevent the introduction into evidence of the
documents that had been seized and examined. Such a result, in my view, would
be absurd.

Chief Justice Jackett quoted extensively in his reasons from
the decision of Munroe, J., of the British Columbia Supreme Court in Re
Director of Investigation and Research and Canada Safeway Ltd. (1972), 26
D.L.R. (3d) 745, 6 C.P.R. (2d) 41, [1972] 3 W.W.R. 547, in which the same
result was reached. That decision, in my view, contains further persuasive
reasons for upholding the position taken by the applicants that the solicitor-and-client
privilege may be invoked to prevent seizure under a search warrant.

I find, accordingly, that the applicant is entitled to raise
the solicitor-and-client privilege at this stage in the proceeding, as a ground
for quashing the search warrant for lack of jurisdiction on the part of the
Justice.

I am of this
view and would add, by way of clarification, that the justice of the peace
should raise the question himself and, where necessary, find that he has no
jurisdiction to authorize the search.

(b) As a
substantive rule

In cases where
the justice of the peace has the necessary jurisdiction to authorize the
search, he should, in exercising that jurisdiction, take into

[page 888]

account the need to protect the
fundamental right of a lawyer's client to have his communications kept
confidential. This may arise where evidence is being sought of communications
which, although made in confidence to a lawyer, are no longer protected because
they were made in circumstances such that they fall within an exception to the
rule; or where a lawyer's office is to be searched for things covered by para.
(a) or (c) of s. 443(1) (for example, stolen goods). Although the rule of
evidence seems to be applicable only with respect to para. (b) of s. 443(1),
the substantive rule will apply to any search affecting the right to
confidentiality, regardless of which of the paragraphs of s. 443(1) such search
is to be made under. In either case the search should be limited to what is
absolutely necessary in order to seize the things for which the search was
authorized. A lawyer's file may contain a host of information concerning a
client, some of which has remained confidential even though other information
is no longer so since it falls within an exception to the rule. Even more
serious is the fact that a lawyer's office contains confidential files
pertaining to other clients which have nothing to do with the crime that is to
be proved or with the things searched for under s. 443(1)(a) and (c).

Some would say that the justice
of the peace has no discretion to refuse to issue a search warrant or to impose
terms of execution once the requirements of form and substance in s. 443  have
been met. They would argue that in s. 443  the word ""may"" means
""must"" and does not confer any discretion. According to this
interpretation, the justice of the peace may issue a warrant only if he is satisfied
that there is reasonable ground to believe that one of the things provided for
in s. 443(1) is to be found in the place sought to be searched, but must do so
as soon as he is so satisfied, and the only condition of execution on the
premises that he may impose is set out in s. 444 of the Code:

444. A warrant issued under section 443  shall be executed by
day, unless the justice, by the warrant, authorizes execution of it by night.

[page 889]

Others, on the contrary, would
say that generally the justice of the peace has the discretion to refuse the
warrant, so long as this discretion is exercised judicially and so long as the
decision to refuse the warrant is not capricious or arbitrary (Carter, R.F., The Law Relating to Search Warrants, 1939, at p. 52; Fontana, J.A., The Law of Search Warrants in Canada, 1974, at pp. 7 and 51 et seq.; Re Pacific Press Ltd. and The Queen et al. (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 487).

I come down on the side of the
discretion, as it allows more effective judicial control of the police.
Searches are an exception to the oldest and most fundamental principles of the
common law, and as such the power to search should be strictly controlled. It
goes without saying that the justice may sometimes be in a poor position to
assess the need for the search in advance. After all, searches, while
constituting a means of gathering evidence, are also an investigative tool. It
will often be difficult to determine definitively the probative value of a
particular thing before the police investigation has been completed. Be that as
it may, there are places for which authorization to search should generally be
granted only with reticence and, where necessary, with more conditions attached
than for other places. One does not enter a church in the same way as a lion's
den, or a warehouse in the same way as a lawyer's office. One does not search
the premises of a third party who is not alleged to have participated in the
commission of a crime in the same way as those of someone who is the subject of
such an allegation. (See on this subject Fontana, J.A., The Law of Search Warrants in Canada, at p. 174.)

The justice of the peace, in my
view, has the authority, where circumstances warrant, to set out execution
procedures in the search warrant; I would even go so far as to say that he has
the right to refuse to issue the warrant in special circumstances, such as
those found in Re Pacific Press
Ltd. and The Queen et al., supra.

That case involved a search of
a newspaper office for information gathered by the newspaper staff. Neither the
newspaper staff nor the newspaper itself were accused of having been involved
in the commission of an offence. In view of the

[page 890]

special situation of a newspaper in light of ss. 1(f) and 2 of
the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix III, Nemetz C.J. of the
British Columbia Supreme Court quashed the search warrant issued by the justice
of the peace, concluding as follows (at p. 495):

The issuing of any search warrant is a serious matter,
especially when its issuance against a newspaper may have, as it did, the
effect of impeding its publication. To use the words of my distinguished
predecessor in United Distillers Ltd. (1948), 88 C.C.C. 338, [1947]
3 D.L.R. 900, the
Justice of the Peace 'should have reasonable information before him to entitle
him to judicially decide whether such warrant should issue or not'. In my opinion, no such reasonable information was before
him since there was no material to show:

1. whether a reasonable alternative source of obtaining

2. the information was or was not available, and if available,
that reasonable steps had been taken to obtain it from that alternative source.

In my opinion, the bringing of an application for a search
warrant in these circumstances was an abuse of the process of the Court. I,
therefore, quash the warrants.

Re Pacific Press Ltd. involved
a search for things provided for in para. (b)
of s. 443(1), that is,
evidence; it goes without saying that the same requirements do not apply in the
case of things provided for in
paras. (a) and (c) of s. 443(1).

It could be advanced that the two conditions set out by Nemetz
C.J. should be met before a warrant is issued whenever a search is sought to be
conducted, under 443(1)(6), of premises
occupied by an innocent third party which are not alleged by the information to
be connected in any way with the crime. It is not necessary for purposes of
this appeal to decide that point. It is sufficient to say that in situations
such as the one in Re Pacific Press Ltd., where
the search would interfere with rights as fundamental as freedom of the press,
and, as in the case at bar, a lawyer's client's right to

[page 891]

confidentiality, the justice of
the peace may and should refuse to issue the warrant if these two conditions
have not been met, lest he exceeds the jurisdiction he had ab initio. I would add one qualification to these two
conditions. The reasonable alternative referred to is not an alternative to the
method of proof but to the benefits of search and seizure of the evidence. As I
have already stated, a search warrant is not only a means of gathering evidence
but also an investigative tool. Therefore a determination of what is reasonable
in each case will take into account the fact that a search makes it possible
not only to seize evidence but also to ascertain that it exists, and even
sometimes that the crime was in fact committed and by whom. Seizure makes it
possible to preserve the evidence.

Moreover, even if the
conditions are met, the justice of the peace must set out procedures for
the execution of the warrant that reconcile protection of the interests this
right is seeking to promote with protection of those the search power is
seeking to promote, and limit the breach of this fundamental right to what is
strictly inevitable. This is also true of searches under 443(1)(a) or (c), as soon as they threaten a fundamental
right.

Generally speaking, where the
search is to be made of a lawyer's office, in order to search for things
provided for under para. (a), (b) or (c)
of s. 443(1), the justice of the peace should be particularly
demanding. Where it is a question of evidence (443(1)(b)), although satisfied that there is such evidence on the premises, he should
only allow a lawyer's office to be searched if in addition he is satisfied that
there is no reasonable alternative to a search. It will sometimes be desirable,
as soon as the informant initiates proceedings, for the justice of the peace to
see that the district Crown attorney is notified, if he is not aware of such
proceedings, as well as the Bar authorities. With their assistance he should
normally be more easily able to decide with the police on search procedures
acceptable to everyone that respect the law firm's clients' right to
confidentiality without depriving the police of their right to search for
evidence of the alleged crime.

[page 892]

In this respect he could take
guidance from the provisions of the Income
Tax Act, 1970-71-72
(Can.), c. 63, s. 232, adapting them
to fit the particular case, of course.

Moreover, the search should be
made in the presence of a representative of the Bar, where possible.

It is encouraging to read the
numerous cases reported in the law reports and see that in almost all cases it
was possible to decide upon appropriate execution procedures with the consent
of the various parties involved (police, Bar, etc.), without the case law
having at the time definitively decided that the justice of the peace had the
authority to impose any. This seems to me to have been done in the case at bar,
since, although the record is not very clear as to the reasons, it is apparent
that the search was conducted in a special manner, with the cooperation of the
police and the Bar, and that the documents seized were placed in a sealed
envelope without having been examined.

Some have expressed the view
that Parliament rather than the courts should set guidelines for searching
lawyers' offices. (See the statements of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Re Borden & Elliott and The Queen (1975), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 337, at p. 348.) Be that as it may, I for
my part hope that the courts in the provinces, in view of the discretion of the
justices of the peace and the willingness of everyone so far to recognize the
importance of the confidentiality of communications made to a lawyer by his
client, and their willingness and the need to preserve it, will rectify this
legislative gap by developing, through rules of court or informally, by means
of a uniform practice, a regional procedure that will take account of local
circumstances; they are certainly in an eminently better position to do so than
this Court.

CONCLUSION

In summary, a lawyer's client
is entitled to have all communications made with a view to obtaining legal
advice kept confidential. Whether communications

[page 893]

are made to the lawyer himself or
to employees, and whether they deal with matters of an administrative nature
such as financial means or with the actual nature of the legal problem, all
information which a person must provide in order to obtain legal advice and
which is given in confidence for that purpose enjoys the privileges attached to
confidentiality. This confidentiality attaches to all communications made
within the framework of the solicitor-client relationship, which arises as soon
as the potential client takes the first steps, and consequently even before the
formal retainer is established.

There are certain exceptions to
the principle of the confidentiality of solicitor-client communications,
however. Thus communications that are in themselves criminal or that are made
with a view to obtaining legal advice to facilitate the commission of a crime
will not be privileged, inter alia.

The fundamental right to
communicate with one's legal adviser in confidence has given rise to a rule of
evidence and a substantive rule. Whether through the rule of evidence or the
substantive rule, the client's right to have his communications to his lawyer
kept confidential will have an effect when the search warrant provided for in
s. 443  Cr. C. is being issued and executed.

Thus the justice of the peace
has no jurisdiction to order the seizure of documents that would not be
admissible in evidence in court on the ground that they are privileged (the
rule of evidence).

Before authorizing a search of
a lawyer's office for evidence of a crime, the justice of the peace should
refuse to issue the warrant unless he is satisfied that there is no reasonable
alternative to the search, or he will be exceeding his jurisdiction (the
substantive rule). When issuing the warrant, to search for evidence or other things,
he must in any event attach terms of execution to the warrant designed to
protect the right to confidentiality of the lawyer's clients as much as
possible.

[page 894]

Applying these principles to
the case at bar, I have arrived at the following conclusions.

First, all information
contained in the form that applicants for legal aid must fill out is provided
for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, is given in confidence for that
purpose and, consequently, is subject to the applicant's fundamental right to
have such communications kept confidential and, as such, is protected by the
rule of evidence and the substantive rule.

It is alleged in the
information laid that the communications made by Ledoux with respect to his
financial means are criminal in themselves since they constitute the material
element of the crime charged. This is an exception to the principle of
confidentiality and these communications are accordingly not protected (this
does not mean that we are expressing an opinion as to the validity of the
allegations in the information). However, since the allegation concerns only
the information dealing with the applicant's financial means, all other
information on the form remains confidential.

Since the part of the form
dealing with Ledoux's financial situation was as an exception admissible in
evidence, the justice of the peace had jurisdiction to order its seizure.

Acting within his jurisdiction
with regard to the rule of evidence, the justice of the peace also exercised
his discretion to issue a warrant judicially having regard to the substantive
rule. As a result of the refusal of the legal aid bureau's staff and lawyers to
disclose to the investigators the contents of the form, or of the oral
statements made to them by Ledoux concerning his financial situation, there was
no reasonable alternative to a search. How otherwise could the investigators
ascertain that Ledoux's statements were fraudulent? Perhaps, as a result of
their investigation, they knew that Ledoux was not eligible for legal aid in
view of his financial means, but the crime of which they suspected him and
concerning which they were entitled to continue the investigation was that of
having concealed his means, ineligibility not being a crime in itself.

[page 895]

I do not know whether the
justice of the peace was the originator of the procedure followed for the
search and seizure or whether there was an agreement between counsel. In any
event, the manner of proceeding in the case at bar was, again having regard to
the substantive rule, proper and acceptable and the justice of the peace was or
would have been by law empowered to and justified in making it a condition of
granting the warrant.

There is one problem, however.
The form seized may contain privileged information. 1 am of the view that the
justice of the peace could have, in the presence of everyone—the Crown, the
representative of the Bar and the Legal Aid representative—opened the envelope
and examined the form to determine whether it contained anything confidential
and, if not, dealt with it in accordance with the law like any other thing
seized. If he had discovered that the form contained confidential information,
he could have (at least this is one of the ways of proceeding) photocopied the
part relevant to the applicant's financial means and dealt with that portion of
the form like any other thing seized by placing it on the file. He could have
placed the original of the document in a sealed envelope also placed on file,
ordering that it not be examined without a judge's order.

In the case at bar, if the
information on the back of the form in fact consists of professional notes, as
indicated by the form, they are confidential. This would still have to be
verified, however. As for the front of the form, most of the information
requested is relevant to the applicant's financial situation, although some
only indirectly. This is not the case, however, with the information required
on the parts of the form that I have identified with the letters A and B, where
the information essentially concerns the ""nature of the case"" or the
""probable existence of a right"". I am therefore of the view that the
judge, after verifying the back of the form, and if he ascertains that it
contains professional notes, should have the front of the form, except parts A
and B, photocopied, and deal with the photocopies and the original of the
document as suggested, that is, place the photocopies on the Court file and
place the original in a sealed

[page 896]

envelope, place the envelope on
the file and order the Court staff not to open it or allow it to be opened
without a judge's order. The sealed envelope will eventually be returned to the
legal aid bureau, unless Marcellin Ledoux disputes the authenticity of the
photocopy should an inquiry or trial be held; were Ledoux to do so, the judge
presiding at the trial or the preliminary inquiry would be fully justified in
opening the envelope and allowing those concerned to see the form, since Ledoux
would then, in my view, have himself by his allegations made it impossible to
reconcile his right to confidentiality for the better administration of
criminal justice.

Before concluding, I should
state that the procedure will vary from one case to another. Here the good
faith of counsel was in no way at issue since, as alleged by the police, they
were not accomplices of their client but rather his victims. Clearly different
execution procedures should be provided for where the information laid alleges
that the lawyer participated in the crime. I would also like to add that the
justice of the peace from whom a warrant to search a lawyer's office is being
sought, if he is not a judge by profession, would be well advised, although in
no way obliged to do so, to refer the applicant to a judge of a court of
criminal jurisdiction or even a judge of a superior court of criminal
jurisdiction.

For these reasons I would
dismiss this. appeal and refer the matter back to the justice of the peace,
ordering him to deal with the envelope and its contents as stated above.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Admissibility of confession—Whether disguised
police officer a “person in authority”—Whether confession voluntary—Voir dire.

The appellant was charged with possession of cannabis resin
for the purpose of trafficking. The issue before the Court concerns the
admissibility of a confession which the Crown sought to put in evidence at
trial. The appellant was arrested, given a police warning and prior to being
lodged in a cell, was asked if he would give a statement, and he declined to do
so. Hours later, a constable acting in an undercover capacity was placed in the
same cell in order to obtain information from the appellant. He did not
identify himself as a police officer and the appellant did not appear to
recognize him as such. The officer told the appellant he was a truck driver,
detained for a traffic violation. During a conversation the appellant made a
statement to the officer which the Crown attempted to introduce in evidence.

After a voir dire, the trial judge ruled that in the
circumstances the undercover policeman was a “person in authority”, that the
statement had been improperly elicited, and was therefore inadmissible.

A majority of the Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial
judge and ordered a new trial.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Estey J. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Mclntyre and
Chouinard JJ.: This case should be decided in the context of the special rules
which have evolved in respect of evidence which has been obtained by way of a
confession. The principle applicable is that no statement made by an accused
person to a person in authority is admissible in evidence against him unless it
is shown by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement in the sense
that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.

[Page 641]

The first issue is whether the constable was a “person in
authority”. Both parties agreed that the test to be applied is a subjective
test, i.e. did the appellant, when he made his statement, believe that
the constable was a person in authority. There is no evidence whatever that the
appellant believed the constable to be a person in authority. The confession is
therefore in the same position as if it had been made to someone other than a
police officer and it was an error of law to refuse to receive it. The
privilege against self incrimination is not relevant in the circumstances of
this case, for there was no attempt by anyone to compel the appellant to make
the disclosure which he did make.

The second issue is whether the confession, even on the
assumption that the constable was a person in authority, was voluntary.
Confessions can be excluded, although there had been no fear of prejudice or
hope of advantage held out by a person in authority, where there exists a
reasonable doubt as to whether the confession in question was “the utterance of
an operating mind”. There is no allegation here that the mind of the accused
was affected by the actions of the police officer. His statement was made
freely and it was volunteered by him.

Per Lamer J.: The confession rule is predicated upon a
rule of law and one of prudence: the right for an accused not to be compelled
as a witness at his trial, and the protection of the criminal justice system.

The rules regarding the admissibility of statements by an
accused to persons in authority may be enunciated in the following manner:

1. A statement is inadmissible unless the judge is satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that nothing said or done by any person in authority
could have induced the accused to make a statement which was or might be
untrue;

2. A statement, though elicited under circumstances which
would not render it inadmissible, shall nevertheless be excluded if its use in
the proceedings would, as a result of what was said or done by any person in
authority in eliciting the statement, bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

That second portion of the rule is not a true discretion.
There first must be a clear connection between the obtaining of the statement
and the conduct; furthermore that conduct must be so shocking as to justify the
judicial branch of the criminal justice system in feeling that, short of
disassociating itself from such conduct through rejection of the statement, its
reputation and, as a result, that of the whole criminal justice system, would
be brought into disrepute. The authorities, in dealing with shrewd and often
sophisticated criminals, must

[Page 642]

sometimes for necessity resort to tricks or other means of
deceit and should not through the rule be hampered in their work. What should
be repressed vigorously is conduct on their part that shocks the community. But
pretending, as in this case, to be a truck driver to secure the conviction of a
trafficker would not shock the community.

Per Laskin C.J. and Estey J., dissenting: The
basic reason for the exclusionary confession rule is a concern for the
integrity of the criminal justice system. The support and respect of the
community for that system can only be maintained if persons in authority
conduct themselves in a way that does not bring the administration of justice
into disrepute. In the realm of confessions, this standard of conduct is
reflected in the requirement that an accused’s statement be given
“voluntarily”.

Where the speaker has, as here, already refused to give a
statement to the authorities, the test of voluntariness must include an
appreciation of the circumstances in which the statement is made, including an
awareness that his statement is being “volunteered” to a person in authority.
To apply the rule otherwise in a case such as this one would not merely permit
but would encourage the deliberate circumvention by the authority of the
accused’s announced exercise of his right not to give a statement to the
authorities. Here the accused had taken the position he did not wish to give a
statement to the police. The police then, by a ruse, subverted that wish and
thus the accused made his statement after he thought he had established that he
was not, in fact, talking to a person in authority. Such a determined
subversion by the police of an expressed right to refuse to make any statement
brings the administration of justice into disrepute. Accordingly, such a
statement given in these circumstances cannot get over the hurdle of the
exclusionary rule.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1],
allowing the appeal by the

[Page 643]

Crown from an acquittal and ordering a new trial. Appeal
dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Estey J. dissenting.

Scott T. Milloy, for the appellant.

E.G. Ewaschuk, Q.C., and J.A. Pethes, for the respondent.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Estey J. were delivered by

ESTEY J. (dissenting)—I have had the benefit of reading
judgments proposed by my colleagues Martland and Lamer JJ. but for reasons
which I will attempt to set out shortly, I have, with respect, reached the
opposite conclusion and therefore I would propose that the appeal be allowed,
the order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the acquittal in the trial court
restored. The facts having been set out by my colleagues, I can largely confine
my remarks to an explanation of how I have reached the conclusion I propose.

This appeal raises a question as to the admissibility of a
statement made by an accused to a person in authority. The statement was
obtained in circumstances outlined in the statement of facts in the appellant’s
factum to which the respondent agreed:

3. The Respondent [accused] was given a police warning and
was then conveyed to the Ottawa City Police Station at 60 Waller Street along
with Bonner and Hrehoriak. Prior to being lodged in a cell, Constable Gervais
asked the Respondent if he was willing to give a statement but he declined to
do so. The Respondent was later removed from the cell, charged with possession
of hashish for the purposes of trafficking and returned to the same cell.

On the next day the police obtained a statement and again the
circumstances in which it was obtained are described in the appellant’s
statement of facts, accepted by the respondent:

4. On November 10, 1976 at approximately 1:00 a.m., Constable McKnight, a member of the Ottawa City Police Force acting in an undercover
capacity, was placed in an 8’ x 8’ cell at the Ottawa City Police
Station occupied by the Respondent alone. Constable McKnight was placed in the
cell on the instructions of Constable Gervais, the investigating officer, in
order to obtain information from the Respondent concern-

[Page 644]

ing the charge against him. …At that time, Constable
McKnight was unarmed, wore blue jeans, a blue jacket and brown boots, and had a
four or five day growth of beard.

5. Upon entering the cell, the Respondent spoke first to
Constable McKnight by saying that Constable McKnight “looked like a nark”.
Constable McKnight just laughed and the Respondent continued that he looked
like a nark because of the way he was dressed. Constable McKnight explained
that he was dressed like that because he had been fishing. The Respondent then
asked Constable McKnight why he was in jail and he replied that it was because
of a traffic ticket. During the conversation, Constable McKnight informed the
Respondent that he was a truck driver from the Pembroke area and had been
fishing so the Respondent would have the impression that he was not a nark and
that he did not know much about drugs. Constable McKnight indicated that people
in the Pembroke area were interested in drugs and that he would be interested
in getting drugs; however, no deal was set up. The Respondent asked Constable
McKnight when he would be getting out and he replied that a buddy would be
coming down to pay the fine…

Therefore, it is not in dispute that the accused was unaware that
he was speaking to an undercover policeman and that the policeman had deceived
the accused by making false statements concerning his identity, including a
denial that he was a police officer. In the result, the statement was given by
the accused after his arrest, and after he had been given a warning by the
police and had refused to give any statement to the police. In the face of this
express election in the presence of a uniformed policeman by the accused to
remain silent, the police then employed a trick and lies to obtain the
statement now in issue. There is no question that when the accused announced
his unwillingness to give a statement, he was aware that he was communicating
his decision to remain silent to a person in authority, namely a police
officer. The question is, therefore, whether or not a statement obtained
thereafter by the police from the accused in these circumstances is admissible
within the confession rules.

The terms “confession” and “admission” have caused considerable
confusion in the law of evidence and in the criminal law generally for the

[Page 645]

past two centuries. We have not consistently defined “a
confession” in precise terms nor has it been related to the other term “an
admission”. Indeed the words are sometimes used interchangeably. Sometimes it
would appear that a confession is but one species of an admission. Wigmore says
that in earlier times a confession was:

…an acknowledgement in express words by the accused in a
criminal case of the truth of the guilty fact charged or some essential part of
it.

3 Wigmore, Evidence (1970), paragraph 821.

An admission is by that learned author defined as a statement
“made out of court by a party‑opponent”: 4 Wigmore, supra, paragraph
1048. Some authors in earlier times went further and used “confession” to
describe a statement which admits the guilt of the accused completely as
charged and opined that anything short of that is included in the term
“admission”. This of course led to considerable confusion as to the application
of the strict admissibility rules as they developed for confessions. In those
times a distinction was made in defining a confession between exculpatory and
inculpatory statements. For our purposes this distinction came to an end in the
statement of Hall J. in Pichê v. The Queen[2]
at p. 36:

In my view the time is opportune for this Court to say that
the admission in evidence of all statements made by an accused to persons in
authority, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, is governed by the same rule and
thus put to an end the continuing controversy and necessary evaluation by trial
judges of every such statement which the Crown proposes to use in chief or on
cross-examination as either being inculpatory or exculpatory.

The distinction between these terms, “confession” and
“admission”, was also discussed in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v.
Harz et al.[3]
where Lord Reid, at pp. 817-8 stated:

Then it was argued that there is a difference between
confessions and admissions which fall short of a full confession. A difference
of that kind appears to be recognised in some other countries. In India and Ceylon

[Page 646]

legislative enactments severely limit the admissibility of
confessions, and the courts have construed these enactments as not preventing
the admission in evidence of other incriminating statements obtained by fair
means though not in the manner required for confessions. And for some reason
not made clear in argument some such distinction appears to be recognised at
least in some states in the United States. But there appears to be no English
case for more than a century in which an admission induced by a threat or
promise has been admitted in evidence where a full confession would have been
excluded. If such a case had occurred since appeal to the Court of Criminal
Appeal became possible I find it very difficult to believe that there would not
have been an appeal. I can see no justification in principle for the
distinction. In similar circumstances one man induced by a threat makes a full
confession and another induced by the same threat makes one or more
incriminating admissions. Unless the law is to be reduced to a mere collection
of unrelated rules, I see no distinction between these cases.

The learned authors of Phipson on Evidence (12th ed.,
1976) state at paragraph 671:

In criminal cases statements made out of court by an accused
are similarly admissible against him though they are subject to special
conditions of admissibility if made to a person in authority, and are then
usually called “confessions”.

Gradually, the law has developed so as to carve out of the
general field of admissions those statements made by an accused to a person in
authority; these are referred to as confessions and it is to these that special
rules for admissibility at trial apply.

The rules of evidence in criminal law, and indeed in civil law,
are all concerned with relevancy, reliability and fairness as well as other
considerations such as the reasonable economy and efficiency of trial. The
rules with reference to confessions have an additional element, namely the
concern of the public for the integrity of the system of the administration of
justice. If the reliability of an accused’s statements were the only
consideration in determining their admissibility the courts would not have
adopted distinctive principles applicable only to statements to persons in

[Page 647]

authority and not to statements against interest generally.
Reliability cannot be the ticket for admission because statements may have
enough of the appearance of reliability to ensure reference to the trier of fact
but still have been excluded by the confession standard. In Piché, supra, the
statement sought to be introduced by the Crown was one which was professedly
false but which was sought to be introduced to contest the credibility of the
accused. The statement was exculpatory in nature and the Crown was required to
prove that such a prior inconsistent statement was voluntary. Cartwright C.J.
stated at p. 26:

It appears to me to involve a strange method of reasoning to
say that an involuntary statement harmful to the accused’s defence shall be
excluded because of the danger of its being untrue but that a harmful
involuntary statement, of which there is not merely a danger of its being false
but which the prosecution asserts to be false, should be admitted merely
because, considered in isolation, it is on its face exculpatory.

The matter is carried further in an earlier discussion in this
Court in DeClercq v. The Queen[4]
where Cartwright C.J., at p. 906, stated:

While the reason for the rule is said to be the danger that
a confession, the making of which has been induced by threats or promises made
by a person in authority, may well be untrue, it must now, I think, be regarded
as settled that when an inquiry is held during the course of a trial as to the
admissibility of an inculpatory statement sought to be introduced by the Crown,
the question to be determined is whether or not the statement was voluntary and
not whether or not it is true.

Martland J. added at p. 911:

…it is settled law that an inculpatory statement by an
accused is not admissible against him unless it is voluntary, and. the inquiry
on a voir dire is directed to that issue, and not to the truth of the
statement…

Why then is the standard of ‘voluntariness’ and not ‘truth’
adopted by the law? Confessions have doubtless been suspect from the earliest
times by those interested in the administration of justice. Torture and other
forms of violence no doubt have brought about confessions, and the disallowance
of their admissibility was perhaps one of the meas-

[Page 648]

ures adopted to eliminate these practices. Many reasons come to
mind at once for the rejection of such statements: the statement may be untrue;
the statement might be incomplete; and the obtaining of such a statement
infringes the accused’s right to remain silent. It may be that the adoption and
continuance of the confession rules are a deep-seated recognition by the courts
of the need to apply, in the conduct of criminal trials, principles which will
command the respect and hence the support of the public for the system of
criminal justice. Certainly without such acceptance and support the system
would not survive. Chief Justice Freedman discussed the presence of the
exclusionary rule in our law in his learned article “Admissions and Confessions”
reproduced in Salhany and Carter, Studies in Canadian Criminal Evidence, (1972),
c. 4. He observed that the rejection of a confession brought about by threats
and beatings would find its basis not in the rules concerning persons in
authority but may arise out of “…discretionary power to consider the broad
question of public policy in the administration of criminal justice”, (at p.
120). Earlier, at p. 99, the learned Chief Justice stated:

Undoubtedly, as already stated, the main reason for
excluding them is the danger that they may be untrue. But there are other
reasons, stoutly disclaimed by some judges, openly professed by others, and
silently acknowledged by still others—the last perhaps being an instance of an
“inarticulate major premise” playing its role in decision-making. These
reasons, all of them, are rooted in history. They are touched with memories of
torture and the rack, they are bound up with the cause of individual freedom,
and they reflect a deep concern for the integrity of the judicial process.

See as well 8 Wigmore, Evidence, 3rd ed., paragraph 2251.

The roots of the confession rules have been examined by writers
in the United States. In his text on Evidence of Guilt, (1959),
Professor Maguire observed at p. 109:

[T]wo obvious reasons appear for caution in receiving
evidence of confessions:

[Page 649]

First, and most commonly invoked, the fear that an
“involuntary” confession of guilt may be untrue.

Second, determination to hold public authorities up to a
humane and honourable standard of conduct in treatment of persons suspected or
accused. While not at all inconsistent with the first reason, this second
reason may operate entirely independently of any risk that a particular
confession is tainted with untruth.

To similar effect see Allen, “Due Process and State Criminal
Procedures: Another Look” (1953), 48 Nw.U.L. Rev. 16, at p. 19.

This Court was faced in Horvath v. The Queen[5],
with the question of admissibility of a confession and in discussing the
general nature of confessions in the law our brother Beetz J. stated (at p.
433):

Apart from the untrustworthiness of confessions extorted by
threats or promises, other policy reasons have also been advanced to explain
the rejection of confessions improperly obtained. But the basic reason is the
accused’s absolute right to remain silent either completely or partially and
not to incriminate himself unless he wants to. This is why it is important that
the accused understand what is at stake in the procedure.

This additional consideration connotes a recognition by the
courts since the earliest times of the desirability and indeed the necessity of
adopting a system of principles in the administration of justice which will be
accepted by and command the support of the community. Thus it can be said that
confessions are not admissible where to admit them would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute, or, to put it another way, would
prejudice the public interest in the integrity of the judicial process.

All of this can be found in different shades and hues in the
authorities, commencing with Ibrahim v. The King[6],
which lays down the principle that to be admissible in a court of law, a
statement by an accused must be voluntary, that is to say it must

[Page 650]

not have been induced by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage.
The prescription that a confession to be admissible must be voluntary is not
limited to the examples set out in Ibrahim, supra. In Horvath, supra,
Spence J. held (at p. 402):

Although many courts seem to have done so, I do not regard
such an authority as Ibrahim as indicating that the natural meaning of
the word “voluntary” should be confined to cases of hope of advantage or fear
of prejudice.

He continued (at pp. 409-10):

The requirement to establish the admissibility at trial of a
statement made by an accused person to persons in authority has been oft cited
as simply that it is free and voluntary. Those are both ordinary English words
and I think mean roughly the same thing. The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary defines “voluntary” as “arising or developing in the mind
without external constraint…; of actions: performed or done of one’s own free
will, impulse, or choice; not constrained, prompted, or suggested by another”.

In the same case, Beetz J. noted (at p. 424):

The question arises as to whether the enumeration in the
rule of instances of involuntariness is a limitative one.

It cannot be limitative since the rule is a judge-made rule
and anything said by a judge beyond what is necessary to decide the issue is obiter.
Furthermore, the principle which inspires the rule remains a positive one;
it is the principle of voluntariness.

The principle itself, of course, requires (and this is an
absolute requisite) that the statement in fact be made to a person in
authority; and if this qualification is not met, then it matters not whether
the person is known to the accused to be one in authority. This is because the
principle adopted for the protection of the integrity of the administration of
justice is founded upon the realization that persons in authority,
instrumentalities of the State, must observe certain basic rules. This is so
for the practical reason that their very authority might, by promise or threat,
express or implied, produce a statement whether or not the accused was truly

[Page 651]

willing to speak, and on occasion might bring about statements
which are in whole or in part untrue. It is also necessary to adopt these basic
rules for the higher reason that ethical precepts are a vital ingredient in a
system of justice if it is to command the respect and support of the community
it serves, particularly in a judicial structure which embraces the concept of
the jury. In this appeal the first encounter of significance was with a person
in authority; that is, the authority to whom the accused communicated his
decision or election not to give a statement. It is that incident which, in the
circumstances here concerned, started the process which, in my view, leads to
the exclusion of the statements thereafter obtained by the authorities.

The analysis need go but one step further. To be voluntary a
statement must be volunteered by the speaker in the sense that the statement
must be the product of a conscious volens on the part of the speaker.
The volens must relate not only to the mechanics of speaking, that is
the articulation of the ideas of the speaker. Where the speaker has, as here,
already refused to give a statement to the authorities, the test of
voluntariness must include an appreciation of the circumstances in which the
statement is made, including an awareness that his statement is being
‘volunteered’ to a person in authority. To apply the rule otherwise in the
circumstances we have here would not merely permit but would encourage the
deliberate circumvention by the authority of the accused’s announced exercise
of his right not to give a statement to the authorities. This idea is taken up
by Rand J. in R. v. Fitton[7]
at p. 963:

Even the word “voluntary” is open to question; in what case
can it be said that the statement is not voluntary in the sense that it is the
expression of a choice, that it is willed to be made? But it is the character
of the influence of idea or feeling behind that act of willing and its source
which the rule seizes upon.

[Page 652]

The matter is carried further by Spence J. speaking for the
entire Court in Ward v. The Queen[8],
at p. 40:

In my view, there is a further investigation of whether the
statements were freely and voluntarily made even if no hope of advantage or
fear of prejudice could be found in consideration of the mental condition of
the accused at the time he made the statements to determine whether or not the
statements represented the operating mind of the accused.

If this latter element is not included, then the meaning of
voluntariness is reduced to a concern for the simple articulation of the words
of the statement by the accused speaker. I can find no authority for such an
arbitrary and destructive reduction of the degree of voluntariness required by
the basic principle illustrated by Ibrahim, supra, literally applied.
Indeed, as I view the sequence of events here, the statement is properly
excluded on the simple application of the principle revealed in Horvath and
Ward, supra, to the facts of this case.

On the facts before us here the authority went to some pains to
ensure that the accused, when making his statement, did not know it was being
made to a person in authority. As I have observed, he had earlier refused to
give a statement to the police. I do not go on and deal with any other set of
facts, such as a situation where the accused ought to have known the hearer was
a person in authority within the meaning of that term in the law, or had not
earlier declined to give a statement. We are concerned here with the fact that
the statement was made by a person under charge to a person in authority
masquerading as something else, and after the hearer has explicitly disavowed
any such status in order to allay the suspicions of an accused who had already
expressed a desire not to make a statement to the police.

It is not necessary to trace the origin of the special rules
applicable to statements by an accused to a person in authority. If indeed
these rules emanate from a desire on the part of the courts and the community
to adopt policies which will ensure a fair, impartial and reputable
administration of justice, then we need proceed no further.

[Page 653]

On the other hand, it has been said that the principles
surrounding the admissibility of a confession emanate from a right to silence on
the part of the accused under our jurisprudence. The accused, of course, need
not testify. He cannot be compelled to do so and his exercised right to silence
may not be the subject of commentary by the Crown before the jury (Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 4(5)). On the other hand, if the
accused elects, for whatever reason, to enter the witness box, he is on the
same footing as any other witness. He may be cross-examined on anything deemed
relevant by the court. By statutory intervention (s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , supra,) that which the accused says in the witness box may
not be used against him in any other proceedings. But, of course, so far as the
principal trial is concerned the section has no application. The right in
the accused, in my view, to elect not to testify in the trial of a charge laid
against him is one of the fundamental elements of our criminal jurisprudence
ranking with the presumption of innocence and the onus on the Crown to
establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt according to law. His right to
silence arises not because he is a witness but because he is an accused.
Indeed, as Dickson J. said in Marcoux and Solomon v. The Queen[9]
at p. 769, the accused has no such right with reference to any question deemed
to be relevant by a court once he enters the witness box. Professor Glanville
Williams, in The Proof of Guilt, (2nd ed., 1958), puts it this way (at
pp. 37‑8):

According to the rule, neither the judge nor the prosecution
is entitled at any stage to question the accused unless he chooses to give
evidence. “At the common law,” says Blackstone, “nemo tenebatur prodere
seipsum: and his fault was not [to] be wrung out of himself, but rather to
be discovered by other means and other men.” This rule may be called the accused’s
right not to be questioned; in America it is termed the privilege against
self-incrimination. The latter expression is more apt as the name for another
rule, the privilege of any witness to refuse to answer an incriminating
question; this is different from the rule under discussion, which, applying
only to persons accused of crime, prevents the question from being asked. The
person charged

[Page 654]

with crime has not merely the liberty to refuse to answer
a question incriminating himself; he is freed even from the embarrassment of
being asked the question. The privilege against self-incrimination, as
applied to witnesses generally, must be expressly claimed by the witness when
the question is put to him in the box; whereas the accused’s freedom from being
questioned prevents the prosecution from asking (much less compelling) him to
enter the box, and from addressing questions to him in the dock. [Underlining
added]

The question naturally follows: should the accused’s out-of-court
statements be admissible in court on the same basis? That is, if made to a
person in authority, must that statement be a voluntary statement (as earlier
described), consciously made to that person in circumstances which make it
evident that the accused intended it to be testimony in open court or to be
capable of being put to such use; or under circumstances which will not bring
the administration of justice into disrepute? This question as it arises here
relates only to those statements made to and not merely in the presence of a
person in authority, intended to be given to that particular person, made after
an election to remain silent, and when made in the circumstances already
described. It surely follows that if our law continues to recognize the right
of an accused not to enter the witness box under compulsion, his indirect
testimony in the form of out-of-court statements to a person in authority
should not be admissible on a basis which, following his invocation of the
right to silence, undermines or defeats the right not to testify. One author
has put the idea this way:

…if there are reasons for not compelling an accused to
testify at trial, those reasons should also be considered in relation to
statements given prior to trial.

Ratushny, Self-incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process,
1979, at p. 97.

By this process of reasoning one can readily reconcile the Ibrahim
rule with the underlying purposes for the special treatment accorded to
confessions,

[Page 655]

being the overriding interest in the acceptance by the community
of the system for the administration of justice. Thus the admission of a
statement which has been induced by a person in authority in such a way that it
might be untrue is but one illustration of conduct that would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute; and hence such a statement is
inadmissible. This principle has its application in any circumstance, whether
or not one might conclude that the statement might be true, where the effect of
the conduct of a person in authority is to remove the basic element of
‘voluntariness’. In short, the possibility or likelihood of the truth or
untruth of a statement is but one element in the process of determining the
voluntary nature of the statement in the full sense accorded to that expression
in the authorities. I find the observations of Lord Diplock in R. v. Sang[10]
at p. 436 appropriate to the circumstances of this appeal:

My Lords, I propose to exclude, as the certified question
does, detailed consideration of the role of the trial judge in relation to
confessions and evidence obtained from the defendant after commission of the
offence that is tantamount to a confession. It has a long history dating back
to the days before the existence of a disciplined police force, when a prisoner
on a charge of felony could not be represented by counsel and was not entitled
to give evidence in his own defence either to deny that he had made the
confession, which was generally oral, or to deny that its contents were true.
The underlying rationale of this branch of the criminal law, though it may
originally have been based upon ensuring the reliability of confessions is, in
my view, now to be found in the maxim nemo debet prodere se ipsum, no one can
be required to be his own betrayer or in its popular English mistranslation
“the right to silence.” That is why there is no discretion to exclude evidence
discovered as the result of an illegal search but there is discretion to
exclude evidence which the accused has been induced to produce voluntarily if
the method of inducement was unfair.

Outside this limited field in which for historical reasons
the function of the trial judge extended to imposing sanctions for improper
conduct on the part of the prosecution before the commencement of the
proceedings in inducing the accused by threats, favour or trickery to

[Page 656]

provide evidence against himself, your Lordships should, I
think, make it clear that the function of the judge at a criminal trial as
respects the admission of evidence is to ensure that the accused has a fair
trial according to law.

The first determination to be made when the court is confronted
with an out-of-court statement by this accused is whether his first statement,
that is his refusal to talk to the police, was made to a person in authority.
This act of the accused is an objective step and therefore depends not on the
understanding of the accused alone but on the actual fact of the identity of
the recipient of the statement. If the recipient be a person in authority as
that term has been developed in the law, the next step is to determine, in all
the circumstances which followed, whether the statement ultimately given (and
which is tendered at trial) is voluntary in the full sense of that term. The
elements which go into the determination of the voluntariness of that statement
include all those circumstances which bear upon the overriding requirement that
the admission of the statement will not render the administration of criminal
justice unacceptable to the community. All this is in sharp contrast to the
determination of the admissibility of a statement by an accused to a person not
in authority. In that instance the presence or absence of threats, force, fear,
hope, tricks, drugs, etc. go to weight and not to admissibility. It also calls
for a different application of the principle than in the usual case where the
accused has not, in prior confrontations with the authorities, declined to give
a statement.

It has been said in considering the use of stratagems by persons
in authority that

there appears to be at least some tendency [in Canadian
courts] to consider the use of such tactics as one of the factors bearing on
voluntariness.

“Developments in the Law—Confessions” (1966), 79 Harv. L.
Rev. 935, at p. 1104.

[Page 657]

This is so in my view if the term “voluntariness” is there
used in the full sense in which I have here used the term.

Davey C.J.B.C., in R. v. Frank[11],
examines the status of statements procured or induced by lies told by the
person in authority to the accused. In the end the Chief Justice found that
their effect on “voluntariness” is measured according to whether or not the
circumstances produced in the accused a hope of advantage or a fear of
prejudice. In R. v. McLeod[12],
the Court of Appeal rejected statements procured by “barefaced lies”. Laskin
J.A. (as he then was) stated (at p. 104):

In so holding, I do not rule out as a matter of law all
stratagems that the police or persons in authority may employ in questioning a
person under arrest. The issue in every case, under the governing law, must be
whether they operate or are calculated to operate upon the person to rouse hope
of advantage or fear of prejudice, or by their oppressiveness (to borrow a term
from the English Judges’ Rules) put in doubt at least whether any ensuing
inculpatory statement has been properly elicited. In my view, reinforced by a
reading of the whole record, the lies and associated incidents in this case had
the forbidden effect in inducing the incriminating statement.

It remains essentially a decision of policy as to whether the
accused must be aware he is making the statement to a person in authority
before it may be admissible as a confession. On the facts here, that basic
question in its broad form does not arise. Here the accused had taken the
position that he did not wish to give a statement to the police. The police
then, by a ruse, subverted that wish and thus the defendant made his statement
after he thought he had established that he was not, in fact, talking to a
person in authority. He did not intend, in such circumstances, to make a
statement to a person in authority and thus the public authority cannot present
the resulting statement as “voluntary” and therefore admissible under the
confession rules. A different result might obtain where

[Page 658]

the accused by the clearest declaration revokes his earlier
declared election not to give a statement to the authorities. In such a case
the succeeding statement is subject to the test of voluntariness in the
ordinary way.

Dubin J.A. in his dissent below refers to the refusal of the
accused to give a statement to the authorities:

A singular feature in this case is that after arrest the
accused was given a police warning and was asked if he was willing to give a
statement. He declined to do so. At that stage, therefore, he had been advised
not only that he need not make a statement to a police officer, but also that
whatever he said would be taken down in writing and could be used in evidence
against him at his trial. In refusing to make such a statement, he exercised
his legal right.

I respectfully agree with these observations.

To summarize then:

a) The exclusionary confession rule applies to statements given
before trial by an accused to persons in authority.

b) The basic reason for the rule is a concern for the integrity
of the criminal justice system. Such a system necessarily requires the support
and respect of the community it purports to serve. That support and respect can
only be maintained if persons in. authority conduct themselves in a way that
does not bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the community.

c) The rule and its administration strike a delicate balance
between the need to secure the conviction of the guilty, but above all, the
avoidance of the conviction of the innocent.

d) In the realm of confessions, this standard of conduct is
reflected in the requirement that an accused’s statement be given
“voluntarily”.

e) In this appeal, an expressed decision to remain silent was
made by the accused to a policeman who was, in the mind of the

[Page 659]

accused as well as in fact, a person in authority.

f) The statement ultimately obtained and tendered in court was
the product of a trick and lies by persons in authority, calculated to subvert
the appellant’s expressed decision to stand mute.

g) Such a determined subversion by the police of an expressed
right to refuse to make any statement brings the administration of justice into
disrepute. Accordingly, such a statement given in these circumstances cannot
get over the hurdle of the exclusionary rule.

h) This appeal is not concerned with the gathering of evidence by
any other means nor with the circumstance where an accused has not announced to
persons in authority that he did not wish to make a statement.

For these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the
acquittal at trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Mclntyre and
Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the Ontario
Court of Appeal[13].
At trial the appellant was acquitted on a charge of possession of cannabis
resin for the purpose of trafficking. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s
appeal and directed that a new trial be held. Dubin J.A. dissented.

The issue which is before this Court concerns the admissibility
of a confession which the Crown sought to put in evidence at trial. An agreed
statement of facts submitted by the parties to the Court of Appeal explains how
the confession came to be made and how it was disposed of by the trial judge.
The relevant portions of that statement are set out below:

On November 9, 1976 at approximately 2:30 p.m., Sergeant
Woods and Constables Lauzon, Carvish and Gervais of the Ottawa Police Force
conducted a search of apartment 1102, 1365 Bank Street in the City of

[Page 660]

Ottawa under the authority of a search warrant. On the
premises at that time were Donal Bonner (D.O.B. 26/06/57), Timothy Hrehoriak
(D.O.B. 24/12/60) and the Respondent (D.O.B. 21/12/45). The Respondent advised
Constable Gervais that he lived on the premises along with one Nancy Olson. In
one of the bedrooms, Sergeant Woods located 128.54 grams of hashish, a set of
scales, a cutting knife and a box of tin foil. Upon analysis, the scales and
knife were found to have traces of hashish.

The Respondent was given a police warning and was then
conveyed to the Ottawa City Police Station at 60 Waller Street along with
Bonner and Hrehoriak. Prior to being lodged in a cell, Constable Gervais asked
the Respondent if he was willing to give a statement but he declined to do so. The
Respondent was later removed from the cell, charged with possession of hashish
for the purposes of trafficking and returned to the same cell.

On November 10, 1976 at approximately 1:00 a.m., Constable
McKnight, a member of the Ottawa City Police Force acting in an undercover
capacity, was placed in an 8’ x 8’ cell at the Ottawa City Police Station
occupied by the Respondent alone. Constable McKnight was placed in the cell on
the instructions of Constable Gervais, the investigating officer, in order to obtain
information from the Respondent concerning the charge against him. During the
trial, a voir dire was conducted on the question of whether Constable
Earl McKnight was a person in authority. At that time, Constable McKnight was
unarmed, wore blue jeans, a blue jacket and brown boots, and had a four or five
day growth of beard. Constable McKnight testified on the voir dire that
the Respondent appeared to be normal and not under the influence of alcohol. No
other persons or police officers were visible from the cell. Constable McKnight
did not identify himself to the Respondent as a member of the Ottawa City
Police Force and the Respondent did not appear to recognize him as such.

Upon entering the cell, the Respondent spoke first to
Constable McKnight by saying that Constable McKnight “looked like a nark”.
Constable McKnight just laughed and the Respondent continued that he looked
like a nark because of the way he was dressed. Constable McKnight explained
that he was dressed like that because he had been fishing. The Respondent then
asked Constable McKnight why he was in jail and he replied that it was because
of a traffic ticket. Constable McKnight asked the Respondent why he was in jail
and the Respondent stated that it was for possession of hashish. While in the
cell, Constable McKnight sat beside the Respondent on the only bench. The
Respondent then told Constable McKnight that he sold hashish

[Page 661]

for $25.00 for 3 grams, that the hash that he had been
caught with had been “fronted” to him and that he would have to pay the people
back $1,000 because he had been “busted”. The Respondent stated that he would
have made $1,800 on the drugs that he had. Constable McKnight asked if there
were many drugs in the City and the Respondent replied that there were approximately
40 pounds. The Respondent also stated that he was arrested at his apartment
along with his buddy who was in the next cell. During the conversation,
Constable McKnight informed the Respondent that he was a truck driver from the
Pembroke area and had been fishing so the Respondent would have the impression
that he was not a nark and that he did not know much about drugs. Constable
McKnight indicated that people in the Pembroke area were interested in drugs
and that he would be interested in getting drugs; however, no deal was set up.
The Respondent asked Constable McKnight when he would be getting out and he
replied that a buddy would be coming down to pay the fine. The Respondent
stated that he had to go to court the next morning because he was on parole
respecting other charges. Constable McKnight was released from the cell at 1:07
a.m. and made his notes concerning the conversation shortly thereafter.

After Constable McKnight testified on the voir dire the
Respondent called no evidence on the issue of whether Constable McKnight was a
person in authority.

After argument by counsel, His Honour Judge Matheson ruled
that in all the circumstances, Constable McKnight was a person in authority.

No further evidence was called by the Crown on the voir
dire on the issue of whether the statements made by the Respondent to
Constable McKnight were voluntary. The Respondent did not request any other
Crown witnesses to be produced for cross‑examination on the voir dire and
did not call any evidence on this issue.

After argument by counsel, His Honour Judge Matheson ruled
that the “continuation of the intent to obtain a statement by this disguise”
puts into doubt whether the inculpatory statement had properly been elicited
and was therefore inadmissible.

The Crown called no further evidence at trial and at the
request of Crown Counsel and the direction of His Honour Judge Matheson, the
jury returned a verdict of “not guilty” of possession.

[Page 662]

The majority of the Court of Appeal held that a new trial should
be ordered. Jessup J.A. (Weatherston J.A. concurring) held that because the
appellant did not consider the undercover officer to be “in authority”, the
statement was not governed by the special rules relating to confessions. Jessup
J.A. went on to say that even if the appellant had regarded Constable McKnight
as being a person in authority, the conditions laid down in Ibrahim v. The
King[14]
as to the voluntariness of an accused’s statements had been met.

Dubin J.A., writing in dissent, was of the view that the trial
judge was correct in excluding the statement and would have dismissed the
appeal. He held that the basis of the confession rule was not merely concern
over the truthfulness of the statement in issue and said that the rules
respecting confessions and an accused person’s right to remain silent were
related. It was his opinion that a trial judge had a discretion to exclude the
confession because of the way in which it was obtained.

This case should be decided in the context of the special rules
which have evolved in respect of evidence which has been obtained by way of a
confession. In Phipson on Evidence, 12th ed., at p. 337, paragraph 792,
the following passage appears:

The classic formulation of the principle applicable to the
admissibility of confessions appears in Lord Sumner’s speech in Ibrahim v.
R. ([1914] A.C. 599, 609) “It has long been established as a positive rule
of English criminal law that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shown by the prosecution to have been a
voluntary statement in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either
by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Hale”.

Lord Sumner’s statement was adopted in this Court in Boudreau
v. The King[15]
and in R. v. Fitton[16].

[Page 663]

The first issue to be determined is whether Constable McKnight
was a “person in authority” because, except in the case of a statement made to
a person in authority, a statement made by an accused against his own interest
is admissible against him in criminal proceedings in the same way that it would
be in civil proceedings and there are no special conditions requiring the Crown
to prove that the statement was voluntary.

Both parties to this appeal agree that the test to be applied in
determining this issue is a subjective test, i.e. did the appellant,
when he made the statement to McKnight, believe that McKnight was a person in
authority. The Court of Appeal agreed with the application of this test. Jessup
J.A. said (at p. 380):

In my opinion the police officer in the present case was not
a person in authority because he was not regarded as such by the respondent. As
Kaufman J.A. says in Admissibility of Confessions in Criminal Matters, 2nd
ed. (1974), at p. 54:

The true test, it is submitted, is highly subjective: Did
the accused truly believe, at the time he made the declaration, that the person
he dealt with had some degree of power over him? In other words, did the
accused think that the person to whom he confessed (or as a result of whose
intervention he confessed) could either make good his promise or carry out his
threats? If so, such person should be treated as a person in authority and if
not, the rules which attach to persons in authority need not be applied, even
though the person, from a purely objective point of view, was in a position of
undoubted authority.

A similar view is expressed by Freedman C.J.M. in Studies in
Canadian Criminal Evidence (1972) at p. 118:

Suppose the policeman is garbed as a prisoner and is in fact
thought by the accused to be a fellow prisoner. He is then not a person in
authority. The test is apparently a subjective one. The court considers the
effect of the inducement on the mind of the accused in the known circumstances.
Based on the knowledge of the accused, was it reasonable for him to think that
the person holding out the inducement had the power

[Page 664]

to implement his promise or carry out his threat, as the
case may be? If the answer is in the affirmative—as it is likely to be where he
is manifestly dealing with the police—the inducement will be deemed to have
come from a person in authority. If the answer is in the negative—as in the
case where the accused confesses to another prisoner, not knowing him to be a
policeman—the inducement will be treated as not having come from a person in
authority.

In taking this position, Jessup J.A. was in agreement with the
decisions of four provincial courts of appeal in which a subjective test was
applied: R. v. Pettipiece[17],
R. v. Muisi (No. 1)[18],
Metenko v. The Queen[19]
and R. v. Stewart[20].

I agree with Jessup J.A. that a subjective test should be applied
in the circumstances of this case. I also agree with his conclusion that
McKnight was not a person in authority because he was not regarded as such by
the appellant. There is no evidence whatever that, at the time the appellant
revealed to McKnight that he was a dealer in drugs, he believed McKnight to be
a police officer. The appellant did not give evidence on the voir dire and
so he did not express any such belief. No evidence on the voir dire was
given on his behalf. The appellant did say to McKnight when he first spoke to
him that McKnight “looked like a nark”, but in the course of their conversation
this suspicion was obviously dispelled. It is clear that he would not have made
the admission which he did make to McKnight if he had believed that McKnight
was a police officer, and that he made it because he believed McKnight to be a
fellow prisoner.

Once it is accepted that the confession of the appellant was not
made to a person in authority, it was properly admissible without any
requirement for the Crown to establish that it was voluntary. The confession
was in the same position as if it had been made to someone other than a police
officer. In my opinion, it was an error of law to refuse to receive it.

[Page 665]

With great respect to the dissenting opinion of Dubin J.A., it is
my view that the privilege against self-incrimination is not relevant in the
circumstances of this case. The scope of the privilege against
self-incrimination has been clearly defined by my brother Dickson in the case
of Marcoux and Solomon v. The Queen[21]
at pp. 768-9:

The limit of the privilege against self-incrimination is
clear. The privilege is the privilege of a witness not to answer a question
which may incriminate him. That is all that is meant by the Latin maxim, nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare, often incorrectly advanced in support of a much
broader proposition.

…

In short, the privilege extends to the accused qua witness
and not qua accused, it is concerned with testimonial compulsion
specifically and not with compulsion generally.

A claim for protection against self-incrimination can only arise
where a tribunal or authority is seeking to compel an individual to disclose
something which he does not wish to disclose. In the present case, there was no
attempt by anyone to compel the appellant to make the disclosure which he did
make. The information given by the appellant to McKnight was furnished by the
appellant entirely on his own volition.

For these reasons, it is my opinion that this appeal should be
dismissed. However, Jessup J.A. in his reasons went on to consider whether the
appellant’s confession was properly admissible even on the assumption that
McKnight was a person in authority. He concluded that it was admissible. This
issue was fully argued before this Court and so I will express my opinion with
regard to it.

At the outset, I would point out that the trial judge, in his ruling
as to the admissibility of the confession, made the following findings:

In the instant case I am satisfied that what Rothman said to
Const. Earl Grant McKnight, and I might add, who was acting in the performance
of his duty, would seem to have been free of both fear and [sic]
prejudice, and free as well of hope of advantage by reason of the

[Page 666]

facts that he had been mislead or tricked into believing
that he was speaking to a person actually held in custody.

On these findings, the respondent had satisfied the requirements
for the admission of the confession as stated in the Ibrahim case. The
trial judge, however, refused to admit the confession because, he said:

However, in light of the facts of this particular case, I
believe that continuation of the intent to obtain a statement by this disguise
puts into doubt whether the inculpatory statement had been properly elicited,
and I feel that in the circumstances that I must rule against admissibility
herein.

It was not, in my opinion, a sufficient basis for the refusal of
the trial judge to receive the confession in evidence solely because he
disapproved of the method by which it was obtained. The issue in the case was
as to whether the confession was voluntary.

I have already noted that this Court has accepted Lord Sumner’s
statement in Ibrahim as to the test as to whether a confession is
voluntary. In the Boudreau case, Rand J., in delivering his own
judgment, referred to the Ibrahim case and said at pp. 269-70, in a
statement which has been cited in this Court by Hall J. in Piché v. The
Queen[22]
at p. 37 and by Spence J. in Ward v. The Queen[23]
at pp. 39-40:

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex [1914] AC. 599, Rex v.
Voisin (1918) 1 K.B. 531 and Rex v. Prosko 63 S.C.R. 226 lay it down
that the fundamental question is whether the statement is voluntary. No doubt
arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a warning
may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is directed against the danger
of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions. It is the doubt cast
on the truth of the statement arising from the circumstances in which it is
made that gives rise to the rule. What the statement should be is that of a man
free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority and what is
sought is assurance that that is the case. The underlying and controlling
question then remains: is the statement freely and voluntarily made?

[Page 667]

This statement was construed by Pickup C.J.O., in R. v. Fitton[24]
at pp. 714-5 in the following manner:

In my opinion, the Crown does not discharge the onus resting
upon it by merely adducing oral testimony showing that an incriminating
statement made by an accused person was not induced by a promise or by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage. That statement of the rule of law is too
narrow. The admissions must not have been “improperly instigated or induced or
coerced”: per Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King, supra, at p. 269. The
admissions must be self-impelled, and the statement must be the statement of a
man “free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority”. The
statement must be “freely and voluntarily made”. Applying that principle to the
particular facts in this case, I have reached the conclusion that the Crown has
failed to show that the oral statement made by the appellant, or the written
statement made by him immediately afterwards, was free and voluntary.

On the appeal in that case to this Court it was held that the
decision of the Court in Boudreau did not extend in any way the rule
laid down in Ibrahim and that it was still the law that a statement is
admissible in evidence if it is shown that it was voluntary in the sense that
it has not been obtained by fear or prejudice or the hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority.

Rand J., at pp. 962-3, said:

The Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the majority of
the Court of Appeal, has treated the expression “freely and voluntarily”, used
in Boudreau v. The King, as if it connoted only a spontaneous statement,
one unrelated to anything as cause or occasion in the conduct of the police
officers; but with the greatest respect that is an erroneous interpretation of
what was there said. The language quoted must be read primarily in the light of
the matters that were being considered. As the opening words show, there was no
intention of departing from the rule as laid down in the authorities mentioned;
the phrase “free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority”
(Boudreau v. The King, supra, at p. 269) means free from the compulsion
of apprehension of prejudice and the inducement of hope for advantage, if an
admission is or is not made. That fear or hope could be instigated, induced or
coerced, all

[Page 668]

these terms referring to the element in the mind of the
confessor which actuated or drew out the admission.

In an earlier passage at p. 962 he had said:

The rule on the admission of confessions, which, following
the English authorities, was restated in Boudreau v. The King, at times
presents difficulty of application because its terms tend to conceal underlying
considerations material to a determination. The cases of torture, actual or
threatened, or of unabashed promises are clear; perplexity arises when much
more subtle elements must be evaluated. The strength of mind and will of the
accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the effect of questions
or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation of the part they have
played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to decide whether what was
said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free from the influence of
hope or fear aroused by them.

The admissibility of a confession was under consideration by this
Court in two recent cases. In Horvath v. The Queen[25],
the accused voluntarily underwent an interview by a police polygraph operator
lasting for four hours. There was a taped transcript of what he said. During
the interview, the police officer left the accused alone three times. During
these intervals, the accused reflected aloud in what were called monologues or
soliloquies. During the second monologue, the accused admitted killing his
mother. After the second monologue, the accused repeated his confession to the
police officer. In the third monologue, he asked his mother’s forgiveness for
having disclosed the incident. Following that, the accused signed a written
confession.

The trial judge accepted the opinion of a psychiatrist that up to
the end of the second monologue the accused was in a light hypnotic state. He
rejected the confession because the accused, for a sizeable part of the
interview immediately prior to the confession, had been in an hypnotic state.

In this Court, three members of the seven-man panel supporting
the judgment of the Court of

[Page 669]

Appeal for British Columbia held the confession to be admissible
as the hypnotic state had ended before the written confession was made and
there was no evidence that it had been obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage. Two members of the majority held the confession to be inadmissible
because, in all the circumstances, it was not free and voluntary. Spence J., at
p. 408, said:

In my respectful opinion, the judgment of this Court in Fitton
must be limited so as not to rule admissible statements made by the accused
when not induced by hope of advantage or fear or prejudice but which are
certainly not voluntary in the ordinary English sense of the word because they
were induced by other circumstances such as existed in the present case.

The other two members of the majority held that the confession
was not admissible, holding that unconsented hypnosis induced by a person in
authority should be added to the motives for exclusion mentioned in Ibrahim.
The written confession, though made after the accused was in a state of
hypnosis, flew directly from the earlier statement made while under hypnosis.
Therefore it was not voluntary.

Ward v. The Queen[26]
was concerned with the admissibility of a confession in a case involving a
charge of criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. This was a
single vehicle accident. The accused and his lady friend, the deceased, were
found on the ground outside the vehicle. He was unconscious and had to be
revived by mouth to mouth resuscitation administered by the occupants of the
first vehicle to arrive after the accident. In issue in the case was whether
the accused or the deceased was operating the vehicle at the time of the
accident.

The police interviewed the accused about half an hour after the
accident occurred and at the hospital some five or six hours later. To the
police he admitted that he was the driver of the vehicle, although earlier, in
response to a question from the person who had revived him, he said that he was
not. On the voir dire, he said he could remember nothing from the time
he was in the Palliser Hotel,

[Page 670]

Calgary, some hours before the accident. His doctor at the
hospital said the accused could answer simple questions but was unable to tell
him what had happened.

Spence J., delivering the judgment of the Court, cited the
passage above quoted from the reasons of Rand J. in Boudreau and
stressed the concluding words “The underlying and controlling question then
remains: is the statement freely and voluntarily made?” He went on to say at p.
40:

I have underlined the last sentence in Rand J.’s statement
to indicate that in my view the examination of whether there was any hope of
advancement or fear of prejudice moving the accused to make the statements is
simply an investigation of whether the statements were “freely and voluntarily
made”. In my view, there is a further investigation of whether the statements
were freely and voluntarily made even if no hope of advantage or fear of
prejudice could be found in consideration of the mental condition of the
accused at the time he made the statements to determine whether or not the
statements represented the operating mind of the accused. In my view, Manning
J. engaged in a consideration of both the mental and physical condition of the
accused, firstly, to determine whether a person in his condition would be
subject to hope of advancement or fear of prejudice in making the statements,
when perhaps a normal person would not, and, secondly, to determine whether,
due to the mental and physical condition, the words could really be found to be
the utterances of an operating mind. Manning J. had a reasonable doubt of both
issues and, therefore, found the statements to be inadmissible. It is not
denied that a reasonable doubt on the part of the trial judge upon the issue is
sufficient to justify his refusal to admit the statements in evidence.

Horvath and Ward are cases in which, although there
had been no fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held out by a person in
authority, the confessions were excluded essentially because of the existence
of a reasonable doubt as to whether the confession in question was “the
utterance of an operating mind”.

The same question arose in the case of Nagotcha v. The Queen[27].
In that case the trial judge admitted in evidence inculpatory statements

[Page 671]

made by the accused on the day of his arrest and a few months
later when he was being taken to a mental health centre after being remanded
there by a Provincial Court Judge.

The accused did not give evidence on the voir dire, but
evidence was given by a psychiatrist that he diagnosed the accused as a
paranoid schizophrenic. He testified that the accused, initially, was not fit
to stand trial, but his condition improved under treatment and no issue was
raised as to his fitness when the trial began. Insanity was not raised as a
defence.

Chief Justice Laskin, delivering the judgment of the Court
upholding the ruling of the trial judge, said at p. 716:

It is clear that there was evidence upon which the trial
Judge could act in holding that the inculpatory statements were admissible, and
it would be going too far to hold, as an invariable rule, that inculpatory
statements by an insane man were ipso facto inadmissible: see Sinclair
v. The King (1946), 73 C.L.R. 316; R. v. Basto (1954),
91 C.L.R. 628. The main contention that the trial Judge had applied the
wrong test of voluntariness, in respect of statements by a paranoid
schizophrenic was based on an alleged distinction between the test expressed in
R. v. Santinon (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 121, [21 C.R.N.S. 323, [1973] 3
W.W.R. 113], a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the test
expressed by this Court in the judgment delivered by Spence J., in Ward v.
The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 30, [(1979), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 498, 94 D.L.R. (3d)
18], O’Driscoll J., was said to have adopted the Santinon test, and it
was submitted that the Ward case, which had not yet been decided at the
time that the accused was tried, prescribed a different test, one more
favourable to the accused. This is not the way that I read the two cases.

He went on to quote from the judgment of Bull J.A. in Santinon
and that of Spence J. in Ward and held that the trial judge,
although he had not, in terms, used the words “operating mind”, had addressed
himself to the proper considerations.

I have reviewed the authorities in this Court with a view to
showing that, in determining the admissibility of a confession to a person in
author-

[Page 672]

ity, the Court is not immediately concerned with the truth or reliability
of the statement made by the accused, but with the question as to whether the
statement he has made was free and voluntary, within the stated rules and
whether the confession was the utterance of an operating mind.

It has been suggested that this Court adopted a new rule
respecting the admissibility of confessions in its judgment in the case of Alward
and Mooney v. The Queen[28].
I do not agree for the following reasons.

In that case the appellants had been charged with a murder which
occurred in connection with a robbery. At the outset of his judgment, Spence
J., who spoke for the majority of the Court, pointed out, at p. 561, that
although the appellant had submitted a number of grounds for appeal, counsel
for the Crown, respondent, had been called upon to reply only to submissions in
reference to three grounds:

1. The admissibility of evidence of similar acts.

2. The judge’s charge as to intoxication.

3. The application of s. 613 (l)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

The statements of the accused relating to the charge of murder
were found by the trial judge to have been voluntarily made and the Court of
Appeal agreed. Counsel for the respondent was not called upon to submit
argument to this Court on that issue.

Limerick J.A., who delivered the reasons for the Court of Appeal
for New Brunswick[29],
dealt with the admissibility of all of the statements made by the accused, and
not only those concerning the commission of the offence charged, in the
following fashion, at pp. 431-2:

The trial Judge found that all the statements given or made
by the appellant were voluntarily given. The evidence does not disclose that he
erred therein. The rule as originally applied was that no statement made by an
accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it be shown by the
prosecution to have been a voluntary statement in the sense that it has not
been obtained from

[Page 673]

him either by fear of prejudice or hope of favour or
advantage exercised or held out by some one in authority. The term “voluntary”
must always be interpreted in this special sense and not in the sense of being
spontaneous. The fact that some questions may be asked which induce the
statement does not destroy the voluntariness of the statement. This rule of
English criminal law has been adopted by our Courts, which have also, to a
large extent, adopted, by case law, the further English rule of Court that the
statement to be admissible must not be obtained by oppression. I can find no
evidence of such oppression in this case as would justify the Court in setting
aside the finding of the trial Judge.

The fact that Constable Munn said to Sergeant Scott in the
presence of the appellant that the old man has regained consciousness and will
be able to identify his assailants,—although untrue, and might induce a sense
of fear in the appellant, would not render the statement inadmissible. The fear
contemplated by the rule of evidence is not a fear of being caught or
identified or a fear induced by the accused’s guilty conscience but a fear of
reprisal if he failed to talk or give the statement.

The principle on which the rule is founded is that the
accused may have been induced or influenced to say what is untrue and, if being
uncertain whether the statement is true, it would be unsafe to receive a
statement made under any influence of hope or fear.

The true test, therefore, is did the evidence adduced by the
Crown establish that nothing, said or done by any person in authority, could
have induced the accused to make a statement which was or might be untrue because
thereof. The Crown met that test.

It is the last paragraph in this quotation which it is contended
stated a new test as to the admissibility of a statement. It should be noted,
however, that Limerick J.A. at the beginning of the passage quoted the rule as
to voluntariness “adopted by our Courts”. The paragraph in question is related
to the untruthful statement made by the police officers to the accused to the
effect that the victim had regained consciousness and would be able to identify
his assailants. When this paragraph is read in context, I do not regard it as
seeking to break new ground as to the law governing the admissibility of
confessions. Limerick J.A. properly directed himself to the issue of
voluntariness, and, significantly, did not exclude the statements because they
were induced by deception.

[Page 674]

In his reasons in this Court, Spence J. recited from the judgment
of Limerick J.A. the three reasons which had been given by the trial judge for
admitting the statements of the accused about the other occurrences, i.e. two
robberies in motels in which they had been involved. The admissibility of
evidence as to similar acts was one of the three points on which the Court
heard argument.

Spence J. then went on to say at pp. 562-3:

Limerick J.A. concluded after discussing the evidence as to
the statements in detail:

The true test, therefore, is did the evidence adduced by the
Crown establish that nothing, said or done by any person in authority, could
have induced the accused to make a statement which was or might be untrue
because thereof. The Crown met that test.

This Court agreed with that conclusion.

In light of this background, I do not agree that it can be said
that this Court in this casual and indirect manner had adopted any new test for
the admissibility of a confession. That this is so is made manifest by the fact
that in the Horvath case, decided less than two years later, Spence J.,
in his reasons, made no reference to the Alward case. His remarks were
directed to the scope of the judgment in Fitton. Had he considered that
the Alward case defined a new test for the admissibility of a
confession, he would certainly have applied it in the Horvath case.

What is significant in the Alward case, in relation to the
present appeal, is that this Court accepted as admissible statements made by
the accused notwithstanding the fact that the police had knowingly given to the
accused false information to the effect that the victim had regained
consciousness and would be able to identify his assailants. There is no
suggestion in Alward that the confession could be excluded by the trial
judge because of this conduct.

In my opinion the effect of the judgments in this Court as to the
admissibility of confessions is that in order to render the confession admissible
the Crown must meet the requirements stipulated in Ibrahim. Even when
this has been done, there may

[Page 675]

be circumstances involved in connection with the obtaining of the
confession from which the Court may conclude that the confession was not free
and voluntary, e.g. as in Horvath and Ward where there is
a reasonable doubt as to whether the statement was the utterance of an
operating mind. In such a case, the confession is not admissible.

The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. McLeod[30]
is of interest in this connection. Laskin J.A. (as he then was) delivering the
judgment of the Court, said at pp. 103‑4:

The accused, appellant, was with the police at a station for
about an hour during which she was questioned and gave a statement; and
following this she was charged.

Two officers were present during the questioning which was
conducted by one only. He tried, as he said, to put her at her ease, by
questions not directed to the robbery, and then proceeded to narrate the
sequence of events on the night of the robbery. Getting no response from the
accused, he then told her that the complainant was still unconscious, in
hospital and on the critical list. These were lies, as the officer admitted.
The accused, who also gave this account of what the officer told her, said in
her evidence on the “trial within the trial” that she became frightened,
started to cry and proceeded to make a statement. The officer took her into a
smaller room, asked her to repeat her story and typed it. The accused hung back
when asked to sign the typed statement, but did so after (according to her
evidence) the officer told her that it would not incriminate her.

The general principles of law respecting the admissibility
of inculpatory statements have been authoritatively stated for this Court by
the Supreme Court of Canada in Boudreau v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262,
7 C.R. 427, 94 C.C.C. 1, [1949] 3 D.L.R. 81, and reaffirmed in Regina v.
Fitton, [1956] S.C.R. 958, 24 C.R. 371, 116 C.C.C. 1,
6 D.L.R. (2d) 529, 10 Can. Abr. (2nd) 6479. But as Rand and Kellock
JJ. pointed out in the latter case (at p. 962), these principles at times
present difficulty of application because their terms tend to conceal
underlying considerations material to a determination; and they continue:

“The case of torture, actual or threatened, or of unabashed
promises are clear; perplexity arises when

[Page 676]

much more subtle elements must be evaluated. The strength of
mind and will of the accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the
effect of questions or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation
of the part they have played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to
decide whether what was said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free
from the influence of hope or fear aroused by them.”

I hold in the present case, contrary to the ruling of the
trial Judge, that the Crown has not discharged the burden of proof resting upon
it in the matter at issue.

In so holding, I do not rule out as a matter of law all stratagems
that the police or persons in authority may employ in questioning a person
under arrest. The issue in every case, under the governing law, must be whether
they operate or are calculated to operate upon the person to rouse hope of
advantage or fear of prejudice, or by their oppressiveness (to borrow a term
from the English Judges’ Rules) put in doubt at least whether any ensuing
inculpatory statement has been properly elicited. In my view, reinforced by a
reading of the whole record, the lies and associated incidents in this case had
the forbidden effect in inducing the incriminating statement.

Jessup J.A., who was a member of the Court which decided the McLeod
case, said about that case in his judgment in the present case:

In all the circumstances, including the emotional impact on
the accused of the lies told her by the officer which put her in fear, the
court held that the Crown had not satisfied the onus on it of proving the
accused’s statement was voluntary.

The circumstances in the present case are entirely different from
those in the McLeod case. There is no allegation here that the mind of
the accused was affected by the actions of the police officer. No person
thought by the accused to be in authority sought by oppression to coerce, or
even to persuade the accused to make a statement. His statement was made freely
and it was volunteered by him. The circumstances of this case show only that
the accused was mistaken as to the identity of the person with whom he was
talking. The accused

[Page 677]

thought that person was a fellow prisoner, who presented himself
as a sympathetic listener.

For these reasons, in my opinion, the statement was admissible
even if McKnight were to be regarded as a person in authority.

I would dismiss the appeal.

LAMER J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario allowing the Crown’s appeal from an acquittal and directing a new
trial.

Appellant was charged in the Court of the General Sessions of the
Peace, in the Judicial District of Ottawa-Carleton, with possession of cannabis
resin for the purpose of trafficking. The case bears on the admissibility of a
confession. Following a voir dire the County Court Judge ruled this
confession inadmissible and directed an acquittal. The circumstances leading to
the arrest, the accused’s statement and the judge’s ruling are to be found in
the agreed statement of facts[31]
submitted by the parties:

On November 9, 1976 at approximately 2:30 p.m., Sergeant
Woods and Constables Lauzon, Carvish and Gervais of the Ottawa Police Force
conducted a search of apartment 1102, 1365 Bank Street in the City of Ottawa
under the authority of a search warrant. On the premises at that time were
Donal Bonner (D.O.B. 26/06/57), Timothy Hrehoriak (D.O.B. 24/12/60) and the
Respondent (D.O.B. 21/12/45). The Respondent advised Constable Gervais that he
lived on the premises along with one Nancy Olson. In one of the bedrooms,
Sergeant Woods located 128.54 grams of hashish, a set of scales, a cutting
knife and a box of tin foil. Upon analysis, the scales and knife were found to
have traces of hashish.

The Respondent was given a police warning and was then
conveyed to the Ottawa City Police Station at 60 Waller Street along with
Bonner and Hrehoriak. Prior to being lodged in a cell, Constable Gervais asked
the Respondent if he was willing to give a statement but he declined to do so.
The Respondent was later removed from the cell, charged with possession of
hashish for the purposes of trafficking and returned to the same cell.

[Page 678]

On November 10, 1976 at approximately 1:00 a.m., Constable
McKnight, a member of the Ottawa City Police Force acting in an undercover
capacity, was placed in an 8’ x 8’ cell at the Ottawa City Police Station
occupied by the Respondent alone. Constable McKnight was placed in the cell on
the instructions of Constable Gervais, the investigating officer, in order to
obtain information from the Respondent concerning the charge against him.
During the trial, a voir dire was conducted on the question of whether
Constable Earl McKnight was a person in authority. At that time, Constable
McKnight was unarmed, wore blue jeans, a blue jacket and brown boots, and had a
four or five day growth of beard. Constable McKnight testified on the voir
dire that the Respondent appeared to be normal and not under the influence
of alcohol. No other persons or police officers were visible from the cell.
Constable McKnight did not identify himself to the Respondent as a member of
the Ottawa City Police Force and the Respondent did not appear to recognize him
as such.

Upon entering the cell, the Respondent spoke first to
constable McKnight by saying that Constable McKnight “looked like a nark”.
Constable McKnight just laughed and the Respondent continued that he looked
like a nark because of the way he was dressed. Constable McKnight explained
that he was dressed like that because he had been fishing. The Respondent then
asked Constable McKnight why he was in jail and he replied that it was because
of a traffic ticket. Constable McKnight asked the Respondent why he was in jail
and the Respondent stated that it was for possession of hashish. While in the
cell, Constable McKnight sat beside the Respondent on the only bench. The
Respondent then told Constable McKnight that he sold hashish for $25.00 for 3
grams, that the hash that he had been caught with had been “fronted” to him and
that he would have to pay the people back $1,000 because he had been “busted”.
The Respondent stated that he would have made $1,800 on the drugs that he had.
Constable McKnight asked if there were many drugs in the City and the
Respondent replied that there were approximately 40 pounds. The Respondent also
stated that he was arrested at his apartment along with his buddy who was in
the next cell. During the conversation, Constable McKnight informed the
Respondent that he was a truck driver from the Pembroke area and had been
fishing so the Respondent would have the impression that he was not a nark and
that he did not know much about drugs. Constable McKnight indicated that people
in the Pembroke area were interested in drugs and that he would be interested
in getting drugs; however, no deal was set up. The Respondent asked Constable
McKnight when he would be getting out and he

[Page 679]

replied that a buddy would be coming down to pay the fine.
The Respondent stated that he had to go to court the next morning because he
was on parole respecting other charges. Constable McKnight was released from
the cell at 1:07 a.m. and made his notes concerning the conversation shortly thereafter.

After Constable McKnight testified on the voir dire the
Respondent called no evidence on the issue of whether Constable McKnight was a
person in authority.

After argument by counsel, His Honour Judge Matheson ruled
that in all the circumstances, Constable McKnight was a person in authority.

No further evidence was called by the Crown on the voir
dire on the issue of whether the statements made by the Respondent to
Constable McKnight were voluntary. The Respondent did not request any other
Crown witnesses to be produced for cross‑examination on the voir dire and
did not call any evidence on this issue.

After argument by counsel, His Honour Judge Matheson ruled
that the “continuation of the intent to obtain a statement by this disguise”
puts into doubt whether the inculpatory statement had properly been elicited
and was therefore inadmissible.

The Crown called no further evidence at trial and at the
request of Crown Counsel and the direction of His Honour Judge Matheson, the
jury returned a verdict of “not guilty” of possession.

The majority in the Court of Appeal (Jessup and Weatherston
JJ.A., Dubin J.A., dissenting) was of the opinion that the police officer to
whom the statement was made was not, for the purpose of determining the
admissibility of the statement, a “person in authority”, and that the
statement, if relevant, was admissible without any voir dire being held
to determine whether it met the special test set out in Ibrahim v. The King[32].
This conclusion, as regards the police officer, was arrived at by adopting and
applying a subjective test followed by many Canadian courts[33]
which is summarized by Kaufman in his third edition of The Admissi-

[Page 680]

bility of Confessions, in the following terms (at p. 81):

The true test, it is submitted, is highly subjective: Did
the accused truly believe, at the time he made the declaration, that the person
he dealt with had some degree of power over him? In other words, did the
accused think that the person to whom he confessed (or as a result of whose intervention
he confessed) could either make good his promise or carry out his threats? If
so, such person should be treated as a person in authority; if not, the rules
which attach to persons in authority need not be applied, even though the
person, from a purely objective point of view, was in a position of
undoubted authority.

I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal for Ontario that, for
the purpose only of determining whether the statement was or was not obtained
“by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority”, (Ibrahim v. The King, supra, at p. 609), the test is a
subjective one and that, under the circumstances of this case, Officer McKnight
was not a person in authority.

However, I should add here that whilst the subjectivity of this
test is due to what many consider a rationalization (i.e. the possible
unreliability_ of the statement) of the voluntariness rule as enunciated in Ibrahim
v. The King, (i.e. without fear of prejudice or hope of advantage),
the conclusion that the police officer was not a person in authority is a
fiction that is necessary only if the rule is couched in terms of
voluntariness, and that it is no longer so when the rule is enunciated in terms
of reliability.

Having decided that the statement was not made to a person in
authority, the Ontario Court of Appeal[34]
further stated (at p. 381):

Even if the undercover officer in this case had been
regarded by the accused as a person in authority, the conditions laid down in Ibrahim
as to the voluntariness of the accused’s statements had been met. There is
no suggestion in the agreed facts of a fear of prejudice exercised by Officer
McKnight or a hope of favour held out by him.

[Page 681]

This second conclusion was predicated on the decision of this
Court in the case of R. v. Fitton[35],
in which it reaffirmed what it had said in Boudreau v. The King[36],
adopting the often quoted rule set out in Ibrahim, supra, where Lord
Sumner said (at p. 609):

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement,
in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.

It is interesting to note that Lord Sumner went on to say (at pp.
610-11):

It is to be observed that logically these objections all go
to the weight and not to the admissibility of the evidence. What a person
having knowledge about the matter in issue says of it is itself relevant to the
issue as evidence against him. That he made the statement under circumstances
of hope, fear, interest or otherwise strictly goes only to its weight. In an
action of tort evidence of this kind could not be excluded when tendered
against a tortfeasor, though a jury might well be told as prudent men to think
little of it. Even the rule which excludes evidence of statements made by a
prisoner, when they are induced by hope held out, or fear inspired, by a person
in authority, is a rule of policy. “A confession forced from the mind by the
flattery of hope or by the torture of fear comes in so questionable a shape,
when it is to be considered as evidence of guilt, that no credit ought to be
given to it”; Rex v. Warwickshall [sic] ((1783) 1 Leach, 263). It
is not that the law presumes such statements to be untrue, but from the danger
of receiving such evidence judges have thought it better to reject it for the
due administration of justice: Reg. v. Baldry ((1852) 2 Den. Cr. C. 430,
at p. 445). Accordingly, when hope or fear was not in question, such statements
were long regularly admitted as relevant, though with some reluctance and
subject to strong warnings as to their weight.

[Page 682]

In his dissenting opinion, Dubin J.A. of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, after saying (at p. 385) that “…one of the reasons assigned for the
rule, as stated in Ibrahim v. The King, supra, is that a confession made
under such circumstances may be untrue, but it does not follow that where the
truth of the confession is no longer in issue that it necessarily becomes
admissible”, concluded that, whatever may be its philosophical basis, the rule
was not exhaustive. He then went on to recognize that a judge has a discretion
to exclude a statement to a person in authority if it was obtained in a manner
which transgresses his right to remain silent (at p. 386):

In my respectful opinion, the rules respecting confessions
and privilege against self‑incrimination are related. I use that term in
the sense of the right of a person under arrest to remain silent when
questioned by law enforcement officers.

I am in agreement with Dubin J.A. that the reliability test is
not the only test of the admissibility of a statement against an accused. I
also agree that a trial judge should have the power to exclude, whether he had
or not until now, under certain circumstances, statements for reasons,
hereinafter stated, quite unrelated to their reliability and even though these statements
may be of great probative value. I would not however, with deference, predicate
the exercise of that power on an extension of the privilege against
self-crimination that would sanction in that way a suspect’s right to remain
silent (see Marcoux and Solomon v. The Queen[37]).
If and to the extent Dubin J.A. does so, I cannot agree with him. In Marcoux
and Solomon v. The Queen, my brother Dickson speaking for the Court (Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré
JJ.) explained the extent to which that doctrine exists in Canada (at pp.
768-9):

[Page 683]

The limit of the privilege against self-incrimination is
clear. The privilege is the privilege of a witness not to answer a question
which may incriminate him. That is all that is meant by the Latin maxim nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare, often incorrectly advanced in support of a much
broader proposition.

…

As applied to witnesses generally, the privilege must be
expressly claimed by the witness when the question is put to him in the witness
box, Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 5. As applied to an
accused, the privilege is the right to stand mute. An accused cannot be asked,
much less compelled, to enter the witness box or to answer incriminating questions.
If he chooses to testify, the protective shield, of course, disappears. In
short, the privilege extends to the accused qua witness and not qua accused,
it is concerned with testimonial compulsion specifically and not with
compulsion generally: Attorney-General of Quebec v. Begin [1955] S.C.R.
593; In re Validity of Section 92(4) of the Vehicles Act 1957 (Sask.) [1958]
S.C.R. 608; see also the helpful article “Is there a right against
self-incrimination in Canada” by Professor Ed. Ratushny, (1973) 19 McGill
Law Journal 1.

In Canada the right of a suspect not to say anything to the
police is not the result of a right of no self-crimination but is merely the
exercise by him of the general right enjoyed in this country by anyone to do
whatever one pleases, saying what one pleases or choosing not to say certain
things, unless obliged to do otherwise by law. It is because no law says that a
suspect, save in certain circumstances[38],
must say anything to the police that we say that he has the right to remain silent,
which is a positive way of explaining that there is on his part no legal
obligation to do otherwise. His right to silence here rests on the same
principle as his right to free speech, but not on a right to no
self-crimination. Therefore any frustration of his choice not to say
anything is not an encroachment to a right to no self-crimination for he has
such a right only “qua witness” and “qua accused” as explained in
Solomon (supra). This is not to say that the fact that an
arrested person’s choice to remain silent has been frustrated is to be
disre-

[Page 684]

garded; it is surely one of the circumstances to be taken into
account by the judge when considering the admissibility of his statement by
applying the test I will describe further on, but it is only one of the
circumstances and would not of necessity result in excluding a statement as
would be the case if suspects enjoyed in Canada as encompassing a privilege
against self-crimination as that which they do in the United States. But I
should like to add here, that I agree with Dubin J.A. that the rule is related
to the privilege against self-crimination for it is, in my opinion, predicated
in part on the right an accused person enjoys not to be compelled to testify;
but in part only, for the rule is also the result of a desire on the part of
the judges to protect the system’s respectability and, as a result, its very
acceptance by its constituency.

Over the years judges and scholars (see Vincent Del Buono,
“Voluntariness and Confessions: A Question of Fact or Question of Law?”,
(1976-77) 19 Crim. L.Q. 100, at pp. 100-01; E.J. Ratushny,
“Self-incrimination: Nailing the Coffin Shut”, (1977-78) 20 Crim. L.Q. 312,
“Unravelling Confessions”, (1970-71) 13 Crim. L.Q. 453; G.A. Martin, “The
Admissibility of Confessions and Statements”, (1962-63) 5 Crim. L.Q. 35; A.C.
Hutchinson and N.R. Withington, “Horvath v. The Queen: Reflections
on the Doctrine of Confessions”, (1980) 18 Osgoode Hall L.J. 146) have minutely
analysed Lord Sumner’s choice of words in Ibrahim in order to determine
the scope of the rule governing the admission of statements by a suspect to
persons in authority (at p. 609): “. a voluntary statement, in the sense that
it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority”.

Some judges have given those words a strict interpretation and
have held that the only circumstances where the exclusionary rule will operate
are to be found in the words “fear of prejudice” and “hope of advantage” and
only when such

[Page 685]

“fear” or “hope” has been “exercised or held out by a person in
authority”.

Others have relied on other passages of the judgment, and have
concluded that those same words should not be regarded as exhaustive, but as
merely illustrative of those circumstances which would render a statement
involuntary (see: Vincent Del Buono, supra, at p. 104). Their reason for
doing so is that they felt that the test was not a true
dictionary-sense-of-the-word “voluntariness” test but in fact a “reliability”
test. This interpretation of Lord Sumner’s use of the word “voluntary” is
justified, they say, by his apparent rationalization of the rule when he quoted
R. v. Warickshall[39]
to the effect that (at pp. 610-11) “A confession forced from the mind by the
flattery of hope or by the torture of fear comes in so questionable a shape,
when it is to be considered as evidence of guilt, that no credit ought to be
given to it”. Others found they had an even wider discretion by relying on another
passage of Lord Sumner’s remarks where he said (at p. 611): “It is not that the
law presumes such statements to be untrue, but from the danger of receiving
such evidence judges have thought it better to reject it for the due
administration of justice.”

Much has been written and said about this rule (voluntariness),
its alleged underlying policy (reliability), and the existence and scope of a
residual discretion. In a recent decision, Alward and Mooney v. The Queen[40],
this Court appeared to have recognized that the “qualified” voluntariness test
was not to be construed restrictively, was not exhaustive; and that evidence
that anything done by the authorities that casts some doubt as to the accused
having been induced to make a possible unreliable statement will be
sufficient to have it excluded, whether what the authorities have done is or is
not susceptible of instilling in the mind of the accused “fear of prejudice” or
of creating “hope of advantage”.

[Page 686]

In that case, the accused Alward had made a statement to the
police whilst under arrest on suspicion of murder. The statement was elicited
as the result of a lie by a police officer to the effect that the victim, who
in reality was still in a comatose state, had recovered consciousness and would
be able to identify his assailants. A full bench of this Court agreed with the
conclusion of the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick when that Court said, in
dealing with the admissibility of that statement, per Limerick J.A. (at
p. 562):

The true test, therefore, is did the evidence adduced by the
Crown establish that nothing, said or done by any person in authority, could
have induced the accused to make a statement which was or might be untrue
because thereof. The Crown met that test.

Though this Court simply stated (at p. 563): “This Court agreed
with that conclusion”, it appears to me to be a clear and unequivocal finding
that should have put an end, if not to all controversies surrounding the
confession rule, at least to those concerning whether the rule is mainly a
reliability test or a voluntariness one, and, if reliability be the test,
whether it is limited to “fear of prejudice” and “hope of advantage” or
general. The three sets of reasons to be found a year later in this Court’s
decision in the case of Horvath v. The Queen[41],
are an indication that such is far from being the case.

While reliability is invoked by most courts as being the
rationale for the rule when dealing with lies by the police as to their true
identity (i.e. the subjective test as to whether a person is a person in
authority), there is a general reluctance to adjust the formulation of the rule
to that alleged rationale. There is also a feeling that, whether the test is
voluntariness or reliability, it is not exhaustive.

This reluctance is quite justified, for reliability, as I will
attempt to demonstrate later on, is not

[Page 687]

really the rationale for the rule but part of the rule itself,
part of the test.

Indeed, why have a special exclusionary rule dealing with the
reliability of usually highly prejudicial statements made by suspects to
persons in authority when we already have an exclusionary rule dealing with
unduly prejudicial evidence that is of slight probative value (R. v.
Wray[42],
R. v. Cook[43],
Noor Mohamed v. The King[44],
Stirland v. D.P.P.[45],
Maxwell v. D.P.P.[46]).
Assuming that, not to be redundant, this special exclusionary rule is intended
to deal with statements that could not be excluded as being of slight probative
value, one then wonders why we have, as a question of policy, imposed a higher
standard of probative value for “statements” before letting the trier of fact
be apprised of the very existence of such evidence. Put in other words, what is
the policy consideration that overrides the application of the fundamental evidentiary
rule that the weight of evidence, when relevant and, if highly prejudicial, of
more than slight probative value, is for the trier of fact? Indicia as to the
answer to this question are to be found in the very formulation of the test,
whether one adopts, as this Court did, Limerick J.A.’s test in Alward and
Mooney (supra) or that of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim (supra).
If the concern with statements made to persons in authority was primarily a
concern about their reliability why then should we only be concerned when “the
hope” or “the fear” entertained by the suspect is due to its having been “exercised
or held out by a person in authority” (the Ibrahim formulation) or
only when the unreliability is the result of something having been “said or
done by any person in authority” (the Alward and Mooney formulation)?
The other statements, those where the hope or fear or unreliability is not the
doing of the authorities, are no less unreliable; furthermore, it is not
because the possible unreliability of the statement is the result of what
persons in authority have said or done that the trier of fact is any less
capable of weighing that evidence and should be

[Page 688]

precluded from doing so through an exclusionary rule.

As regards whether the test, be it reliability or voluntariness,
is considered by judges as being exhaustive, Chief Justice Freedman in an
article he wrote (S. Freedman, “Admissions and Confessions”, at pp. 95 et
seq., in R.E. Salhany and R.J. Carter, ed., Studies in Canadian Criminal
Evidence, 1972) had this to say (at p. 99):

It is justice then that we seek, and within its broad
framework we may find the true reasons for the rule excluding induced
confessions. Undoubtedly, as already stated, the main reason for excluding them
is the danger that they may be untrue. But there are other reasons, stoutly
disclaimed by some judges, openly professed by others, and silently
acknowledged by still others—the last perhaps being an instance of an
‘inarticulate major premise’ playing its role in decision-making. These
reasons, all of them, are rooted in history. They are touched with memories of
torture and the rack, they are bound up with the cause of individual freedom, and
they reflect a deep concern for the integrity of the judicial process. [The
underlining is mine]

A close look at the reported cases substantiates quite
convincingly what Chief Justice Freedman said; trial judges are sanctioning,
when appropriate, what they think is, under the circumstances of each case,
seriously unfair, oppressive, or undesirable conduct on the part of persons in
authority by excluding even reliable statements through a liberal
interpretation of the voluntariness rule or of the reliability test, whichever
is more convenient, and quite understandably through a more stringent
application of the rules of evidence concerning the credibility of witnesses
and the burdens of proof and of persuasion that rest upon the shoulders of the
authorities.

Former Chief Justice Gale, of Ontario, had this to say when,
as a trial judge, he delivered judgment on a voir dire (R. v.
McCorkell, cited in “Notes and Comments”, (1964-65) 7 Crim. L.Q. 395, at
pp. 396-7):

[Page 689]

…I am prepared to conclude that they went there in perfectly
good faith to speak to the accused. They cautioned him again and he made
certain disclosures. Strictly speaking, I concede that these statements were
probably voluntary on his part within the meaning of that word under the
authorities. However, in my discretion, I am not going to allow them to be
admitted as part of the trial, believing as I do that the sanctity of the
relationship between a solicitor and his client is not to be lightly frittered
away and ought not to be violated, even though innocently as in this case.

It is my opinion that once an accused person has retained
counsel to the knowledge of the police or other persons in authority, the
latter ought not to endeavour to interview and question that accused person
without first seeking and obtaining the concurrence of his solicitor. So
strong is my view in this respect that I am therefore exercising my discretion
in the way I have indicated, perhaps wrongly, because, strictly speaking, the
statement thus procured was probably admissible. I decline, however, to
give any encouragement in the future to persons in authority to circumvent the
position of an accused’s solicitor by going directly to speak to the accused.
[The underlining is mine]

He was one of those who, to use the terms of Chief Justice
Freedman, “openly professed” what a great many more “silently”, but not less
effectively, “acknowledge”.

Bringing about a guilty suspect to admit guilt in a statement is
not in itself an improper activity. It is only to be repressed if it is done in
a way that offends our basic values, that is in a manner which be contrary to
the rules of law we have developed for their protection and furtherance. Our
criminal justice system has vested the courts with two responsibilities: the
protection of the innocent against conviction; and the protection of the system
itself by ensuring that the repression of crime through the conviction of the
guilty is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values as a society.
These concerns have brought about the elaboration by judges and legislatures of
procedural and evidentiary safeguards. The concern for the innocent resulted in
the reasonable doubt rule (the burden of persuasion) and, considering the
individual citizen’s position when facing the awesome power of the state, in
our putting on the

[Page 690]

shoulders of the state the burden of proof; the concern for the
process’ respectability resulted in three corollaries:

1. the right for any person not to be convicted through the
use against him or her of evidence adduced under oath through compulsion by the
law (the protection afforded by s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970,c.E-10),

2. the right for an accused not to be compelled as a witness
at his own trial,

3. the exclusion of statements the admission of which
because of conduct on the part of authorities would be more damaging to the
systems reputation than that resulting from a guilty accused’s acquittal.

It is on the second and third of these corollaries that the rule
as regards the admissibility of confessions is predicated and it is with regard
to this rationalization that the rule should be formulated and then applied.

As I have said earlier, if there existed in Canada a general
right to no self-crimination, any statement made by a person to persons in
authority other than a voluntary statement would not, at a minimum, be
admissible in evidence against that person at his or her trial. As that right
(apart from the protection of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act ) is
limited to one’s right not to be compelled as a witness in one’s trial, it is
only if and to the extent the statement is used by the Crown in a way that
would amount to such compulsion that the statement should be excluded.

Evidence tendered by the Crown will usually quite normally have
the effect of eventually forcing the accused to take the stand or stand convicted.
One could not say that by doing so the Crown transgresses the accused’s right
to stay mute. The accused’s right to stay mute or to testify is a choice he
will make in light of the probative value of the evidence adduced in and
against his interest.

Special considerations however arise when dealing with
statements, which, as we all know, are, when tendered in evidence by the Crown,
in some way damaging to the accused’s defence. That there

[Page 691]

need be a special approach to statements is not because they are
frequently unreliable but because any unreliability surrounding them will
usually be adduced only through the accused’s own testimony. Elements affecting
a statement’s reliability, when present, generally have the effect of forcing
the accused into the witness stand and then, if this were to happen before the
trier of fact, being subject to cross-examination at large. But this is equally
so of other types of evidence and is not, nor should it be, reason in itself
for excluding evidence. One surely cannot say that because the Crown is
tendering as evidence a statement of alleged questionable reliability that it
is, any more so than in the case of other types of evidence, indirectly
transgressing the accused’s right not to testify by forcing him to take the
stand and to attack its reliability. But I think that such is the case if the
Crown’s agents are responsible by what they said or did for the possible
presence of these elements of unreliability, whatever might those words or that
conduct have been.

As a result a first conclusion may be drawn: a statement before
being left to the trier of fact for consideration of its probative value should
be the object of a voir dire in order to determine, not whether the
statement is or is not reliable, but whether the authorities have done or said
anything that could have induced the accused to make a statement which was or
might be untrue. It is of the utmost importance to keep in mind that the
inquiry is not concerned with reliability but with the authorities’ conduct as
regards reliability. In passing, I should like to mention that considering
whether a confession, the reliability of which has been confirmed by real
evidence, should be treated differently from others, whether an accused
testifying oh a voir dire should be asked questions relating to the
statement’s truthfulness, and indeed the very definition of a “person in
authority”, are matters that, given the opportunity to do so, should be
considered in the light of that important distinction.

This first conclusion leads naturally to certain others: that
reliability is not the rationale of the voluntariness test, also, that
voluntariness, as Lord

[Page 692]

Sumner himself recognized in Ibrahim, (“voluntariness” but
“in the sense that it has not been obtained…”) is not really the test.

The first rationale for the confession rule is the repression of
conduct on the part of the authorities that indirectly frustrates an accused’s
right not to testify; the test that corresponds to this first rationale is whether
the authorities did anything in eliciting those statements that might affect
its reliability.

Would this then mean that voluntariness is of no relevance
whatever? I think not. Clearly, the elicitation, against a suspect’s will, of a
statement usually will, though not always, be the result on the part of the
authorities of conduct that will be such as might affect that statement’s
reliability. But what if not? What if, as in this case, the statement was the
result of a ruse or again what if the authorities resorted to truth serum, or
hypnotism, but did nothing to render that statement unreliable? As I have
stated earlier, mere lack of voluntariness cannot as such be a reason for
excluding a statement as there is no general right to no self-crimination.

Now let us assume that the statement is unreliable, but through
no fault on the part of the authorities; if at the same time it was extracted
from the suspect against his will as a result of what the authorities have said
or did, could it not be argued that, by eliciting the statement, the
authorities, though not responsible for unreliable evidence going to the trier
of fact, are none the less responsible for the accused’s having to take the
stand and that, as a result, all involuntary statements should be excluded as a
breach by the Crown of the accused’s right not to be compelled to testify?

It is of importance, before answering this question, to bear in
mind the difference between the situation where the authorities will be
responsible for the trier of fact being given a possible unreli-

[Page 693]

able statement by conduct which is the very cause of such
unreliability and that where they are responsible but only because they
elicited such a statement against the accused’s will.

Indeed, though we have shifted from considering conduct of the
authorities that might affect the statement’s reliability to that of
considering their conduct which affects a suspect’s free will, we have not
changed the purpose for doing so, namely, the protection of the accused’s right
not to be compelled to testify at his trial; we are therefore concerned with
his free will only to the extent its frustration has an adverse effect on that
right. If lack of voluntariness, when considered in this way, were to result
automatically in the exclusion of all unwilling statements this would then be,
in my opinion, an overextension of the right of an accused to stand mute, and
would amount to introducing indirectly into our system a facet of the general
privilege of no self-crimination we do not have in this country. Should this
then mean that lack of voluntariness is but relevant if it is the result of
conduct on the part of the authorities that might affect the statement’s
reliability? In fact, that voluntariness per se is irrelevant? And if this
is so, would this necessarily mean that the reliability test is exhaustive.

One should expect but few of the guilty to admit spontaneously
their wrongdoing and should recognize that such admissions when made in or out
of court are, more often than not, the result of the effectiveness of the
investigative forces. As I have said earlier, there is nothing inherently wrong
in outsmarting criminals into admitting their guilt or into jeopardizing the
liberty they might be tempted to take with the truth in the course of their
trial. Our concern with voluntariness, apart from its aforementioned relation
to unreliability, is part of, and, for that reason, in a sense limited to when
it equates to, a more general concern we have for the integrity of the criminal
justice system. As the criminal justice system exists for the protection of the
values we cherish the most as a society, we

[Page 694]

consider it counter-productive to the very aims and purposes of
the system to admit as evidence against an accused a statement elicited by
means that amount to a blatant disregard for those values and others of equal
importance we are seeking to protect through the prosecution of his alleged
crime. Lack of voluntariness (when not due to conduct by the authorities
resulting in possible unreliability) will be of concern if the methods resorted
to by the authorities in eliciting that unwilling statement have that negative
effect.

This concern by the courts for the protection of the integrity of
the system has always been present when defining voluntariness, its alleged (in
my opinion wrongly so) rationale, and the existence of some residual
discretion. Unfortunately, because this concern was not clearly identified and
dealt with in an autonomous and comprehensive way, endeavours to rationalize
the confession rule have given somewhat blurred results. This difficulty was
compounded by the fact that we have tried to accommodate this concern within
the two parameters of the Ibrahim pronouncement: voluntariness and
reliability. As a result, the extent to which we have stretched the
voluntariness test to deal on an ad hoc basis with statements that had
to be excluded but could not be so through the reliability test has clashed
with another quite legitimate concern we have also had not to jeopardize the
police in their work. The reasons given by this Court in Horvath and
indeed in many other cases by other courts amply illustrate the point. There
are situations where it is desirable that a statement that is not voluntary be
admitted, and there are other situations where it should certainly not—(I am
speaking here of voluntariness in a wide sense and where lack of voluntariness
is not the result of conduct by the authorities that would be dealt with
through the reliability test). In fact there are situations where a statement,
though given voluntarily in any sense one can reasonably give to that word and
notwithstanding the absence of any conduct on the part of the authorities that
might affect its reliability, should nevertheless be exclud-

[Page 695]

ed as seriously damaging the system’s respectability. Lack of
voluntariness is but a symptom that might indicate, but not necessarily so,
that the authorities have done something that could have induced the accused to
make an unreliable statement or that the statement was elicited in a way
damaging to the system’s integrity. For this reason it is preferable that
voluntariness not be referred to when enunciating the rule (nor indirectly so
through the use of expressions such as—oppression—not the result of a free
operating mind—the result of a complete emotional disintegration) as it is only
one of the factors to be considered along with many others, when deciding if
the tendering as evidence of a statement would damage the system’s integrity or
whether it would amount to a transgression of the accused’s right not to
testify.

As regards the reliability test, I find it convenient and
appropriate to retain the Alward formulation since it seems to have
already met with some approval in this Court, to which should be added, in
order to deal with our concern for the integrity of the judicial process, a
norm and its formulation that has already met with the approval of Parliament
when enacting s. 178.16  of the Criminal Code :

178.16 (1) A private communication that has been
intercepted is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the
communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

(a) the interception was lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by
the originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof;

but evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private communication is not
inadmissible by reason only that the private communication is itself
inadmissible as evidence.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the judge or
magistrate presiding at any proceedings may refuse to admit evidence obtained
directly or indirectly as a result of information acquired by interception of a
private communication that is itself inadmissible as evidence

[Page 696]

where he is of the opinion that the admission thereof
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. [The underlining
is mine]

…

Therefore, the rules regarding the admissibility of statements by
an accused to persons in authority may be enunciated in the following manner:

1. A statement made by the accused to a person in authority
is inadmissible if tendered by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding unless
the judge is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that nothing said or done by
any person in authority could have induced the accused to make a statement
which was or might be untrue;

2. A statement made by the accused to a person in authority
and tendered by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding against him, though
elicited under circumstances which would not render it inadmissible, shall
nevertheless be excluded if its use in the proceedings would, as a result of
what was said or done by any person in authority in eliciting the statement,
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

I would emphasize that under the above mentioned second rule the
judge is not exercising a pure discretion to exclude, as is the case under s.
178.16(2)  of the Criminal Code , and that his finding is to be dealt with
in appeal as any other finding, subject to the differences and limits of the
Appeal Court’s jurisdiction as defined by ss. 603  and 605  of the Criminal
Code .

I hasten to say also that, if the second portion of the rule is
not a true discretion, it is even less a blanket discretion given judges to
repudiate through an exclusionary rule any conduct on the part of the
authorities a given judge might consider somewhat unfortunate, distasteful or
inappropriate. There first must be a clear connection between the obtaining of
the statement and the conduct; furthermore that conduct must be so shocking as
to justify the judicial branch of the criminal justice system in feeling that,
short of disassociating itself from such conduct through rejection of the
statement, its reputation and, as a result, that of the whole criminal justice
system, would be brought into disrepute.

[Page 697]

The judge, in determining whether under the circumstances the use
of the statement in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute, should consider all of the circumstances of the proceedings,
the manner in which the statement was obtained, the degree to which there was a
breach of social values, the seriousness of the charge, the effect the
exclusion would have on the result of the proceedings. It must also be borne in
mind that the investigation of crime and the detection of criminals is not a
game to be governed by the Marquess of Queens-bury rules. The authorities, in
dealing with shrewd and often sophisticated criminals, must sometimes of
necessity resort to tricks or other forms of deceit and should not through the
rule be hampered in their work. What should be repressed vigorously is conduct
on their part that shocks the community. That a police officer pretend to be a
lock-up chaplain and hear a suspect’s confession is conduct that shocks the
community; so is pretending to be the duty legal-aid lawyer eliciting in that
way incriminating statements from suspects or accused; injecting Pentothal into
a diabetic suspect pretending it is his daily shot of insulin and using his
statement in evidence would also shock the community; but generally speaking,
pretending to be a hard drug addict to break a drug ring would not shock the
community; nor would, as in this case, pretending to be a truck driver to
secure the conviction of a trafficker; in fact, what would shock the community
would be preventing the police from resorting to such a trick.

It must be remembered that the first part of the rule, the
reliability test, will have dealt with most of the situations and that the
second part of the rule would come into operation on very rare occasions since
such conduct would usually have some effect on the reliability of the
statement. Nevertheless, it is in my opinion all the more important to have a
rule that is available to deal with those situations which, thanks to the high
standard of conduct of the vast majority of our police officers, will be very
few but for that reason all the more deserving of immediate and vigorous
rebuke.

[Page 698]

Applying the rule to this case, the trial judge had to ask
himself if he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the lie by Constable
McKnight to the accused could not have induced him into making a statement that
might be untrue. It appears from what he said that he was satisfied that the
lie did not have that effect. Applying the rule in the Ibrahim formulation
he said (A.C., at p. 31):

In the instant case I am satisfied that what Rothman said to
Const. Earl Grant McKnight, and I might add, who was acting in the performance
of his duty, would seem to have been free of both fear and prejudice, and free
as well of hope of advantage by reason of the facts that he had been mislead or
tricked into believing that he was speaking to a person actually held in
custody.

But, he then went on to say:

However, in light of the facts of this particular case, I
believe that continuation of the intent to obtain a statement by this disguise
puts into doubt whether the inculpatory statement had been properly elicited,
and I feel that in the circumstances that I must rule against admissibility
herein.

In coming to this last conclusion he committed in my opinion an
error in law by applying the wrong test. To exclude the statement it was not
sufficient that the judge have a doubt that it was elicited improperly; he had
to find that the improper conduct on the part of the police, that is, to use
his words, the “continuation of the intent to obtain a statement by this disguise”,
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

Applying that test, I cannot but come to the conclusion that
there was no impropriety committed on the part of the police that would result
in bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. I, therefore, agree
with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in law and
that a new trial should be ordered.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Murder—Manslaughter—Non-direction by trial judge—Review of evidence by
trial judge—Defence of drunkenness—Other defence not put to jury—Criminal Code ,
ss. 212 (a)(ii), 618(1) .

The appellant and the deceased, both
alcoholic, respectively 27 and 64 years old, had been drinking all day. An
argument developed. The appellant was kicked twice and then proceeded to both
beat and kick the deceased. The actual cause of death was suffocation,
occasioned by the fact that as a result of a blow which fractured the jaw of
the deceased, his denture was broken in two, and lodged at the back of his
throat. The appellant was charged with murder and convicted.

Counsel for the appellant, in his opening
statement to the jury stated that how the deceased had died was not in issue.
He stated that the only issue raised by the defence was as to whether the
appellant was too intoxicated to form the intent to kill, or the intent to cause
bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death.

The appellant’s appeal was dismissed by the
Court of Appeal.

Three grounds of appeal were raised in this
Court: 1) Failure by the trial judge to relate the cause of death and the
quality of actual bodily harm caused to the requisite intent under s. 212 (a)(ii);
2) Failure by the trial judge to instruct the jury that a verdict of
manslaughter was available apart from the defence of drunkenness and that if
the appellant lacked the knowledge that the bodily harm occasioned to the
deceased was likely to cause death the appellant could not be convicted of
murder; 3) Misdirection with respect to the defence of drunkenness.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Dickson, Estey and Lamer JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 40]

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Beetz, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ.: In relation to the first point:
Every summing up must be regarded in: the light of the conduct of the trial and
the questions which have been raised by counsel for the prosecution and for the
defence respectively. In a case which has not occupied a great deal of time and
in which the issue, guilt or innocence can be simply and clearly stated, it is
not a fatal defect to the summing-up that the evidence has not been discussed
by the trial judge. Here, the jury knew from the evidence of the accused that
he had delivered kicks to the head of a frail and elderly man and desisted only
when his body was still. Error in law was not established with respect to the
first point.

In relation to the second point: The trial
judge made it clear to the jury that they could not convict the appellant of
murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
knew that the bodily harm was likely to cause death and that otherwise a verdict
of manslaughter was available. In this case, where the sole defence was that
the accused was too drunk to be able to form either the intent necessary to
convict him of murder, it was not necessary to leave before the jury the
defence, which had never been raised, that the accused, apart from drunkenness,
did not know that the bodily harm was likely to cause death.

In relation to the third point: The
instruction to the jury in respect of the defence of drunkenness was in
accordance with the decisions of this Court and was not seriously challenged by
the appellant whose real submission was that the law as to drunkenness should
be reconsidered. This is not a proper case to undertake that reconsideration.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson, Estey and Lamer JJ., dissenting: The trial judge’s
charge to the jury as regards the defence of drunkenness conformed to the law
as laid down by the House of Lords and by this Court. This is not a proper case
to reconsider this area of the law as the Court has been invited to reconsider
only the test of “capacity” and not the logic and desirability of categorizing
offences as of general or specific intent.

However, the trial judge had the duty to
submit to the jury any defence other than that of drunkenness which had been
revealed by the evidence or which could have been reasonably inferred from the
evidence. As the injuries inflicted upon the deceased were not of a fatal type
and as they were the cause of the victim’s death only because he had dentures
that broke and obturated

[Page 41]

his larynx, the jury should have been told
that even if they were of the view that the accused had the capacity to know
that the blows were likely to cause death, they should nevertheless acquit of
murder and reach a verdict of manslaughter if, when considering circumstances
other than intoxication, such as, the very nature of the blows, and the
position the blows in fact occupied in the chain of causation, they had a
reasonable doubt that he did in fact know. When considering the charge as a whole,
one cannot but conclude that the jury was probably left with the impression
that a verdict of manslaughter was dependent only upon the success of the
defence of drunkenness. A new trial should be ordered.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, dismissing the
appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a charge of murder. Appeal dismissed,
Laskin C.J. and Dickson, Estey and Lamer JJ., dissenting.

Brian H. Greenspan, for the appellant.

Ross B. Lundy, for the respondent.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Dickson, Estey
and Lamer JJ. were delivered by

LAMER J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. By that judgment the Court dismissed Robert George Young’s appeal
from a conviction for murder at the Assizes at Cobourg, Ontario, on an
indictment charging that he: “…on or about the 3rd day of June, 1975, at the
Town of Port Hope, in the County of Northumberland did murder Joseph Anthony
MacNeill contrary to the Criminal Code  of Canada”. Leave to appeal to this
Court was granted at large.

The evidence led at trial disclosed that the
appellant, a young alcoholic, and the deceased, an elderly alcoholic, had met a
couple of weeks previ-

[Page 42]

ous to the evening of the latter’s death, and had
become drinking partners in that period of time. On June 2, 1975, the pair
commenced a bout of drinking early in the morning and continued to imbibe
throughout the day. There is evidence of steady alcohol consumption up until
the time of death early the next morning (i.e., approximately 3:00 a.m.).

A third party resident of the apartment had
returned at about that hour, to find the appellant crying and repeating that he
had killed the deceased but had not meant to do it. The autopsy revealed the
cause of death as suffocation. A broken piece of denture had lodged in the
throat of the deceased to block entrance to the throat and larynx. The unusual
way in which the deceased had met his death had been the result of a skirmish
and fisticuffs with the appellant. The medical examination showed various
external marks of violence on the body of the deceased. There were small cuts
and bruises about his head and forearms. The major injury, though, was a broken
jaw.

At trial the appellant testified that, though
his inebriation interfered with a clear recollection of what had transpired, he
thought he and the deceased had argued. He could not remember the cause or
duration of the argument. He testified that the deceased kicked him twice, that
he started kicking back and that the next thing he knew, the deceased was lying
on the floor. The appellant had no idea how many times he kicked him but stated
he stopped kicking him after he saw blood; then said he, he telephoned the
police.

He was convicted for murder under the following
definition of that offence (R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 212 ):

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

(a) where the person who
causes the death of a human being

…

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or
not;

…

[Page 43]

The trial judge’s charge to the jury as regards
the defence of drunkenness conformed to the law as laid down by the House of
Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[1] and later clarified and modified by this
Court in MacAskill v. The King[2],
Malanik v. The Queen[3] and
in Capson v. The Queen[4].

Whilst acknowledging this, appellant invites us
to reconsider this area of the law dealing with drunkenness, and order a new
trial because of misdirection as to the proper test as regards the effect of
intoxication on mens rea. As I am of the opinion that appellant should
succeed on another ground, there is here no compelling reason to do so.
Furthermore, I do not think that this is the proper case to reconsider that question
as we have been invited to reconsider only the test, and, as a result have had
the benefit of argument solely on that aspect of the question. Indeed, if and
when we do so, it would then be desirable that we consider not only the test
set out in Beard (capacity) but also, as was done by my brother Dickson
in Leary v. The Queen[5], the
logic and desirability of categorizing offences as of general or specific
intent. A departure from the “capacity test”, without reconsideration of the
very existence of those categories, could lead to erratic and undesirable
results when the defence of intoxication is applied.

At trial the defence pleaded drunkenness and
nothing else. Appellant now argues before us that the judge’s charge to the
jury amounted to misdirection in law because it left the jury with the
impression that, if the defence of drunkenness did not succeed, the jury could
not find manslaughter.

The duties of a trial judge as regards which
defences juries should be apprised of has long been

 [Page 44]

established and was recently restated by this
Court in the case of R. v. Squire[6]
where Spence J. speaking for the Court, said (at p. 19):

It is, of course, the duty of a trial judge
to submit to the jury in his charge any defence available to the accused which
had been revealed by the evidence whether or not counsel for the accused chose
to advance that defence in his address to the jury: Mancini v. Director
of Public Prosecutions (1941), 28 Cr. App. R. 65. And, of course, in many
cases, there are alternative defences and counsel for the accused feels that
his presentation to the jury would only be weakened if he presented
alternatives requiring the jury to make two different findings of fact. It is,
however, equally plain that a trial judge is under no duty to invite the jury
to consider defences of which there is no evidence or which cannot reasonably
be inferred from the evidence: Mancini v. Director of Public
Prosecutions, supra, at p. 72, Lee Chun-Chuen v. The Queen, [1963]
A.C. 220 at p. 233 Wu v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 609 at pp. 616
and 617.

See also: Charbonneau v. The Queen[7]; Rustad v. The Queen[8]; Workman and Huculak v. The Queen[9]; Kelsey v. The Queen[10]; Azoulay v. The Queen[11]; Markadonis v. The King[12]; MacAskill v. The King[13].

Therefore two questions must here be considered:

—Whether the evidence reveals a defence
other than that of drunkenness or whether such a defence can be reasonably
inferred from the evidence;

—If so, whether the trial judge in his
charge adequately put such a defence to the jury.

First question:

The Court of Appeal for Ontario thought not. With this conclusion I cannot, with deference, agree.

Of prime importance, when answering this first
question, is the fact that the injuries inflicted upon

 [Page 45]

the deceased were not of a fatal type whether
considered individually or cumulatively, and that they were the cause of the
victim’s death only because he had dentures, that those dentures broke, and
that in breaking a piece of denture, having the required size to do so, lodged
itself in such a way as to hold the victim’s glottis shut, thus obturating the
larynx, somewhat like a plug in a sink.

It is from these peculiar circumstances that can
be reasonably inferred a defence available to the accused other than that of
drunkenness: even if the jurors were of the view that the accused had the
capacity to know that the blows were likely to cause death, they should
nevertheless acquit of murder and reach a verdict of manslaughter if, when
considering circumstances other than intoxication, such as, the very nature of
the blows, and the position the blows in fact occupied in the chain of
causation, they had a reasonable doubt that he did in fact know.

Second question:

This then leads us to the second question. Were
the jurors adequately apprised of this defence?

When considering the adequacy of a judge’s
charge to a jury it is wrong to single out a passage of his charge, and then,
if some error was committed, out of context, find misdirection. A judge’s
charge should be considered in its entirety and be examined in the light of
what was effectively conveyed to the jurors. Also it is not because a judge
might have said something which was wrong that a new trial should necessarily
as a result be ordered; if, when considering all of the charge, the end result
is that the jury was properly instructed, no effect should then be given to
such a mistake. This sound approach is usually taken to deal with the result of
nitpicking by appellants; were this to be otherwise, very few charges could
survive their scrutiny. The present case offers an illustration of such a
situation. In the course of his charge, the judge said this to the jury:

[Page 46]

The mere fact that he was intoxicated, even
to a high degree, offers no excuse unless the consumption of alcohol destroyed
his capacity to develop the intent to kill or the intent to do bodily harm in
reckless disregard of the likelihood that death was a probable consequence.

In saying this, he had overlooked an essential
element of the offence, namely, foresight of the consequences of the violent
conduct.

Appellant made this one of his grounds of
appeal. Having regard to many other passages of the charge and indeed to the
entirety of the charge, the Court of Appeal for Ontario found that:

…it is obvious, taking the charge as a
whole, that the jury could not have been misled, but in addition the sequence
of events is such that on the crucial questions—at least in the minds of the
jury—the trial judge on the re-charge put the matter in a form to which no
exception can be taken. We therefore reject that ground of appeal.

I am in full agreement with the Court of Appeal
and consider that their rejection of that ground of appeal was the proper way
to deal with that type of situation.

This approach should not however be limited to
overriding mistakes in charges but should also be taken when considering a
charge that is, when examined in a piecemeal way, technically correct, but
which when considered in its entirety, does not properly give the jury the law
or, as in this case, overlooks a defence available to the accused.

The trial judge, after having explained the
difference between culpable homicide and not culpable, then said:

Culpable homicide is murder where a person
who causes the death of a human being means to cause his death or means to
cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death and is
reckless whether death ensues or not.

Those are the precise words of s. 212(a)
of the Code. He then explained the theory of the Crown:

[Page 47]

…the theory of the prosecution is that the
accused man did cause the death of the deceased or meant to cause him bodily
harm knowing it was likely to cause death, and he was reckless whether death
ensued or not.

Further on he noted an error by the Crown and
corrected it:

I made a note and underlined it while
counsel for the Crown was speaking to you—he asked the question, “Was the mind
of the accused so befuddled by alcohol that he was incapable of forming the
intention of causing injury”? It is more than that before it is manslaughter.
You have to take all the words of the section; bodily harm, knowing it was
likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensured [sic] or
not.

…

Accordingly, to secure a conviction for
murder, the Crown must prove to the exclusion of any reasonable doubt, that the
accused caused the death of the deceased by means of an unlawful act or by
criminal negligence and that the accused meant to cause the death or meant to
cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensured [sic] or not.

…

The third element of the charge of murder
is that the accused man caused death or caused bodily harm that he knew was
likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not…

The judge went on to deal at some length with
the defence of drunkenness, after which he told the jury what was the theory of
the defence:

The theory of the defence is that the
accused was under the influence of alcohol to such an extent that he was
incapable of forming the intent to kill or cause bodily harm in reckless
disregard of the likelihood that death was a probable consequence. In other
words, what the defence is suggesting to you is that the accused was not guilty
of murder but guilty of manslaughter and saying, if you have any doubt as to
his ability or capacity to form intent, then he is entitled to the benefit of
that doubt and you should find him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter.

This statement of the theory of the defence was
followed by a thorough review of the evidence as

[Page 48]

regards appellant’s and the victim’s
intoxication. Then he summed up in this way:

Now has the Crown satisfied you beyond a
reasonable doubt on the truth of the charge? I point out that the three
ingredients are; the accused caused the death of the deceased, 1; and 2; by an
unlawful act or by criminal negligence; and 3; that the accused meant to cause
death or meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not.

If the Crown has satisfied you beyond a
reasonable doubt as to each element of that offence, then you should find the
accused guilty as charged. If the Crown has not satisfied you beyond a
reasonable doubt as to each element, or if you have a reasonable doubt as to
any of the elements, then you must find the accused not guilty.

If you find the accused not guilty of the
murder, then you must consider the included offence of manslaughter. Now for
this it is: The accused caused the death of the accused [sic] by
means of an unlawful act or by criminal negligence. If the Crown has satisfied
you beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of those two elements, then you should
convict the accused of manslaughter. However, if the Crown has not satisfied
you beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of those elements, or if you have a
reasonable doubt as to any of them, then you must acquit the accused. But I say
in this case there isn’t much doubt because there is an admission by the man as
to those two.

Then, coming to the theory of the defence:
It is drunkenness. In effect, it was that if you have the view that he had so
much alcohol he didn’t have the capacity to form the judgment to form the
intent to cause death or cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause
death, then you should find him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter. That in effect was the defence.

If you accept the evidence of the defence,
and especially the evidence of Mr. Young, or if it creates a reasonable doubt
in your minds, then you should acquit him of murder but find him guilty of
manslaughter.

…

[Page 49]

You may return any of the following
verdicts: Not guilty—if you believe that he didn’t cause the death, even.
Guilty as charged—if you—and that would be if you find all three of these
elements including the intent. If you find that because of drunkenness or you
have a reasonable doubt as to it—that there was some doubt as to his capacity
to form intent, then you would find him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter.

About an hour later the jury came back with a
question:

…We would just like re-clarification,
please, on the difference between murder and manslaughter.

Complying with this request, the judge told the
jurors:

All right. Murder: The Crown must prove to
the exclusion—beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused caused the death of
the deceased by means of an unlawful act and that the accused meant to cause
death or meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not. That is murder, with the three
elements; that the accused [sic] the death by an unlawful act,
and “intent”, as I have just described it.

Manslaughter is where an accused caused the
death of a deceased by an unlawful act—in other words; if you have a reasonable
doubt as to his capacity because of drunkenness, then you should give him the
benefit of that doubt and find him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter, because there is no doubt that the accused caused the death of
the deceased by means of an unlawful act. There is no great dispute as to that,
so it is merely between murder and manslaughter, and if you have any doubt at
all on that evidence—any reasonable doubt as to his capacity to form intent to
do these things because of drunkenness, then you give him the benefit of that
doubt.

The judge undoubtedly and more than once
told the jury that any reasonable doubt as to one of the essential elements of
a combination of ss. 205(5)  and 212 (a)(ii) should be
resolved in favour of the accused, and, given that causation was not in issue,
result in a verdict of manslaughter. However, when considering the charge as a
whole and when considering his very last remarks and the fact that throughout
his charge he reviewed the evidence in such a way as to relate the facts nearly
exclusively

[Page 50]

to the defence of drunkenness, I cannot but
conclude that the jury was probably left with the impression that a verdict of
manslaughter was dependent only upon the success of that defence. Before
concluding, I should, in all fairness to the trial judge, mention that no
objection in that regard to the charge was made by counsel for the accused.

Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that this
appeal should succeed and that a new trial should be ordered.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Beetz,
McIntyre and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant is appealing from the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed his appeal from his conviction on a charge of
murder.

The following recital of the facts is taken from
the reasons for judgment delivered by Arnup J.A. on behalf of the Court of
Appeal:

The appellant is a 27 year old alcoholic.
The deceased was a 64 year old alcoholic. The appellant had known the deceased
for about two weeks before the death of the latter and had had occasion to
drink with him on a number of occasions.

On June 2, 1975, the appellant and the
deceased consumed enormous quantities of wine and other intoxicating beverages
in the course of the day. Around 3 a.m. on June 3, 1975, the events took place which gave rise to the
charge. Both the appellant and the deceased had continued to drink heavily
during the evening.

The call to the police occurred about 3:30 in the morning of June 3rd. In the meantime,
the appellant had met some friends to whom he had said that he “thought he had
murdered somebody”. Later he stated he had killed the deceased but he didn’t
mean to do it.

It appears that there had been an argument
between the two men. The appellant says that he was kicked twice by the
deceased and that he then “fought back”, but it is obvious from his testimony
that his memory of the events is hazy indeed. What is clear, is that he
proceeded to both beat and kick the deceased. The actual cause of death was
suffocation, occasioned by the fact that as a result of a blow which fractured
the jaw of

[Page 51]

the deceased, his denture was broken in
two, and lodged at the back of his throat, and he suffocated. He had a number
of bruises on his head, his face, his arms and his chest, but no one of them in
itself was the cause of death.

Dr. Dutkevich, the pathologist who conducted the
post mortem examination of the deceased, Joseph Anthony MacNeill,
certified that there were nine external signs of violence done to the body, all
but one of which occurred on the head:

1. A superficial cut behind the ear measuring
two centimetres by one centimetre, and covered with dried blood.

2. A diamond-shaped abrasion on the jaw, also
covered with blood.

3. A bruise and swelling on the neck below the
jaw.

4. A superficial abrasion on the tip of the
nose.

5. A vertical cut over the upper lip; the entire
lip was swollen, and was badly bruised.

6. A very considerable swelling and bruise on
the left cheek.

7. A bruise and small swelling on the chin.

8. A superficial abrasion on the top of the
head.

9. Bruises over a two-inch area on the right
forearm.

The jaw had been broken as well, undoubtedly the
cause of the broken denture.

The autopsy revealed that the deceased had been
in an extremely fragile state of health, that there were lesions on the lungs,
and biliary cirrhosis was present in the liver. The deceased had an alcohol
level in his blood of 210 milligrams per cent.

This clinical description of the deceased was
supplemented by evidence of the coroner and the policeman who attended the
call. Constable Zweerink, who had known the deceased, testified that “I
couldn’t identify him at the time. He was quite battered”. The coroner,
Wrathall, stated that “He had some cuts and bruises around his head, behind

[Page 52]

his ear and in his mouth”. Furthermore, “there
was a puddle of blood on the floor near the head”.

This evidence, coupled with that of the accused,
leads to the conclusion that the appellant knocked MacNeill to the ground and
then kicked him on the head until the body was still.

In considering the criticisms of the charge to
the jury by the trial judge made on appeal, but not at the trial, it is
important to examine what were the real questions raised at the trial before
the judge and jury. The position taken by the defence was made abundantly clear
in the opening statement to the jury made by counsel for the appellant. He
said:

My lord. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
at this point it is my opportunity to address you to indicate to you the nature
of the case that is going to be presented to you for the defence.

My learned friend has quite fairly pointed
out to you that the issue of how Mr. MacNeill died is not really something that
is being contested here. We are not suggesting and it is not being argued, and
you were able to tell this by the nature of the Examination‑in‑Chief
and Cross-examination,—it is not really being contested how Mr. MacNeill
died. But the Crown Attorney has to prove in his case that not only did
Mr. Young kill Mr. MacNeill, but he has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that at the time he killed him he intended to kill him or he intended to cause
him bodily harm that was likely to kill him.

The defence, very simply—and my friend has
stated this, is: That at the relevant time—at the time Mr. MacNeill died—Mr.
Young was too intoxicated to be able to form either one of those
intentions—either the intent to kill or the intent to cause that bodily harm I
referred to, and in order to put this defence before you, part of that evidence
obviously is covered in Cross-examination, and it is my intention to call Mr.
Young who will tell you what he recalls of the events and of the time in
question. And following Mr. Young I am going to call a toxicologist in this
case, a woman who is an expert in assessing the effects of alcohol, and who
will be called to give evidence—to give her opinion of the possible or probable
effects of alcohol on Mr. Young.

[Page 53]

At the conclusion of the judge’s charge to the
jury, no objection to it was made by counsel for the appellant.

Counsel for the appellant argued three grounds
of appeal before the Court of Appeal. Arnup J.A. dealt with the first ground as
follows:

The first ground of appeal argued before us
was that no reasonable jury on the set of facts I have mentioned, and
particularly those directly leading to the death, could find that the accused knew
that the bodily harm was likely to cause the death of the deceased: the Criminal
Code , s. 212 (a)(ii), quoted below. The defence sought to be made out
at the trial rested solely on drunkenness sufficient to reduce the charge from
murder to manslaughter. At no time was it suggested to the trial judge that a
defence resting on the submission now made by counsel for the appellant was an
alternative ground of defence and that the trial judge should put that defence
to the jury. It is, of course, the law that a trial judge is obligated to put
to the jury a defence which reasonably arises from the evidence, whether or not
that defence is put forward by counsel for the accused.

We are all of the opinion that this
particular defence does not reasonably arise from the evidence as I have
outlined it, and that in the circumstances the trial judge was not obliged to
put it to the jury. Moreover, we are further of the view that there was ample
evidence from which the jury could conclude that the appellant meant to cause
the deceased bodily harm and that he knew it was likely to cause the death of
the deceased.

In raising this ground of appeal, the appellant
was seeking to invoke the power given to the Court of Appeal by s. 613(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code  which permitted that Court to allow an accused’s
appeal if it was of the opinion that:

the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal on that
issue was not a judgment on a question of law and so an appeal from that
decision to this Court would not lie under s. 618(1)  of the Criminal Code  (R.
v. Warner[14]).

[Page 54]

The second ground of appeal related to
misdirection in the charge to the jury with respect to s. 212 (a)(ii) of
the Criminal Code , which reads:

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

(a) where the person who
causes the death of a human being

…

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or
not;

This submission was based on the fact that
when discussing the defence of drunkenness the trial judge had said:

The mere fact that he was intoxicated, even
to a high degree, offers no excuse unless the consumption of alcohol destroyed
his capacity to develop the intent to kill or the intent to do bodily harm in
reckless disregard of the likelihood that death was a probable consequence.

He had also said, on a further occasion, and
used the expression: “incapable of forming the intent to kill or cause bodily
harm in reckless disregard of the likelihood that death was a probable
consequence”.

In each case, there was omitted the phrase “that
he knows is likely to cause death”.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal pointed out
that on four occasions prior to these passages, the judge had correctly defined
the purport of subpara. (ii) of s. 212 (a), and did so again on two
occasions thereafter. No objection was taken to the charge. The jury returned
later seeking “re-clarification on the difference between murder and
manslaughter”. On the recharge, the trial judge again put the relevant section
to the jury in precise terms. There were no objections from counsel.

Arnup J.A. dealt with this ground of appeal as
follows:

We are all of the opinion that in the
circumstances I have outlined, it cannot be said that there was an error in the
charge to the jury such that a new trial is required. In our view it is
obvious, taking the charge as a whole, that the jury could not have been
misled, but in addition the sequence of events is such that on the

[Page 55]

crucial questions—at least in the minds of
the jury—the trial judge on the recharge put the matter in a form to which no
exception can be taken. We therefore reject that ground of appeal.

I agree with this conclusion.

The third ground of appeal was that the trial
judge had failed to charge the jury on the question of provocation by the
deceased. The Court held that the evidence did not raise a possible defence of
provocation. The issue of provocation was not raised before this Court.

Before this Court, counsel for the appellant
adopted a different approach. Three grounds of appeal were raised which can be
summarized as follows:

1. The trial judge failed to relate the cause of
death and the quality of actual bodily harm caused to the requisite intent
under s.212 (a)(ii).

2. The trial judge failed to instruct the jury
that a verdict of manslaughter was available apart from the defence of
drunkenness and that if the appellant lacked the knowledge that the bodily harm
occasioned to the deceased was likely to cause death the appellant could not be
convicted of murder.

3. There was misdirection with respect to the
defence of drunkenness.

The first two grounds of appeal allege
non-direction by the trial judge. In substance, the first ground is a
contention that the trial judge should have reviewed the evidence as to the
circumstances of MacNeill’s death and, particularly, the fact that death
resulted from suffocation because his denture lodged in his throat, in relation
to the appellant’s intent when he caused bodily harm to MacNeill. The second
ground is an allegation that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that
apart from drunkenness if the appellant lacked the knowledge that the bodily
harm he inflicted on MacNeill was likely to cause death the jury could not
convict him of murder.

[Page 56]

With respect to the first point, in my opinion
the comments made by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Demeter[15]
at pp. 340-41 apply aptly to the circumstances of the present case:

There will probably never be a perfect
charge or one that cloistered appellate counsel cannot find objectionable after
minute scrutiny. However, no case has been cited to us where non-direction on a
matter of evidence has been held to be misdirection requiring a new trial
except where a single item of evidence is the foundation of the defence. In R. v.
Price and Hansen, [1969] 1 O.R. 24, [1969] 1 C.C.C. 226, both this Court
and the Supreme Court of Canada [[1968] S.C.R. vi] refused to order a new trial
by reason of non-direction going only to credibility. In that case this Court
again adopted, as expressing the principles applicable to non-direction on
evidence, what was said by Lord Justice Ashworth in R. v. Attfield, [1961]
3 All E.R. 243 at pp. 245-6 [at pp. 30-1 O.R., pp. 233-5 C.C.C]:

“In most cases what the trial judge
endeavours to do is by reference to the evidence to direct the jury’s attention
to what may be called the salient features for and against the accused man. No
case has laid down, so far as we are aware, that it is essential for the
validity of a summing-up that there should be a reference to the evidence, but
equally there is no case that, so to speak, absolves a court from what is
normally its function of assisting the jury by dealing with the evidence. Some
assistance is to be gained from a passage cited in R. v. Stoddart (1909),
2 Cr. App. Rep. at p. 246. In that case a trial had taken place over a period of
twenty days, and there was an omission to direct the jury on many of the no
doubt complex issues which had been considered in the course of it, but this
court cited the words of SIR WILLIAM BRETT, M.R. [later Lord Esher], in Abrath
v. North Eastern Ry. Co. (1883), 11 Q.B.D. 440 at p. 453, as
follows:

‘It is no misdirection not to tell the jury
everything which might have been told them: there is no misdirection, unless
the judge has told them something wrong, or unless what he has told them would
make wrong that which he has left them to understand. Non-direction merely is
not misdirection, and those who allege misdirection must show that

 [Page 57]

something wrong was said or that something
was said which would make wrong that which was left to be understood.’

“That is the end of the quotation, and this
court then went on:

‘Every summing-up must be regarded in the
light of the conduct of the trial and the questions which have been raised by
the counsel for the prosecution and for the defence respectively. This court
does not sit to consider whether this or that phrase was the best that might
have been chosen, or whether a direction which has been attacked might have
been fuller or more conveniently expressed, or whether other topics which might
have been dealt with on other occasions should be introduced. This court sits
here to administer justice and to deal with valid objections to matters which
may have led to a miscarriage of justice. (Cf. R. v. Cohen and
Bateman, (1909), 2 Cr. App. Rep. at p. 207.)’

“Nothing that this court is saying today is
intended to put forward the suggestion that a judge is entitled to refrain from
discussing the evidence if the circumstances of the case and the conduct of the
trial demand that he should. The words that are important in R. v. Stoddart [supra]
are that each case must depend on its own facts. Clearly, in a complicated
and lengthy case it is incumbent on the court to deal with the evidence.
Conversely, in a case which has not occupied a great deal of time and in which the
issue, guilt or innocence, can be simply and clearly stated, this court is not
prepared to hold that it is a fatal defect to the summing-up that the evidence
has not been discussed.”

I must stress the words “Every summing-up must
be regarded in the light of the conduct of the trial and the questions which
have been raised by the counsel for the prosecution and for the defence
respectively”, and again “in a case which has not occupied a great deal of time
and in which the issue, guilt or innocence can be simply and clearly stated
this court is not prepared to hold that it is a fatal defect to the summing-up
that the evidence has not been discussed”.

This was not a lengthy trial. The issues had
been limited by counsel for the defence to one only, i.e. was the
appellant too intoxicated to form the intent to kill or to cause bodily harm
that he knew was likely to cause death.

[Page 58]

The jury knew from the evidence of the accused
that he had delivered kicks to the head of a frail and elderly man while prone
on the floor and desisted only when his body was still. The trial judge had
properly instructed them as to the burden resting upon the Crown in order to
prove the appellant was guilty of murder.

In my opinion the appellant has not established
any error in law in the charge to the jury in relation to the first point.

As to the second point, in my opinion the trial
judge did make it clear to the jury that they could not convict the appellant
of murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
appellant knew that the bodily harm which he inflicted upon MacNeill was likely
to cause his death and that otherwise a verdict of manslaughter was available.

In the following passage in the charge the trial
judge listed the three elements which the Crown was required to prove:

In the alternative, the theory of the
prosecution is; if the accused didn’t have the necessary intent or there was
reasonable doubt about the intent of the kind I have referred to, then he was
automatically guilty of manslaughter.

Accordingly, to secure a conviction of
murder, the Crown must prove to the exclusion of any reasonable doubt, that the
accused caused the death of the deceased by means of an unlawful act or by
criminal negligence and that the accused meant to cause the death or meant to
cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless
whether death ensued or not.

After reviewing the evidence of drunkenness, the
trial judge addressed the jury as to the possible verdict of murder or
manslaughter:

I mention to you the two decisions the
Crown offer. If you are satisfied that all three elements have been proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, then the accused would be guilty of murder. If you
have any question as to the third element—a reasonable doubt as to it,—then it
is manslaughter. I point out to you manslaughter is really an included offence
in the charge of murder.

[Page 59]

When a person is charged with murder, if
the Crown cannot prove all three elements but only the other two, then the
accused would be automatically guilty of murder—I am sorry, automatically
guilty of manslaughter.

Now has the Crown satisfied you beyond a
reasonable doubt on the truth of the charge? I point out that the three
ingredients are; the accused caused the death of the deceased, 1; and 2; by an
unlawful act or by criminal negligence; and 3; that the accused meant to cause
death or meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not.

If the Crown has satisfied you beyond a
reasonable doubt as to each element of that offence, then you should find the
accused guilty as charged. If the Crown has not satisfied you beyond a
reasonable doubt as to each element, or if you have a reasonable doubt as to
any of the elements, then you must find the accused not guilty.

If you find the accused not guilty of the
murder, then you must consider the included offence of manslaughter. Now for
this it is: The accused caused the death of the accused [sic] by
means of an unlawful act or by criminal negligence. If the Crown has satisfied
you beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of those two elements, then you should
convict the accused of manslaughter. However, if the Crown has not satisfied
you beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of those elements, or if you have a
reasonable doubt as to any of them, then you must acquit the accused. But I say
in this case there isn’t much doubt because there is an admission by the man as
to those two.

Then, coming to the theory of the defence:
It is drunkenness. In effect, it was that if you have the view that he had so
much alcohol he didn’t have the capacity to form the judgment to form the
intent to cause death or cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause
death, then you should find him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter. That in effect was the defence.

If you accept the evidence of the defence,
and especially the evidence of Mr. Young, or if it creates a

[Page 60]

reasonable doubt in your minds, then you
should acquit him of murder but find him guilty of manslaughter.

It will be observed that in this passage the
reference to drunkenness does not appear until the judge turns to the theory of
the defence, which he describes briefly and accurately in the first sentence:
“Then, coming to the theory of the defence: It is drunkenness”.

Counsel for the appellant refers to the passages
in the charge dealing with possible verdicts and the recharge. The first
passage is as follows:

You may return any of the following
verdicts: Not guilty—if you believe that he didn’t cause the death, even.
Guilty as charged—if you—and that would be if you find all three of these
elements including the intent. If you find that because of drunkenness—or you
have a reasonable doubt as to it—that there was some doubt as to his capacity
to form intent, then you would find him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter.

The second passage is as follows:

All right. Murder: The Crown must prove to
the exclusion—beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused caused the death of
the deceased by means of an unlawful act and that the accused meant to cause
death or meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not. That is murder, with the three
elements; that the accused [sic] the death by an unlawful act and
“intent”, as I have just described it.

Manslaughter is where an accused caused the
death of a deceased by an unlawful act—in other words; if you have a reasonable
doubt as to his capacity because of drunkenness, then you should give him the
benefit of that doubt and find him not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter, because there is no doubt that the accused caused the death of
the deceased by means of an unlawful act. There is no great dispute as to that,
so it is merely between murder and manslaughter, and if you have any doubt at
all on that evidence—any reasonable doubt as to his capacity to form intent to
do these things because of drunkenness, then you give him the benefit of that
doubt.

Counsel contends that the effect of these
instructions was to direct the jury that the exclu-

[Page 61]

sive foundation for a reduction of the charge
from murder to manslaughter was on the basis of the defence of drunkenness.

In my opinion a new trial should not be ordered
on this ground. The trial judge in the passages quoted earlier had properly
stated the general law as to the circumstances in which a charge of murder
should be reduced to manslaughter. The references to drunkenness in the last
two passages cited were made in the context of the sole issue raised by the
defence, the course which the trial had taken and the evidence adduced. In this
case, the trial judge made it clear that the jury had to find the requisite
intent to hold the accused guilty of murder, and also put to the jury the
principal defence of drunkenness. In my opinion these two passages in the
charge must be considered in relation to the rest of the charge, and when so
considered did not effect the removal of the defence that one of the requisite
elements of murder had not been proven by the Crown, nor did they constitute a
direction that a reduction of the charge from murder to manslaughter could only
be made on the basis of the defence of drunkenness.

Notwithstanding that I am of the view that the
jury was left free to find a verdict of manslaughter aside from the defence of
drunkenness, all the circumstances of the offence and the course of the trial
indicate that the only valid issue to be put to the jury was as stated by the
trial judge in the latter part of his recharge “if you have any doubt at all on
that evidence—any reasonable doubt as to his capacity to form intent to do
these things because of drunkenness, then you will give him the benefit of that
doubt”. As I noted earlier in these reasons, the evidence of the accused and
that of the medical witnesses showed that the accused had delivered kicks to
the head of a frail and elderly man lying prone on the floor. In my opinion
that conduct is such as to, in the normal course of events, give rise to a
probability of serious injury that is likely to cause death. In the absence of
any indication that the accused lacked the normal

[Page 62]

intent which accompanies such conduct, the
inference to be drawn from the facts, absent drunkenness, is that the accused
intended to cause bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death and was
reckless as to whether death ensued or not. The accused did not say that he did
not know what he was doing was likely to cause death. His sole defence was that
he was too drunk to be able to form either of the intents necessary to convict
him of murder. In these circumstances, it was not necessary to leave before the
jury the defence, which had never been raised, that the accused, apart from
drunkenness, did not know that the bodily harm which he was inflicting was
likely to cause death.

In my opinion, the appeal should not be allowed
on the basis of the second ground of appeal.

The third ground of appeal was that the trial
judge misdirected the jury in respect of the defence of drunkenness. His
instruction to the jury on this issue was as follows:

I next deal with the matter of drunkenness.
The law as to the effect of the consumption of alcohol is this: drunkenness
does not exonerate an accused. It does not excuse him entirely, but evidence of
drunkenness which at the time of the alleged offence, rendered an accused
incapable of forming the intent to kill or to cause bodily harm that he knew
was likely to cause death, should be taken into consideration by you, with the
other facts proven, in order to decide whether or not he had that intent.

There are varying degrees of intoxication.
The mere fact that he was intoxicated, even to a high degree, offers no excuse
unless the consumption of alcohol destroyed his capacity to develop the intent
to kill or the intent to do bodily harm in reckless disregard of the likelihood
that death was a probable consequence. A man may be intoxicated and yet be able
to perform [sic] the intent to act as he does. For example; he
may be a great danger to the public if he drives and yet be quite capable of
forming the intent to drive. The accused’s capacity is a question of fact for
you and you alone to decide.

[Page 63]

The onus is not on the accused to prove the
required incapacity. The Crown is the one that must satisfy you that the
accused had the capacity. In other words; that he was not so affected by
alcohol that he could not form the intent, either the intent to kill, or the
intent to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death. And I point
out to you that it is sufficient if the evidence raises a reasonable doubt in
your minds as to his mental capacity to form the necessary intent.

This statement of the law is in accordance with
the decisions of this Court in MacAskill v. The King[16], Perrault v. The Queen[17] and Mulligan v. The Queen[18]. This was not seriously challenged by
counsel for the appellant whose real submission was that the law as to
drunkenness as stated by the House of Lords in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Beard[19], and
followed in judgments in this Court, should be reconsidered. I agree with my
brother Lamer that this is not a proper case in which to undertake that task.

In my opinion, the third ground of appeal also
fails.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Rape—Evidence—Early
complaint—Definition—Manner of proof—Judge’s role when dealing with this type
of evidence on voir dire.

On a voir dire in a rape case,
complainant’s statement, which did not contain the word “rape”, was found to be
inadmissible as an early complaint; it nevertheless was allowed to be put
before the jury. The recipient of the statement who stated that the word “rape”
was used, was not allowed to make any mention of “rape” before the jury.
Accused appealed a decision of the Court of Appeal setting aside his acquittal
and ordering a new trial. The issues raised here were: (1) the definition of
“early complaint”; (2) how its proof was to be made; and (3) the role of the
trial judge when dealing with this type of evidence on a voir dire.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

In a rape case, a complaint is any statement
made by the alleged victim which, given the circumstances of the case, would,
if believed, be of some probative value in negating the adverse conclusions the
trier of fact could draw as regards her credibility had the complainant been
silent. The judge, before admitting a complaint as evidence, should hold a voir
dire to determine: (a) whether there was some evidence which if believed by
the trier of fact would constitute a complaint; (b) that the complaint was not
elicited by questions of a “leading and inducing or intimidating character”;
and (c) that it was “made at the first opportunity after the offence which reasonably
offer[ed] itself”. In determining whether there was evidence which, if believed
by the jury, would constitute a complaint, the trial judge should take into
account evidence by the victim, if any, as well as that of any person recipient
of that complaint. Evidence by a recipient person is admissible on the voir
dire and before the trier of fact only if the victim has testified as to
the facts material to the commission of the offence; it is not necessary that
the victim have testified as to the complaint itself.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta[1],
overturning appellant’s acquittal by Cormack J. and a jury and ordering a new
trial. Appeal dismissed.

J.E. Faulkner, for the appellant.

Jack Watson and Richard Stelmaczonek, for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—This is an appeal brought with leave of
this Court by the accused whose acquittal on a charge of rape by an Edmonton jury was set aside by the Court of
Appeal for Alberta. That Court
ordered a new trial.

This appeal raises three issues. They do not
warrant my setting out all of the facts of the alleged rape but merely the
events that happened immediately after, for all of the issues relate to early
complaint evidence, and to be more precise, to the following: (1) the
definition of an “early complaint”; (2) how proof of it may be made; (3) the
role to be played by a trial judge when dealing with this type of evidence on a
voir dire.

At the trial, Catherine, the complainant,
testifying in chief, said that Larry, the appellant, with whom she had gone to
a party, had raped her and then had driven her to her sister Vivian’s
residence. In the course of a voir dire which had been

[Page 317]

entered into in order to determine the
admissibility of an alleged early complaint, Catherine said that upon entering
the house, she told her sister Vivian: “Larry hurt me.” On cross‑examination
there was the following exchange:

Q. Well, you never told her Larry raped
me, did you?

A. No, I didn’t.

Q. You never said that?

A. Not that I can remember.

…

Q. But you never told at any time in
this—say up to the point that Darlene came in, you never told Vivian that you
had been raped?

A. No, not that I can remember. [Emphasis
added]

When Vivian was heard as a witness she related
the conversation as follows:

Q. Okay. Now this is very important. What
were the—as far as you remember, what were the exact words she used on this
second occasion after Gerald left, to you? What were her, as best as you can
remember, her exact words?

A. Well, she just said that Larry had raped
her.

Q. I see. Did she use that word, rape?

A. Yes.

The trial judge ruled that Vivian when
testifying before the jury could not “give evidence as to any mention of rape
to her by the complainant”; he also ruled that what Catherine had said did not
amount to a “complaint”; nevertheless, he allowed her to testify before the
jury that she had told her sister, “Larry hurt me.”

The Court of Appeal was of the view that the
trial judge “erred in not leaving the sister’s evidence as to what Catherine
said to her to the Jury”. This finding was because that Court was of the
opinion “that the existence of a recent complaint may be given by the evidence
of persons other than the complainant herself”.

Appellant argues before this Court that the
Court of Appeal erred in so finding. Appellant further argues that, in any
event, even if the trial

[Page 318]

judge was wrong, that error should not have
resulted in the setting aside of the acquittal as it was not one of law but at
best one of mixed fact and law. Those are appellant’s two grounds of appeal.

Let me say at once that I find no merit in the
second ground of appeal.

When ruling on the admissibility of the alleged
complaint, the trial judge said the following:

THE COURT: I am satisfied that there was a
complaint—or, I’m satisfied that if there was a complaint it was made at the
earliest opportunity, but I’m not satisfied that a complaint was made. There is
all through this a curious reluctance on the part of the complainant to talk
about the experience. Now she herself says—she was questioned very closely on
it, whether she had mentioned that Larry had raped her. She said she didn’t say
anything, and she said Vivian didn’t say anything. But she presumed that Vivian
knew from the look on her—knew from staring at her, and then went to get
Darlene Brown. Then after she said that, she summed up her testimony by saying
that she didn’t remember much of what she said to Vivian.

Now if indeed she had admitted to Vivian
that she had been raped, if there was some sense of delicacy that made her
reluctant to talk about rape, she would have gotten rid of that reluctance once
the story was out, so to speak, to Vivian. But then she gets up to the hospital
and Dr. Morris—was it Morris?

MR. STELMACZONEK: Yes.

THE COURT: He finds that same reluctance in
her to talk about rape. Now any inhabitions [sic] she had about speaking
of the rape must have been removed when she told, if she did, when she told
Vivian she had been raped and Darlene Brown came over having had the previous
regrettable experience in that same matter—in that same type of crime, and so
that it’s quite apparent to me that she was not talking about rape. If Vivian,
Darlene Brown arrived at the conclusion that she had been raped, that’s another
thing. But there was no complaint, in my opinion, made to Vivian of rape. The
only complaint she made was that Larry hurt her and this is not sufficient to
establish that there was a recent complaint of the rape.

[Page 319]

Now gentlemen, this was evidence heard on a
Voir Dire, and it’s not admissible. It may not be brought before the jury to
establish a recent complaint of rape.

A careful reading of the judge’s remarks reveals
that he considered what Vivian said Catherine had told her as relevant in order
for him to determine whether there was or was not a “complaint” made by
Catherine. It is not unreasonable to assume that had he preferred Vivian’s
version of what Catherine had said, he would have ruled that Catherine had in
fact made a “complaint”. It is here unnecessary speculation to try to wonder
what evidence would then have been left to the jury; if both versions, one
could assume that the jury would then have been invited to weigh the evidence
anew. But he made a finding of fact, i.e., that what Catherine did say
to her sister was, in his opinion, that which she testified to, and then
considered that what she said could not be a “complaint”. The findings of law
made by the judge in order to make that finding of fact were that it is the
proper function of a judge on a voir dire to:

(a) weigh the evidence and determine what was
said by the alleged victim;

(b) then determine whether what was said was a
complaint that the jury could then consider and give weight to.

The Court of Appeal was of the view, at least
this is my understanding of what that Court is saying, that if a judge on a voir
dire has evidence before him which, if believed by the jury, would in law
constitute a complaint, he must leave it to the jurors to determine what was in
fact said and instruct them as to what effect may be given to that evidence.
That was a question of law on which the Court of Appeal could properly
entertain an appeal by the Crown. Indeed, even though Vivian’s evidence was
excluded as the result of a finding of fact, the judge’s entry upon such an
enquiry (preferring Catherine’s evidence to that of her sister) was predicated
on his assuming, wrongfully in the

[Page 320]

opinion of the Court of Appeal, he had the right
to do so. Appellant’s second ground, namely, that the ruling was not one of
law, is therefore of no support to his appeal.

As regards the first ground, appellant’s first
and main proposition in his factum is as follows:

…it is submitted, evidence of complaint may
be admissible notwithstanding discrepancies between the version of the
complaint as testified to by the victim and as testified to by the recipient of
the complaint, but provided both versions of the complaint are as to a
sexual assault. This is precisely what was held in R. v. Kenshol
(1978) 43 CCC (2d) 316 (Ont. Co. Ct.).

This proposition raises all three issues.

FIRST ISSUE: What
is a complaint?

The case law as regards early complaint evidence
(see amongst others R. v. Cook[2];
R. v. Belliveau[3]; R.
v. Waddell[4]; R.
v. Shonias[5]; R.
v. Ball[6]; R.
v. Washington[7] amply
shows that there exists in this area of the law great uncertainty, at least as
to some aspects of that evidence. There is disagreement as to the nature of the
complaint that may be put to the jury and by whose testimony; also as to the
proper function of a judge holding a voir dire to determine the admissibility
of early complaint evidence. Much of this disagreement and uncertainty is, in
my opinion, the result of our considering the admissibility of such evidence as
an exception to a general exclusionary rule, whilst what is in fact exceptional
is the granting of special probative value to the silence of an alleged victim
of a sexual offence. Most scholars and many a judge have in the past explained
the historical origins of the rule and attempted, with relative success as far
as I am concerned, to rationalize the singling out of that group of victims’
complaints as being exceptionally admissible.

[Page 321]

There are today suggestions (see amongst others
the Eleventh Report by the Criminal Law Revision Committee of
England and Wales and comments by Schiff, in vol. 1 of Evidence in the
Litigation Process, at pp. 574 et seq.), that the need for
the rule is doubtful and should be reconsidered. We have not been invited by
the parties to do so, but I should like to add here that, given the proper
opportunity, we should seriously reconsider the soundness of some of the
assumptions that are made in order to justify the rule; furthermore, some of
those assumptions are even more difficult to accept since the extension of the
rule to victims of both sexes and to all sexual offences, including those where
consent is not in issue (cf. R. v. Lillyman[8] and R. v. Osborne[9]).[10]

That the trier of fact may be apprised of
complaints made by the alleged victim of a sexual offence is an exception to
the rule at common law that a witness’ testimony-in-chief may not be buttressed
by the party calling her by proving that she has made a prior consistent
statement (by asking her or otherwise).

That exception was recognized as necessary to
negate the adverse effect the alleged victim’s silence might have on her
credibility when relating the circumstances of the offence and, if essential to
the commission of the offence or simply averred by the victim, the victim’s
credibility when asserting absence of consent. (R. v. Lillyman, supra;
R. v. Osborne, supra; Thomas v. The Queen[11], at p. 355). That possible adverse
effect is predicated upon the assumption that the true victim of a sexual
offence will, under normal circumstances, complain at the first reasonable
opportunity. Early complaint evidence seeks to negate the inference

[Page 322]

that could otherwise be drawn from the victim’s
silence as a result of that assumption.

This negation being the purpose and that
assumption being the justification of the exception to the general rule, one can
then logically conclude that the exception should operate whenever the victim’s
silence might have, given the nature of the offence and the circumstances of
that particular case, an adverse effect on her credibility, and if the victim’s
complaint is of such a nature and was made under such circumstances as to be of
some probative value in rebutting that adverse effect. Though the rule was
extended to all types of sexual offences and to both sexes, an indiscriminate
recognition of the assumption does not appear to have been questioned and any
victim’s silence is of relevance as regards her credibility. Be that as it may,
this case is one of rape where consent is in issue, and we therefore need not
consider whether the relevancy of a victim’s silence, and as a corollary that
of a victim’s departure from same, can ever be in question, for it undoubtedly
will always be relevant in this type of case.

What then is to be determined on a voir dire in
a rape case is whether there was a complaint that is of such a nature
and made under such circumstances as to be of some probative value in negating
beforehand in some way the adverse effect the victim’s silence would have on
her credibility as a result of that assumption.

The precise purpose for admitting such evidence,
while limiting its use (it is not proof of the facts nor is it corroboration
evidence), in turn suggests, in my opinion, a wide definition of what is to be
considered a complaint. In my view, any statement made by the alleged victim,
which is of some probative value in negating the adverse conclusions the jury
might be invited to make and could draw as regards her credibility had she
remained silent, is to be considered a complaint. It will have the effect of
negating that adverse con-

[Page 323]

clusion if it is in some way supportive of the
victim’s credibility by showing consistency between the victim’s conduct after
the alleged ravishment and the victim’s narration of same as a witness.

Because it is supportive of the witness’
testimony to the effect that she was the victim of a sexual crime, we refer to
it as being a “sexual complaint” or “a complaint of rape…” This is not to say
however, as some courts have held, that it must be a complaint that directly
alleges a sexual attack; I think it sufficient that the early statement made by
the alleged victim be in some way useful to the trier of fact in restricting,
if not wholly negating, the adverse effect total silence would have had on the
victim’s credibility.

The all or nothing approach, that is
letting in only complaints that refer to a sexual assault, is hard to reconcile
with the very purpose of the rule, the rebuttal of the inference that silence
suggests as a result of the assumption. If silence, given the nature and
circumstances of the case considered, is to be of some probative value adverse
to the victim, then, subject to the other requirements of the rule and of the
other rules of evidence, any departure from silence is relevant and admissible.
It will either help the Crown or the defence, but will always, in such a case,
serve the jury in weighing the victim’s credibility. Furthermore, not only is
the all or nothing approach lacking in logic, it creates insurmountable
problems when applied as a rule. Indeed, assuming the victim did speak out (e.g.,
as in this case, “Larry hurt me”), having precluded the jury from knowing
that the victim did not stay mute and from what she said, is the judge then to
let the jurors infer adversely to the victim to the same extent as total
silence would permit? This query appears to have been present in the trial
judge’s mind. Indeed, though he found that the statement made by Catherine
(“Larry hurt me”) was not a complaint of rape, he nevertheless left those words
to the jury; one may assume that he felt that they were in some way relevant in
assessing her credibility. I am of the view that he was right in admitting
Catherine’s

[Page 324]

evidence as to what she said she told her
sister, for it was, though the trial judge did not think so, evidence of a
complaint as that is contemplated by the exception to the rule.

However, with respect, I cannot agree that he
should have excluded Vivian’s evidence; and this leads me to the second issue
raised by the appeal.

SECOND ISSUE: HOW
may proof of a complaint be made?

Given the aforementioned definition of “a
complaint”, it is clear that Vivian’s version of Catherine’s words would, and
this would be so even if by definition complaints were restricted to express
“sexual complaints”, constitute a complaint. Whatever may have been the judge’s
reasons for setting aside Vivian’s testimony of what her sister had told her,
appellant supports that decision by inviting us to adopt the proposition that

(1) the victim must testify as to the complaint;

(2) the victim’s version of the complaint must
be as to a sexual assault;

(3) if the two previous conditions are not met,
the recipient of the complaint cannot testify.

In support of this proposition, appellant asks
us to consider the reasoning in R. v. Cook, supra. The complainant in
that case had not testified at all. The complainant’s mother was heard and she
was allowed to relate as a recent complaint what her child, had told her.
Brooke J.A., of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, was of the view (Houlden and
Thorson JJ.A., concurring) that (at p. 86):

In our view, the evidence of the
complainant’s mother as to what was said to her by her child was inadmissible
as a recent complaint. In such circumstances as these, where the complainant
either does not give evidence or, in the alternative, gives evidence but
testifies that he has no recollection of the alleged sexual misconduct, the

[Page 325]

issue of recent complaint does not arise
and the purpose for which the evidence would otherwise be admissible does not
exist. In the early case of R. v. Guttridges (1840), 9 Car. & P. 471
at 472, 173 E.R. 916, Parke B. said that in such cases:

“I think the safest course will be to
reject the evidence, as it is not part of the res gestae, but merely
confirmatory evidence.”

Recently, in Phipson on Evidence, 12th ed.
(1976), the learned author states at p. 142, para. 355:

“Thus if the alleged victim of indecent
assault is unable to give any evidence of it, evidence by another witness of a
complaint made to her by the alleged victim shortly after the incident becomes
inadmissible.”

My reading of the R. v. Guttridges, Fellowes,
and Goodwin case is that it is authority only for the proposition that if
the alleged victim has not testified to having been the victim of a sexual
offence there is then no credibility to support by proof of an early complaint
and no evidence by the recipient of such a complaint is therefore admissible.

The same applies, I suggest, to that passage of Phipson’s
12th edition referred to by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The words
“evidence of it” refer to the “indecent assault” and do not say more than that
the declarant must have testified to her having been the victim of the offence.

This appears to be further borne out by Phipson’s
reference to Wallwork[12]. In
that case, a female child of five years of age who was called as an unsworn
witness could not recall anything. As a result, there was no evidence by her of
the alleged incest. Her grandmother’s narration of what the young girl told her
was received in evidence as an early complaint. Goddard L.C.J. (Donovan and
Havers JJ., concurring) ruled that evidence inadmissible in the following terms
(at pp. 161-62):

The child had given no evidence because
when the poor little thing was put into the witness-box, she said nothing and
could not remember anything. The learned judge had expressly told the jury to
disregard her evi-

[Page 326]

dence altogether. Therefore, there was
no evidence given by her with regard to which it was necessary to say what she
had said to her grandmother was consistent; nor could there be any question
of the identity of the prisoner or any question of consent. [The underlining is
mine]

Again it seems clear that what is relevant is
the consistency between her conduct (as distinct from her version of her
conduct) shortly after the occurrence and her version of the nature of
that occurrence, and this case cannot support the proposition that this
consistency is relevant only if first advanced by her in the witness stand.

Appellant further relies on the decision of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Shonias, supra. In that case, a
fourteen-year-old girl, alleging rape, testified in the course of a voir
dire and said that she had told her foster-mother that she had been
“beatened up” and that if she did not say more it was because she “didn’t feel
like talking”. The trial judge ruled that such a statement was not a complaint
that related to a sexual offence and, as a result, she was not asked by the
Crown in the presence of the jury to relate what she had told her foster-mother.

However, defence counsel knew that the judge
intended to consider as admissible evidence by the foster-mother to the effect
that the young girl had told her she had been raped. He, therefore, in the
course of cross-examining the young girl, elicited what she had said to her
foster-mother. Another voir dire was held to determine whether the
foster-mother’s version of the complaint was admissible, and that version was
ruled admissible and considered by the judge as being capable of forming a
complaint by the daughter. Dubin J.A., of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
(Martin J.A., concurring), after noting that it was unfortunate that the trial
judge had not been apprised of that Court’s decision in R. v. Washington,
supra, said (at p. 305):

In view of the judgment of this Court in
the Washington case, the learned trial Judge, having ruled that what the
complainant said did not constitute a complaint,

[Page 327]

erred in leaving it to the jury that they
could find from the evidence of the foster-mother that the complainant had made
a complaint that she had been raped by the accused. With respect to the learned
trial Judge, he erred in allowing the evidence of the foster‑mother as to
the alleged complaint to be admitted into evidence and erred in instructing the
jury that from that evidence they could find that the complainant had made a
complaint. The evidence of the foster-mother is not admissible independently of
the issue as to whether the complainant had made a complaint. Its admissibility
is dependent on that issue first having been established.

Gale C.J.O., whilst agreeing in the disposition
of the case, said (at p. 302):

I should add that I have some reservations
about the correctness of the observations made in R. v. Washington, [1951]
O.W.N. 129, in the passage of that judgment, which appears at p. 131, and
referred to by my brother Dubin. However, having regard to the fact that this
young man in the ordinary course would soon be released from the sentence
imposed upon him by the trial Judge, this does not appear to be the appropriate
case in which this Court should reconsider the relevant principles laid down in
the Washington case.

The Washington case is not reported fully
and was summarized in the reports. It appears from that summary that a sixteen-year-old
girl, alleging an assault with intent to commit rape, when testifying said that
she had told her father: “Daddy, Bubbles Washington [the accused] broke in and
beat me up.” Her father’s version of her statement was that she had said:
“Bubbles attacked me upstairs in bed.” The trial judge ruled both the
daughter’s and the father’s evidence admissible and then told the jury (at pp.
129-30):

“Now, gentlemen, the accused is not charged
with merely assaulting and beating the complainant. He is charged with
attempted rape. If the complainant did no more than simply say that the accused
had beaten her up and assaulted her or that he had broken into the house and
beaten her up that evidence so far as the attempted rape is concerned would be
inadmissible as hearsay evidence, but if she said what the father says she said
then it is admissible. If upon a fair interpretation of the language that she
used she could be understood to mean that the accused made an attack upon her

[Page 328]

to satisfy his sexual passions that would
be admissible. Whose version is correct? The little girl as to what she said or
the father of the girl as to what he says she said? If you believe him then
what she said amounts to a complaint because obviously, it seems to me, words
that deal with the assault upon a woman coupled with her being in bed imply an
attack upon her for sexual reasons, but it is for you to say.”

In appeal, Laidlaw J.A., (Hope and Gibson JJ.A.,
concurring) held (at p. 131):

As to the second ground, that the evidence
of the so-called complaint was improperly admitted, it was doubtful whether
what occurred between this girl and her father could properly be taken as a
complaint. According to her own evidence it was not a complaint of a sexual
attack on her. The father’s evidence conflicted with hers, and his evidence
therefore could not be confirmatory, or tend to strengthen the girl’s story,
within the established rules as to evidence of complaints. The learned trial
judge, having ascertained the conflict in the evidence, should have decided
that the evidence of this remark to the father could not be corroborative, and
should not have admitted it.

The report indicates (at p. 130) that it
had been argued by counsel for appellant that such evidence:

…should not have been admitted at all since
the father’s evidence, if accepted, contradicted that of the complainant, and
evidence of a complaint was admissible only as confirmatory, and only after the
complainant had herself told her story.

The report also lists the authorities relied
upon by appellant in support of that proposition as being the following: R.
v. Guttridges, Fellowes, and Goodwin[13];
R. v. Megson, Battye, and Ellis[14];
R. v. Lilly man, supra; R. v. Christie[15].

I have already commented on R. v. Guttridges as
not being supportive of the proposition advanced, and neither is the Megson case.
In that case the victim of a rape had died and as a result had not testified to
the facts material to the commission of the offence. She had however complained
to the person with whom she lodged. The

[Page 329]

prosecution wanted to adduce this evidence as
proof of the rape and of the accused’s guilt. Rolfe B. dealt with the matter in
the following terms (at p. 422 of the report):

There is a wide difference between
receiving such statements as confirmatory of a prosecutrix’s credibility in a
charge of rape, on which she is examined as a witness, and in a case like the
present, where the complaint made is to be received as independent evidence. I
entertain very great doubts indeed, about the admissibility of such evidence.

and then summing up, said:

I had a strong feeling, that it was not
competent to the prosecutor to extract in detail the complaint made by the
deceased on her return home. In ordinary cases of rape, where a witness describes
the outrage in the witness-box, evidence of her complaint soon after the
occurrence of the outrage is properly admissible to shew her credit and the
accuracy of her recollection. Here, however, the object was to give in evidence
the particulars of the complaint as independent evidence, with a view of
shewing who were the persons who committed the offence. [See the case of Rex
v. Gutteridge, post [p. 471]]. All that could safely be received was, I
think, her complaint that a dreadful outrage had been perpetrated upon her.

This is hardly support for the proposition
advanced by appellant in the Washington case; on the contrary it could
even support the admissibility of proof of the fact of a complaint even when
the complainant has not testified at all, let alone as to her complaint; as
this ruling was made at a time when most courts never permitted more than proof
of the fact of the complaint and would not permit the adducing in evidence of
the terms of the complaint, it could be argued, now that it is well settled law
that the contents of a complaint may be proved (see R. v. Lillyman, supra;
R. v. Osborne, supra), that this case supports the admission of the
contents of a complaint even when the complainant for some reason has not been
heard at all. I hasten to add that I would not have followed respondent on such
a construction of this decision had respondent taken that position. But that
case is surely not support for the appellant’s proposition.

[Page 330]

Likewise of R. v. Christie, supra. A
five-year-old boy, allegedly the victim of an indecent assault, gave evidence
without being sworn. He was not asked about any identification previous to that
which he had made of the prisoner in Court. When his mother testified, she was
allowed to relate the following statement made by her son to her and a police
constable immediately after the incident giving rise to the charge: “That is
the old man, mum.”

As regards that statement’s admissibility, that
matter was in no way dealt with “qua” a recent complaint. Indeed
Lord Atkinson put the question to be dealt with in this way (at p. 552)

The Attorney-General contended that the
entire statement of the boy was admissible on each of four separate grounds:—

(1.) As part of the act of identification,
or as explanatory of it.

(2.) As a statement made in the presence of
the prisoner in circumstances calling for some denial or explanation from him,
the truth of which he admitted by his conduct and demeanour.

(3.) As proof of the consistency of the
boy’s conduct before he was examined with his testimony given at the trial.

(4.) As part of the res gestae.

Your Lordships intimated during the course
of the argument that you would not consider this third point. It is,
therefore, unnecessary to allude to it further. [The underlining is mine]

Lord Moulton did likewise (at p. 558):

The admission of this evidence has been
defended on three grounds: (1.) that it was evidence of identification of the
prisoner by the boy; (2.) that it was a statement made in the presence of the
prisoner coupled with evidence of his behaviour on hearing the statement; and
(3.) that it was relevant to the issue of “consistent complaint,” and
therefore admissible in the case of an offence such as an indecent assault
committed on a small child.

My Lords, I do not propose to deal with
the third ground because it is not necessary to do so for the

[Page 331]

purpose of deciding this appeal, and it
raises very difficult questions which would be better decided in some case
where the admission of the evidence turns directly on the point. I shall,
therefore, confine myself to the first and second of the above grounds. [The
underlining is mine.]

And Lord Reading (at p. 562):

The Attorney-General submitted that this
evidence was admissible, first, because it was part of the act of
identification by the boy; secondly, because it was a statement made in the
hearing and presence of Christie which had a bearing upon his conduct and
demeanour at the time of hearing it; thirdly, because it proved that the boy’s
conduct after the offence was committed and before he gave evidence was
consistent with the statements made by him at the trial; and, fourthly, because
it was part of the res gestae.

During the argument your Lordships
intimated that it was not convenient on this appeal to consider the third
ground, and there was no further discussion upon it.

As for Viscount Haldane, he agreed with the
others but added a few remarks which apply rather to identification evidence
than to early complaint. As a result, I fail to see in what way any reference
could be made to this case to support the proposition advanced by appellant in Washington.

Finally, the Court of Appeal for Ontario was
referred to Lillyman. That is the case which gave the ancient early
complaint rule its modern formulation. Hawkins J. stated the case in the
following way (at pp. 167-68):

The prosecutrix was called as a witness,
and deposed to the acts complained of having been done without her consent.
Counsel for the prosecution tendered evidence in chief of a complaint made by
her to her mistress, in the absence of the prisoner, very shortly after the
commission of the acts, and proposed to ask the details of the complaint as
made by the prosecutrix. The admission of the evidence was objected to by the
prisoner’s counsel; but the learned judge overruled the objection and admitted
the evidence. The mistress then deposed to all that the prosecutrix had said
respecting the prisoner’s conduct towards her.

…

[Page 332]

If the evidence was rightly admitted, the
conviction was to be affirmed; if otherwise, to be quashed.

The essential ruling in that case (at
p. 179) was:

…that the whole statement of a woman
containing her alleged complaint should, so far as it relates to the charge
against the accused, be submitted to the jury as a part of the case for the
prosecution, and that the evidence in this case was, therefore, properly
admitted…

The judgment also rationalizes the rule and puts
an end to a practice that prevailed with some judges who limited the evidence
as to early complaint to the sole fact that a complaint had been made.

One of the passages of the judgment is probably
at the source of the proposition that, if the victim has not testified to
having made a complaint of having been the object of a sexual offence, the
recipient of same cannot be heard nor can he complete by his testimony what
would, standing alone, not be a true complaint.

Indeed, Hawkins J. speaking for the Court said
(at p. 170):

It is necessary, in the first place, to
have a clear understanding as to the principles upon which evidence of such a
complaint, not on oath, nor made in the presence of the prisoner, nor forming
part of the res gestae, can be admitted. It clearly is not admissible as
evidence of the facts complained of: those facts must therefore be established,
if at all, upon oath by the prosecutrix or other credible witness, and,
strictly speaking, evidence of them ought to be given before evidence of the
complaint is admitted. The complaint can only be used as evidence of the
consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the
witness-box, and as being inconsistent with her consent to that of which she
complains.

It appears that some were under the impression
that those very words justified the proposition. Though Hawkins J.’s statement
of the case does not say that the prosecutrix had deposed as to her complaint,
the fact that he said in the passage quoted earlier: “… but the learned judge
overruled the objection and admitted the evidence. The

[Page 333]

mistress then deposed to all that the
prosecutrix had said respecting the prisoner’s conduct towards her” could be
construed, though I read it otherwise, as meaning that she had in fact deposed
as to her complaint. But any doubt there may be, is in my opinion resolved by a
passage of the judgment where he says (at pp. 169-70):

The girl was examined as a witness in
support of these charges, and deposed to the acts she complained of having been
committed without her consent. For the Crown, evidence was tendered in chief of
a complaint made by the girl to her mistress, in the absence of the prisoner,
very shortly after the commission of the acts charged, and it was proposed
to ask the witness called for that purpose to state the details of the
complaint in the language used by the girl. Counsel for the prisoner objected,
first, that the complaint could not be given in evidence at all, and, secondly,
that even if the fact of a complaint having been made was admissible, the
particulars of it could not be elicited in the examination in chief. I
overruled both objections, and the complaint with full particulars was
deposed to by the witness. The jury found the prisoner guilty on the first
count only. That, however, does not affect the question we have to decide,
because, although to establish guilt upon that count it was not essential to
prove want of consent, yet, as the girl had emphatically stated that whatever
was done was against her will, the reasons which in our opinion, as it will
appear, made the complaint evidence upon the second and third counts were
equally applicable to the first. [Emphasis added]

It appears that in Lillyman the
complainant had deposed to the attempted ravishment and sexual assault on her
person but not to her complaint. Lillyman is in fact authority for the
proposition that evidence of a complaint may be made in part or in toto by
evidence adduced through the recipient’s testimony. Arguments to the effect
that this cannot be so, because it is only evidence that is supportive of the
victim’s credibility, can only justify the conclusion, with which I am in
agreement, that evidence of a complaint through the recipient’s testimony
cannot be made unless the victim has testified to her ravishment. Indeed, if
she has not, the supportive evidence would have nothing to support and it is
clear that it cannot be

[Page 334]

tendered as evidence of the facts complained of.[16]

Now to deal with the last of the issues raised
by this appeal.

THIRD ISSUE: The
role of the judge on the voir dire.

Assuming, as in this case, the victim has
testified not only to her ravishment but also to her complaint and that there
is conflicting evidence between her version of the complaint and that of the
recipient(s), should the judge on the voir dire weigh the
evidence and determine whether there has been a complaint before letting the
jury be apprised of it and give it whatever probative value it deserves; or,
should he limit himself to determining whether there is some evidence which, if
believed by the jury, would constitute a complaint.

Since such evidence is admitted for the ultimate
purpose of negating the possible probative effect the victim’s silence would
have in the eyes of the jury on the victim’s credibility, one could argue that
they should be apprised of anything that would have some such negating value.
One could then, following this reasoning, argue with some logic that the judge
should also let them determine whether it is an “early complaint” and whether
it was a “spontaneous” one, if there is as to the latter questions some discrepancy
in the evidence between the victim and the recipient of the complaint, as long
as there is some evidence which, if believed, would result in the complaints
being “early” and “spontaneous”.

Some cases support this view. The preponderant
view, however, is that it is for the judge to finally decide whether or not a
complaint was elicited by questions of a “leading and inducing or intimidating
character” and whether it was made “at the first opportunity after the offence
which reasonably offers itself”; and these cases so hold irrespective of
whether, there being contradictory evidence regarding those two issues, there
is some evidence

[Page 335]

which, if believed, would result in the
complaint being “early” and “spontaneous”. (See R. v. Osborne, supra;
R. v. Cummings[17]; R.
v. Woodworth, Stutt and Giles[18];
R. v. Belliveau, supra).

Logic would then suggest that conflicting
evidence as to the existence of the complaint should be dealt with in the same
way and be weighed and determined by the judge, at the voir dire. The
rule is not the result of cold logic but has come to us from the middle ages
and existed long before scholars started rationalizing and categorizing in a
system of law the various ways judges dealt with evidentiary problems over the
centuries. When the old rule was expanded and reformulated in the last years of
the nineteenth century and the first years of the twentieth, it appears that
the existence of the complaint was a matter of fact left to the jury whilst the
determination of its recentness and of its spontaneity were simply left to the
judge, with no reasons given.

In Lillyman, Hawkins J., in support of
giving the jury more than the mere fact of a complaint, said (at p. 177):

After very careful consideration we have
arrived at the conclusion that we are bound by no authority to support the
existing usage of limiting evidence of the complaint to the bare fact that a
complaint was made, and that reason and good sense are against our doing so.
The evidence is admissible only upon the ground that it was a complaint of that
which is charged against the prisoner, and can be legitimately used only for
the purpose of enabling the jury to judge for themselves whether the conduct of
the woman was consistent with her testimony on oath given in the witness-box
negativing her consent, and affirming that the acts complained of were against
her will, and in accordance with the conduct they would expect in a truthful
woman under the circumstances detailed by her. The jury, and they only, are
the persons to be satisfied whether the woman’s conduct was so consistent or
not. Without proof of her condition, demeanour, and verbal expressions,
all of which are of vital importance in the consideration of that question, how
is it possible for them satisfactorily to

[Page 336]

determine it? Is it to be left to the
witness to whom the statement is made to determine and report to the jury
whether what the woman said amounted to a real complaint? And are the jury
bound to accept the witness’s interpretation of her words as binding upon them
without having the whole statement before them, and without having the power to
require it to be disclosed to them, even though they may feel it essential to
enable them to form a reliable opinion? For it must be borne in mind that if such
evidence is inadmissible when offered by the prosecution, the jury cannot alter
the rule of evidence and make it admissible by asking for it themselves. [The
underlining is mine]

And later on (at p. 178):

…when the whole statement is laid before
the jury they are less likely to draw wrong and adverse inferences, and may
sometimes come to the conclusion that what the woman said amounted to no real
complaint of any offence committed by the accused. [Emphasis added]

There is therefore in Lillyman, and indeed
in most cases subsequent to the Lillyman case, though not explicitly
said, the suggestion, all the more strong as it seems to be taken for granted,
that if there is some evidence which the jury could weigh and consider as a
complaint, the judge is to leave it to them subject to his having first
determined that it would be an “early” and “spontaneous” complaint. (See
amongst others R. v. Ball, supra, and R. v. Waddell, supra). I
cannot find much wrong in proceeding this way save possible illogicality in treating
differently the issues of “spontaneity” and of “recentness”: indeed, even if
there is some evidence that, if believed, would establish the complaint as
being an “early” and “spontaneous” one, it is for him, and not for the jury, to
make that determination. But as I said earlier, the rule suffers for logic at
the outset by the indiscriminate application to all victims of any sex offence
of the very assumption upon which it is predicated. Probably the best argument
in favour of so doing is that this is the state in which the rule came to us
from Lillyman and I can find as many illogicalities created by modifying
it as those purportedly done away with.

[Page 337]

NOW TO SUMMARIZE:

1. In a rape case, a complaint is any statement
made by the alleged victim which, given the circumstances of the case, will, if
believed, be of some probative value in negating the adverse conclusions the
trier of fact could draw as regards her credibility had she been silent;

2. Before admitting a complaint as evidence, the
judge shall hold a voir dire to determine:

(a), whether there is some evidence which if
believed by the trier of fact (in this case the jury) would constitute a
complaint;

(b) that the complaint was not elicited by
questions of a “leading and inducing or intimidating character”;

(c) and that it was “made at the first
opportunity after the offence which reasonably offers itself”.

((b) and (c) are the words of Ridley J. in R.
v. Osborne, supra).

3. In determining whether there is some evidence
which, if believed by the jury, would constitute a complaint, the trial judge
shall take into account evidence by the victim, if any, as well as that of any
person recipient of that complaint.

4. Evidence by a recipient person is admissible
on the voir dire and before the trier of fact only if the victim has
testified as to the facts material to the commission of the offence; but it is
not necessary that the victim need have testified as to the complaint itself.

In the case at bar, the trial judge was right in
admitting as evidence Catherine’s words “Larry hurt me”, for I am of the view
that, given the circumstances of the case, those words, even standing alone,
constitute a complaint; indeed, if the jury believes she said that, the
statement is of some probative value in negating the effect her total silence
would have had on her credibility.

I am also of the view that the judge should have
admitted in evidence Vivian’s version of Cathe-

[Page 338]

rine’s complaint. Having done so, he should have
instructed the jury that it was their duty to determine what in fact Catherine
had said and then give those words whatever probative value they deserved in
the light of the usual instructions a judge gives as regards the limited use of
complaint evidence. Not having done so, he erred in law, and the Court of
Appeal was right, in my opinion, in ordering a new trial.

For these reasons, I would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

informations on date of scheduled appearance—No action taken by Court on
charges—Informations later located elsewhere with another magistrate—Accused
summoned to appear at later date—Objection taken to jurisdiction of Court—Loss
of jurisdiction.

R. v. Krannenburg, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1053, followed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest
 Territories allowing an appeal from a decision of Tallis J.[1]
dismissing the respondent’s application for an order of prohibition. Appeal
dismissed.

E.G. Ewaschuk, Q.C., and R. Fainstein,
for the appellant.

Barrie Chivers, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The judgment in R. v. Krannenburg,
delivered concurrently, determines the present appeal. The facts in the two
cases are different, but the procedural question is common to both.

In the instant case, the respondent was charged
with (i) failing to comply with a demand made by a peace officer to provide a
sample of his breath; and (ii) driving while impaired. On the appointed date,
he appeared before the magistrate in Hay River, Northwest Territories. Paragraph 9 of the
agreed statement of facts reads:

THAT at that time, the Clerk could not
locate the informations, that the informations were not present in

[Page 1064]

Court and that no action of any nature
whatsoever was taken by the Court on the charges.

Nothing was done. The informations were missing.
It later developed that they were in the possession of another magistrate in Yellowknife. When the respondent was
summoned to appear at a later date, objection was taken to the jurisdiction of
the Court.

The Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories, following the
judgment of the Alberta Appellate Division in Krannenburg, allowed the
appeal of the accused from the decision of Tallis J.

I would dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to the
order granting leave to appeal to this Court, the appellant will pay the costs
of the respondent on a solicitor and client basis.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Failure of Court to proceed
with case at appointed time and place—Resulting loss of
jurisdiction—Jurisdiction over offence not saved by curative section of
Code—Criminal Code , s.440.1  [en. 1974-75-76, c. 93, s. 43 ].

On February 9, 1977, the respondent was
charged with unlawfully driving a motor vehicle while impaired. The case was
adjourned from time to time until finally set for trial on April 21, 1977, at 2:00 p.m. in Courtroom No. 5 of the Provincial Court Building in the City of Edmonton. Due to a mix-up, the case was called that morning in Courtroom No.
1 and, the respondent not being present, the provincial judge issued a warrant
for her arrest. Unaware of these developments, the respondent and her counsel
duly appeared at Courtroom No. 5 at 2:00 p.m. Her name did not appear on the
list of cases scheduled to be heard that afternoon. Crown counsel told
respondent’s counsel that he knew nothing about the charge. The respondent and
her counsel departed.

Thereafter, the respondent applied to the
Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta for an order (i) setting aside
the warrant, and (ii) prohibiting the Provincial Court from dealing further with the information. The order was granted.
The Crown conceded that the warrant had been improperly issued, but challenged,
in the Appellate Division, that part of the order which prohibited further
proceedings on the information. The Appellate Division in a unanimous judgment
maintained the order of prohibition. Subsequently, leave to appeal to this
Court was granted. The narrow question was whether s. 440.1  of the Criminal
Code , a curative section proclaimed in force April 26, 1976, remedies a loss of jurisdiction
resulting from the failure of a court to proceed with a case at the appointed
time and place.

[Page 1054]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The language of s. 440.1(1), read in its
grammatical and ordinary sense, is simply not wide enough to cover the
situation, as here, where there is failure on the part of the court to proceed.
The language of s. 440.1 (2) is equally inapposite.

Section 440.1(1), on a plain reading,
contemplates three elements, precedent to the operation of the section, namely,
(i) a proceeding before a court, judge, magistrate or justice; (ii) failure to
comply with the provisions of the Code relating to adjournments or
remands; (iii) non-appearance of the accused or defendant at any such
proceeding or adjournment thereof. It is doubtful if any one of these elements
is present in circumstances where the accused or defendant appears at the time
and place appointed, but the court fails to appear and nothing is done.

Section 440.1  is directed to the situation
where there has been a procedural defect or irregularity in respect of
adjournments or remands. The court may purport to adjourn the trial or remand
the accused, but inadvertently breach some provision of the Criminal Code  in
so doing. A good example is the case in which the magistrate contravenes the
eight-day time limitation by adjourning the matter beyond eight days without
consent or sine die. In those circumstances, the proceedings are not to
be held to be invalid. Section 440.1 , in effect, gives statutory recognition to
the earlier practice of issuing a summons or warrant to bring an accused person
before the court where there had been an improper adjournment and the accused
failed to appear.

The problem in the instant case was not one
of contravention of the requisites of the Code relating to adjournments.
There was no failure to comply with any provision of the Code. The
imbroglio arose because the court failed to appear and nothing was done at the
time and place set for trial.

In the case of Doyle v. The Queen, [1977]
1 S.C.R. 597, the Court evidenced a willingness to abandon the distinction
between loss of jurisdiction over the person (as in improper adjournments) and
loss of jurisdiction over the offence (as in a failure to proceed). Section
440.1 , however, cannot be interpreted as embracing both eventualities. It is
not so worded as to save jurisdiction over the offence when the court has not
acted. The decision in Trenholm v. Attorney-General of Ontario, [1940]
S.C.R. 301, affirmed in Doyle, governs this appeal.

[Page 1055]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division[1],
dismissing the Crown’s appeal from the granting of an order of prohibition.
Appeal dismissed.

J. Watson, for the appellant.

Brian Burrows, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—It has long been recognized in our
law that an inferior court may suffer loss of jurisdiction by reason of some
procedural irregularity, as for example, when the date to which an accused is
remanded or to which a case is adjourned for trial comes and goes without any
hearing or appearance, “with nothing done”. The narrow question in this appeal
is whether s. 440.1  of the Criminal Code , a curative
section proclaimed in force April 26, 1976, remedies a loss of
jurisdiction resulting from the failure of a court to proceed with a case at
the appointed time and place.

The facts are short and simple. On February 9, 1977, the respondent was charged with
unlawfully driving a motor vehicle while impaired. The case was adjourned from
time to time until finally set for trial on April 21, 1977, at 2.00 p.m. in Courtroom No. 5 of the Provincial Court Building in the City of Edmonton. Due to a mix-up, the case was called that morning in Courtroom No.
1 and, the respondent not being present, the provincial judge issued a warrant
for her arrest. Unaware of these developments, the respondent and her counsel
duly appeared at Courtroom No. 5 at 2.00 p.m. Her name did not appear on the
list of cases scheduled to be heard that afternoon. Crown counsel told
respondent’s counsel that he knew nothing about the charge. The respondent and
her counsel departed.

Thereafter, the respondent applied to the Trial
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta for an order (i) setting aside the warrant,
and (ii) prohib-

[Page 1056]

iting the Provincial
 Court from dealing further with the information. The
order was granted. The Crown conceded that the warrant had been improperly
issued, but challenged, in the Appellate Division, that part of the order which
prohibited further proceedings on the information. The Appellate Division in a
unanimous judgment maintained the order of prohibition.

In circumstances of a failure to act, the
leading decision is Trenholm v. Attorney-General of Ontario[2], in which the applicant sought a writ of habeas
corpus. He had appeared before a magistrate on January 3, 1938, and was remanded to
January 10, 1938. An inquiry into his mental condition was being conducted in
the interim. By warrant dated January 12, he was detained at a mental
institution. It was held the warrant was not validly issued because the remand
had expired on the tenth, at which time no steps were taken. Thus, there was no
authority under which the warrant could have been issued. There was “no
criminal cause or charge in existence”: per Kerwin J. at p. 308. The
justice became functus: per Davis J. at p. 313. Loss of
jurisdiction over the offence occurred when the date of adjournment or remand
passed and “nothing was done”. Such procedural defect destroyed the
jurisdiction of the court. The indictment or warrant became invalid and of no
effect. R. v. Lights[3]; Ex
p. Peters[4]; R.
v. Mack[5].

In a more recent judgment of this Court, Doyle
v. The Queen[6], Trenholm
was affirmed. Where a court fails to proceed with a hearing, jurisdiction
over the information charging the accused with the offence is lost, and
thereafter “that information is to be treated as if it had never been laid”:
per Ritchie J. at p. 610.

The question for determination in the case at
bar, however, is whether s. 440.1 of the Code has changed all of
this. Does the section have the

[Page 1057]

result of saving the jurisdiction which would
otherwise have been lost? Section 440.1  reads:

(1) The validity of any proceeding before a
court, judge, magistrate or justice is not affected by any failure to comply
with the provisions of this Act relating to adjournments or remands, and where
such failure has occurred and an accused or a defendant does not appear at any
such proceeding or upon any adjournment thereof, the court, judge, magistrate
or justice may issue a summons or, if it or he considers it necessary in the
public interest, a warrant for the arrest of the accused or defendant.

(2) Where, in the opinion of the court,
judge, magistrate or justice, an accused or a defendant who appears at a
proceeding has been misled or prejudiced by reason of any matter referred to in
subsection (1), the court, judge, magistrate or justice may adjourn the
proceeding and may make such order as it or he considers proper.

(3) The provisions of Part XIV apply mutatis
mutandis where a summons or warrant is issued under subsection (1).

The Crown contends that where an adjournment
expires with no valid action taken by the court, s. 440.1(1) preserves the
court’s jurisdiction on the information charging the accused. Reliance is place
upon Doyle v. The Queen, supra.

Prior to the decision in Doyle, there was
a respectable body of authority which drew a distinction between loss of
jurisdiction over the person and loss of jurisdiction over the offence, i.e.
the indictment or information. Loss of jurisdiction over the person was
considered to arise when the court failed to follow the prescriptions of the Criminal
Code  pertaining to adjournments and remands. Although jurisdiction over the
person was said to be lost, it could be regained when the accused appeared
before the court voluntarily or in response to a summons or warrant.
Proceedings then continued on the original information or indictment. See R.
v. Bence et al, Ex p. Regina Oral Arts Ltd.[7]; Re Kuhn and the Queen[8]; R. v. Stedelbauer Chevrolet Oldsmobile
Ltd.[9]; Re

[Page 1058]

Groves Certiorari Application[10];
but see also St-Pierre v. The Queen[11], and Kolot v. Hemsworth[12].

The judgment in Doyle cast doubt upon the
validity of a distinction between jurisdiction over the person and jurisdiction
over the offence. Very briefly, these were the circumstances in Doyle. There
had been a number of delays and adjournments, each of which had been met by
protest from counsel representing Doyle. Although the information had been
initiated December 8, 1973, it was not until April 1, 1974, that the charge was
read to the accused. At that time, the Court further adjourned the trial to a
time four months later. Doyle then brought an application for a writ of mandamus
declaring void his recognizance. Mr. Justice Ritchie, writing for this
Court, held that the failure to put the accused to his election “involved the
loss of jurisdiction over the accused” (p. 607); and, by adjourning the case
for more than eight days, “jurisdiction over the person of the accused was
accordingly lost” (p. 608). Later in the judgment, in obiter dicta, Mr. Justice
Ritchie, had this to say:

In the present case if the magistrate had
granted an adjournment for eight days and then done nothing, the situation
would have been exactly within the Trenholm decision and I cannot see
that the affirmative violation of the Code by adjournment for more than
eight days which occurred here affords any distinction in principle from the
acquiescence in allowing an eight-day adjournment to expire which is what
occurred in Trenholm. (p. 609)

It is this language which has been interpreted
as removing the distinction between loss of jurisdiction over the information
or indictment and loss of jurisdiction over the person. See the annotation “The
Wonderful World of Practice”, 35 C.R.N.S. 14 at p. 19; also “Criminal Law
and Procedure”, (1977) 9 Ott.L.R. 568 at p. 648.

It should be observed at the outset that this
case approximates the situation in Trenholm, where “nothing is done”,
rather than in Doyle, where there was a clear contravention of a
specific provision of the Code relating to adjournments. Doyle

[Page 1059]

did nothing to erode the view expressed in Trenholm
that when the assigned date passes, without action taken, jurisdiction is
lost. Doyle had the effect of recognizing a like loss of jurisdiction
when there has been an irregular adjournment or remand. If the dicta in Doyle
could be said to have suppressed the distinction between jurisdiction over
the person and jurisdiction over the offence, s. 440.1  may be seen as
restoring that distinction, in the sense that it permits the court, judge,
magistrate or justice to issue a summons or warrant to secure attendance of an
accused or defendant where there is any failure to comply with the provisions
of the Code relating to adjournments or remands. The validity of the
proceeding is not affected by such failure.

The Crown advances two main arguments. First, it
is said that in setting an adjournment to a certain time and place, and
allowing it to expire without the court taking steps to extend the adjournment
or otherwise deal with the matter, there has been a failure to comply with the
provisions relating to adjournments. When the court does nothing on the
‘adjourned’ date, it has failed to comply with the terms of the adjournment and
is therefore within the curative scope of s. 440.1 .

Second, it is argued that the section ought
to be given a liberal construction; taking a fair and liberal reading, failure
to deal with a matter on the adjourned date is a failure relating to an
adjournment. The spirit in which s. 440.1  was enacted was that of
resolving procedural irregularities and losses of jurisdiction. If Doyle teaches
that there is no difference in principle between the two sets of circumstances
in which formerly there would have been a loss of jurisdiction, then
s. 440.1  ought to be applied equally to cover losses of jurisdiction over
the person and the offence. More particularly, it is urged that the section can
be used to remedy a failure by the court to attend proceedings set for a
particular day.

The Crown submits that a narrow reading of
s. 440.1  will revive the dichotomy of loss of jurisdiction and that the
section should receive such large

[Page 1060]

interpretation as will save jurisdiction in a
case such as the one at bar. It might be noted that a broad interpretation was
given in Magna v. R.[13]; in R.
v. Griffin, Whyte, Porter, and Bruce (Ont. Weekly Court, August 15,
1978, unreported); and in Craven and National Aviation Consultants
Ltd. v. R. (Toronto Weekly Court, March 26, 1979, unreported). A narrow
interpretation was preferred by the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island
sitting in banco in R. v. Barry (October 11, 1978, unreported).

In my view, the interpretation the Crown would
give to the word “adjournment”, in order to use s. 440.1  to cure a loss of
jurisdiction consequent upon a failure of the court to attend, is both
artificial and contrived. The language of s. 440.1(1), read in its grammatical
and ordinary sense, is simply not wide enough to cover the situation, as here,
where there is failure on the part of the court to proceed. The language of
s. 440.1(2) is equally inapposite.

Section 440.1(1), on a plain reading,
contemplates three elements, precedent to the operation of the section, namely,
(i) a proceeding before a court, judge, magistrate or justice; (ii) failure to
comply with the provisions of the Code relating to adjournments or
remands; (iii) non‑appearance of the accused or defendant at any
such proceeding or adjournment thereof. In my view, it is doubtful if any one
of these elements is present in circumstances where the accused or defendant
appears at the time and place appointed, but the court fails to appear and
nothing is done.

Section 440.1  is directed to the situation where
there has been a procedural defect or irregularity in respect of adjournments
or remands. The court may purport to adjourn the trial or remand the accused,
but inadvertently breach some provision of the Criminal Code  in so
doing. A good example is the case in which the magistrate contravenes the
eight-day time limitation by adjourning the matter beyond eight days without
consent (R. v. Dupras Ltd.; R. v. Latraverse[14]) or sine die (Queen v.

[Page 1061]

Morse[15]; Queen v. Quinn[16]; R. v. Moore[17]). In those
circumstances, the proceedings are not to be held to be invalid. Section 440.1 ,
in effect, gives statutory recognition to the earlier practice of issuing a
summons or warrant to bring an accused person before the court where there had
been an improper adjournment and the accused failed to appear.

The problem in the instant case was not one of
contravention of the requisities of the Code relating to adjournments.
There was no failure to comply with any provision of the Code. The
imbroglio arose because the court failed to appear and nothing was done at the
time and place set for trial.

In the case of Doyle, the Court
evidenced, as I have indicated, a willingness to abandon the distinction
between loss of jurisdiction over the person (as in improper adjournments) and
loss of jurisdiction over the offence (as in a failure to proceed). Section
440.1 , however, cannot be interpreted as embracing both eventualities. It is
not so worded as to save jurisdiction over the offence when the court has not
acted. The Trenholm decision, affirmed in Doyle, governs this
appeal.

I add this caveat. The Appellate Division
was of opinion that the Court had lost jurisdiction over the offence, but that
a new information was available, if one could be laid within the limitation
period for summary conviction cases. The question of whether a new information
may be laid after jurisdiction has been lost is not before us, and I refrain
from any extended discussion on the point, in the absence of argument and on
the narrow facts of this case. It is manifest, however, that there will be
occasions on which the laying of a new information will not be available. Time
limitations may preclude it. Indeed, the laying of another information may
amount to nothing less than an abuse of process. The successful challenge

[Page 1062]

to jurisdiction may not come until after trial
on the merits and conviction. The full effect of s. 440.1(2) and possible
prejudice to the accused, through the laying of a new information, would
require consideration. The dicta in Doyle should not therefore,
in my opinion, be taken as authority for the proposition that in every case it
will be possible, when jurisdiction over the offence is lost, to lay another
information in the same jurisdiction charging the same offence.

I would dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to the
order granting leave to appeal to this Court, the appellant will pay the costs
of the respondent on a solicitor and client basis.

Appeal dismissed.

Donald B. Bayne, for the appellant.

J.D. Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The appellant, Charette, was
charged, along with several others, in an indictment dated October 4, 1976,
with conspiracy to use forged documents (cheques) as if they were genuine,
contrary to s. 326  of the Criminal Code  of Canada. The Crown’s case was entirely dependent upon evidence obtained by
the interception of certain private telephone communications which were
purportedly made pursuant to an authorization given by a Supreme Court judge
under s. 178.13  of the Criminal Code . At the outset of the trial, the
trial judge held an extensive voir dire of some eight and-one-half days,
during which he

[Page 786]

the entire Crown case covering all questions
relating to the obtaining of the interceptions in addition to evidence
concerning the validity of the authorization and the procedures followed by the
Crown in pursuance of it. At the conclusion of the voir dire, he held
that transcripts of the interceptions made by the Crown, as well as certain
derivative evidence obtained because of the interceptions, were inadmissible.
The Crown case, depending as it did upon such evidence, was therefore
destroyed. The jury, which had been sworn before the commencement of the voir
dire, was recalled and the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal
since the Crown had led no evidence. The accused were acquitted. The Crown
appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal with the result that a new trial was
directed. The reasons of the Court, written by Dubin J.A., have been reported
and are to be found as R. v. Parsons et al.[2]

Before this Court, the appellant raised
substantially the same points that were canvassed in the Court of Appeal.
Because I am of the view that the appeal must fail and a new trial be ordered,
I do not consider it wise or necessary to deal at any greater length with the
matter than to express approval of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I adopt
the reasons given in that Court by Dubin J.A. which, in my view, correctly deal
with all the issues raised in this case. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal
and confirm the direction for a new trial.

Appeal dismissed, direction for a new
trial confirmed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Admissibility
of statements—Inculpatory statements made by paranoid schizophrenic—Accused fit
to stand trial after treatment—Defence of insanity not raised.

Appellant was convicted of non-capital
murder. The conviction was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal without
reasons. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the sole issue was whether
the trial judge had erred in law in admitting in evidence, after a voir
dire, certain inculpatory statements made by the accused on the day of his
arrest, and a few months later when he was being taken on remand to a mental
health centre. Appellant did not give evidence on the voir dire or
before the jury. On the voir dire the sole defence evidence was from a
psychiatrist who diagnosed the appellant as a paranoid schizophrenic. The
accused was later regarded as fit to stand trial.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

It is not an invariable rule that inculpatory
statements by an insane man are ipso facto inadmissible. There was here
evidence upon which the trial judge could act in holding the statements in
question admissible. Guidance as to the proper test of voluntariness to be
applied in such cases by the trial judge is to be found in both Ward v. The
Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 30, and R. v. Santinon (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d)
121, the underlying and controlling question being “is the statement freely and
voluntarily made”. A trial judge is not bound by a fixed formula when he
considers whether to admit inculpatory statements of an accused who is
allegedly insane, so long as he addresses himself to the proper considerations,
as was done in this case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
recorded reasons an appeal from a conviction of non-capital murder. Appeal
dismissed.

John Hornak, for the appellant.

S. Casey Hill, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The accused was convicted of
non-capital murder after trial before O’Driscoll J. and a jury. The conviction
was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal which found it unnecessary to
deliver any reasons. On appeal to this Court, by its leave, the sole issue was
whether the trial Judge had erred in law in admitting in evidence, after a voir
dire, certain inculpatory statements made by the accused on the day of his
arrest and a few months later when he was being taken to the mental health
centre at Penetanguishene after being remanded there on the order of a Provincial
Court Judge.

The accused did not give evidence on the voir
dire or before the jury. The sole defence evidence on the voir dire was
given by Dr. R.L. Fleming, a psychiatrist at the mental health centre, who
diagnosed the accused as a paranoid schizophrenic. Although he testified that
the accused was not fit to stand trial when he saw him at Penetanguishene on
December 16, 1975, the accused’s condition improved with treatment, and no
issue was raised as to his fitness for trial when it began on April 27, 1976. Insanity was not raised as a
defence.

It was the contention of counsel for the accused
that the trial Judge had applied the wrong test in law in holding that the
inculpatory statements were admissible in evidence. This was his principal
ground of appeal although he also urged that the evidence on the voir dire was
too “meagre” to

[Page 716]

warrant a ruling of admissibility. He also
suggested as well that this Court should hold that no inculpatory statement by
an insane person should be admitted in evidence, even if there was no promise
of benefit or inducement or threat by a person in authority, but later
abandoned this position.

It is clear that there was evidence upon which
the trial Judge could act in holding that the inculpatory statements were
admissible, and it would be going too far to hold, as an invariable rule, that
inculpatory statements by an insane man were ipso facto inadmissible:
see Sinclair v. The King[1], R. v.
Basto[2]. The
main contention that the trial Judge had applied the wrong test of
voluntariness, in respect of statements by a paranoid schizophrenic was based
on an alleged distinction between the test expressed in R. v. Santinon[3], a judgment of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal and the test expressed by this Court in the judgment delivered
by Spence J. in Ward v. The Queen[4].
O’Driscoll J. was said to have adopted the Santinon test, and it was
submitted that the Ward case, which had not yet been decided at the time
that the accused was tried, prescribed a different test, one more favourable to
the accused. This is not the way that I read the two cases. In Santinon, Bull
J.A., as he then was, said at p. 124 of 11 C.C.C. (2d):

The first proposition of the appellant on
the first ground of appeal is that he was insane, and shown so to be on the voire
dire, within the meaning of the definition in Criminal Code , section 16(2) ,
in that he was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts,
and while in that condition, any statement made by him could not be a free and
voluntary one. The appellant’s counsel bluntly put his primary proposition on
the basis that any statement made by an insane man, whether to persons in
authority or not, can never be admissible as being free and voluntary because
of the lack of capacity. He was unable to refer us to any Canadian, English or
Commonwealth authorities for such a proposition, and I am aware of none. In my
view, the question of admissi-

[Page 717]

bility of a statement of an accused depends
on it being established that it was free and voluntary in the limited sense
above, of not having been induced or obtained either by fear of prejudice or
hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. That rule
must, I think, be qualified to the extent that, having regard to the infinite
degrees of insanity, if such incapacity is shown that the accused, for example,
is so devoid of rationality and understanding, or so replete with psychotic
delusions, that his uttered words could not fairly be said to be his statement
at all, then it should not be held admissible. There may well be other similar
situations. But I do not think it necessary to consider them because in this
case it is clear that, whatever his mental condition, the appellant was well
aware of what he was doing and saying to the police officers at the time of his
interviews. The reliability of an admissible statement of an insane or mentally
ill person is another matter which involves weight that is to be given to it by
a jury, which is not concerned with the question of admissibility. I recognize
that in many cases there would be no probative value whatsoever to the
confession of an insane person. In result, I see no validity in the broad and
all encompassing proposition that an insane man cannot make an admissible statement
or confession, or put in converse form, that a confession of an insane man must
not be admitted into evidence simply because of his insanity, even if it be
voluntary within the proper meaning of that term as I have described. An insane
person is not normally incapacitated because of insanity per se from giving
sworn evidence as a witness and I can see no reason why his voluntary
statements should be rendered inadmissible because of the same condition.
Whether they should be believed is another matter entirely.

In the Ward case, Spence J. referred to
the reasons of Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King[5] at pp. 269-270 and underlined the
last sentence in the passage, which was as follows: “The underlying and
controlling question then remains, is the statement freely and voluntarily
made”. Spence J. then continued as follows (at p. 40 of [1979] 2 S.C.R.):

[Page 718]

I have underlined the last sentence in Rand
J.’s statement to indicate that in my view the examination of whether there was
any hope of advancement or fear of prejudice moving the accused to make the
statements is simply an investigation of whether the statements were “freely
and voluntarily made”. In my view, there is a further investigation of whether
the statements were freely and voluntarily made even if no hope of advantage or
fear of prejudice could be found in consideraion of the mental condition of the
accused at the time he made the statements to determine whether or not the
statements represented the operating mind of the accused. In my view, Manning
J. engaged in a consideration of both the mental and physical condition of the
accused, firstly, to determine whether a person in his condition would be
subject to hope of advancement or fear of prejudice in making the statements,
when perhaps a normal person would not, and, secondly, to determine whether,
due to the mental and physical condition, the words could really be found to be
the utterances of an operating mind. Manning J. had a reasonable doubt of both
issues and, therefore, found the statements to be inadmissible. It is not
denied that a reasonable doubt on the part of the trial judge upon the issue is
sufficient to justify his refusal to admit the statements in evidence.

O’Driscoll J. in considering whether the
inculpatory statements of the accused were admissible quoted the passage
reproduced above from the judgment of Bull J.A. in Santinon and
concluded as follows:

Although the accused, in this case,
according to the evidence of Doctor Fleming, was in an acute state when he saw
him on December 16th 1975, I do not find on this evidence that he was so devoid
of rationality and understanding, or so replete with psychotic delusions that
his uttered words could not fairly be said to be his statements at all. Having
come to that conclusion, it is my finding that the statements attributed to the
accused on the airplane trip on December the 11th, and in the police cruiser on
the way to Penetanguishene should be admitted into evidence before the jury,
and let the jury decide what reliability should be placed upon them, if any.

Merely because O’Driscoll J. did not use the
words “operating mind”, found in the reasons of Spence J. in the Ward case
is no ground for saying that he used a wrong test. A trial Judge is not bound
by a fixed formula when he considers whether to admit inculpatory statements so
long as he addresses

[Page 719]

himself to the proper considerations. This the
trial Judge did in this case.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEWFOUNDLAND, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Motor
vehicles—Breathalyzer—Evidence—Certificate of analysis—Rebuttable
presumption—Conclusive evidence ‘in the absence of any evidence to the
contrary’—Evidence required to constitute ‘evidence to the contrary’—‘Mere
possibility of inaccuracy’ insufficient—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
ss. 236, 237(1)(c), (f), 771(2), (3)—Interpretation Act, R.S.C 1970, c. I-23,
s. 24(1).

Respondent was seen driving a motorcycle in
an erratic manner at around 1.35 a.m. He failed a preliminary breath test on a
roadside screening device then went to a police station to be tested on a
Borkenstein Breathalyzer. At trial, the statutory Certificate of Analyses was
tendered as was a copy of the Instruction Manual issued by the manufacturer of
the breathalyzer. The manual stated in part that “The temperature of the
solution and room air must be within 1 °C of each other if accurate answers are
to be obtained”. The technician admitted that when he made the check with the
standard alcohol solution he noted the temperature of the solution but not the
room temperature. The defence called as a witness a doctor in chemistry who did
not claim to be an expert in breathalyzers and whose knowledge of these
instruments was limited to careful readings of the Instruction Manual put in
evidence by the Crown. This expert witness explained that there would be a
difference in the reading if there was not an equilibrium of temperature
between that of the room and that of the solution and that he would not put his
signature to an analysis unless he had taken the two temperatures and unless
they were the same. The magistrate dismissed the charge and his reasons were
endorsed by the District Court Judge on the basis that the evidence indicated
that the approved technician performed the tests in a manner that left the
results open to uncertainty. This judgment was affirmed by the Appeal Division
on the view that the failure of the technician to follow the prescribed mandatory
procedure in testing the accuracy of the machine made the certificate
inadmissible as evidence of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the
accused.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

[Page 1090]

The certificate filed fully complied with
s. 237(1) (f) of the Criminal Code  and was by itself evidence
of the results of the analyses. There is no implicit condition that the
instrument used must be shown to be functioning properly and the technician to
have followed the manufacturer’s instructions in testing its accuracy. It is
clear from the wording of the Code that the rebuttable presumption
arises from the mere statements in the certificate itself. That a scientist
would not sign a certificate of analysis is irrelevant. Parliament has
prescribed the conditions and did not see fit to require a check test, and for
good reason, it wanted its prohibition to be exactly enforceable. The
certificate was evidence and the only question was whether there was evidence
to the contrary sufficient at least to raise reasonable doubt. A review of the
defence expert’s evidence makes it clear that he did not show that the test
could have been affected to such an extent as to affect the reading in what was
not a borderline case (150 mg., i.e. 87 per cent in excess). The facts required
for a conviction are established and a verdict of guilty should be entered
without a need for a new trial.

affirming the judgment of Barry D.C.J. (loc. cit. at p. 200) who dismissed
a

[Page 1091]

Crown appeal from the acquittal of respondent,
Robert Crosthwait, by Magistrate Fowler on summary conviction proceedings. The
accused was charged that he:

On or about the 10th day of September,
A.D., 1977 at or near Gander, Newfoundland did unlawfully drive a motor vehicle
having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof in his
blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary
to Sec. 236  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

The evidence before the magistrate disclosed
that the accused, driving a motorcycle around 1:35 a.m. in an erratic manner, was first
requested to provide a breath sample for a preliminary test on a roadside
screening device. Having failed the test, he was requested to accompany the
officer to a police station for breath tests on a Borkenstein Breathalyzer. The
officer was a qualified technician duly authorized and he made the required two
breath analyses, each of which gave a reading of 150 milligrams per 100 millilitres
of blood. Between the two breath analyses, the officer made a test with a
standard alcohol solution and verified that the result of this test, based upon
the temperature of this solution which he noted, came within the prescribed
tolerance. Having completed the two breath tests, the officer made a
certificate of the two analyses with a notice of intention to produce as
evidence and immediately served this notice upon the respondent. The
Certificate of Analyses reads:

CERTIFICATE OF ANALYSES

I, B. McNeil         ,
being a person designated as a qualified technician, by the Attorney General of
Newfoundland pursuant to section 237(6)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada,

DO HEREBY CERTIFY:

THAT at Gander in the Province of
Newfoundland pursuant to a demand under section 235(1)  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, I did take Two samples of the breath of a person indentified to
me as Robert Crosthwait;

THAT I did receive each of the said samples
directly into a Borkenstein Breathalyzer, Model 900, an instrument approved for
this purpose pursuant to section 237(6)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada;

[Page 1092]

THAT I did perform a chemical analysis of
each of the said samples by means of the said instrument in which a solution
suitable for use in the said instrument and identified as an ampoule of
potassium dichromate reagent lot #67422 was used; THAT I performed the said
chemical analyses at Gander in the Province of Newfoundland; THAT one of the
said samples was taken at 2:18 a.m. on the 10th day of September, 1977, and that
the result of the proper chemical analysis of this sample was 150 milligrams of
alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood;

THAT another of the said samples was taken
at 2:36 a.m. on the 10th day of
September, 1977, and that the result of the proper chemical analysis of this
sample was 150 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood;

I FURTHER CERTIFY:

THAT this certificate of analyses is true
to the best of my skill and knowledge.

DATED this 10th day of September, 1977, at Gander in the Province of Newfoundland.

At the trial, the officer who had made the
breath analyses was called by the Crown. The Certificate was tendered in
evidence and duly received. There was also put in evidence a copy of the
Instruction Manual issued by the manufacturer of the breathalyzer used for the
test. In the part of this manual dealing with the use of a standard alcohol
solution for making a check on the accuracy of the instrument, there is the
following sentence: “The temperature of the solution and room air must be
within 1°C of each other if accurate answers are to be obtained”. The
technician admitted that when he made the check with the standard alcohol
solution he noted the temperature of the solution, but not that of the room
where the test was made. However, he said that the solution was taken by him
from the locker in that same room where he kept the instrument itself.

The defence called as a witness a doctor in
chemistry who did not claim to be an expert on the operation of breathalyzers.
His knowledge of those instruments was limited to careful readings of the
Instruction Manual which was put in evidence. The significant part of his
testimony is as follows:

[Page 1093]

A. Any pure liquid or any solution tends to
put one or more of its components into the vapour phase above the solution. The
amount of the component which goes into the vapour phase depends directly on
the temperature. To have a definitely established amount of substance in the
vapour phase and that is what we are doing here, we are saying there will be a
definitely established amount of alcohol in the vapour phase, we need for the
solution to have reached equilibrium with its surroundings. Most importantly,
this equilibrium involves the temperature of the surroundings. If one were to
take a reading when the solution when not in equilibrium with its surroundings
and then take a reading a little while later, the two readings of the amount of
substance in the vapour phase would be different and they would constantly change
until equilibrium is reached. Without actually carrying out a research program,
I would not be able to state how much the difference would be, how much the
change would be. But in any solution this would be the same. If one has the
solution at a different temperature, reads the temperature in the solution and
then takes a reading, leaves it a few minutes or a certain time, takes another
reading, then the values of the amount of whatever we are looking at in the
vapour phase would be different. Eventually, when the two, the solution and the
surroundings were in equilibrium, no matter how long you took between readings,
they would always come out the same. Once equilibrium has been reached.

Q. Now, you’ve had an opportunity to
familiarize yourself with the contents of that manual? A. Yes.

Q. Is it reasonable to assume that two
substances, namely air and water, because they may be in the same room, one
being locked in a cupboard at a lower altitude than the other, that these two
substances, that is the ambient air and the solution would be within one degree
centigrade of each other? A. What one can say about this Your Honour and I’ll
have to edge it around because one hasn’t seen where the things are kept and so
on, as one knows from one’s own house, the temperature around the thermostat
for example within a room may record 70 degrees Fahrenheit and yet one knows
that another portion of the room the temperature is not 70 degrees Fahrenheit,
it may be higher or it may be lower. Consequently, it is possible for temperatures
to vary between where the solution was stored and the general area where the
test was carried out, it is possible.

…

A. I would not put my signature to an
analyses unless I had got the two temperatures and unless they were the same.

[Page 1094]

Magistrate Fowler stated his reasons for
dismissing the charge in these words:

…This particular case rests on two factors
as presented by way of defence, the first being whether or not the taking of
the room temperature is essential to the proper and correct operation of the
breathalyzer machine. It is this Court’s understanding that once the machine is
ready to receive its first human breath sample and in fact does so, the reading
is recorded and then it is checked by a device known as an equilibrator to ensure
its proper functioning. If the technician is satisfied that the machine is
working properly, he then takes the required second sample of human breath and
once again prepares the machine and records the reading. The problem now
arises, whether or not the test performed to determine the proper functioning
of the breathalyzer machine was in itself a proper test, insofar as the
parameters of the equilibrator are concerned; that is the temperature and the
concentration of alcohol in the solution. The manual which has been entered as
Exhibit #2, BM#2, the Breathalyzer Model 900 Instruction Manual, states on page
26, and I quote from that Exhibit, “room air pumped through water containing
alcohol will take on a definite amount of alcohol controlled by the concentration
of alcohol in the solution and the temperature. The temperature of the solution
and room air must be within one degree celcius of each other if accurate
answers are to be obtained”. On page 27 of the same manual, it is stated,
“check the temperature of the solution to see that it is close to room
temperature.” Notwithstanding the chart on page 27 of the same manual, which no
doubt was derived knowing the parameters or variables of temperature and
alcohol content by the producers of the manual, the test of the machine’s
accuracy is done using an ‘equilibrator’, in a room with the specific
temperature, and that temperature must be recorded in order to determine its
deviation, if any, from that of the air and alcohol-water solution. If this is
not done, the technician does not know if his test on the machine yields a
correct reading. In the case before the bar today, Cst. McNeil, the technician,
stated, and I’m paraphrasing the Constable’s statement, that if he didn’t get a
correct reading the machine would not function properly and the reading would
be disqualified. He further stated that if the proper procedure was followed
nothing could go wrong. He also stated that he did not take and record the room
temperature but that since the standard alcohol solution test worked out, then
the room temperature and the air-alcohol solution temperature must be within
one degree celcius of each other. In effect he was saying that since the test
worked out, the machine worked out, and since the machine worked, therefore the
test worked. The obvious question

[Page 1095]

now then that has to be considered is “what
if both the machine and the equilibrator were in error?” The only answer would
be that the degree of error would be absolutely unknown. The only way to accurately
perform the test of the breathalyzer machine’s proper functioning is with a
good equilibrator test. In the evidence of Dr. Newlands, the expert
chemist, he stated that he has had twenty-two years experience in the field of
chemistry and is head of the Department of Chemistry at Memorial University of
Newfoundland. He further states to have a definitely established amount of
alcohol in the vapour stage, the solution must reach equilibrium with its
surroundings, most importantly the temperature of its surroundings. He further
states you could not assume both temperatures to be the same. A good
equilibrator test would require, I am not quoting this particular point now by
Dr. Newlands, this is the Court’s words, a good equilibrator test would
require the room temperature to be known as well as the concentration of
alcohol in the solution. The distinction between this case and the case of R.
vs. Dygdala in the Supreme Court of Alberta is that the instructional manual
was not entered in that case as well as no expert chemical evidence was entered
to assist in interpreting the principles of the chemistry involved. Referring
to use of the equilibrator, on page 26 of the Instructions Manual for the Model
900 Breathalyzer under the heading “Use of the Equilibrator”, which one would
have to assume from this piece of evidence defines the functionality of that
particular equilibrator, without the temperature noted, the instruction
manual’s reference to the use of the equilibrator becomes meaningless and it
does indeed give rise to a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the recorded
blood‑alcohol ratio of this particular accused. There are other factors
in this case, however, the case rests primarily on the issue just considered,
and consequently having said what I have just said, I find that I cannot enter
a conviction in this particular matter and I enter a finding of ‘not guilty’.
The case is dismissed against Mr. Crosthwait.

These reasons were endorsed by Barry D.C.J. who,
after quoting extensively from the evidence and reviewing cases including Dygdala[3] concluded as follows (at p. 214):

While the Code places a great
responsibility and power in the hands of an approved technician in making a
determination of the blood-alcohol level of an accused person, it also requires
of him that he perform his test

[Page 1096]

properly, using approved apparatus and
materials. The evidence of Dr. Newlands is that he performed such tests in
a manner as to leave the results open to question or uncertainty. In my view
that is unquestionably evidence to the contrary within the meaning of
section 237(1) (c). The learned magistrate was right in accepting his
testimony as to the principles involved in the conduct of the standard alcohol
solution tests, and of his critical appraisal of the method used by the
approved technician in this case. Accordingly I hereby confirm the decision of
the learned magistrate and dismiss this appeal.

On appeal Morgan J.A. with whom Furlong C.J.N.
and Gushue J.A. concurred, said on the main issue (at pp. 198-200):

In my view the rebuttable presumption of
the proportion of alcohol in the blood of an accused that arises under Sec.
237(1) (c) can only arise when it is made clear that all the
conditions prescribed by that section have been fulfilled. As I read the provisions
of Sec. 237, the accused is entitled to challenge the statements contained in
the certificate and if the information elicited on cross-examination reveals
that any one of the prescribed statutory conditions has not, in fact, been
fulfilled, the certificate itself cannot be relied on as evidence of the
proportion of alcohol in the accused’s blood.

One of the statutory prerequisites is that
a chemical analysis of each sample be made by means of an approved instrument
operated by a qualified technician. An approved instrument being defined as,

“…an instrument of a kind that is designed
to receive and make a chemical analysis of a sample of the breath of a person
in order to measure the proportion of alcohol in the blood of that person and
that is approved as suitable for the purposes of this section by order of
the Attorney General of Canada”,

Borkenstein Breathalyzer Model 900 is an
approved instrument within the meaning of that section.

In this case the qualifications of the
technician is not in issue but objection was taken as to the accuracy of the
particular instrument used by him.

A breathalyzer Instruction Manual is
supplied with each machine for the information and guidance of operators. In
addition to providing a check list of the proper steps to be taken by the
operator to eliminate error in conducting the breath sample test, the Manual
makes provision for the testing of the machine itself to ensure

[Page 1097]

the accuracy of the reading obtained. This
test involves the use of the equilibrator in which the standard alcohol
solution is placed. With respect to the use of the equilibrator the Manual
prescribes that when the alcohol solution is being performed the temperature of
the solution and room air must be within 1°C of each other if accurate answers
are to be obtained.

The importance of ensuring that the
solution and room air are within 1°C of each other if accurate answers are to
be obtained was re-emphasized by Dr. Newlands in his evidence to which I
have already referred. It was admitted that the technician did not take the
room temperature when testing the machine. Because the reading obtained was
within 10 milligrams of the predetermined reading on his chart he assumed that
the solution and room temperature were within the prescribed limits of each
other and thus the machine was functioning properly. An assumption he was not
entitled to make without knowing the room temperature.

In my opinion, it is implicit in the
statutory approval of a class of instruments that a particular instrument of
that class is functioning properly. The failure on the part of the technician
to follow the prescribed mandatory procedure in testing the accuracy of the
machine meant that the reliability of that particular machine was left in doubt
and therefore he could not certify the accuracy of the reading obtained on the
blood samples tests, as required by statute. The certificate then cannot be
said to have been in strict accord with the statutory provision which is a
prerequisite to the admissibility of the certificate as proof of the proportion
of alcohol in the blood of the accused. There being no other evidence adduced
the accused was properly acquitted and the learned District Court Judge quite
properly affirmed the Magistrate’s judgment.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

Subsection 236(1) under which the accused
was charged reads:

236. (1) Every one who drives a motor
vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion
or not, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof
in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, is
guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction
and is liable…

Respecting evidence in prosecutions under this
provision, paras, (c) and (f) of subs. 237(1) provide:

237. (1) In any proceeding under Section
234  or 236 ,

…

[Page 1098]

(c) where samples of the breath of
the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1) , if

(i) not proclaimed

(ii) each sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time, with an interval of
at least fifteen minutes between the times when the samples were taken,

(iii) each sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by a qualified technician, and

(iv) a chemical analysis of each sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician,

evidence of the results of the chemical
analyses so made is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that
the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the
offence was alleged to have been committed was, where the results of the
analyses are the same, the proportion determined by such analyses and, where
the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the proportions
determined by such analyses;

…

(f) where samples of the breath of
the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1) , a certificate of a qualified technician stating

(i) that each chemical analysis of the
samples has been made by means of an approved instrument operated by him in
which a substance or solution suitable for use in that approved instrument and
identified in the certificate was used,

(ii) the results of the chemical analyses
so made, and

(iii) if the samples were taken by him,

(A) not proclaimed

(B) the time when and the place where each
sample and any specimen described in clause (A) was taken, and

(C) that each sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by the technician,

[Page 1099]

is evidence of the statements contained in
the certificate without proof of the signature or the official character of the
person appearing to have signed the certificate.

Concerning para. (f) it must be
noted that subs. 24(1) of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23)
provides:

24. (1) Where an enactment provides that a
document is evidence of a fact without anything in the context to indicate that
the document is conclusive evidence, then, in any judicial proceedings, the
document is admissible in evidence and the fact shall be deemed to be
established in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.

In the instant case, the certificate filed at
the trial fully complies with the conditions stated in para. (f).
It was, therefore, by itself, evidence of the results of the analyses. With
respect, I cannot agree that there is another implicit condition namely, that
the instrument used must be shown to have been functioning properly, and the
technician had followed the manufacturer’s instructions in testing its
accuracy. It is clear from the wording of the Code that the rebuttable
presumption arises from the mere statements in the certificate itself. The
presumption may no doubt be rebutted by evidence that the instrument used was
not functioning properly but the certificate cannot be rejected on that amount.
It may very well be that a scientist would not sign a certificate of analysis
on the basis of the tests as performed by the technician, but this is
irrelevant. Parliament has prescribed the conditions under which a certificate
is evidence of the results of breath analyses and did not see fit to require
evidence that the approved instrument was operating properly. Parliament did
not see fit to require a check test be made with a standard alcohol solution
and made reference only to the solution used for the actual test. Technicians
are instructed to make a check test but the making of this test or its results
have not been made conditions of the validity of the certificate and it has not
been provided that the certificate would not be valid if it was not shown that
the instrument had been maintained and operated in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions.

[Page 1100]

There is no need to dwell on the reasons for
which Parliament did not specify those additional conditions, they are obvious.
In R. v. Moreau[4], Beetz
J. said (at p. 273):

…one of the reasons if not the only reason
why Parliament prescribed the use of approved instruments must have been that
it wanted its precise prohibition to be exactly enforceable. This intent would
be frustrated if approved instruments were treated as ordinary instruments.

This does not mean that the accused is at the
mercy of the technician: while the certificate is evidence by itself, the facts
of which it is evidence are “deemed to be established only in the absence of
any evidence to the contrary”. Thus, any evidence tending to invalidate the
result of the tests may be adduced on behalf of the accused in order to dispute
the charge against him. As was pointed out in R. v. Proudlock[5], it is not necessary in such cases that the
rebutting evidence should do more than raise a reasonable doubt and, of course,
this evidence may be sought in depositions given by witnesses of the Crown as
well as in depositions of defence witnesses. Therefore, in my view, the situation
here is that the certificate was evidence of the results of the analyses by
virtue of the express provisions of the Criminal Code , however, the
further question remained: Was there any evidence to the contrary sufficient at
least to raise a reasonable doubt?

The evidence on the basis of which the accuracy
of the results of the breath tests was questioned may be briefly summarized.
The tests themselves were not disputed, what was challenged was the check test
with the standard alcohol solution. It was pointed out that, according to the
Instruction Manual, for accurate results, the temperature of the solution and
room air must be within 1°C of each other. The technician did record the
solution temperature, he did not verify that it was within 1°C of the air temperature
of the room in which it was kept and the defence expert witness says it is
possible that it did differ by more than 1°C. As to the influence this may have
had on the accuracy of

[Page 1101]

the results of the check test, he says: “Without
actually carrying out a research program, I would not be able to state how much
difference would be, how much the change would be”.

After examining the whole of the evidence of
Dr. Newlands, I find that it does not provide any evidence of a
probability of a difference of more than 1 °C and no evidence of how or whether
such a possible difference could have influenced the results of the test to a
significant extent. In this connection I feel that it is important to note that
this is not a borderline case concerning the excess blood alcohol above the
allowable maximum of 80 milligrams. The two breath tests disclosed 150
milligrams, that is 87 per cent in excess. There is no suggestion in the
evidence that any conceivable difference between room air and alcohol solution
temperature could have affected the validity of the check test to such an
extent as to conceal a malfunction of this order of magnitude.

I am therefore of the opinion that the evidence
of Dr. Newlands does not constitute evidence to the contrary under
s. 237(1) (c) of the Criminal Code . Mere possibility of some
inaccuracy will not assist the accused. What is necessary to furnish evidence
to the contrary is some evidence which would tend to show an inaccuracy in the
breathalyzer or in the manner of its operation on the occasion in question of
such a degree and nature that it could affect the result of the analysis to the
extent that it would leave a doubt as to the blood alcohol content of the
accused person being over the allowable maximum. There is no such evidence
before the Court in the case at bar. Dr. Newlands’ testimony, taken at its
face value, does not supply it. It merely affords evidence of a mere
possibility of some inaccuracy in the check test, but no evidence as to the
extent of such inaccuracy in the case at bar or as to the possibility or
probability of the effect which any such inaccuracy might have had upon the
results of the breath analysis. The certificate therefore remains
uncontradicted.

At the hearing in this Court, counsel for the appellant
referred to the unreported judgment in R. v. Furey, a Newfoundland
Provincial Court

[Page 1102]

case, where reference was made to scientific
literature and experiments designed to show the extent of the influence of
differences between room air temperature and standard alcohol solution
temperature in performing a check test on a Borkenstein Breathalyzer; the
variation was not significant amounting only to a few milligrams. I do not find
it necessary to consider whether this being a matter of science, judicial
notice could be taken of those facts. It does not appear to me that there is
any need in the instant case to go into that question.

In my view in order to conclude that there was
no evidence before the Magistrate to rebut the certificate, it is enough to
note that the only evidence was merely of a possibility of a temperature
difference without any indication that this could have affected the results to
a significant extent. While it is for the trier of fact to weigh the evidence,
the question whether there is any evidence is a question of law and an
acquittal based on doubt resting on a conjectural possibility will be set
aside: Wild v. The Queen[6].

Seeing that all the facts required for the
conviction are established by the evidence, there is no need for a new trial,
and the proper order is to enter a verdict of guilty as was done by the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Fotti[7],
(affirmed by this Court, February 7, 1980[8]).

Concerning the sentence, it appears to me that
the proper order in the circumstances would be to return the case to the first
court of appeal, that is, the District Court of Newfoundland, in order that,
after hearing the parties, it may pass sentence and also adjudicate on costs at
trial and in that Court. I would not award costs on the second appeal, however,
I must point out that Morgan J.A. was in error in holding that, by virtue of
subs. 610(3) of the Criminal Code , no costs would be allowed in that
Court. These being summary conviction proceedings, the appeal to that Court was
governed by s. 771  of the Criminal Code , subss. (2) and (3) of
which provide:

[Page 1103]

(2) Sections 601 to 616 apply mutatis
mutandis to an appeal under this section.

(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2),
the court of appeal may make any order with respect to costs that it considers
proper in relation to an appeal under this section.

In R. v. Ouellette[9] it was held that, as a result of
these provisions, costs could be awarded against the Crown.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the
judgments of the courts below, enter a verdict of guilty and direct that the
case be referred to the District Court of Newfoundland for the imposition of
sentence and the adjudication of costs at trial and on appeal to that Court. I
would make no order as to the costs in the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland but,
in accordance with the terms on which leave to appeal was granted, the
appellant will pay respondent’s costs in this Court.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Rape — Defence of mistake of fact not put to
the jury — Honest belief that consent to intercourse — Mens rea — Reasonable
belief — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 143.

The appellant listed his house for sale with the real
estate firm with which the complainant, a real estate saleswoman, was
associated. After an appointment at a downtown restaurant for lunch to discuss
the house sale, during which lunch a good deal of liquor was consumed by both
parties, they went to the appellant's house, the one which was listed for sale.
There, the complainant contended, she was raped over her protests and strug­gles,
while the appellant claims he had an amorous interlude involving no more than a
bit of coy objection on her part and several acts of intercourse with her
consent. Whatever occurred in the house, the complai­nant eventually ran out of
the house naked with a man's bow tie around her neck and her hands tightly tied
behind her back with a bathrobe sash. She was in an upset state and exhibited
great fear and emotional stress.

When the defence closed its case and before the trial
judge commenced his charge, the jury was excluded while counsel for the
appellant argued that the trial judge should put the defence of mistake of fact
to the jury, i.e. that the judge tell the jury that if the appellant
entertained an honest though mistaken belief that the complainant was
consenting to the acts of intercourse as they occurred, the necessary mens
rea would not be present, and the appellant would be entitled to an
acquittal. The trial judge refused to accede to the request and the appellant
was eventually convicted of the rape of the complainant. The conviction was
affirmed in the Court of Appeal with one dissent, upon the fact that the trial
judge failed to put to the jury the defence of mistake of fact, the majority
adopting the view that the issue emerging from the evidence was a simple one of
consent or no consent.

[Page 121]

Held (Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Pigeon, Beetz, McIntyre and
Chouinard JJ.: It is well established that the trial judge must put before the
jury any defences which may be open to the accused upon the evidence whether raised
by the accused's counsel or not. This, however, does not mean that the trial
judge becomes bound to put every defence suggested to him by counsel. There
must be in the evidence some basis upon which the defence can rest and the
judge must consider, assuming that the evidence relied upon by the accused to
support a defence is true, whether that evidence is sufficient to justify the
putting of the defence. The test to be applied is that there must be in the
record some evidence which would convey a sense of reality in the submission.
In this case, to convey such a sense of reality, there must be some evidence
which if believed' would support the existence of a mistaken but honest belief
that the complainant was in fact consenting to the acts of .intercourse. Here,
the complainant's version excludes consent and any possible mistaken belief in
consent, while the appellant's version speaks of actual consent and no
suggestion of any mistaken belief could arise, and in this situation the only
realistic issue which can arise is the simple issue of consent or no consent.
To require the putting of the alternative defence of mistaken belief in
consent, the evidence must appear from or be supported by sources other than
the appellant in order to give it any air of reality.

Per Martland J.: If a case arises which
raises the issue as to whether, on a charge of rape, an accused person who
seeks to rely upon a defence of mistake of fact must, in order to succeed,
establish that his mistake was reasonable as well as honest, it is open to this
Court to determine that issue, and it is not precluded from so doing by the
judgment in Beaver v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 531.

Per Dickson and Estey JJ., dissenting: The
point in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in failing to put before
the jury a defence of mistaken belief in consent, such failure being a
non-direction amounting to misdirection.

With respect to the mens rea: The
mens rea which is required, and its nature and extent, will vary with
the particular crime: it can only be determined by detailed examination of the actus
reus of the offence. In a case of alleged rape, where a fact or
circumstance is not known to, or is misapprehended by, the accused, leading to
a mistaken but honest belief in the consent of the woman,

[Page 122]

his act is not culpable in relation to that element
of the offence. The actus reus of rape is complete upon {a) an act of
sexual intercourse; (b) without consent. An affir­mative finding as to each of
these elements does not finish the inquiry, however, for the requirement that
there be a guilty intention must also be satisfied. The great weight of
authority is in support of the view that the accused's perception of the
woman's consent is an important aspect of any prosecution for the crime of
rape. Intention or recklessness must be proved in rela­tion to all elements of
the offence, including absence of consent.

With respect to the defence of mistake of fact:
An honest and reasonable mistake of fact is on the same footing as the absence
of a reasoning faculty, as with infants, or impairment of the faculty, as in
lunacy. Culpability rests upon commission of the offence with knowledge of the
facts and circumstances comprising the crime. If the accused's act would be
innocent, according to facts as he believed them to be, he does not have the
criminal mind and ought not be punished for his act. Mistake is a defence where
it prevents an accused from having the mens rea which the law requires
for the very crime with which he is charged. Mistake of fact is more accurately
seen as a negation of guilty intention than as the affirmation of a positive
defence. Whether the mistake is rooted in an accused's mistaken perception, or
is based upon objective, but incorrect, facts confided to him by another, should
be of no consequence.

With respect to whether a defence of honest,
though mistaken, belief in consent must be based on reasonable grounds: The
mind with which the jury is concerned is that of the accused, not that of a
reasonable man. By importing a standard external to the accused, there is
created an incompatible mix of subjective and objective factors. If an honest
lack of knowledge is shown, then the subjective element of the offence is not
shown. To apply the reasonable standard in this appeal, the Court would defy
accepted and sound principles of criminal law.

With respect to the Plea and the Evidence: It
is not necessary that an accused specifically plead mistake. If there was
""some"" evidence to ""convey a sense of reality"" to a defence
of mistake as to consent, then the jury ought to have been instructed to
consider that plea. Here, even on the complainant's version there is much
common ground with the appellant's version which supports his defence of belief
in consent, and there is also circumstantial evidence supportive of a plea of
belief in consent.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia[1],
dismissing, by a majority, an appeal by the appellant from his conviction of
rape. Appeal dismissed, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting.

Douglas McK. Brown, Q.C., for the appellant. 

John Hall, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Pigeon, Beetz, McIntyre and Chouinard
JJ. was delivered by

McINTYRE J.—The appellant appeals his rape conviction, which was
affirmed in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia with one dissent, upon the
ground that the trial judge failed to put to the jury the defence of mistake of
fact. That ground is expressed in the appellant's factum in these words:

Did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the
jury on the question of honest belief by the accused that the Complainant
consented to intercourse and thus on the facts of this case, failed to put
properly before the jury a defence, such failure being a non-direction
amounting to misdirection?

A consideration of the facts of the case is vital to a resolution
of the problem it poses. The complainant was a real estate saleswoman employed
by a well-known and well-established real estate firm in Vancouver. She was
successful in her work. The appellant is a businessman who was anxious to sell
his home in Vancouver and he had listed it for sale with the real estate firm
with which the complainant was associated. She was to be responsible for the
matter on her firm's behalf. On August 4, 1976, at about 1:00 p.m., she met the
appellant by

[Page 124]

appointment at a downtown restaurant for lunch. The purpose of
the meeting was to discuss the house sale. The lunch lasted until about 4:00 or
4:30 p.m. During this time, a good deal of liquor was consumed by both parties.
The occasion became convivial, the proprietor of the restaurant and his wife
joined the party, and estimates of the amount of alcohol consumed varied in
retrospect, as one would expect. It does seem clear, however, that while each
of the parties concerned had a substantial amount to drink, each seemed capable
of functioning normally.

At about 4:00 p.m., or shortly thereafter, they left the
restaurant. The appellant drove the complainant's car while she sat in the
front passenger seat. They went to the appellant's house, the one which was
listed for sale, to further consider ques­tions arising in that connection. Up
to the time of arrival at the home, at about 4:30 or 5:00 p.m., there is no
significant variation in their account of events. From the moment of arrival,
however, there is a complete divergence. She related a story of rape completely
against her will and over her protests and struggles. He spoke of an amorous
interlude involving no more than a bit of coy objection on her part and several
acts of inter-course with her consent. Whatever occurred in the house, there is
no doubt that at about 7:30 p.m. the complainant ran out of the house naked
with a man's bow tie around her neck and her hands tightly tied behind her back
with a bathrobe sash. She arrived at the door of a house nearby and demanded
entry and protection. The occupant of the house, a priest, admitted her. She
was in an upset state and exhibited great fear and emotional stress. The police
were called and these proceedings followed. More detailed reference to the
facts will be made later.

When the defence closed its case and before the trial judge
commenced his charge, the jury was excluded while counsel for the appellant
argued that on the facts of the case as it appeared from the evidence, the
trial judge should put the defence of mistake of fact to the jury. He contended
that the appellant was entitled to have the judge tell the jury that if the appellant
entertained an honest

[Page 125]

though mistaken belief that the complainant was consenting to the
acts of intercourse as they occurred, the necessary mens rea would not
be present, and the appellant would be entitled to an acquittal. Reliance for
this proposition was placed upon Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan[2]
and R. v. Plummer and Brown[3]. The
trial judge refused to accede to defence counsel's request and in disposing of
the motion had this to say:

THE COURT: In this case the complainant has testified that
the accused had intercourse with her during a three-hour period some five times
without her consent. The accused has testified that the acts of intercourse
that he had with the complainant were all with her consent and that the only resistance
to his amorous advances was of a token variety, and that orally along lines of:
""Oh George, what are you doing?""

There are many conflicts in the evidence during the critical
period of time when the acts of sexual intercourse took place, and the jury
will have to be directed to accept either the complainant's or the accused's
ver­sion of the facts.

The essence of the case as I see it is essentially has the
Crown negatived the complainant's consent?

Later, he said, after referring to the Morgan case and the
case of Plummer and Brown:

Although the concept of mens rea underlies all criminal
prosecutions I know of no obligation to instruct a jury in connection with this
concept. I acknowledge and am in agreement with counsel's statements that in
appropriate circumstances defences arise in favour of accused persons, even
where no intent is apparent from the statute creating an offence, and these
defences at a minimum are accident and mistake of fact. Although the reason­ing
in Director of Public Prosecutions and Morgan may have limited application to
Canadian Criminal Law, I am wholly in accord with the attempt made by the
learned Trial Judge in placing before the jury in that case what I conceive to
be an alternative defence, namely, a mistaken view of the facts. That defence
was justified in that case because three of the four accused persons pledged
their oaths to the assertion that the victim's husband, also a co-accused, had
told them before attending at the victim's residence that his wife was prone to
put on a show of struggling but that this would only be a charade stimulating
her sexual excitement.

[Page 126]

In answer to my questions during argument defence counsel
has suggested that acts of familiarity prior to the time of intercourse,
independently testified to by disinterested persons, and the accused's evidence
where he alluded to only oral and token resistance to his advances, constituted
evidence upon which I could con­clude that the defence of mistake of fact
should be left to the jury.

In addition to that evidence, I have reviewed the evi­dence
of the accused and I regret to say, notwithstand­ing the forceful submission of
defence counsel, I do not recognize in the evidence any sufficient basis of
fact to leave the defence of mistake of fact to this jury.

In the Court of Appeal, this ruling found support in the majority
judgment of Farris C.J.B.C. with whom Craig J.A. agreed. The majority adopted
the view that the issue emerging from the evidence was a simple one of consent
or no consent. In a dissenting judgment, Lambert J.A. was of the opinion that
there was sufficient evidence to put the defence to the jury. He would have
directed the jury that the accused was entitled to an acquittal if the jury
found that he entertained an honest and reasonably held mistaken belief
in the existence of consent. This is a view which I cannot share in view of the
pronouncement in this Court in Beaver v. The Queen[4],
at p. 538.

It is well established that it is the duty of a trial judge in
giving directions to a jury to draw to their attention and to put before them
fairly and completely the theory of the defence. In performing this task, it is
also clear that the trial judge must put before the jury any defences which may
be open to the accused upon the evidence whether raised by the accused's
counsel or not. He must give all necessary instructions on the law relating to
such defences, review the relevant evidence and relate it to the law
applicable. This, however, does not mean that the trial judge becomes bound to
put every defence suggested to him by counsel. Before any obligation arises to
put defences, there must be in the evidence some basis upon which the defence
can rest and it is only where such an evidentiary basis is present that a trial
judge must

[Page 127]

put a defence. Indeed, where it is not present he should not put
a defence for to do so would only be to confuse.

What is the standard which the judge must apply in considering
this question? Ordinarily, when there is any evidence of a matter of fact, the
proof of which may be relevant to the guilt or innocence of an accused, the
trial judge must leave that evidence to the jury so that they may reach their
own conclusion upon it. Where, however, the trial judge is asked to put a
specific defence to the jury, he is not concerned only with the existence or
non-existence of evidence of fact. He must consid­er, assuming that the
evidence relied upon by the accused to support a defence is true, whether that
evidence is sufficient to justify the putting of the defence. This question has
been considered frequently in the courts: See Wu v. The King[5]
and Kelsey v. The Queen[6]. The
test to be applied has, in my opinion, been set down by Fauteux J., as he then
was, in Kelsey v. The Queen.

The allotment of any substance to an argument or of any
value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial judge from mentioning
such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some
evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the
grievance.

In addition, I would refer to the words of Judson J., speaking
for the majority, in R. v. Workman and Huculak[7]
 where he said:

... I can see no possible ground for any instruction that,
on any view of the evidence Huculak could be an accessory after the fact and
not a principal. Before this could be done, there must be found in the record
some evidence which would convey a sense of reality in the submission (Kelsey
v. The Queen, 105 C.C.C. 97 at p. 102, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220 at
p. 226, 16 C.R. 119 at p. 125). Failure of counsel to raise the matter
does not relieve the trial judge of his duty to place a possible defence before
the jury but there must be something beyond fantasy to suggest the existence of
the duty.

[Page 128]

It seems to me that the trial judge, in the passage above quoted
from his ruling on this ques­tion, has applied that test. He has heard all the
evidence. He heard the argument advanced by counsel. He considered the whole
matter with counsel's argument in mind and he concluded, ""I do not
recognize in the evidence any sufficient basis of fact to leave the defence of
mistake of fact to the jury"". In my view, he directed himself correctly in
law.

In relating the law to the facts of any case, we must keep in
mind what it is that the trial judge must look for in the evidence in deciding
whether there is, in the words of Fauteux J., ""some evi­dence or matter
apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument, and in the grievance"".
In this case, to convey such a sense of reality, there must be some evidence
which, if believed, would support the existence of a mistaken but honest belief
that the complainant was in fact consenting to the acts of intercourse which
admittedly occurred. This requires a more detailed recital of the evidence than
would ordinarily be necessary.

The complainant, after describing the events of the early
afternoon in the restaurant, said that upon entering into the house where
discussions were to take place regarding its sale, the appellant seized her and
pushed her down the hallway to the bedroom. She resisted his pushing and tried
to reason with him. He said that he was going to break her and began, as soon
as the bedroom was reached, to remove her blouse. She said she protested and
screamed and grew hysterical and tried to reason with him but was not fighting
him in a physical way. When he continued to remove her blouse, she realized he
was going to rape her. She tried to escape but he threw her onto the bed and
she became totally hysterical. She just lay on the bed and screamed. She then
said she tried to rise from the bed but he held out his arm and told her to
remove his cufflinks, she refused and then she tried to escape. He pushed her
back onto the bed, removed her skirt, nylons and panties, but not her brassiere
or slip. She remained on the bed scream­ing, then she observed that he was
undressed, although did not actually recall him undressing. She described
various conversations in which she

[Page 129]

told him she was not able to take birth control pills and was
without any contraceptive protection. She said that she and the man she lived
with were attempting to have a baby and she was at that time ovulating. This
information came, she said, from her lover who was a gynaecologist and he later
gave evidence confirming these matters. She tried to persuade the appellant to
desist but he would not be put off and finally had intercourse with her against
her will. She said that the appellant had told her he would not ejaculate in
her and she described three short acts of intercourse all against her will in
which no ejaculation occurred. After some time the appellant left the bed and
got a bow tie from a drawer and a sashcord from a dressing gown. Again, against
her will, he tied the bow tie over her mouth as a gag and tied her hands behind
her back. She struggled against this and threw herself from the bed onto the
floor. He put her back on the bed and while her hands remained tied had
intercourse again from the rear. During all this time she said she was at times
pleading and reasoning with him, at times hysterical and screaming, and at
times endeavouring to avoid and escape him. She said at one stage when she saw
him get the tie and cord that she decided that he was going to kill her.
Shortly after the incident of falling off the bed, and by this time some three
hours had elapsed, she said that he left the room. She seized the opportunity
to escape and fled from the house naked with her hands still tied behind her
back. She ran down an alley and pounded at the door of a nearby house. She was
admitted and the police were called. During all this period, she insisted that
she did not consent to any of the acts of intercourse. She insisted that she
was hysterical, fearful and helpless in his hands and she escaped as soon as
she could.

The appellant, in giving evidence on his own behalf, said that
upon arrival at the house, he entered and went immediately to the bathroom. On
his return to the front of the house, he led the complainant into the living
room. They sat on a couch and began to kiss. During this episode, she removed
her necklace and left her car keys on a table in the living room. They then
moved into the bedroom where she consented to the removal of

[Page 130]

her clothes. He hung her blouse in the closet and put her other
garments, after folding them, at the foot of the bed. He agreed that she
refused to undo his cufflinks but he undressed and they then had intercourse
with her consent. He admitted to three occasions and admitted that he had had
no ejaculations. The whole performance, while with her consent, was not very
successful. He admitted getting the tie to gag her and the cord to bind her,
saying that it was done as an act of bondage to stimulate sexual activity. He
said that when bound she suddenly threw herself from the bed and was hysterical
and screaming. He said that he put her back on the bed. He left to find a
cigarette and on his return she had gone. He did not know where. He waited for
some time then put some clothes on and had a look around the house and the yard
but could not find her. He insisted that everything was done with her consent.
She made no serious resistance to his advances beyond making such coy inquiries
as ""George, what are you doing?"" He said he would not have forced her
if she had resisted, that she made no objection to his advances, and, that when
she threw herself from the bed he desisted from any further efforts at
intercourse and did not have intercourse after that event.

It will be seen at once that there is a fundamental conflict
between the two stories. Her version excludes consent and any possible mistaken
belief in consent. His version speaks of actual consent and no suggestion of
any mistaken belief could arise. To find support for the defence asserted by
the appellant, the other evidence must be considered.

When the complainant gained admission to the house where she
sought help, she was observed to be in a distraught and emotional condition.
She complained that she had been assaulted or raped or that someone was
attempting to rape her. She was evidently fearful. She wanted to have her
gentleman friend called and the call was made. The police were called as well.
The priest, who had

[Page 131]

admitted her to the house, removed the cords from her wrists and
found that they had been tightly tied. He gave evidence that he had some
difficulty in untying her.

After the complainant had spoken to the police, they went to the
appellant's house. Some forty minutes had elapsed since she had left it. The
appellant asked if they came about the girl. He denied he had raped her. He
said she was willing, that she didn't resist much, and that she had suddenly
become hysterical and had run away. He didn't follow her because he didn't know
what to do and when he first discovered her absence he was naked himself. In
the house, the police found the necklace in the living room with the car keys.
They found the complainant's blouse hanging in the closet in the bedroom, the
complainant herself had seen it there before her escape. They found her underclothes
folded at the foot of the bed with the exception of her slip which was in the
bed sheets. Further examination revealed that the clothing of the complainant
was undamaged, that is, untorn, though the complainant said that she did
observe a torn shoulder strap in her slip the next day. Medical evidence found
the following physical markings or injuries upon the body of the complainant.
There were three scratches, two on her chest and one on her back, a red mark on
the inside of her upper right arm, reddened areas on the front of both wrists.
There was no bruising or redness on her mouth, throat, neck, the inside of her
thighs or legs, and no injury or any kind of redness was observed about the
vaginal area.

In summary then, this was the state of evidence when the trial
judge was called upon to make his ruling. It became his task to apply the rule
enun­ciated above. In assessing his resolution of the matter, we must consider
the situation as it pre­sented itself to him at the time. Speculation as to
what the jury did, or would have done after being charged, is not relevant
here.

With that thought in mind and, bearing in mind that the object of
the judicial search must be

[Page 132]

evidence of a mistaken but honest belief in the consent of the
complainant, one must first ask the question ""Where is this evidence to be
found?"" It cannot be found in the evidence of the complainant. She denies
actual consent and her evidence cannot provide any support for a mistaken
belief in consent. Her conduct, according to her description, is that of a
terrified, hysterical, non-consenting woman who resisted the appellant's
advances, albeit unsuccessfully, and when able fled from his house in search of
assistance. Turning then to the evidence of the appellant, it immediately
becomes apparent that his evidence speaks of actual consent, even cooperation,
and leaves little if any room for the suggestion that she may not have been
consenting but he thought she was. The two stories are, as has been noted
before, diametrically opposed on this vital issue. It is not for the trial
judge to weigh them and prefer one to the other. It is for him in this
situation, however, to recognize the issue which arises on the evidence for the
purpose of deciding what defences are open. In this situation, the only
realistic issue which can arise is the simple issue of consent or no consent.
In my opinion, the trial judge was correct in concluding that there simply was
not sufficient evidence to justify the putting of the defence of mistake of
fact to the jury. He left the issue of consent and that was the only one
arising on the evidence.

In reaching this conclusion, I am not unmindful of the evidence
of surrounding circumstances which were said to support the appellant's conten­tion.
I refer to the absence of serious injury suf­fered by the complainant and the
absence of damage to clothing, as well as to the long period of time during
which the parties remained in the bedroom. These matters may indeed be cogent
on the issue of actual consent but, in my view, they cannot by themselves
advance a suggestion of a mistaken belief. The finding of the clothes at the
foot of the bed, the necklace and the keys in the living room, are equally
relevant on the issue of actual consent and, in my view, cannot affect the
issue which was clearly framed by the opposing assertions of consent and
non-consent.

[Page 133]

It would seem to me that if it is considered necessary in this
case to charge the jury on the defence of mistake of fact, it would be
necessary to do so in all cases where the complainant denies consent and an
accused asserts it. To require the putting of the alternative defence of
mistaken belief in consent, there must be, in my opinion, some evidence beyond
the mere assertion of belief in consent by counsel for the appellant. This evi­dence
must appear from or be supported by sources other than the appellant in order
to give it any air of reality. In R. v. Plummer and Brown, supra, Evans
J.A., (as he then was) speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, considered
that there was such evidence as far as Brown was concerned and directed a new
trial because the defence had not been put. In that case, the complainant had
gone to Plummer's ""pad"" where she had been raped by Plummer. Brown
entered the room where the rape occurred after Plummer had gone. Apparently he
had arrived at the house separately from Plummer. It was open on the evidence
to find that he was unaware then that Plummer had threat­ened the complainant
and terrorized her into submission. He had intercourse with her and she said
that because of continuing fear from Plummer's threats, she submitted without
protest. In these special circumstances, the defence was required. The facts
clearly established at least an air of reality to Brown's defence. In Morgan,
there was evidence of an invitation by the complainant's husband to have
intercourse with his wife and his assurance that her show of resistance would
be a sham. In other words, there was evidence explaining, however preposterous
the explanation might be, a basis for the mistaken belief. In the case at bar,
there is no such evidence.

Where the complainant says rape and the accused says consent, and
where on the whole of the evidence, including that of the complainant, the
accused, and the surrounding circumstances, there is a clear issue on this
point, and where as here the accused makes no assertion of a belief in consent
as opposed to an actual consent, it is unrealistic in the absence of some other
circumstance

[Page 134]

or circumstances, such as are found in the Plummer and Brown and
Morgan cases, to consid­er the judge bound to put the mistake of fact
defence. In my opinion, the trial judge was correct in refusing to put the
defence on the evidence before him.

I might add that I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
of my brother Dickson J., and while it is apparent that I am unable to accept
his view on the evidentiary question, I am in agreement with that part of his
judgment dealing with the availability as a defence to a charge of rape in
Canada of what is generally termed the defence of mistake of fact.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The following are the reasons delivered by

MARTLAND J.—I agree with the opinion expressed by my brother
McIntyre that the trial judge was correct in concluding that there was not
sufficient evidence to justify putting the defence of mistake of fact to the
jury and with his proposed disposition of this appeal.

I would, however, like to make a comment in respect of one
passage in his reasons which refers to the dissenting opinion of Lambert LA. in
the Court of Appeal. Lambert J.A. was of the opinion that there was sufficient
evidence to put the defence of mistake of fact to the jury and that the trial
judge should have directed the jury that the accused was entitled to an
acquittal if the jury found that he entertained an honest and reasonably
held belief in the existence of consent. Dealing with the words underlined,
my brother McIn­tyre says that he cannot share this view because of the
pronouncement of this Court in Beaver v. The Queen[8],
at p. 538. The passage to which he refers is contained in the judgment of
Cartwright J. (as he then was) and reads as follows:

In Regina v. Tolson ((1889), 23 Q.B.D. 168), Stephen J. says
at p. 188:

... I think it may be laid down as a general rule that an
alleged offender is deemed to have acted under

[Page 135]

that state of facts which he in good faith and on reasonable
grounds believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an offence.

I am unable to suggest any real exception to this rule, nor
has one ever been suggested to me.

and adds at p. 189:

Of course, it would be competent to the legislature to
define a crime in such a way as to make the existence of any state of mind
immaterial. The ques­tion is solely whether it has actually done so in this
case.

I adhere to the opinion which, with the concurrence of my
brother Nolan, I expressed in The Queen v. Rees ([1956] S.C.R. 640 at
651) that the first of the state­ments of Stephen J. quoted above should now be
read in the light of the judgment of Lord Goddard C.J., con­curred in by
Lynskey and Devlin JJ., in Wilson v. Inyang ([1951] 2 K.B. 799) which,
in my opinion, rightly decides that the essential question is whether the
belief entertained by the accused is an honest one and that the existence or
non-existence of reasonable grounds for such belief is merely relevant evidence
to be weighed by the tribunal of fact in determining that essential question.

The paragraph which follows the quotation from Stephen J. in R.
v. Tolson is an obiter dictum. The Court which determined the Beaver
case was a five-man court and two of the judges dissented on the
disposition of the case. It involved a charge of being in possession of a drug.
The accused was in physical possession of a package which contained drugs, but
he said he never knew that the package contained drugs. The Courts below had
held that this furnished no defence to the charge under subs. 4(1)(d) of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. The issue before the Court, and on which it
divided, was whether the statute created an absolute prohi­bition, or whether
the want of knowledge as to the nature of the substance found in the possession
of the accused furnished a defence. The dissenting minority held the view that mens
rea was not an essential element of the offence charged. The reasonableness
of the belief of the accused was not in issue.

Cartwright J., in the passage cited, relies on a statement of
Lord Goddard C.J. in Wilson v. Inyang[9].

[Page 136]

That was a case in which the charge was that of wilfully and
falsely using the title of ""physician"" contrary to s. 40 of the Medical
Act, 1858. The offence, as defined, included a specific mental ingredient.

Speaking of that case, Bridge J., who delivered the judgment of
the Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan[10],
said at p. 190:

Wherever the definition of a crime includes as one of its
express ingredients a specific mental element both the evidential and the
probative burden lie upon the Crown with respect to that element. Typical
examples are dishonesty in theft and knowledge or belief in han­dling. In
seeking to rebut the Crown's case against him in reference to his state of mind
the accused may and frequently does assert his mistaken belief in non-existent
facts. Of course it is right that in this context the question whether there
were reasonable grounds for the belief is only a factor for the jury's
consideration in deciding whether the Crown has established the neces­sary
mental element of the crime. This is because the issue is already before the
jury and no evidential burden rests upon the accused.

The decision of the Divisional Court in Wilson v. Inyang,
[1951] 2 K.B. 799, is to be understood in the light of this
principle. The court there rejected the argument that an acquittal by a
magistrate of a defendant charged with an offence under section 40 of the
Medical Act 1858 should be reversed on appeal by case stated on the ground that
the defendant had no reasonable ground for his belief that he was entitled to
call himself a ""physician."" Lord Goddard C.J. said, at p. 803:

""If he has acted without any reasonable ground, and has
refrained from making any proper inquiry, that is generally very good evidence
that he is not acting honestly. But it is only evidence, ...""

The statute, however, under which that prosecution was
brought required the prosecution to prove that the defendant acted
""wilfully and falsely."" Inevitably, therefore, if this subjective
mental element was not proved the prosecution failed.

The remarks of Lord Goddard C.J. in Wilson v. Inyang were
made with reference to an offence

[Page 137]

under the section of the Medical Act and do not purport to
be a general definition of the requisites of a defence of mistake of fact in
all criminal cases.

For these reasons, it is my opinion that if a case arises which
raises the issue as to whether, on a charge of rape, an accused person who
seeks to rely upon a defence of mistake of fact must, in order to succeed,
establish that his mistake was reasonable as well as honest, it is open to this
Court to determine that issue, and that it is not precluded from so doing by
the judgment in the Beaver case. On the reasoning of my brother McIntyre
in this case, with which I have agreed, that issue does not arise in the present
appeal.

The reasons of Dickson and Estey JJ. were delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—George Pappajohn, a Vancouver
businessman, was found guilty before a judge and jury on an indictment charging
rape. From that conviction, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia. That Court, by a majority, dismissed the appeal.

The principal issue the jury had to determine was whether the
complainant consented to those acts of intercourse which, it is not disputed,
took place. At trial, however, counsel for the appellant advanced an
alternative ""defence"" which, in his submission, ought also to have
been left with the jury. It was argued that even were the jury to decide that
the acts transpired in the absence of consent, the appellant could, nonetheless,
be excused from criminal responsibility if he had honestly, albeit mistakenly,
believed that the complainant was a willing partner. Though the trial judge did
not dismiss the defence as being unavailable at law, in the circumstances he
disallowed the plea, ruling that there was insufficient evidential foundation
to warrant an instruction on the issue. The point in this appeal is whether the
trial judge erred in failing to put before the jury a defence of mistaken
belief in consent, such failure being a non-direction amounting to
misdirection.

[Page 138]

In the main, the Court is here concerned with issues of mens
rea and mistake of fact. Nonetheless, an appreciation of the evidence led
at trial is fundamental to the appeal. Recognition of the defence, if
unavailable on the facts of his case, is of no value to the appellant.
Conversely, the appellant cannot succeed, regardless of the strength of those
facts, unless and until mistake, or honest belief in consent, is accepted as a
defence in law to a charge of rape.

It will be convenient to identify the pivotal issues on which the
appellant's case turns:

(1) What is the mens rea of rape?

(2) Is a mistaken belief in consent available in defence to the
charge of rape?

(3) If so, does mistake afford a defence only where the mistake
is one which is held both honestly and on reasonable grounds?

(4) Did the trial judge err in the case at bar in ruling there
was not sufficient basis of fact to justify leaving the defence of mistake of
fact to the jury?

I 

Mens Rea

There rests now, at the foundation of our system of criminal
justice, the precept that a man cannot be adjudged guilty and subjected to
punishment, unless the commission of the crime was voluntarily directed by a
willing mind. Blackstone spoke of a ""vicious act"" consequent upon a
""vicious will"" (Commentaries, Book IV, at p. 21). Proof of the
mental element is an essential and constituent step in establishing criminal
responsibility. Parliament can, of course, by express words, create criminal
offences for which a guilty intention is not an essential ingredient. Equally, mens
rea is not requisite in a wide category of statutory offences which are
concerned with public welfare, health and safety. Subject to these exceptions, mens
rea,

[Page 139]

consisting of some positive states of mind, such as evil
intention, or knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, or reckless disregard
of consequences, must be proved by the prosecution. The mental element may be
established by inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional
evidence.

The mens rea which is required, and its nature and extent,
will vary with the particular crime; it can only be determined by detailed
examination of the actus reus of the offence. Speaking generally, at
least where the circumstance is not ""morally indifferent"", the mental
element must be proved with respect to all circumstances and consequences that
form part of the actus reus. It follows that, in a case of alleged rape,
where a fact or circum­stance is not known to, or is misapprehended by, the
accused, leading to a mistaken but honest belief in the consent of the woman,
his act is not culpable in relation to that element of the offence:

… for if the actus reus includes surrounding circum­stances,
it cannot be said to be intentional unless all its elements, including
those circumstances, are known. (Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, The
General Part, at p. 141). (Emphasis added.)

Taking these principles, then, what is the mental element
required under s. 143  of the Criminal Code  on a charge of rape? This
crime was historically regarded as an offence of physical violence. Blackstone
defined rape as ""the carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her
will"" (Com­mentaries, supra, at p. 210). A more comprehen­sive
definition of rape at common law is found in Archbold, Criminal Pleading,
Evidence and Prac­tice (38th ed.) (1937), at para. 2871:

Rape consists in having unlawful sexual intercourse with a
woman without her consent by force, fear or fraud (citing 1 East's Pleas of
the Crown 434 and 1 Hale's Pleas of the Crown 627).

Section 143 of our Code, in brief, defines rape as an act
of sexual intercourse with a female person without her consent, or with consent
if that consent is extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm.

[Page 140]

It will be seen that the statutory definition does not depart in
any significant way from the common law definition. For all practical purposes,
the Criminal Code  merely codifies the common law. The essence of the
crime consists in the commission of an act of sexual intercourse where a
woman's consent, or genuine consent, has been withheld.

The actus reus of rape is complete upon (a) an act of sexual
intercourse; (b) without consent. An affirmative finding as to each of these
elements does not finish the inquiry, however, for, as I have indicated, the
requirement that there be a guilty intention must also be satisfied. The
important question then arises as to whether at common law, and under s. 143 of
the Code, the guilty intention for rape extends to the element of
consent. In principle, it would seem that it should, as intention as to consent
is central to responsibility; a man should only be punished where he proceeds
with an act of violation in the knowledge that consent is withheld, or in a
state of recklessness as to whether willingness is present. The intention to
commit the act of intercourse, and to commit that act in the absence of consent,
are two separate and distinct elements of the offence.

Is the accused's perception of consent relevant to a charge under
s. 143  of the Criminal Code ? The argument against the application of Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan[11] in
Canada is that the Code creates a statutory offence of rape which does
not expressly advert to, or require, that there be a state of mind or intent to
proceed in the absence of consent. The issue of consent as an aspect of mens
rea for rape does not appear to have been raised directly in English
authorities previous to the Morgan decision, although Lord Denman in R.
v. Flattery[12] had
occasion to say:

There is one case where a woman does not consent to the act
of connection and yet the man may not be guilty of rape, that is where the
resistance is so slight and her behaviour such that the man may bona fide believe
that she is consenting ... (at p. 392)

[Page 141]

The question has been topical in the Australian courts for some
time, and we have the benefit of a body of case law which deals with the mental
element and honest belief as a defence of mistake. The first decision is R.
v. Hornbuckle[13] (the
Full Court of Victoria sitting) which established a defi­nition of the mental
element in rape, followed generally by the Australian courts. In the course of
delivering judgment, McFarlan J. had the following to say:

To hold that knowledge that the act of intercourse was
occurring sufficiently establishes the intent, because the man who knows he is
committing the act must intend it, even if prima facie warranted, seems
to us to fail to distinguish ""intent to have intercourse"" from
""intent to have intercourse without the consent of the female"". (at
p. 287)

The Hornbuckle case was followed in R. v. Daly[14].
The appeal did not raise an issue of honest belief or mistake, but reached the
Court on the question of whether the jury ought to have been instructed that
one of the elements of rape is an intention to have intercourse without
consent. The Hornbuckle principle was reaffirmed by Smith J.:

... the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt that
the accused either was aware that the woman was not consenting, or else
realized she might not be, and determined to have intercourse with her whether
she was consenting or not. (at pp. 258-9)

A later decision by the Appellate Court of New South Wales, R.
v. Flaherty and others[15], which
was concerned with a plea of mistaken belief, conflicts with Daly, at
least on the issue of the burden of proof. Though Flaherty accepts the
defence of honest and reasonable mistake, Asprey J.A. states (at p. 148):
"" ... the state of mind of the accused is no part of the Crown case,
except to the extent that the Crown must prove an intention to perform the
physical act."" In his view, an accused wishing to benefit from the defence
bears the evidential burden to introduce credible ma­terial upon which a jury
can conclude that he

[Page 142]

honestly, but mistakenly, believed in consent, and had reasonable
grounds for so doing.

In R. v. Flannery and Prendergast[16],
the Hornbuckle and Daly line of authority, as to the Crown's
burden to prove knowledge of consent, was followed. Flaherty was not
mentioned. Once again, honest belief was in issue, and in dealing with the
defence the Court considered the mental element for rape. It was held that
where an accused has not perceived an absence of consent and honestly believed
there was consent, the exist­ence of the belief negatives the intention
requisite to the commission of the crime.

One of the more recent cases is R. v. Sperotto, R. v.
Salvietti[17]. A
five-man appellate court heard the case, which raised the defence of honest
belief. On the question of the mental element, the Court held:

In order to convict the accused of the crime of rape
and, subject to what is hereinafter said, to establish this intention on his
part the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that when the accused had
intercourse with the woman either (i) he was aware that she had not consented,
or (ii) he realized that she might not be consenting and was determined to have
intercourse with her whether she was consenting or not. (at p. 226)

Moreover, the Court held that Flaherty's case was not
intended to be read as asserting that the state of mind of the accused is no
part of the Crown case in relation to the intention of the accused to have
intercourse with the woman, regardless of consent.

In Morgan, each of the Law Lords accepted the element of
knowledge or recklessness as to consent, as a feature of the guilty intention
in the crime of rape. In particular, Lord Hailsham endorsed the test formulated
by the trial judge, that the pros­ecution must prove that "" .. . each
defendant intended to have sexual intercourse without her consent, not merely
that he intended to have sexual intercourse with her but that he intended

[Page 143]

to have intercourse without her consent"". (at p. 209) Lord
Hailsham added the qualification, if an accused is reckless as to consent, that
is equivalent, on ordinary principles, to an intent to do the prohibited act
without consent. Lord Simon, though dissenting on the issue of whether a belief
must be reasonably held, was succinct:

The actus reus is sexual intercourse with a woman who
is not in fact consenting to such intercourse. The mens rea is knowledge
that the woman is not consenting or recklessness as to whether she is
consenting or not. (at p. 218)

In the view of Lord Edmund-Davies, also in dissent, it is
incorrect to regard rape as involving no mental element save the intention to
have intercourse; knowledge by the accused of the woman's unwillingness to have
intercourse is essential to the crime. (at p. 225) (See also Lord Fraser of
Tullybelton, at p. 237).

Following the Morgan decision, the Home Secretary
commissioned an inquiry and the Report of the Advisory Group on the Law of
Rape (the Heilbron Report) was soon published (1975). The mandate of the
Group was to consider whether the Morgan decision necessitated immediate
statutory reform. In the course of its report, which approved the principles
elucidated in Morgan, the following is stated, at para. 23:

The mental element, which the prosecution must addi­tionally
establish (i.e. to the actus reus) is an intention by the defendant to
have sexual intercourse either know­ing that she does not consent, or
recklessly not caring whether she consents or not.

Moreover, the Group agreed that a mistaken though genuine belief
is inconsistent with, and negatives, the requisite mental element. Such a
belief need not be reasonably held, although the reasonableness of it is a
relevant consideration for the jury. It is no longer disputed that, in England,
perception of the woman's consent is an aspect of the mental element in crimes
of rape.

Turning to Canada and the intention requisite for a s. 143 
offence, the most recent decision is

[Page 144]

Mazza v. The Queen[18], in
which the appellant appealed his conviction in a joint trial with the co-accused
Rizzuto. Mazza engaged in intercourse where no consent was given, though in
circum­stances somewhat different to those under which his co-accused earlier
committed similar acts. Mazza arrived after the woman's submission had been
induced by the threats of his cohort, and claimed in defence that he was
unaware that she was, in fact, withholding consent. Chief Justice Laskin,
speaking for the Court, reviewed the facts and held Mazza had no valid
complaint. The trial judge had not failed to isolate the question of Mazza's
possible lack of awareness of non-consent, or of honest belief there was
consent. The case goes no further in its discussion of mens rea and
mistake of fact.

The law of rape was considered by this Court in Leary v.
The Queen[19].
The appeal turned on the availability of intoxication as a defence to the
charge. Mr. Justice Pigeon, although disagreeing with the contention that
specific intent was required, cited the following passage from the speech of
Lord Simon, in the course of his review of what had been said in Morgan (at
p. 58):

This brings me to the fourth question, namely whether rape
is a crime of basic or ulterior intent. Does it involve an intent going beyond
the actus reus? Smith and Hogan (Criminal Law, 3rd Edn, 1973, p. 47) say
No. I respectfully agree. The actus reus is sexual intercourse with a
woman who is not in fact consenting to such intercourse. The mens rea is
knowledge that the woman is not consenting or recklessness as to
whether she is consenting or not. (Emphasis added.)

The dissenting judgment in Leary contained this definition
of the mental element:

... the Crown must prove, beyond reasonable doubt,
intercourse without consent, together with (a) an inten­tion to force
intercourse notwithstanding absence of consent, or (b) a realization that the
conduct may lead to non-consensual intercourse and a recklessness or
indifference to that consequence ensuing. It will not do

[Page 145]

simply to say that because the accused committed the
physical act and the woman did not consent, he must be taken to have intended
to have intercourse without consent. (at p. 35)

Two decisions rendered in provincial courts of appeal bear
comment. In R. v. Bresse, Vallières and Théberge[20],
Myrand J.A., speaking for the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal,
accepted knowledge of lack of consent as a positive aspect of the crime of
rape:

[TRANSLATION] In any matter of rape, two mental elements
must be considered; the one relates to the victim, the other to the aggressor.
With regard to the victim, it is the absence of consent to the sexual rela­tions;
with regard to the aggressor, it is the desire to impose sexual relations upon
the victim. The latter element assumes the knowledge by the accused of the lack
of consent of the victim. (at pp. 81-2)

He concluded that where the attitude of the woman is equivocal as
to consent, it cannot be said there is no evidence for a jury on the issue of
sincere belief in consent.

In R. v. Plummer and Brown[21], the
appellant Brown arrived after earlier acts of intercourse had been induced by
threats and was alerted to the possibility that consent was not forthcoming, as
the girl was crying when he entered the room. On appeal from his conviction,
the Ontario Court of Appeal, without reference to, or review of, any of the case
authorities, held:

There must be a direction to the jury, that if the Crown
fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the circumstances were such
that Brown could not honestly believe her consent was voluntary, then he must
be acquitted. (at p. 500)

It will thus be seen that the great weight of authority is in
support of the view that the accused's perception of the woman's consent is an
important aspect of any prosecution for the crime of rape. Counsel for the
Crown in the instant appeal reviewed and compared s. 143 of the Code with
other Part IV Code offences, to make the point that the subjective
belief of an accused is no

[Page 146]

part of the case to be proved by the Crown. It was contended
that, since reference to intention to proceed in the absence of consent is
lacking in s. 143 , the statutory wording prevails over case authorities which
consider the mental element in terms of the common law definition. Section 148
of the Code was cited in comparison. This section specifies as an
ingredient of the offence, knowledge or reason for belief that the female
person is, by reason of her mental condition, incapable of giving a reasonable
consent. Knowledge of the existence of a blood relationship is a constituent
element of the crime of incest, spelled out in s. 150 of the Code.

One cannot assume, on the strength of these two sections, that
there is no mens rea element relating to consent, for crimes of rape.
Parliament does not consistently employ wording which indicates express levels
of intention (such as knowingly, intentionally, wilfully) for all offences
which undoubtedly import a mental element. Even within Part IV, there is no
consistency in the wording of the offences. I do not think the determination of
the mental element for rape turns, in any way, on a comparative analysis of the
wording for Part IV offences.

I refer to the statement by Lord Reid in Sweet v. Parsley[22]:

... for it is firmly established by a host of authorities
that mens rea is an essential ingredient of every offence unless some
reason can be found for holding that that is not necessary. It is also firmly
established that the fact that other sections of the Act expressly
require mens rea, for example because they contain the word 'knowingly',
is not in itself sufficient to justify a decision that a section which is
silent as to mens rea creates an absolute offence. (at p. 350)

In summary, intention or recklessness must be proved in relation
to all elements of the offence, including absence of consent. This simply
extends to rape the same general order of intention as in other crimes.

[Page 147]

II 

Mistake of Fact

Belief by an accused in a mistaken set of facts has not always
afforded an answer to a criminal charge. By the early criminal law, the only
real defence that could be raised was that an act had not been voluntary and,
therefore, could not be imputed to the accused. Thus it was possible in some
cases to excuse a man who had acted under a mistake, by the argument that his
conduct was not truly voluntary (Russell on Crime, Vol. I (12th
ed.), at p. 71). In the seventeenth century, Hale wrote: ""But in some
cases ignorantia facti doth excuse, for such an ignorance many times
makes the act itself morally involuntary."" (1 Pleas of the Crown 42)

The leading English cases on mistake of fact are, of course, R.
v. Prince[23] and
R. v. Tolson[24]. In
the Prince decision (at p. 152), Brett J. cited from Blackstone's
Commentaries:

Ignorance or mistake is another defect of will, when a man
intending to do a lawful act does that which is unlawful. For here, the deed
and the will, acting sepa­rately, there is not that conjunction between them
which is necessary to form a criminal act .. .

Brett J. held that mistake, as a defence, applies whenever facts
are present, in which an accused believes and has reasonable ground to believe,
which if true, would render his act innocent and not a crime. The Tolson case,
following Prince, considered the extent to which a mistaken, though
honest and' reasonable, belief that the first spouse was dead could afford a
defence to a charge of bigamy. The classic statement is that of Cave J.:

At common law an honest and reasonable belief in the
existence of circumstances, which, if true, would make the act for which the
prisoner is indicted an innocent act has always been held to be a good defence.
(at p. 181)

An honest and reasonable mistake of fact is on the same footing
as the absence of a reasoning

[Page 148]

faculty, as with infants, or impairment of the faculty, as in
lunacy (Tolson, at p. 181). Culpability rests upon commission of the
offence with knowledge of the facts and circumstances compris­ing the crime.
If, according to an accused's belief concerning the facts, his act is criminal,
then he intended the offence and can be punished. If, on the other hand, his
act would be innocent, accord­ing to facts as he believed them to be, he does
not have the criminal mind and ought not to be pun­ished for his act. (See E.
R. Keedy, ""Ignorance and Mistake in the Criminal Law"", 22 Harvard
L.R. 75, 82).

As stated by Mr. Justice Dixon, as he then was, in Thomas v.
The King[25]:

States of volition are necessarily dependent upon states of
fact, and a mistaken belief in the existence of circum­stances cannot be
separated from the manifestation of the will which it prompts ... the nature of
an act of volition may be of an entirely different description if it is based
on mistake of fact. The state of facts assumed must often enter into the
determination of the will. It would be strange if our criminal law did not
contain this principle and treat it as fundamental. (at pp. 299-300)

Mistake is a defence, then, where it prevents an accused from
having the mens rea which the law requires for the very crime with which
he is charged. Mistake of fact is more accurately seen as a negation of guilty
intention than as the affir­mation of a positive defence. It avails an accused
who acts innocently, pursuant to a flawed percep­tion of the facts, and
nonetheless commits the actus reus of an offence. Mistake is a defence
though, in the sense that it is raised as an issue by an accused. The Crown is
rarely possessed of knowledge of the subjective factors which may have caused
an accused to entertain a belief in a fallacious set of facts.

If I am correct that: (i) s. 143  of the Criminal Code  imports
a mens rea requirement, and (ii) the mens rea of rape includes
intention, or recklessness as to non-consent of the complainant, a mistake that
negatives intention or recklessness entitles the accused to an acquittal.
Glanville Williams notes

[Page 149]

 (Criminal Law, The General Part, p. 173, para. 65):

It is impossible to assert that a crime requiring intention
or recklessness can be committed although the accused laboured under a mistake
negativing the requisite inten­tion or recklessness. Such an assertion carries
its own refutation.

Howard (Criminal Law (3rd. ed.)) points out that rape is
aimed at the protection of women from forcible subjection to non-marital sexual
intercourse, but that the facts of life not infrequently impede the drawing of
a clean line between consensual and non-consensual intercourse:

… it is easy for a man intent upon his own desires to
mistake the intentions of a woman or girl who may herself be in two minds about
what to do. Even if he makes no mistake it is not unknown for a woman
afterwards either to take fright or for some other reason to regret what has
happened and seek to justify herself retrospectively by accusing the man of
rape. (at p. 149)

I do not think the defence of mistaken belief can be restricted
to those situations in which the belief has been induced by information
received from a third party. That was the situation in the Morgan case.
In Morgan, the belief in consent was induced by information related by
the complainant's hus­band, who spoke of his wife's sexual propensities. The
foundation for the defence, incredible as it turned out to be, in view of the
violence, was the misinformation of the husband. Had the defendants believed
that information, and had the wife's overt conduct been relatively consistent with
it, the defendants would have had a defence. That is the effect of the dicta
of the House of Lords in the Morgan case.

In principle, the defence should avail when there is an honest
belief in consent, or an absence of knowledge that consent has been withheld.
Wheth­er the mistake is rooted in an accused's mistaken perception, or is based
upon objective, but incor­rect, facts confided to him by another, should be of
no consequence. The kind of mistaken fact pleaded by the Morgan defendants,
however, is more likely to be believed than a bald assertion of mistaken belief
during a face to face encounter. In any

[Page 150]

event, it is clear that the defence is available only where there
is sufficient evidence presented by an accused, by his testimony or by the
circumstances in which the act occurred, to found the plea.

III 

Honest and Reasonable Mistake

The next question which must be broached is whether a defence of
honest, though mistaken, belief in consent must be based on reasonable grounds.
A majority of the House of Lords in Morgan answered the question in the
negative, and that view was affirmed by the Heilbron Committee. There can be no
doubt this answer is conso­nant with principle. As Professor Keedy has written (22
Harv. L. Rev. 75, at p. 88), an act is reasonable in law when it is such as
a man of ordinary care would do under similar circum­stances; to require that
the mistake be reasonable means that, if the accused is to have a defence, he
must have acted up to the standard of an average man, whether the accused is
himself such a man or not; this is the application of an outer standard to the
individual; if the accused is to be punished because his mistake is one which
an average man would not make, punishment will sometimes be inflicted when the
criminal mind does not exist.

In other jurisdictions, there are divergent deci­sions and dicta
on the question whether mistaken belief must be based on reasonable grounds
to exculpate. In the affirmative are such bigamy cases as Tolson, supra;
Thomas, supra; R. v. King[26] and
R. v. Gould[27]. Non-bigamy
cases are Prince, supra; Bank of New South Wales v. Piper[28],
R. v. Warner[29] and
Sweet v. Parsley, supra. In the majority of cases in which the courts
view the mistake as a defence only if made on

[Page 151]

reasonable grounds, such as in Tolson, that view is not a
necessary part of the ratio decidendi.

Among the cases in which mistaken belief was considered, and a
test of reasonableness applied, are Flannery, supra, R. v. Bourke[30]
and Sperotto and Salvietti, supra. Cases to the contrary are: Thorne
v. Motor Trade Association[31],
Wilson v. Inyang[32],
R. v. Smith[33],
R. v. Brown[34]. Virtually
unanimous rejection of the added requirement of ""reasonableness"" is
to be found in the scholarly writings: Glanville Williams (Criminal Law, The
General Part, para. 70, at p. 201): ""The idea that a mistake, to be a
defence, must be reasonable, though lurking in some of the cases, is certainly
not true as a general proposition""; Glanville Williams, Textbook of
Criminal Law, at p. 100; Howard, supra, at pp. 153-4; Smith &
Hogan, Criminal Law (4th ed.), at p. 182; Russell on Crime (12th
ed), at p, 76; J. C. Smith (1975), Crim. L.R. 41; Morris and Turner, 2
U. of Queensland L.J. 247.

In Canada, the Tolson rule has already been rejected by
this Court in favour of the honest belief standard. Unless this Court wishes to
overrule Beaver v. The Queen[35], it
is difficult to see how the minority in Morgan can decide this appeal.

In R. v. Rees[36], the
issue was whether there is mens rea for the offence of knowingly or
wilfully contributing to juvenile delinquency. Cartwright J. set out the Tolson
test and then held as follows:

[Page 152]

The first of the statements of Stephen J., quoted above
should now be read in the light of the judgment of Lord Goddard C.J., concurred
in by Lynskey and Devlin J.J. in Wilson v. Inyang which, in my opinion,
rightly decides that the essential question is whether the belief
entertained by the accused is an honest one and that the existence or
non-existence of reasonable grounds for such belief is merely relevant evidence
to be weighed by the tribunal of fact in determining such essential question.
(at p. 651)

One year later, in Beaver v. The Queen, supra, a narcotics
case, the opinion of Mr. Justice Cart­wright was accepted by a majority of the
Court. He adopted the paragraph quoted above from Rees. Beaver has since
been regarded as an authoritative contribution to the law as to mental element,
and mistaken belief, in true crimes.

It is not clear how one can properly relate reasonableness (an
element in offences of negligence) to rape (a ""true crime"" and not an
offence of negligence). To do so, one must, I think take the view that the mens
rea goes only to the physical act of intercourse and not to non-consent,
and acquittal comes only if the mistake is reasonable. This, upon the
authorities, is not a correct view, the intent in rape being not merely to have
intercourse, but to have it with a non-consenting woman. If the jury finds that
mistake, whether reasonable or unreasonable, there should be no conviction. If,
upon the entire record, there is evidence of mistake to cast a reasonable doubt
upon the existence of a criminal mind, then the prosecution has failed to make
its case. In an article by Professor Colin Howard (4 U. of Queensland
L.J. 45), the following is offered:

To crimes of mens rea, or elements of a crime which
requires mens rea, mistake of fact simpliciter is a defence; to
crimes of negligence, or elements of an offence which requires only negligence,
mistake of fact is a defence only if the mistake was in all the circum­stances
a reasonable one to make. (at p. 47)

[Page 153]

The same analysis is expressed by Glanville Wil­liams, supra, para.
71, at p. 202.

In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan, four Law
Lords agreed that having accepted the mental element of knowledge as to
consent, it is inconsistent to attach a standard of reasonableness to a defence
of honest belief. As Lord Hailsham pointed out, the following two propositions
are totally irreconcilable:

(i) each defendant must have intended to have sexual
intercourse without her consent, not merely that he intended to have
intercourse but that he intended to have intercourse without her consent;

(ii) it is necessary for any belief in the woman's consent
to be a ""reasonable belief"" before the defendant is entitled to be
acquitted.

The difference between the majority and minori­ty decisions in Morgan
turned upon the way in which each Law Lord perceived the Tolson prece­dent,
as being a wide-ranging and well-established principle, or as expressing a
narrow rule limited in effect to bigamy and the facts at hand.

Lambert J.A., in his dissenting judgment in the instant case
reasoned, on his reading of Leary and Morgan, that a defence of
honest belief in consent must be based on reasonable grounds. In his view, two
law Lords in Morgan following Tolson, clearly required an honest
belief to be held on reasonable grounds (Lord Simon and Lord Edmund-Davies).
Two others, Lord Fraser and Lord Hailsham, invoked general principles to
conclude that an honest belief in consent need not be reasonably held. The
decision of the fifth judge, Lord Cross, turned on a distinction drawn between
statutory and common law offences. Bigamy, the offence in question in Tolson,
was a statutory offence. Rape is not. Therefore, the Tolson requirement
that the mistake be reasonable does not apply to rape, a crime defined by
common law. Were rape to be defined by statute, the defence would be available
only if supported by reasonable grounds. Lambert J.A. held that if one adapted
the decision of Lord Cross to s. 143 of the Code, the tables would be

[Page 154]

turned, and a majority of the Lords would, for purposes of the Criminal
Code , endorse the honest and reasonable test. If the distinction Lord Cross
thought might be possible between statutory and common law offences would have
the effect of giving a defence of unreasonable mistake to a person accused of a
crime which, in express terms, imported mens rea, but would limit the
defence to one of reasonable mistake to a person accused of a crime which
imported mens rea only by implication, the justification for the
distinction is not apparent. I am unable to see why the defence should be so
limited. Rape is not a crime of strict or absolute liability. With respect,
there is no compelling reason for extending to rape the misap­prehension having
its genesis in Tolson, and now endemic in English law, that makes bigamy
a crime of negligence and would have a like effect if applied to statutory
rape.

Mr. Justice Lambert recognized that while his conclusion was
directed by precedent rather than logic, he also found it to be supported, in
relation to rape, by policy and practical sense:

Why should a woman who is sexually violated by (such) a man
have to defend herself by screams or blows in order to indicate her lack of
consent, or have to consent through fear, for a charge of rape to be sustained?
Surely a firm oral protest, sufficient to deny any reasonable grounds for
belief in consent, should be a sufficient foundation in these circumstances for
a charge of rape.

I am not unaware of the policy considerations advanced in support
of the view that if mistake is to afford a defence to a charge of rape, it
should, at the very least, be one a reasonable man might make in the
circumstances. There is justifiable concern over the position of the woman who
alleges she has been subjected to a non-consensual

[Page 155]

sexual act; fear is expressed that subjective orthodoxy should
not enable her alleged assailant to escape accountability by advancing some
cock-and-bull story. The usual response of persons accused of rape is—""she
consented"". Are such persons now to be acquitted, simply by saying:
""even if she did not consent, I believed she con­sented""? The concern
is legitimate and real. It must, however, be placed in the balance with other
relevant considerations. First, cases in which mistake can be advanced in
answer to a charge of rape must be few in number. People do not normally commit
rape per incuriam. An evidential case must exist to support the plea.
Second, if the woman in her own mind withholds consent, but her conduct and
other circumstances lend credence to belief on the part of the accused that she
was consenting, it may be that it is unjust to convict. I do not think it will
do to say that in those circum­stances she, in fact, consented. In fact, she
did not, and it would be open to a jury to so find. Third, it is unfair to the
jury, and to the accused, to speak in terms of two beliefs, one entertained by
the accused, the other by a reasonable man, and to ask the jury to ignore an
actual belief in favour of an attributed belief. The mind with which the jury
is concerned is that of the accused. By importing a standard external to the
accused, there is created an incompatible mix of subjective and objective
factors. If an honest lack of knowledge is shown, then the subjective element
of the offence is not proved. The following passage from the Heilbron Report
is, however, apposite:

66. Morgan's case did not decide, as some critics
seem to have thought, that an accused person was entitled to be
acquitted, however ridiculous his story might be, nor did it decide that the
reasonableness or unreasonableness of his belief was irrelevant. Furthermore it
is a mistaken assumption that a man is entitled to be acquitted simply because
he asserts this belief, without more.

Perpetuation of fictions does little for the jury system or the
integrity of criminal justice. The ongoing debate in the courts and learned
journals as to whether mistake must be reasonable is conceptually important in
the orderly development of

[Page 156]

the criminal law, but in my view, practically unim­portant
because the accused's statement that he was mistaken is not likely to be
believed unless the mistake is, to the jury, reasonable. The jury will be
concerned to consider the reasonableness of any grounds found, or asserted to
be available, to support the defence of mistake. Although ""reasonable
grounds"" is not a precondition to the availability of a plea of honest
belief in consent, those grounds determine the weight to be given the defence.
The reasonableness, or otherwise, of the accused's belief is only evidence for,
or against, the view that the belief was actually held and the intent was,
therefore, lacking.

Canadian juries, in my experience, display a high degree of
common sense, and an uncanny ability to distinguish between the genuine and the
specious.

The words of Dixon J. bear repeating:

... a lack of confidence in the ability of a tribunal correctly
to estimate evidence of states of mind and the like can never be sufficient
ground for excluding from inquiry the most fundamental element in a rational
and humane criminal code. (Thomas v. The King, supra, at p. 309)

In Textbook of Criminal Law, at p. 102, Professor
Glanville Williams states the view, with which I am in agreement, that it is
proper for the trial judge to tell the jury ""that if they think the
alleged belief was unreasonable, that may be one factor leading them to
conclude that it was not really held; but they must look at the facts as a
whole"". It will be a rare day when a jury is satisfied as to the existence
of an unreasonable belief. If the claim of mistake does not raise a reasonable
doubt as to guilt, and all other elements of the crime have been proved, then
the trier of fact will not give effect to the defence. But, if there is any
evidence that there was such an honest belief, regardless of whether it is
reasonable, the jury must be entrusted with the task of assessing the credibility
of the plea.

[Page 157]

To apply the reasonable standard in this appeal, the Court, in my
view, would have to: (a) accept the minority decision in Morgan; (b)
overrule Beaver or find a means of distinguishing the offence of rape;
and (c) defy accepted and sound principles of criminal law.

IV 

The Plea and the Evidence

I come now to what is perhaps the most difficult part of this
case, namely, whether there was an evidential base sufficient to require the
trial judge to place before the jury the defence of mistaken belief in consent.
The trial judge and two judges of the Court of Appeal concluded no such base
existed. Chief Justice Farris, in dismissing the appeal, was strongly
influenced by the fact that ""at no time did the appellant suggest in his
evidence that while there was resistance on the part of the complainant
nonetheless he honestly believed that she was in fact consenting. He did
testify that there was resistance after acts of bondage but from then on there
was no intercourse"". With respect, it is not necessary that an accused
specifically plead mistake. The issue to which an accused's state of mind is
relevant is mens rea and that issue is always before the jury, the onus
being on the prosecution. Nor is a defence of honest belief necessarily inconsistent
with a defence of consent. In raising the latter, an accused is challenging the
factual aspect of the offence. Did the complainant or did she not consent? If
she did, the actus reus was not committed. The defence of honest belief
is different in nature, for it rests upon an accused's subjective perception of
that factual situation.

In relying upon consent as a defence, the appellant invites the
trier of fact to find in all the circumstances that she did consent (i.e. to
reject her testimony). In relying on honest belief, he is suggesting that even
if she did not consent, he nonetheless proceeded in the mistaken but honest
belief that she had been willing. Though the offence was committed, he is not
responsible, for he lacked the requisite intention. In most cases, it

[Page 158]

is difficult to imagine that consent and honest belief can offer
alternative defences. If there is no consent in fact, rare is the case in which
a man will, nonetheless, believe that it was given. This, however, may be one
such case.

If there was ""some"" evidence to ""convey a sense of
reality"" to a defence of mistake as to consent, then the jury ought to
have been instructed to consider that plea. Kelsey v. The Queen[37],
at p. 226. The Crown argues that the question of suffi­ciency of evidence
is not one of law and, therefore, not properly before the Court. As stated in Dunlop
and Sylvester v. The Queen[38], at
p. 890:

The question of whether there is sufficient evidence to go
to the jury, i.e. any evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed,
could find the appellants guilty . . is a question of law, which can found an
appeal to this Court under s. 618(1)(a).

The evidence of the complainant is that of no consent, at any
time, to any act of intercourse with the appellant. Her version of the incident
is inter­spersed with assertions of screaming, fighting, rea­soning and
attempted escape. But even on the complainant's version there is much common
ground with the appellant's version which supports his defence of belief in
consent. Moreover, the appellant testified. There was ample evidence in his
testimony which points to circumstances, from which arise an inference of
willingness or consent, at least for those activities which preceded the
so-called ""bondage"". It is not proper, in my view, to look at the two
pieces of testimony that are in conflict, to conclude that the only issue is
one of credibility and that a blurred perception, on the part of the appellant,
is inconceivable when cast alongside the complainant's evidence. That is a
matter for the jury to decide. The appellant tells of a convivial afternoon (as
to that there is no dispute), minimal resistance through episodes of

[Page 159]

intercourse and, finally, hysteria with ""bondage"". If
his version were accepted, the defence is two-fold: (a) actual consent; and (b)
belief in consent. Though the jury found, as a fact, there was no consent, the
further finding that the appellant may, nonetheless, have been mistaken was not
left open.

Leaving aside the possibility of post-bondage intercourse, the
jury could have reached any one of three alternative conclusions: (1) the
appellant was telling the truth and the complainant did consent; or (2) he was
not telling the truth, she did not consent and he was aware of that fact or
reckless to it; or (3) though he did not plead mistake, he believed she was
consenting, notwithstanding token resistance. His defence of consent is
rejected and that of honest belief accepted. I think there was sufficient
evidence to put that third alternative to the jury.

Because the case turns on evidential matters, detailed reference
thereto is unavoidable. The two met at lunch to discuss the sale of the
appellant's residence. The complainant was his agent in the matter. Throughout
the afternoon, until approximately 4:00 p.m., a considerable amount of alcohol
was imbibed by both parties and by friends who joined the table. At one point,
the complainant left to ensure the time limit for parking her car had not
expired and was escorted by the appellant in this task. The two stopped to
visit a friend of the appellant who owned a dress shop. The appellant told of
casual affectionate gestures he had ini­tiated. His evidence was supported by
the owner of the dress shop—""it look to me like she hand it to him on a
platter""—and by the witness Oswald—"" ... it was quite obvious to me
that he was court­ing her ... on several occasions I noticed he kissed her
hand"". The appellant and the complainant returned to the restaurant
briefly and then departed for appellant's home, with the appellant at the wheel
of the complainant's car, where it was intended they would complete the
business discussion.

She testified that, upon arrival at his house, the appellant
closed the door and pushed her down the

[Page 160]

hall. She was resisting him, in the sense of trying to reason
with him asking him why he was pushing her. He said he was going to break her.
In the bedroom, while he took her blouse off, she rea­soned with him. When he
succeeded in removing it, she knew he was going to rape her. She tried to
escape, but he threw her down on the bed and she became totally hysterical. She
screamed at the top of her lungs. He gestured with his upraised arm, that she
was to undo his cuff links. When she refused, he threatened her with his fist
and she began to scream. He removed her underclothing and skirt in one tug.
When he suggested and commenced acts of oral gratification, she refused and he
did not continue. This is significant. It is an area of common ground. If the
appellant wanted oral sex, but discontinued upon perceiving her resistance, why
did he proceed to acts of intercourse if her resistance was also made known in
that regard? This reflects not only on her credibility, but more importantly,
on his perception of that which she was resisting and that to which she was
consenting. Then, she said, he raped her. After the first act, there was a
conversational session. She pleaded with him to let her go. She tried to escape
and, on each occasion, he would catch her at the door, push her back down, and
rape her again. On three occasions she tried to escape and, on each, he raped
her. After she had been there about an hour, he became angry and threw her off
the end of the bed. He took her right hand, wrenched it hard and tightly, and
tied both hands tightly behind her back with a bathrobe cord. He threw her face
down on the bed and raped her from behind. She was trying to talk and reason
with him. At some point, he gagged her with a bow tie. She was tied for an hour
before being gagged and it was an hour before she got away. When he left the
room to get cigarettes, she ran out the front door and went down the lane
screaming.

The tone of the appellant's evidence differs at the outset, with
his description of a pleasant afternoon and affectionate gestures. On arrival
at his house, he repaired to the bathroom. When he returned, they sat on the
chesterfield and he kissed

[Page 161]

her. She took off her necklace and put it on the coffee table.
They kissed and when she expressed concern about her blouse, he led her to the
bedroom. As he took off her blouse, she asked, ""George, what are you
doing?"" He hung up her blouse in the closet. She did not resist removal of
the blouse. She then lifted herself while he removed her skirt, folding and
placing it at the foot of the bed. She did not resist. She ""sort of
refused"" to undo his cuff links. She lifted her arms so that he could
remove her slip. He removed other items of her clothing and she asked,
""What are you doing?"", or ""Why are you doing this?"" He took
off his own clothes, put his tie on the tie rack, and piled his underwear and
socks on the floor. He suggested and began to perform acts of oral sex. She put
up her hands and stopped him. When she resisted he stopped, for he perceived a
definite reluctance on her part. He suggested they have intercourse. That act
proceeded and proved frus­trating to both parties. He left the room and
returned. She also made a trip to the bathroom. The two talked for some time.
She said she ""really had to go"", but made no attempt to go toward the
door. A second act of intercourse was carried out, and then she agreed to a
third one in a different position, from behind. Neither party was satisfied and
so he suggested something different. He tied a bow tie loosely around her neck,
and she asked: What was he doing? Why was he doing it? She did not protest or
fight. He told her he was symbolically putting her into ""bondage"".
After the bow tie was in place, he tied the sash around her wrists. About then,
while his attention was diverted, she pitched forward off the bed, and, when he
lifted her back onto it, her demeanour completely changed. All along, she had
only ""mildly protested"" when he had done anything and he thought she
""might have enjoyed it"". Now she claimed he was trying to break her.
She was screaming hysterically. He was dumbfounded. He backed off and went to
get a cigarette. When he returned, she had gone. He did not have intercourse
with her after tying her hands. She had not resisted up until that time, except
to the acts of oral sex. It is not disputed by the appellant that, with
""bondage""

[Page 162]

and the fall from the bed, the complainant became highly
distraught and hysterical.

Two excerpts from the testimony of the appellant bear on the
point under consideration:

Q. ... when you were asked by the police later on ""did
she object to going to bed"" and you said ""not violently"" .. .

A. What I meant by that was there was no violence, there was
some token submission, there was oral resistance, there was oral resistance.

Q. By oral resistance she said she did not want to make love
to you?

A. No, she did not, when I was taking off her clothes she
was saying things like, ""George what are you doing""?

Q. I put it to you she was hysterical and she was screaming
and she was crying.

A. She was hysterical and she was screaming and she was
crying, correct.

Q. And I put it to you that that was prior to the time at
which you tied her.

A. That was not.

The evidence of the appellant's conversation with the police
officer is of importance:

Question: Who tied her hands?

Answer: I did.

Question: Why?

Answer: Part of the act of intercourse.

Question: Did she mind? Answer: She didn't seem to.

Question: When did she start minding?

Answer: After she started talking about her childhood, her
mother, her father, and then I excused myself and got up.

Question: Did you have intercourse?

Answer: What do you mean, penetration? Question: Yes.

Answer: Penetration, yes; intercourse, no.

Question: Where did you go when you got up?

[Page 163]

Answer: To get a cigarette. She seemed to have a lot of
trouble and I didn't want to screw her up any more than she was.

Question: Did she object to going to bed?

Answer: Not violently.

Question: You mean token resistance?

Answer: Yes. No I really couldn't say, she really didn't
resist very much.

There is circumstantial evidence supportive of a plea of belief
in consent: (1) Her necklace and car keys were found in the living room. (2)
She confirmed his testimony that her blouse was neatly hung in the clothes
closet. (3) Other items of folded clothing were found at the foot of the bed.
(4) None of her clothes were damaged in the slightest way. (5) She was in the
house for a number of hours. (6) By her version, when she entered the house the
appellant said he was going to break her. She made no attempt to leave. (7) She
did not leave while he undressed. (8) There was no evidence of struggle, and
(9) She suffered no physical injuries, aside from three scratches.

The Heilbron Report contains the following observations which
seem pertinent to the case at bar. The crime of rape involves an act—sexual
intercourse—which is not, in itself, either criminal or unlawful, and can,
indeed, be both desirable and pleasurable; whether it is criminal depends on
complex considerations, since the mental states of both parties and the
influence of each upon the other, as well as their physical interaction, have
to be considered and are sometimes difficult to inter­pret—all the more so,
since normally the act takes place in private; there can be many ambiguous
situations in sexual relationships; hence, however precisely the law may be
stated, it cannot always adequately resolve these problems; in the first place,
there may well be circumstances where each party interprets the situation
differently, and it may be quite impossible to determine with any confidence
which interpretation is right.

Toy J. gave a full, fair and accurate summary of the testimony by
the complainant and appellant. There can be no criticism of the instructions in
this respect. He did not, however, charge the jury on

[Page 164]

the defence of mistaken belief, as he earlier ruled there was not
""in the evidence any sufficient basis of fact to leave the defence of
mistake of fact to this jury"".

In my view, with respect, the judge erred in failing to instruct
the jury (a) that as to pre-bond­age intercourse, the issues were consent and
belief in consent; and (b) that as to post-bondage intercourse, the issue was
whether an act of intercourse occurred or not. If the answer to (b) was
negative, a conviction could not be founded upon the post-bondage period. If
the answer was in the affirma­tive, a conviction would almost, of necessity,
follow, because there was admittedly no consent or belief in consent after the
""bondage"".

That the case gave the jury difficulty is clear from the fact
that the charge was delivered about noon, on a Friday, and the verdict was not
ren­dered until about 5:00 p.m. on Saturday.

I am mindful of the comment of Mr. Justice Pigeon in Leary, that
consideration should be given to the plight of a complainant, who should not be
subjected to the humiliation of having to testify again, unless justice makes
it imperative. The possibility of a mistaken belief in consent in the
pre-bondage phase was an issue that should have been placed before the jury:
the judge's failure to do so makes it imperative, in my opinion, in the
interests of justice, that there be a new trial. It was open to the jury to
find only token resistance prior to the ""bondage"" incident, which the
appellant may not have perceived as a withholding of consent. The accused was
convicted of that which, perhaps, he did not intend to do had he known of no
consent. It does not follow that, by simply disbelieving the appellant on
consent, in fact, the jury thereby found that there was no belief in consent,
and that the appellant could not reasonably have believed in consent.

[Page 165]

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Jurisdiction of
the court—Question which could be raised by way of appeal.

The appellant, charged with possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, elected for trial before judge and
jury. After a preliminary hearing, he was cited to trial before the Court of
the Queen’s Bench. Afterwards, an indictment was preferred by the Attorney
General of Canada in terms identical to those in the original information
charging him and his trial proceeded before Mayrand J. in the Court of the
Sessions of the Peace. The appellant, convicted and sentenced to fourteen years
of imprisonment, launched an appeal and a petition for writ of habeas
corpus. The Court of Appeal having dismissed the appeal on the merits, this
Court granted the application for leave to appeal from that decision. That
appeal will be heard at a later date. The only issue now before this Court is
the petition for habeas corpus which had been dismissed by the Superior
Court and the Court of Appeal. Nolan J.A., who delivered the reasons of the
Court of Appeal, stated that “a petition for writ of habeas corpus does
not lie in the circumstances of this case: Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960]
S.C.R. 431; In re Richard Darby, [1964] S.C.R. 64; Sanders v.
The Queen (1920), 2 C.C.C. 57. All the allegations concerning the
alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace could
have been raised by way of appeal”.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Quebec
affirming the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing a petition for habeas
corpus. Appeal dismissed.

appellant.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

MARTLAND J.—The legal issues raised on the
application for habeas corpus will be before this Court on the
appellant’s appeal, leave for which has been granted. In these circumstances,
we agree with the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal by Nolan J.A. in

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Intercepted private
communications—Admissibility—Whether trial judge can review the basis upon
which a wiretap authorization was given—Criminal Code , s. 178.13(1) , as
en. 1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, s.
9.

The appellant and his co-accussed Molis were
charged with trafficking in a restricted drug. On the voir dire held at
the outset of the trial to determine the admissibility of the evidence obtained
through the intercepted private communications made pursuant to an
authorization given by Trotter J., the appellant argued before Allan J. that
there was no evidence presented to Trotter J. upon which he could exercise his
discretion to grant the authorization. Allan J. ruled on January 13, 1978, that
he did not perceive any substantive defect of form or irregularity of procedure
in the application before Trotter J. or his granting of the authorization.

The appellant set out, inter alia, as
a ground of appeal before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, a submission that
the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of intercepted communications and
in holding that such communications were lawfully intercepted pursuant to valid
authorization. On March 5, 1979,
the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal without reference in its reasons to
this issue. The Court here dealt only with this ground of appeal, judgment
being reserved on the other issues which were raised by the co-accused Molis
and adopted by the appellant.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear
you, Mr. Scollin and Mr. Pomerant. Even assuming that a wiretap
authorization under Criminal Code , s. 178.13(1)  is reviewable by the
trial judge on the ground that there was no evidence of the required
pre-conditions for such an authorization, we are of the opinion that we cannot
in this case interfere with the concurrent findings that there was some
evidence on which Judge Trotter gave the authorization. This ground of appeal
therefore fails and judgment is reserved only on the issues argued by counsel
for the co-accused Molis and adopted by counsel for Hawkins.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Effect of acquittal
of one of two co-conspirators—Separate trials for co-conspirators.

The appellant and one Muzard were charged on
a joint indictment with conspiracy of the one with the other. Before the jury
was impanelled both the accused moved for separate trials, reference being
particularly made to the intention of the Crown to produce a written statement
given to the police by Guimond which clearly implicated Muzard in the
conspiracy. The motion was refused and at the joint trial which ensued
Guimond’s statement was admitted in evidence. However, Guimond gave contrary
evidence to the effect that the whole scheme was his idea alone and Muzard had
never agreed to anything concerning it. Even if Guimond’s testimony coincided
in large mesure with the evidence of Muzard and despite the instructions by the
trial judge to the jury that Guimond’s written statement was not evidence
against Muzard, both the accused were convicted. On appeal, the Court of Appeal
of Quebec affirmed the
conviction of Guimond and ordered a new trial for Muzard. Muzard was acquitted
at his second trial. Although the acquittal took place at a time subsequent to
the judgment of the Court of Appeal and this circumstance forms no part of the
reasons for judgment under appeal, the appeal to this Court rises the two
following questions of law: (1) whether when an appeal is taken by two persons
who had been jointly tried and convicted of conspiracy, it is an error for the
Court of Appeal to allow the appeal of one of them and direct a new trial for
him alone, or whether under such circumstances a new trial should be directed
against both jointly; and (2) whether the acquittal of Muzard at his second
trial should be given the effect of a finding that there was no conspiracy and
that his fellow conspirator must also go free.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Estey J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The case law in England and in

[Page 961]

this country, in conformity with the age old
procedure whereby review in such cases could only be held by Writ of Error, was
for many years dominated by the rule that the court was limited to a consideration
of errors appearing on the face of the record and it was frequently held, on
this basis, that in conspiracy cases where two parties only were charged and
the record disclosed the acquittal of one, the other must be acquitted even in
the face of a plea of guilty. However, the majority of this Court in Koury v.
The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 212, made it abundantly clear that the old role
of inconsistent verdicts was no longer binding on this Court. This contention
was supported by the Privy Council in the case of Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Shannon, [1975] A.C. 717, where it was stated that the rule
which drew its life’s breath from the Writ of Error naturally expired when that
writ was abolished. Now it can be taken, that where only two persons are charged
with conspiracy and they are separately tried whether or not they are
separately indicted, the conviction of one is not necessarily invalidated by
the acquittal of the other.

The Court of Appeal was correct in ordering a
new and separate trial for Muzard. The statement made by Guimond to the police
was totally inadmissible. The nature of the other evidence tendered against
him, coupled with the fact of his acquittal when the statement was found
irreceivable at his second trial, is sufficient to show that Muzard was
convicted at the first trial on the basis on this inadmissible evidence. Even
if the jury has been told that it was evidence against Guimond alone, it could
never have been said with assurance that one or more of the jurors did not
convict Muzard on the basis of this statement. Also, whenever it is apparent
that the evidence at the joint trial of two-alleged co-conspirators is
substantially stronger against one than the other, the safer course it to
direct the separate trial of each and this is particularly the case when the
prosecution is tendering in evidence a damaging statement made by one under
circumstances which made it inadmissible against the other.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Estey J., dissenting: There was a fatal error made by the Court
of Appeal in affirming the conviction of Guimond and at the same time ordering
a new trial for Muzard. Not only is the logic unassailable that on a joint
trial of two, charged with conspiring only with each other, an acquittal of one
must carry the acquittal of the other, but legal principle is equally
compelling for such a result. Similarly, if there be a conviction of the two
and on their appeal a flaw is established in the trial, an order for a new
trial or an acquittal must be of both.

[Page 962]

It is not open to say that the present case
is one where the two accused should be treated as if separately tried. They
were not; and to use the retrial of Muzard as a separate trial is to beg the
very question raised by the joint indictment, the joint trial, the joint
conviction and the joint appeal in which Muzard alone was given a new trial.

LaBaie, for the appellant.

the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Estey J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—I have had
the advantage of reading the reasons prepared by Justice Ritchie in which he
has set out the facts and discussed comprehensively the applicable law. My
difference with him resides in the effect that he would give to the order of
the Quebec Court of Appeal of a separate trial for Muzard (which resulted in an
acquittal) following the appeal of both Guimond and Muzard from their
conviction of conspiracy. In my opinion, there was a fatal error made by the
Quebec Court of Appeal in affirming the conviction of Guimond and at the same
time ordering a new trial for Muzard. If there was to be a new trial for the
one, based on the trial judge’s failure to give the jury sufficient direction
that a written statement by Guimond was not evidence against Muzard, new and
separate trials should have been ordered for each.

[Page 963]

In this case, Guimond and Muzard were charged on
a joint indictment with conspiracy of the one with the other and with no one
else. Because of the Crown’s intention to introduce a written statement by
Guimond implicating Muzard, the two accused moved for separate trials but their
motion was refused and a joint trial ensued. Both the accused gave evidence
which, if believed, would have exonerated them. Guimond’s written statement was
introduced after a voir dire, but Guimond’s evidence at the joint trial
contradicted his written statement and was to the effect that there was no
conspiracy with Muzard but rather that the scheme to abduct the manager of a
credit union and to extort money from it for his release (which was the subject
of the alleged conspiracy) was a scheme concocted by Guimond alone.

Not only is the logic unassailable that on a
joint trial of two, charged with conspiring only with each other, an acquittal
of one must carry the acquittal of the other, but legal principle is equally
compelling for such a result. Similarly, if there be a conviction of the two
and on their appeal a flaw is established in the trial, an order for a new
trial or an acquittal must be of both. This position is consistent with the
result in Dharmasena v. The King[1] in
the Privy Council and with R. v. Baron and Wertman[2] in the Ontario Court of Appeal. In fact, the Dharmasena case is on all
fours with the present case, although there the indictment also contained a
count of murder on which the appellant co-conspirator’s conviction was
affirmed.

The criminal law in England on this matter is no
longer a matter of common law but is governed by s. 5(8) of the Criminal
Law Act, 1977, under which a conspirator tried together or separately with
a co-conspirator may stand convicted notwithstanding that the latter has been
acquitted “unless under all the circumstances of the case his conviction is
inconsistent with the acquittal of the other person”. If such a statute were
applicable

[Page 964]

here, it would be my opinion that the case would
be governed by the qualifying clause above‑quoted: see Williams, Textbook
on Criminal Law (1978), at pp. 361-2.

I do not find it necessary in the present case
to go beyond its facts in dealing with the law. Hence, I put to one side such
questions as whether the rule I would apply should govern where two charged as
conspirators are jointly indicted but tried separately. In Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Shannon[3], the
House of Lords rejected the technically-based rule that inconsistency on the
record should apply to exculpate a conspirator who pleaded guilty when the
co-conspirator, separately tried, was acquitted. This, of course, is not the
present case.

Necessarily, the House of Lords in Shannon examined
a variety of situations involving co‑conspirators before coming to its
conclusion on the issue immediately before it. Although the five Law Lords were
unanimous in the result on the specific issue in appeal, there was no unanimity
on some other situations that were canvassed. One of these was that in the Dharmasena
case, already mentioned. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, who spoke for Lord
Reid as well as for himself said this, at p. 754:

If, as in Dharmasena s case, two
people are tried together for conspiring with each other and are convicted and
if they can and do appeal and if for any reason a new trial can be ordered I
express no disagreement with the view expressed in Dharmasena’s case
that the order for a new trial should be of both.

Viscount Dilhorne treated the Dharmasena case
as one involving separate trials and therefore rejected the view there taken,
but in fact the two alleged co-conspirators were jointly tried and convicted.
It was only because, on appeal from the convictions, a new trial was ordered
for one that an issue of the appellate court’s decision affirming the
conviction of the other was questioned. In such circumstances, I am unable to
appreciate the view

[Page 965]

that the two were separately tried; the plain
fact is that they were not. In Dharmasena, as in the present case, the
flaw in the application of the law rested on the appellate court’s untenable
differentiation in ordering a new trial for one alleged conspirator while at
the same time affirming the conviction of the other. Lord Simon of Glaisdale
rejected what I may call the Dharmasena view but only where there was a
significant differentiation of evidence against each of two conspirators
jointly indicted and jointly tried. If the evidence against each was
substantially the same, in his view a trial judge could be expected, as a
matter of common sense, to tell the jury that unless they were sure that both
alleged conspirators were guilty, they should both be acquitted. Lord Salmon
was more understanding of the anomaly in convicting one of two alleged
conspirators on a joint trial while acquitting the other. I quote his words, at
p. 772:

If A and B are tried together for
conspiring with each other and with no one else, the judge should nevertheless,
in all save the most exceptional cases, continue to direct the jury that they
should convict or acquit both, that is to say, they cannot convict the one and
acquit the other. This may not accord with strict logic. The law does not,
however, rest wholly upon logic but more upon experience and common sense.
Theoretically it is, no doubt, possible that the evidence in respect of A might
be so different from the evidence affecting B that a verdict against A of
conspiring with B might be justified whilst a verdict against B of conspiring
with A would not be justified. In practice, however, this does not happen save
in the rarest of cases. Accordingly when A and B are charged with conspiring
with each other and no one else it would, as a general rule, be highly
undesirable for the trial judge to recite the usual formula about the jury’s
duty of considering the evidence against each of the accused separately. In
such a case it would be particularly difficult for a jury to perform this intellectual
feat. Even if there were a confession by A and only slight evidence against B,
I doubt whether, whatever the judge might tell them, the jury would convict A
and acquit B. They would still convict or acquit both. In such a case, however,
it would be the duty of the judge to direct the jury that A’s confession was no
evidence at all against B.

[Page 966]

The respect to be paid to decisions of the House
of Lords will be well met in the present case by subscribing to the views
expressed by Lord Porter in the Dharmasena case which, if any composite
view at all can be gleaned from the separate reasons in Shannon, stands unaffected by the latter case. In any event, Dharmasena accords
with my own view of what the law should be on the situation presented there and
paralleled here.

In the present case, the acquittal of Muzard
upon his second trial appeared to be influenced by the fact that the Guimond
statement (which as Crown evidence would be hearsay as the Muzard) was
excluded. I do not think that the fact that in the Baron and Wertman case
the statement of Baron was held admissible for limited purposes against
Mrs. Wertman as well as being admissible against Baron offers any basis
for distinguishing that case from the present one. Indeed, in the result in the
Baron and Wertman case, where the two accused were charged with
conspiring with others as well as with each other, the order for a new trial
covered both accused since there was no evidence to support a finding that
either of the accused conspired with another but not with each other. I can see
no ground upon which it would be proper in a case like the present one to deny
a retrial to Guimond when his statement is not admissible against Muzard but to
grant it as in the Baron and Wertman case because of a statement there
admissible against both.

Nor is it, in my opinion, open to say that the
present case is one where the two accused should be treated as if separately
tried. They were not; and to use the retrial of Muzard as a separate trial is
to beg the very question raised by the joint indictment, the joint trial, the
joint conviction and the joint appeal in which Muzard alone was given a new
trial.

I would allow Guimond’s appeal, set aside the
judgments below and direct a new trial.

[Page 967]

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Spence,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec affirming the conviction of the
appellant on a charge of conspiracy with Roger Muzard to abduct the family of
the manager of the Caisse Populaire at Ste-Hélène-de-Bagot in Quebec and to
extort a sum of money from the Caisse Populaire through such means.

The two alleged conspirators were tried together
in September 1975 before Mr. Justice Reeves of the Superior Court sitting
with a jury and both were convicted at trial. On appeal by both accused to the
Court of Appeal, Guimond’s appeal was dismissed while the appeal of Muzard was
allowed and a new trial directed in this case before a judge sitting alone.

Before the jury was impanelled at the first
trial where the two accused were jointly indicted, both the appellants moved
for separate trials and reference was particularly made to the intention of the
Crown to produce a written statement given to the police by Guimond which
clearly implicated Muzard in the conspiracy. This motion was, however, refused
and at the joint trial which ensued Guimond’s statement to the police was
admitted in evidence after the holding of a voir dire, but he proceeded
to give contrary evidence to the effect that the whole scheme was his idea
alone and Muzard had never agreed to anything concerning it and in fact had
objected strongly to the whole plan. The Guimond testimony at trial was in
direct conflict with his written statement and if the jury had believed it they
would no doubt have acquitted both the accused of conspiracy. The conviction of
both clearly indicates that the jury believed the written statement and found
Guimond’s testimony to be untrue although it coincided in large measure with
the evidence of Muzard.

In charging the jury the trial judge instructed
them that Guimond’s written statement was not evidence against Muzard, but the
Court of Appeal

[Page 968]

was of opinion that this direction was not
enough under the circumstances and that it would be difficult to imagine a jury
of laymen being able to separate the contents of the statement from the effect
that its introduction would have had on them when considering Muzard’s case as
the allegation that Guimond had conspired with Muzard would readily invite the
conclusion that Muzard had in fact in turn conspired with him. In granting a
new trial to Muzard, the Court of Appeal was clearly of opinion that separate
trials should have been ordered in the first place.

In this regard I prefer to use the language
employed by Mr. Justice Bélanger speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal
when he said at pp. 624-625 [of case]:

[TRANSLATION] However, it is difficult to
imagine that, in the same trial, the jury could accept as true Guimond’s
confession that he was guilty of an illegal agreement with Muzard, without
coming to the same conclusion towards the latter, or at least without all other
evidence presented by the Crown being thereby coloured in the sense of such an
illegal agreement, regardless of Guimond’s and Muzard’s denials.

…

It would undoubtedly have been preferable
for Muzard’s counsel to renew his request for a separate trial at the time the
confession was admitted in evidence, but I feel this is a case where the Court
should have acted proprio motu; especially if one recalls that at the
time of his first decision the judge had not yet read the statement, and based
himself to some extent on the uncertainty in which the Crown had left him
regarding the production of the document.

As I cannot conclude, without a reasonable
doubt, that in a separate trial the jury would have come to the same conclusion
on the first count of the indictment, I consider that appellant Muzard is
entitled to a separate new trial on this count.

At Muzard’s second trial the evidence at his
first trial was by agreement accepted as the record together with the evidence
of two witnesses who testified as to his good character subject, of course, to
the objection as to the admissibility of the Guimond statement. The course of
the proceedings is to some extent clarified in the following paragraph from the
reasons for judgment of the trial judge at Muzard’s second trial:

[Page 969]

[TRANSLATION] GUIMOND and MUZARD having
appealed against their conviction, the Court of Appeal, on the nineteenth (19)
of July, one thousand nine hundred and seventy-six (1976), unanimously
dismissed GUIMOND’s appeal, and by two (2) votes to one (1), allowed MUZARD’s
appeal, ordering in his case that a new trial be held before a judge sitting
alone, on the ground that from the time GUIMOND’s confession was admitted in
evidence at the joint trial of the accused before a jury, MUZARD was entitled
as of that moment to a separate and distinct trial.

Realizing the difficulty and possible injustice
that might have arisen from the introduction of the Guimond statement at a
joint trial before a jury, the same trial judge made it clear that he was not
accepting it as evidence against Muzard. In this regard he said, at
p. 658:

[TRANSLATION] I am not called upon to
decide here whether GUIMOND’s confession was free and voluntary. I shall simply
say that it is inadmissible in evidence against MUZARD for two (2) reasons:

First, because
this statement or confession is subsequent to the carrying out of the
conspiracy with which the accused is charged, and,

Second, because
in the context of the new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal, precisely
because this statement proved to be prejudicial to MUZARD, GUIMOND became a
competent and compellable witness for the Crown as well as for the defence. He
was not called to testify for the Crown.

In the result Muzard was acquitted at his second
trial while Guimond remained convicted of having conspired with him and it is
this circumstance which gives rise to the present appeal although the acquittal
took place at a time subsequent to the judgment of the Court of Appeal and this
circumstance therefore forms no part of the reasons for judgment under appeal.

It is not, in my view, necessary to review the
facts further in order to disclose the questions of law to which they give rise
which are: (1) whether when an appeal is taken by two persons who had been
jointly tried and convicted of conspiracy, it is an error for the Court of
Appeal to allow the appeal of one of them and direct a new trial for him alone,
or whether under such circumstances a new trial should be directed against both
jointly;

[Page 970]

and (2) whether the acquittal of Muzard at his
second trial should be given the effect of a finding that there was no
conspiracy and that his fellow conspirator must also go free.

The case law in England and in this country, in
conformity with the age old procedure whereby review in such cases could only
be held by Writ of Error, was for many years dominated by the rule that the
court was limited to a consideration of errors appearing on the face of the
record and it was frequently held, on this basis, that in conspiracy cases
where two parties only were charged and the record disclosed the acquittal of
one, the other must be acquitted even in the face of a plea of guilty. The case
of R. v. Manning[4] is
often referred to as the leading authority for the proposition that where
conspirators are tried jointly it is an error to instruct the jury that one may
be found guilty and the other acquitted. In that case, Mathew J. expressed what
he described as “an imperative rule of law” in the following terms at
p. 243:

The rule appears to be this. In a charge
for conspiracy in a case like this where there are two defendants the issue
raised is whether or not both the men are guilty and if the jury are not
satisfied as to the guilt of either then both must be acquitted.

This proposition was clearly stated in the case
of R. v. Plummer[5] where
Mr. Justice Dickens, at pp. 340 and 341 put the matter succinctly when he
said:

The law is clear that, when several persons
are tried together on a joint indictment for conspiracy, and one is convicted
and the rest acquitted, the conviction of the one is bad, because the record
when made up on the indictment is repugnant and inconsistent on the face of it.

Mr. Justice Bruce expanded the same
proposition at p. 347 and 348 in the following terms:

…and I think it logically follows from the
nature of the offence of conspiracy that, where two or more persons

[Page 971]

are charged in the same indictment with
conspiracy with one another, and the indictment contains no charge of their
conspiring with other persons not named in the indictment, then, if all but one
of the persons named in the indictment are acquitted, no valid judgment can be
passed upon the one remaining person, whether he has been convicted by the
verdict of a jury or upon his own confession, because, as the record of
conviction can only be made up in the terms of the indictment, it would be
inconsistent and contradictory and so bad on its face. The gist of the crime of
conspiracy is that two or more persons did combine, confederate, and agree
together to carry out the object of the conspiracy.

It seems to me that it matters not
whether that trial of A., B., and C, took place at the same time or not, so
long as they are charged upon one indictment. Only one record can be drawn up
based upon that indictment.

The passage which I have italicized clearly
indicates that the Plummer case, like all those upon which it was based,
is founded on the rule arising out of the procedure by way of Writ of Error to
which I have referred and it will be seen that the learned judge last quoted
was of opinion that the same considerations applied whether the conspirators
were tried jointly or separately so long as they are all charged in the same
indictment.

In this country as recently as 1972 the same
reasoning was adopted by Mr. Justice Jessup in the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the case of R. v. Funnell[6] where he said, at p. 217:

But the law is settled that if two are accused
of conspiracy and are tried together, the acquittal of one must result in the
acquittal of the other.

And later at p. 218 in the same case,
Mr. Justice Jessup said:

In my view the technical basis in the
result in the Plummer case is still good law.

but further at p. 220 the same judge said:

Accordingly it may be the law should be
altered by Parliament or the Supreme Court of Canada. However in a matter
involving the liberty of the subject 1 do not feel at liberty to refuse to
apply a principle of the common law of so ancient an origin, particularly when
another appellate court of this country has acted on the principle for the
benefit of a subject. Moreover in a

[Page 972]

criminal matter it is of little force to
say that a defence is technical because all criminal law is technical.

The observations contained in these passages
appear to me to be at odds with what was said by Mr. Justice Spence,
speaking for a majority of this Court in Koury v. The Queen[7], where he had occasion to comment on
the changed approach to be adopted by courts of appeal since the abolition of
the writ of error at p. 217:

That theory of inconsistent verdicts grew
up at common law. I can well understand its application before the constitution
of a Court of Criminal Appeal when the only mode of review, apart from the
Court of Crown Cases Reserved, was the Writ of Error, which brought before the
reviewing tribunal only the indictment, the plea and the verdict. With a
vitiating inconsistency appearing on the face of this limited record, all that
the Court of Queen’s Bench could do was to quash the conviction.

In that case Mr. Justice Spence was
considering inconsistency allegedly created by the acquittal of an accused on a
charge of conspiracy and at the same time a conviction for the substantive
offence. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Spence
made it abundantly clear that the old rule of inconsistent verdicts was no
longer binding on this Court. At p. 218 of the report he said:

To give effect to this submission would be
to ignore the common sense of the trial. Courts of Appeal do not now operate
under 19th-century procedural limitations. On the evidence that we can now
examine, the error, if any, is in the acquittal on the charge of conspiracy and
not in the conviction on the substantive offence. We can say with the assurance
that on this record, which includes the whole of the evidence, the judge’s
charge and the objections of the defence counsel to the charge, that this man
was properly convicted and that his acquittal on conspiracy does not vitiate
this conviction or give rise to any substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice. We are not compelled to defer to this acquittal for the purpose of
quashing the conviction on fraud. We are not engaged in a process of logic
chopping and we are entitled to look at the facts behind the record of the
acquittal.

[Page 973]

The case of Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Shannon[8], to
which further reference will be made hereafter, contains a lengthy exposition
of the history of the old cases and the approach adopted by Mr. Justice
Spence finds strong support in the following passage from the reasons for
judgment of Lord Morris at p. 749:

In days when any review of convictions in
criminal cases involved bringing the record before the court it was assumed
that if there was an apparent inconsistency on the face of the record then that
must have been the reflection or the consequence of some error. The error could
then be corrected. I say apparent inconsistency because if the charge was that
A and B (and no others) conspired together and if the record showed that one
was found guilty and the other not guilty it need not logically have been
inferred that there necessarily was inconsistency. The case against A might
have been proved while the case against B had not. On the other hand, when only
the record was available and when the apparent inconsistency very probably or
possibly reflected a real inconsistency the fair course was to decide that
there was error which called for correction… The procedure upon a writ of error
was cumbersome because though on the record there was the formal history of the
case (the arraignment, the plea, the issue and the verdict) it took no account
of some of the most material parts of the trial where error was most likely to
occur—viz., the evidence and the direction of the judge to the jury. So the
writ could do nothing to remedy the only errors that were really substantial.

Finally, Lord Salmon in the same case at
p. 771 says of the old rule:

The rule was, no doubt, acceptable when the
writ of error afforded a wrongly convicted man his only remedy. That writ was,
however, abolished, because its preservation was no longer necessary. Indeed,
long before it died it had become moribund. The rule which drew its life’s
breath from the writ naturally expired with it. It was, however, perhaps
impossible for the courts to notice its demise until this House pronounced it
to be dead. My Lords, I suggest that this pronouncement should now be made.

It follows that, in my view, Rex v.
Plummer… should be overruled and many of the dicta in… Dharmasena v. The
King [1951] A.C. 1… can no longer be accepted.

[Page 974]

In the case of Dharmasena[9] two accused were tried together in Ceylon. One count of the indictment against
them charged both with conspiracy to murder the husband of one of them, and
both were found guilty on this count by the jury. On appeal the conviction of
the wife was set aside and a new trial ordered in her case although the
conviction of her alleged co‑conspirator was upheld. On the re-trial the
wife was acquitted and her companion’s appeal was based on the old rule that
the wife’s acquittal involved the acquittal of her companion. This contention
was upheld in the Privy Council where Lord Porter said of the wife’s acquittal:

Their Lordships think that the proper
course is to treat her acquittal as a disposal of the charge of conspiracy and
as involving the acquittal of the appellant also on that charge.

As I have indicated, the Shannon case
disapproved this conclusion although Lord Morris, speaking for himself and Lord
Reid, observed that:

If, as in the Dharmasena case, two
people are tried together for conspiring with each other and are convicted and
if they can and do appeal and if for any reason a new trial can be ordered I
express no disagreement with the view expressed in Dharmasena’s case
that the order for a new trial should be of both.

These observations were not necessary for the
determination of the issue in Shannons case where one accused being then
represented by a solicitor and counsel had pleaded guilty to a count charging
him and another alone with conspiracy with each other and no one else but his
alleged co-conspirator having pleaded not guilty at a separate trial was
acquitted. In that case the Court of Appeal feeling itself bound by the old
rule as stated in such cases as Plummer, supra, quashed the conviction
notwithstanding his plea of guilty on the ground that it could not stand in
light of the acquittal of his alleged co-conspirator. This judgment was
reversed in the House of Lords where, as I have indicated, the old rule was
finally pronounced “to be dead”. In the course of his reasons

[Page 975]

for judgment in the Shannon case, Lord
Simon had occasion to refer at p. 767 to a situation closely akin to that
in the present case. He there said, speaking of two conspirators A and B:

A may have made a full written confession
which is evidence against himself but not against B; and yet, according to the
rule as heretofore applied, B’s acquittal exculpates A too. Such absurdities
bring the law into discredit, and mean that rogues escape society’s sanctions.
This is only to be borne if necessary to ensure that no one is unsafely or
unsatisfactorily convicted; but the rule is no longer required for that
purpose.

The members of the House of Lords were, however,
not unanimous in the reasons which led them to the same conclusion in that Lord
Morris with whom Lord Reid agreed and Lord Salmon indicated his assent,
advanced the view that where only two persons alone are charged and tried
jointly with conspiracy, the trial judge should direct the jury “In all save
the most exceptional cases that they should convict or acquit both,…” (per Lord
Salmon, at p. 772).

In expressing the view that it would be
illogical to instruct the jury otherwise, Lord Morris said at p. 754:

If I am right in my view that, where there
is a charge of conspiracy against A and B (the charge not alleging any
conspiracy with anyone else) and where A is first separately tried and pleads
or is found guilty and where B is later separately tried and acquitted, such
acquittal does not of itself warrant setting aside the conviction of A—should
the same reasoning which supports this view also lead to the conclusion that if
A and B are tried together but if the evidence is strong against one but weak
or lacking in the case of the other a permissible result could be that one
would be convicted and the other acquitted?

Here the force of logic comes into
collision with what Mathew J. called “an imperative rule of law” and with what
Lord Coleridge, C.J. called an “established rule of practice.” Though the
“rule,” whether it be called a rule of law or of practice, came into existence
with the historical background to which I have alluded, I think that the rule
has much to commend it where it is related to a case where a jury has to
consider (in the circumstances under consideration) whether to return similar

[Page 976]

verdicts in the cases of A and B or whether
to return different verdicts. Though by a clear direction a jury could have
explained to them the process of thought that they should apply in their
deliberations, any jury might feel embarrassed and might well be perplexed in
sorting out the reasoning that would enable them to say that they were fully
satisfied in A’s case that A conspired with B (with its corollary that in A’s
case they were fully satisfied that B conspired with A) and yet also to say
that in B’s case they were not satisfied that B conspired with A. In the
administration of the criminal law it is particularly desirable that
complications and subtleties should if possible be avoided. A “rule” which at
least at first sight would appeal to many as having the backing of common sense
ought not lightly to be jettisoned. I consider, therefore, that in the
situation posed it would be wiser to adhere to the “rule” and that summings up
should give effect to it.

It does not appear to me to be likely that the last
quoted passage can have been intended to envisage a situation such as we have
here where one of the conspirators has made a confession that is inadmissible
against the other but it is in any event apparent that Lord Morris fully
appreciated the considerable difficulty facing any trial judge in a charge to
the jury, at the joint trial of two conspirators where the evidence is not the
same against each of them. I do not take the view that Lord Morris dissented
from the proposition that where the evidence is substantially different as
between two jointly charged conspirators, it is desirable that they be tried
separately. In this regard, I share the view expressed by Viscount Dilhorne at
p. 761 where he said:

Ordinarily where two persons are tried
together when charged with conspiring together and with no one else and there
is no material difference in the evidence admissible against each, the result
will be that either both will be convicted or both acquitted. In such cases
there is really no need for, and no need to question, the long-established
rule.

In some cases, however, the weight of the
evidence admissible against conspirator A may be far greater than that
admissible against conspirator B. A, for instance, may have made a statement
admissible against him and not against B, which goes a long way to proving his
guilt and B may have made no such statement. In every case, before a man
charged with others is convicted, a judge must direct the jury to consider the
evidence

[Page 977]

admissible against him separately for
surely it is a fundamental principle of English law that no man is to be
convicted save on proof of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt by evidence
admissible against him. I see no justification for any departure from this, I
think, well-established practice in cases of conspiracy where only two are
charged with that offence. It is adhered to where there are a greater number of
conspirators and I think that it would be highly undesirable that a departure
from it should be approved where two only are so charged.

If a jury are not satisfied of B’s guilt
but are satisfied of A’s, has a judge to direct them that even though satisfied
of A’s guilt, they must acquit him if they acquit B? It is said that a jury
would not be able to understand a direction that they could find one
conspirator guilty and also acquit the man with whom he is charged with
conspiring. Whether or not that be so—and I doubt it—I do not think that a jury
would think the law was anything but a nonsense if after they have been told
that they must consider the evidence against each of the accused separately,
they must, even though satisfied of A’s guilt, acquit him if they think that
the evidence is insufficient to convict B.

If it were necessary in this case to decide
whether or not the long-established rule was now obsolete, it is these
considerations which would incline me to holding that it was, the foundation
for it having gone and the court now being able to ascertain what happened at
the trial.

I think it can be taken, that where only two
persons are charged with conspiracy and they are separately tried whether or
not they are separately indicted, the conviction of one is not necessarily
invalidated by the acquittal of the other.

In the present case, I am satisfied that the Court
of Appeal was correct in ordering a new and separate trial for Muzard whose
motion to that end was in my view wrongly refused by the trial judge. The
statement made by Guimond to the police after the conspiracy had been aborted
was totally inadmissible against Muzard for any purpose and yet the nature of
the other evidence tendered against him, coupled with the fact of his acquittal
when the statement was found irreceivable at his trial, satisfy me that he was
convicted at the first trial on the basis of this inadmissible evidence. On its
face the Guimond statement

[Page 978]

clearly inculpated Muzard in the conspiracy and
in the circumstances of the present case, however often a jury had been told
that it was evidence against Guimond alone, it could never have been said with
assurance that one or more of the jurors did not convict Muzard on the basis of
that statement.

The case of Shannon is discussed in the
reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Martin on behalf of the
Court of Appeal of Ontario in R. v. Baron and Wertman[10]. In that case Mrs. Wertman and the
man with whom she was living (Baron) were jointly charged with conspiracy to
murder her husband. Baron had made a statement to the police the effect of
which was that Mrs. Wertman had shot her husband and had asked Baron to
“get rid of the body”. This statement was read over by Mrs. Wertman and
evidence of the statement and her reaction to it were introduced at the joint
trial as to admissibility of this evidence, Mr. Justice Martin said at pp.
541-542:

Notwithstanding, as has been pointed out,
that there is no evidence upon which a jury could find that Mrs. Wertman
accepted Baron’s statement by her words or conduct, I am of the view that
the statement, in strict law, was admissible, albeit for a limited purpose, if
she had been granted a separate trial. Evidence may be admissible for one
purpose although inadmissible for another: see Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd
ed., vol. 1 (1940), pp. 299-303.

(The italics are my own.)

In Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Christie (1914), 10 Cr. App. R. 141, [1914] A.C. 545, which
constitutes the foundation of the modern law governing the admissibility of
statements made in the presence of the accused, the House of Lords held that
evidence of an incriminating statement made in the presence of an accused is
admissible notwithstanding that there is no evidence from which it could be
inferred that the accused acknowledged the truth of the statement or any part
of it, if the conduct and demeanour of the accused on hearing the statement are
relevant facts in the case (at pp. 160 and 166). If, however, the evidential
value of the conduct and demeanour of the accused on hearing the statement is
slight and the prejudicial effect of the statement is great, the trial Judge
has discretion to exclude it: Director of Public Prosecutions v. Christie,
supra, at pp. 161 and 165.

[Page 979]

In the present case Mrs. Wertman’s
reaction on reading Baron’s statement was relevant and admissible, but such
reaction would not be fully intelligible without reference to the statement to
which she was responding and the jury was therefore entitled to consider them
together.

Mr. Justice Martin also said at
p. 533:

The learned trial Judge correctly
instructed that although the general rule was that statements made by an
accused were evidence only against the accused making the statement, the rule
was subject to the exception that if the jury found a conspiracy, the acts and
declarations of one conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy were admissible
against a co-conspirator. Nowhere, however, did he instruct the jury that the
rule did not make admissible against a co-conspirator a mere narrative account
of past events by one conspirator, even if made during the continuance of the
conspiracy.

In holding that the Baron statement was
admissible against Mrs. Wertman for the limited purpose of considering her
reaction to it Mr. Justice Martin said at p. 541:

It was contended before us on behalf of
Mrs. Wertman, that there being no evidence upon which a jury could find
that she had adopted Baron’s statement so as, in effect, to make it her own, it
was inadmissible as against her and since it was highly-prejudicial, a separate
trial should have been ordered to ensure her a fair trial. This argument proceeded
on the basis that Baron’s statement was not admissible as against her and would
not have been admissible on a separate trial.

On this branch of the case, the learned judge
concluded that Mrs. Wertman’s reaction on reading Baron’s statement was
relevant and admissible, and that such reaction would not be fully intelligible
without reference to the statement to which she was responding and the jury was
therefore entitled to consider them together.

Having found that there was misdirection at the
trial in that the trial judge failed to fully explain the legal significance of
the Baron statement, the learned trial judge concluded with the following
reference to the Shannon case at pp. 552-553:

[Page 980]

Order to be made

Mr. Scullion, for the Crown, argued
that, in the event the Court concluded that a new trial must be had for
Mrs. Wertman on the ground of the misdirection to which reference has been
made (a result which he strenuously opposed) the conviction of the appellant
Baron ought none the less to be sustained.

In Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Shannon (1974), 59 Cr. App. R. 250, the House of Lords, overruling earlier
decisions to the contrary, unanimously held that if two persons are charged
with conspiracy with each other and with no other person, and are tried
separately, the conviction of one is not invalidated by the subsequent
acquittal of the other. However, Lord Morris (Lord Reid concurring) also
expressed the view that it is highly desirable that where there is a charge of
conspiracy against two persons they should be tried together, and that if two
people are tried together and convicted, and they appeal, if for any reason a
new trial is ordered, the new trial should be for both. Lord Morris and Lord
Reid were also of the view that where A and B are charged with conspiracy with
each other and with no one else and are tried together, the trial Judge should
direct the jury that they cannot convict one and acquit the other. Lord Salmon
also considered that such a direction should be given save in the most
exceptional cases.

In the present case the appellants were
charged with conspiracy with each other and with others. If there was any
evidence upon which a jury could find that either of the appellants had
conspired with some person or persons but not with each other, the logic of the
view expressed by Lord Morris might not require the order for a new trial to
apply to both appellants. In my view, however, the record is devoid of evidence
upon which a jury reasonably could find that either of the appellants conspired
with some other person or persons to murder Isaac Wertman, but not with each
other.

In my view the appeal of Mrs. Wertman
must be allowed for the reasons previously stated. The jury did not arrive at a
verdict of guilty without experiencing some difficulty. Misdirection which may
have affected the verdict with respect to her must, in the particular
circumstances of this case, have also prejudiced Baron since the jury could not
reasonably have acquitted her and convicted him of conspiracy. I am accordingly
of the view that in the circumstances the order for a new trial should apply to
both appellants.

The difficulties which have arisen in this
case illustrate the wisdom of the remarks of Meredith, J.A., in R. v.
Goodfellow (1906), 10 C.C.C. 424 at p. 431, 11 O.L.R. 359, with
respect to the undesirability of charg-

[Page 981]

ing the offence of the conspiracy to commit
a crime where there is no evidence of the conspiracy except such as proves the
actual commission of the crime.

In the result, being of the opinion that
the verdict must be set aside, I would allow the appeals, set aside the
convictions, and order a new trial for both appellants.

It will be seen that the Baron and Wertman case
is clearly distinguishable from the present circumstances in that the statement
there in question was admissible against both the alleged co-conspirators
albeit that its admissibility against Mrs. Wertman was for a limited
purpose. Whereas the statement in the present case was totally inadmissible
against Muzard for any purpose. This distinction is clearly noted in the
following passage from the reasons for judgment of the learned judge who spoke
for the Ontario Court of Appeal in that case where he said at p. 543:

Because of the view which I have taken with
respect to the admissibility, in the circumstances, of Baron’s statement of
June 6th, to show Mrs. Wertman’s conduct and demeanour in response to it,
it is unnecessary to examine the authorities with respect to the granting of
separate trials where one accused has made a statement incriminating a
co-accused in circumstances in which such statement is inadmissible for any
purpose in relation to the latter.

I would, therefore, not give effect to this
ground of appeal.

The wrongful admission of the Guimond statement
before Mr. Justice Reeves and the jury, in my view, clearly justified the
order for the separate trial of Muzard which was made by the Court of Appeal of
Quebec.

I have already expressed the opinion that when
two alleged co-conspirators are tried separately the acquittal of one does not
necessarily invalidate the conviction of the other. I am of the opinion also
that, whenever it is apparent that the evidence at the joint trial of two
alleged co-conspirators is substantially stronger against one than the other,
the safer course is to direct the separate trial of each and this is
particularly the case when the prosecution is tendering in evidence a damaging
statement made by one under circumstances which made it inadmissible against
the other.

[Page 982]

The old rule as to the effect of inconsistent
verdicts is sometimes said to subsist in cases where the same or substantially
the same evidence is admissible against the jointly tried conspirators. In such
an event it would be illogical to acquit one and convict the other but this
does not appear to me to be because of the force of any “imperative rule of
law” stemming from the existence of inconsistency on the face of the record but
is rather the logical result of the evidence having established the guilt or
innocence of both the alleged co-conspirators.

For all these reasons as well as for those
delivered by Mr. Justice Bélanger in the Court of Appeal of Quebec, I
would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Confessions and
admissions—Rights of the accused—Voir dire—Failure to charge jury as to
evidence of accomplice/ accessory after the fact—Whether witness accomplice/
accessory—Defence of drunkenness—Criminal Code , s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

The appellant was tried on a charge of murder
following the death, after a vicious beating, of the woman with whom he was
living. There was little room for doubt that the deceased died as a result of
the beating administered by the appellant. The appellant was reported to have
made the observation in a tavern on the day after, “I beat her up; I don’t know
if she is alive or dead”. The appellant was found guilty at what was his second
trial on the same charge, his conviction at an earlier trial having been set
aside and a new trial directed (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 540.

The grounds of appeal to this Court were that
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the trial judge did not err in
law, (first) in not holding a voir dire for various statements allegedly
made by the appellant, (second) in not instructing the jury that the evidence
of a witness, C.T., who had been present at the beating, should be treated as
that of an accomplice, and (third) in finding that lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death
is not a “defence” to a charge of murder, and therefore erred in not holding
that the evidence of drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict
to manslaughter. The first alleged error related to statements made by the
appellant to two uniformed police officers alerted by C.T., an acquaintance of
the appellant, when they arrived at the appellant’s room to find the appellant
standing by the bed on which the victim lay unconscious, with C.T. sitting
beside her.

[Page 1042]

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ.: dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: In the particular circumstances of the
case the trial judge was in error in admitting the statements made by the
appellant at the time that the police officers arrived at his room. The police
officers were in uniform and the girl’s condition must have made it obvious
that they were investigating at least a serious case of assault. Appellant’s
counsel however made no objection to the absence of a voir dire notwithstanding
that one had been held at the first trial and this taken in conjunction with
the mass of other evidence made it appropriate to apply s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code.

While C.T. was present during the terrible
events of the night and morning in question and had taken no steps to stop the
appellant in his actions this did not mean that he should have been treated
either as an accomplice or as an accessory. A person does not become an
accomplice merely by witnessing an act and failing to intervene to prevent it.
Further the evidence of two statements as to the victim’s condition to the
effect that she was alright, merely sleeping, and that nothing happened, when
read in light of s. 23(1) of the Code, which defines an accessory
after the fact as one who knowing that a person had been a party to an offence
receives, comforts or assists him for the purpose of enabling his escape did
not justify the conclusion that C.T. was an accessory.

Finally, the Court of Appeal was in error
when it said “…lack of knowledge, due to intoxication, that bodily harm
inflicted by any person is likely to cause death is not a defence to a charge
of murder”. Notwithstanding this error there was however no justification for
the further allegation that the evidence of drunkenness justified a reduction
of the verdict to manslaughter.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting: Under these
circumstances the two police officers when in the apartment were regarded by
C.T. and the accused as “persons in authority” and were so acting. While not
holding that counsel for the appellant waived the requirement of a voir dire,
or even that such a waiver is possible, these facts and the mass of other
evidence justified the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.
The admissibility of the very brief exculpatory statement without determining its
voluntary character caused no substantial miscarriage of justice.

[Page 1043]

As to the second ground of appeal, a person
merely witnessing an act does not thereby become an accomplice. Indeed counsel
for the appellant in his address to the jury, although he attacked most
vigorously C.T.’s credibility did not imply that C.T. might have taken any part
in beating the victim. Nonetheless C.T.’s statements to the police officer,
“Oh, she’s alright, she’s just sleeping” and “nothing happened” were false statements
serving to conceal evidence and exonerate the appellant and C.T. in effect so
admitted in his cross-examination. C.T. was therefore an accessory. As an
accessory after the fact is “particeps criminis”, and so an accomplice, the
judge should have given an “accomplice warning”. In view of the fact that C.T.
was demonstrably a most unreliable witness, and of the thrust of his evidence,
it was possible to say that a jury given the proper warning could not, acting
judicially, have failed to convict the appellant. Upon this ground the appeal
should have been allowed and a new trial directed.

On the third ground of appeal, the trial
judge was doubtful that the jury could find that the appellant could have
formed the necessary specific intent. It was for the Appeal Division to satisfy
itself not that there was evidence but that the weight of such evidence was not
so weak as to make the verdict of the jury unreasonable, a requirement which
falls short of requiring the Appeal Division to substitute its opinion for that

[Page 1044]

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick
pronounced on July 28, 1977. By that judgment, the Appeal Division affirmed the
conviction of the appellant on June 5, 1976, by a judge and jury on the charge

THAT he did on or about the 5th of January,
A.D. 1974 at the City of Fredericton, in the County of York and Province of New
Brunswick, unlawfully cause the death of Linda Diana Hitchcock and did thereby
commit murder punishable by life imprisonment, contrary to Section 218(2)  of
the Criminal Code  of Canada and amendments thereto.

I shall recite the facts as set out by Limerick
J.A. in his reasons for judgment for the Appeal Division and refer hereafter to
any additional facts which are relevant to these my reasons. Limerick J.A.
said:

At 8:20 a.m. on January 5th, 1974, Csts. Arbeau and Larder
of the City of Fredericton
police force received a radio call as a result of which they proceeded to the
Windsor Hotel, a combined rooming house and hotel, at 151
 Westmorland Street in the City of Fredericton to assist in taking a patient
to the hospital.

On entering room No. 25, occupied by the
appellant, they found the deceased, Linda Diana Hitchcock, lying crosswise on a
bed. Carl Taylor, occupant of room No. 23 was sitting on the bed and the
appellant was standing nearby. Miss Hitchcock was unconscious, her eyes were
partly open and her breathing was shallow and labourous.

Cst. Arbeau asked what the problem was and
the appellant replied that she had been drinking all night and had fallen down
the stairs on her way to the bathroom. After communicating with police
headquarters by radio, Cst. Larder carried the 90 pound Miss Hitchcock to the
police car and placed her in the rear seat and the appellant sat with the
girl’s head on his lap. The police drove the car to the hospital and delivered
Miss Hitchcock to the emergency ward where she was examined by an intern and
two doctors, who then had her removed to the intensive care unit of the
hospital. She was pronounced dead the following day.

Medical evidence established there were
multiple bruises and cigarette burns on her arms, legs and body, a raised

[Page 1045]

lump on one temple and a cut in her scalp
at the back of her head as well as bruises, some of which were recent and
others several days old.

An autopsy disclosed death was caused by a
massive subdural haematoma resulting from the tearing of the sagittal vein
lying between the two hemispheres of the brain which had caused internal
pressure in the skull forcing the lower portion of the brain into the opening
at the base of the skull and so damaging the part of the brain which controls
the vital functions of the body, resulting in the paralysis of these vital
functions.

The evidence discloses that for some months
prior to Miss Hitchcock’s death she had been living with the appellant in
apartment No. 25, a two room apartment, in the Windsor Hotel. About 10:00 p.m.
on the night of January 4th she had gone to the Canadian Legion dance in
Marysville with Darrell White, Marjorie Arbeau and Kenny Hanson. They left the
dance about 1:30 a.m. and after
eating at a restaurant they, in company with Gerald Peterson, returned to the
Windsor Hotel to apartment No. 20 where Mr. White and Miss Arbeau lived.
The deceased then left apartment No. 20 to find the appellant and brought him
back to that apartment.

Later that night Mr. White and Miss
Arbeau went for a drive leaving the appellant, the deceased, Gerald Peterson
and Kenny Hanson in White’s apartment. The appellant struck the deceased both
before and after Mr. White and Miss Arbeau left the apartment. On the
occasion of the second slapping when told by Kenny Hanson to leave her alone,
the appellant left the apartment. He later returned and carried the deceased
out of the apartment.

Between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. several of the tenants heard loud
talking and shouting and two heavy thuds from the area of Carl Taylor’s
apartment (No. 23) just down the hall from that of the appellant.
Mrs. Wilson, who had an apartment across the hall from No. 23, removed her
children from their bedroom around 5:30 a.m. on that morning because of loud
talking, crying and noises eminating from Taylor’s apartment. She overheard the deceased crying and say to the
appellant “Please don’t hit me any more”. She also heard the deceased ask Carl
Taylor to make the appellant stop hitting her. Through the keyhole in her
bedroom she saw the appellant through the open door of Taylor’s apartment seated in Taylor’s apartment. She heard the appellant say he wouldn’t hit her any
more and later again heard the deceased crying and say “I thought you weren’t
going to hit me any more”.

[Page 1046]

A number of witnesses testified that on
previous occasions they had seen the appellant beating and slapping the
deceased. Anita McGraw, a week previous to the 5th of January, observed the
appellant slapping and punching the deceased in the face and head and banging
her head against the wall of their apartment.

Carl Taylor, who was somewhat intoxicated
on the night of January 4th, and somewhat confused as to times and the sequence
of events on that night, testified that the appellant and the deceased were in
his apartment No. 23 on the night of January 4 and that the appellant
continually beat the deceased, had thrown her on the floor and banged her head
three or four times against the refrigerator door. He also testified the
deceased had left the apartment to go to the toilet followed by the appellant. Taylor said he followed them out into the
hall to see what was going on and saw the appellant helping the deceased up off
the floor of the landing of the stairway in front of the bathroom. A police
officer testified this landing was six and three quarters inches below the
level of the hall floor or one step down. All three then returned to Taylor’s apartment. The appellant finally
returned to his own apartment about 7:30 a.m., dragging the deceased, who was at the time unconscious, by the
hair. Taylor, worried by her
condition, telephoned for an ambulance between 8:00 and 8:15 a.m.

Taylor testified
the appellant about a week previously had threatened to kill him with a knife
and for this reason was afraid of him and had not interfered to stop him
beating the deceased.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on
October 6, 1977, and the following three questions were put to this Court by
the appellant as grounds of appeal:

1. Did the Supreme Court of New Brunswick,
Court of Appeal err in law in holding that the learned Trial Court Judge did
not err in law in not holding a voir dire for various statements allegedly made
by the accused appellant, Hubert Edwin Morris?

2. Did the Supreme Court of New Brunswick,
Court of Appeal err in holding that the learned Trial Court Judge did not err
in law in not instructing the jury that the evidence of Karl Taylor, a Crown
witness, should be treated as that of an accomplice?

3. Did the Supreme Court of New Brunswick
Court of Appeal, err in law in finding that the lack of

[Page 1047]

knowledge, due to intoxication, that bodily
harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death is not a “defence” to a
charge of murder, and did they thereby err in not holding that the evidence of
drunkenness in this case was so overwhelming that it should have reduced the
verdict to manslaughter?

I shall deal with those three grounds of appeal
in the same order.

This Court, on December 21, 1978, pronounced judgment in
the appeal of Keith Bruce Erven v. Her Majesty The Queen[2]. In that appeal, reasons were
delivered by Dickson J. which were concurred in by three other members of the
Court. Concurring reasons were delivered by Pratte J. which were concurred in
by another member of the Court, and dissenting reasons were delivered by
Ritchie J., concurred in by two members of the Court. Dickson J., for himself
and for his three concurring brethren, expressed the view at p. 943:

In my opinion, it is always necessary to
hold a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of a statement made by
an accused out of court to a person in authority. Only in this way can fairness
to the accused be assured. To require a voir dire only if doubt is cast
on the voluntariness of a statement by the circumstances under which it was
made, as determined from evidence given in the trial proper, would not only
shift a burden to the accused but also, in other respects, cause him
significant prejudice. One must be realistic with the jury process. If the
statement is subsequently ruled inadmissible, the jury will, nevertheless, at
least be left with the knowledge that a statement was made by the accused which
has now been excluded. This is bound to arouse suspicion as to its content. If
evidence of the context of the statement is allowed to be given for some time
before anything casts doubt on its voluntariness, the jury will know something,
and perhaps much, of its content. Prejudice will surely result. Such a limited
requirement would destroy the fundamental distinction between the function of
the voir dire, which is to determine voluntariness, and that of
the trial proper, which is to determine guilt.

I can see no justification for engrafting
upon the general rule, which is remarkably free of qualifications, any
exception and, particularly, one expressed in such terms as “obviously
voluntary” or “volunteered”. Attempts in

[Page 1048]

the past to water down the rule have not
met with success and, in my opinion, the present attempt should also be
repelled.

With that view, I then concurred, as did two of
my brethren, and I apply that view to the present appeal to say that the appellant’s
statements to the two police constables Arbour and Larder should not have been
admitted Unless and until their voluntary character had been determined in a voir
dire.

Limerick J.A. suggested, as one of the reasons
for the admissibility of the statements, that these two officers, when they
entered the appellant’s apartment, were not “persons in authority”. The learned
justice in appeal was of the view that they were not then investigating a crime
and that there was no suggestion that a crime had been committed. I have read
and reread the evidence of the constables. They testified that they were on
patrol in a marked police cruiser at about 8:20 a.m. when they received a call
on the police radio. Constable Larder merely testified “We received a call from
our despatch”. Constable Arbour testified “I answered a call to Windsor Hotel
or Windsor Apartments”. When the two constables entered the apartment, they
found the victim lying across the bed unconscious, one thought at first that
she was dead, and the appellant and the witness Carl Taylor present. Arbour
asked who called the ambulance and also what was the trouble. With respect, I
have not the slightest doubt that both the appellant and Carl Taylor had no
other thought than that these two uniformed constables, appearing so
immediately after the call for the ambulance and finding these two men with an
unconscious woman, were “persons in authority” and were exercising their
authority in the investigation of highly suspicious circumstances. I can see
nothing in the circumstances which would permit a conclusion other than that it
was a situation which required that the admissibility of the statements should
be tested in a voir dire. I subscribe to what was said by Martin J.A. on
this point in R. v. Sweezey[3], at
p. 177:

[Page 1049]

I am consequently of the view that a
statement made by a person to a police officer conducting an investigation with
respect to a suspected offence must be shown to have been made voluntarily
before it is admissible against that person in a criminal trial in which he is
an accused. The words “statement by an accused” used by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim
v. The King, supra, in my view, refer to a statement made by a person who
is an accused in a criminal trial when the statement is sought to be introduced
against him rather than to the fact that he was an accused at the time he made
the statement.

Then, is the failure to hold a voir dire, and
the consequent submission to the jury of evidence which might have been
inadmissible as not voluntary, fatal to the conviction? Dickson J., in Erven,
was of the opinion that s. 613(1) (b)(iii) was available but
that the circumstances in that case made its use inadvisable. Pratte J.
expressed the same view. Ritchie J., in his dissenting reasons, was of the
opinion that the statements were properly admitted without a voir dire but
concluded, “I am, therefore, in any event of the opinion that this is a case in
which s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should be
invoked”.

I, therefore, turn to consider whether the
failure to hold a voir dire in the circumstances of this case resulted
in no substantial miscarriage of justice so as to permit the application of
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . The circumstances
are quite unusual. The appellant had been tried previously for the same offence
and was then represented by the same counsel who appeared on his behalf on the
second trial, in the Appeal Division and in this Court. At the first trial, the
admissibility of these statements was considered in a voir dire. After
conviction, a new trial was directed (R. v. Morris[4]).

Upon Constables Larder and Arbour being called
at the second trial, this same counsel made no objection to the admissibility
of their evidence in which they testified as to the statements in question and
made no request that such issue be considered in a voir dire. These two
witnesses, and many others, were cross-examined minutely as to

[Page 1050]

the fact that they failed to observe obvious
signs of a beating when they first saw the victim. The statements objected to
as inadmissible were totally exculpatory. “She had been drinking all night and
she had fallen down the stairs on her way to the bathroom”, Arbour testified.
That factor, however, does not remove the necessity of a voir dire (Piché v.
The Queen[5]) but it
is of importance in considering whether s. 613(1) (b)(iii) should be
applied. Of much more importance is that counsel for the defence called two
witnesses but did not call the appellant who, in conversation with another
patron of a tavern the next morning, had made admissions very contradictory to
his exculpatory statement the admissibility of which is here in question. In
his address to the jury, counsel for the appellant attacked very strongly the
reliability of the evidence of the Crown witness Carl Taylor which will be
dealt with hereafter and other witnesses who had testified to a series of
brutal assaults upon the victim by the appellant and then said:

If you are not satisfied, if you are
satisfied that the injuries came about partly of her own volition, perhaps
because she fell down the stairs, which evidence I will deal with in a few
minutes, perhaps from a culmination of events over a period of time, which
again is not the subject matter of this charge, then you must find the accused
not guilty.

Counsel continued in his address to stress the
evidence as to the appellant’s intoxication in reference to his ability to
possess the necessary intent but then returned to an analysis of the evidence
of the other witnesses and of the medical evidence to show in it support for
the statement of the accused, recited above, the admissibility of which he now
contests even referring to the statement itself. Under these circumstances,
there is much force to the comment made by Limerick J.A. that “the admission of
the statement formed the basis for the defence that the beating inflicted on
the deceased by the appellant was not the cause of her death”.

[Page 1051]

I am not ready to hold that counsel for the
accused waived the requirement of a voir dire or even that such a waiver
is possible. That matter is to be considered in another appeal. But these
facts, together with the presence of a mass of evidence, not only from Carl
Taylor but many other witnesses recounting the many assaults upon the deceased
during that long terrible night, convince me that the admissibility of this
very brief exculpatory statement without determining its voluntary character in
a voir dire caused no substantial miscarriage of justice. Therefore, I
would apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

The second ground of appeal urged in this Court
was the submission that the learned trial judge should have included in his
charge to the jury a warning that Carl Taylor was an accomplice and that,
therefore, it was dangerous to convict on his uncorroborated evidence although
it was within their power to do so. Although Carl Taylor was arrested later in
the morning after the constables’ arrival at the scene and was taken to the
police station, Constable Larder testified that it was because he was
intoxicated not because he was considered to have been involved in the offence.
Of course, when Constables Arbour and Larder arrived at the Windsor Apartments
and entered the apartment in question, they found there the unconscious victim and
two men, the appellant and Carl Taylor. The constables’ investigation could not
fail to include them both and for the purpose of that investigation both would
be considered suspects. But after the evidence at the trial had been concluded
and the judge charged the jury, it was apparent that Carl Taylor could not be
considered an “accomplice” in the limited sense of the word. Despite the
appellant’s argument in this Court, I find no authority for the proposition
that one who merely fails to prevent another person assaulting a third can be
considered as an accomplice in the assault. I agree with Dickson J.A., as he
then was, when he said in R. v. Taylor[6]
at p. 329, “A person merely witnessing an act does not thereby become
an accomplice”. 

[Page 1052]

Indeed counsel for the accused, in his address
to the jury, although he attacked most vigorously Carl Taylor’s credibility,
did not imply that Taylor might
have taken any part in beating the victim. Carl Taylor, however, did make a
statement to these officers which tended to exonerate the appellant. Constable
Arbour, in his testimony, reported Taylor as saying, after the appellant had stated that the victim had
fallen down the stairs, “Oh, she is alright, she’s just sleeping”. Carl Taylor,
in cross-examination, admitted that he told the officers that “nothing
happened”. Carl Taylor assigned two reasons for this false statement: firstly,
he feared that he himself might be accused of harming the girl and, secondly,
he feared that the appellant, who had threatened him with a knife only a few
days before, would harm him if he involved the appellant. In The King v.
Levy[7], the
Court of Appeal held that a person who concealed evidence, knowing that an
accused was guilty, in an attempt to assist him in escaping conviction was an
accessory after the fact. The Criminal Code  defines an accessory after
the fact in s. 23(1)  as follows:

23. (1) An accessory after the fact to an
offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to the offence,
receives, comforts or assists him for the purpose of enabling him to escape.

I am of the opinion that The King v. Levy,
supra, would have been so decided if that subsection of the Code
had been applicable and R. v. Andrews, R. v. Craig[8], is to the same effect. I quote Lord
Parker, C.J., at p. 962:

That he did not do so fully is clear, because a
full direction entails telling the jury that they must be satisfied that the
appellant did the acts complained of for the purpose of assisting the principal
felon to escape apprehension or conviction.

R. v. French[9] is to the same effect.

[Page 1053]

I cannot see that the fact that Carl Taylor’s
action was motivated by fear of reprisal would make him any less an accessory
after the fact in the present circumstances. With respect, I must differ from
Limerick J.A. when he said:

There is no evidence to support the
suggestion that Taylor told the
police nothing happened with the intention of helping the appellant escape
liability.

I am of the opinion that Taylor so admitted in his
cross-examination.

The question, therefore, is whether it is
necessary to give to the jury the “accomplice warning” in the case of a witness
who was an accessory after the fact. The issue was referred to rather obliquely
in Horsburgh v. The Queen[10],
where the Court was considering whether the trial judge should have warned
himself in accordance with the rule of practice, now become a rule of law,
applicable to the evidence of accomplices, upon considering the evidence of a
group of juvenile witnesses who had testified for the prosecution. It was the
contention of the Crown that these witnesses could not be considered
accomplices as they could not have been convicted of the charge against the
accused. Martland J., at p. 755, cited and adopted the statement of Lord
Simonds, L.C., in Davies. Director of Public Prosecutions[11] at p. 400:

There is in the authorities no formal
definition of the term “accomplice”: and your Lordships are forced to deduce a
meaning for the word from the cases in which X, Y and Z have been held to be,
or held liable to be treated as, accomplices. On the cases it would appear that
the following persons, if called as witnesses for the prosecution have been
treated as falling within the category:—

(1) On any view, persons who are participes
criminis in respect of the actual crime charged, whether as principals or
accessories before or after the fact (in felonies) or persons committing,
procuring or aiding and abetting (in the case of misdemeanors). This is surely
the natural and primary meaning of the term “accomplice”. But in two cases,
persons falling strictly outside the ambit of

[Page 1054]

this category have, in particular
decisions, been held to be accomplices for the purpose of the rule: viz:

(2) Receivers have been held to be
accomplices of the thieves from whom they receive goods on a trial of the
latter for larceny (Rex v. Jennings, (1912) 7 Cr. App. R.
242: R. v. Dixon, (1925) 19 Cr. App. R. 36):

(3) When X has been charged with a specific
offence on a particular occasion, and evidence is admissible, and has been
admitted, of his having committed crimes of this identical type on other
occasions, as proving system and intent and negativing accident; in such cases
the court has held that in relation to such other similar offences, if evidence
of them were given by parties to them, the evidence of such other parties
should not be left to the jury without a warning that it is dangerous to accept
it without corroboration. (Rex v. Farid, (1945) 30 Cr. App. R.
168).

Martland J. continued at p. 756:

I do not agree that this result follows
from the Davies case. Particeps criminis means one who shares or
co-operates in a criminal offence. The passage cited from that case shows that
the term includes an accessory after the fact, who certainly could not be
convicted of the main offence. What is necessary to become an accomplice is a
participation in the crime involved, and not necessarily the actual commission
of it. Whether or not there has been such participation will depend upon the
facts of the particular case.

It will be seen that Martland J. was there
concerned with whether a person was “participes criminis” even if he could not
be convicted of the offence of which the accused were charged. He illustrated
that the definition of “accomplice” was not so narrowly confined by pointing
out that the Lord Chancellor considered that even accessories after the fact
were “participes criminis” although certainly accessories after the fact, or
the witnesses in Horsburgh could be so convicted. As a matter of fact,
the witnesses in Horsburgh were certainly not in the position of
accessories after the fact. Martland J., for the majority, was of the opinion
they were accomplices in that they were “particeps criminis”.

[Page 1055]

In R. v. Gratton[12], at pp. 154-5, the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick determined that an accessory after the
fact was not an accomplice. Limerick J.A. there found that the inclusion of
accessory after the fact in the definition of accomplices by the Lord
Chancellor in Davies, supra, was not in accord with the law in Canada or, at any rate, in New Brunswick. Hors-burgh was not
cited.

In Ontario in R. v. Riezebos[13], the Court of Appeal for Ontario
was concerned with a witness, Utting, who it was alleged was an accessory after
the fact in that he assisted the accused for the purpose of enabling them to
escape (at p. 8). Lacourciere J.A., in giving judgment for the Court,
cited Mahlikilili Dhalamini v. The King[14],
Davies v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra, Horsburgh v. The Queen,
supra, and R. v. Gratton, supra, and at p. 11 said:

With great respect, we are unable to agree
with this submission or with the conclusion of the Court in R. v. Gratton,
supra, and the other cases referred to. Logically, the evidence of an
accessory after the fact should be regarded as untrustworthy because of his
desire “to purchase lenient treatment for himself at the expense of the accused
by co-operating with the authorities” per Ritchie J., in Horsburgh, supra, at
p. 310 C.C.C., p. 719 D.L.R. It seems to us that the question whether
an accessory after the fact should be treated as an accomplice has been
answered affirmatively by the highest Court in the land in the Horsburgh case,
supra, so that it is concluded and may be regarded as settled law in Canada.

The same issue came before this Court in Paradis
v. The Queen[15]. There,
Pigeon J., giving reasons for judgment for himself and two others, held that
although the warning need not be given in the case of an accessory after the
fact, the witness in question on the evidence in the particular case would have
to have been determined by the jury to be an accomplice before he could have
been found to be an accessory after the fact and, therefore, the trial judge
was correct in including the warning in his charge. Martland J., for the
majority, at p.

[Page 1056]

265, agreed with that determination but added as
to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec that the warning need not be given in the case of an accessory
after the fact:

I am not, however, prepared to accept the
view expressed by the Court of Appeal on that issue. The Court approved the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick in R. v. Gratton (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 150. In the
later case of R. v. Riezebos (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 1, the
Court of Appeal for Ontario did not agree with the conclusion reached in the Gratton
case, and preferred to adopt the definition of the term “accomplice” stated
by Lord Simonds, L.C., in Davies v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1954]
A.C. 378, at p. 400, which was accepted by my brother Ritchie and by me in
Horsburgh v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 746, at pp. 768 and
756. I am not persuaded that we were wrong in so doing.

In that paragraph, Martland J., for the majority
of the Court, reaffirmed the view which he had expressed in Horsburgh, again
for the majority, that an accessory after the fact was “particeps criminis” and
so an accomplice and therefore that the warning should be given as to the
testimony of such a witness.

In R. v. French, supra, the Court
of Appeal for Ontario was
concerned with the testimony of a witness who had first stated to police that
the accused was elsewhere at the time the crime was committed and testified she
had so stated for fear of her life. The Court held, in a unanimous judgment,
that the trial judge was in error in not leaving to the jury the question of
whether the witness were an accessory after the fact if she had so acted for
the purpose of enabling the accused to escape. MacKinnon J.A., as he then was,
said at p. 214:

Lacourciere, J.A., speaking for this Court
in R. v. Riezebos (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 1, reviewed the law with
relation to accomplices and accessories after the fact and quoted the following
passage from the majority judgment in Horsburgh v. The Queen, [1968] 2 C.C.C.
288 at pp. 298-9, 63 D.L.R. (2d) 699, [1967] S.C.R. 746 at p. 756 [p. 10]:

[Page 1057]

Particeps criminis means one who shares or co-operates in a criminal offence. The
passage cited from that case shows that the term includes an accessory after
the fact, who certainly could not be convicted of the main offence. What is
necessary to become an accomplice is a participation in the crime involved, and
not necessarily the actual commission of it. Whether or not there has been such
participation will depend upon the facts of the particular case.

The Court in Riezebos came to the
conclusion that the question whether an accessory after the fact should be
treated as an accomplice had been answered affirmatively by the Supreme Court
of Canada in the Hors-burgh case. The majority of the Supreme Court
reaffirmed this view in Paradis v. The Queen (1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 387,
73 D.L.R. (3d) 745, 13 N.R. 251.

Despite the clash of opinion between the appeal
courts in New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario, I have come to the conclusion that
MacKinnon J.A., as he then was, was correct when he stated that the majority of
this Court had, in Paradis, reaffirmed that the trial judge should give
to the jury the accomplice warning as to witnesses whom they find to be
accessories after the fact. I realize the obiter character of statements
to this effect in both Horsburgh and Paradis but it is an obiter
which has been repeated and, at least in Ontario, has been adopted as a firm statement of the law. The rule, in my
opinion, is a salutary one for the reason referred to in Horsburgh by
Ritchie J. and stated again by Lacourciere J.A. in Riezebos at
p. 11:

Logically, the evidence of an accessory
after the fact should be regarded as untrustworthy because of his desire “to
purchase lenient treatment for himself at the expense of the accused by
co-operating with the authorities”.

I have, therefore, concluded as part of my ratio
decidendi in this appeal that the learned trial judge erred in not leaving
to the jury the question of whether Carl Taylor was an accessory after the fact
and warning them that if they so found it would be dangerous to convict the
appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of such accessory after the fact.

[Page 1058]

Again, this does not end the matter. There is no
logical reason why it should be determined that the provisions of
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) should not be invoked. Limerick J.A. did so in
his reasons for the Appeal Division applying the section without expressly
referring to it, in the last paragraph of his reasons. MacKinnon J.A., as he
then was, adopted the same course in French when he said at p. 216:

The jury were left in no doubt as to the
danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of Miss Deveau. The warning
given by the trial Judge satisfied the requirements of justice and there was no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in his failing to leave to the jury
the question of whether Miss Deveau was an accessory after the fact.

I therefore turn to consider whether the failure
I have found in the charge resulted in any miscarriage of justice.

Carl Taylor was amply demonstrated to be the
most unreliable witness. There is some significance in the fact that the
witness upon whom the Crown relied to testify to the cruel and senseless
beating inflicted upon the deceased over many hours was only called as the
twenty-seventh witness for the Crown after two hundred and fifty-three foolscap
pages of evidence had been given. In his examination it was shown that Carl
Taylor came directly from an alcoholics’ rehabilitation institution accompanied
by an attendant and that he had a criminal record. The cross-examination
reveals page after page of contradictions, hesitations and frequent resort to
the reply of “I don’t remember”, which might well reflect his own intoxication
during the critical period. All of these features of Taylor’s testimony were the subject of very strong comments in the defence
counsel’s address to the jury.

Although as the learned trial judge asks in his
charge “Did the blows described by Taylor and that is the only evidence of the serious blows, cause a rupture of the sagittal vein…?” (the underlining is my
own), there was a great deal of other direct and circumstantial evidence of
well nigh continuous beating of the deceased by the accused

[Page 1059]

during this long and terrible night. Moreover,
evidence was given by one witness that the accused in the tavern the next
morning admitted “I beat her up and I don’t know whether she’s alive or dead”.

These matters were all before the jury on the
evidence which they heard. But the importance of the rule requiring the judge
to give the accomplice warning is just that it comes from the judge. So
in French, supra, MacKinnon J.A., as he then was, sought
something in the trial judge’s charge which could compensate for the absence of
the necessary formal warning as to the evidence of an accomplice, having
included an accessory after the fact in that classification. He quoted the
trial judge as follows at pp. 211-212:

The Crown’s case rests on the foundation
provided by Nadine Deveau’s evidence. She is a self-confessed persistent liar,
thief and drug addict, who originally gave the police an alibi for Tom French,
and only many months later, in suspicious circumstances, accused Tom French.
Because of her character and her propensity to lie, and because of her
involvement in crime, it would be dangerous to convict on her evidence. No one
who knows her would believe her under oath, and in any event, look to the
evidence as regards the story of the original plot to murder Ken Landers; she
is supported by no one, and contradicted by Mrs. Landers.

As regards the meeting outside the City
Hotel, she is supported by no one and contradicted by two guards,
Mr. Eriksen and Mr. Holbrook and by Bill Buck and Brian Holtzhauer.
As regards the conversation over at Adam Hanson’s barber shop, she is supported
by no one and contradicted by Don Morrison.

There are a number of witnesses that you
have heard testify that they would not believe Nadine Deveau under oath, and I
should tell you that in the last resort it is for you to decide whether you
would believe Nadine Deveau under oath. These witnesses knew her, they say they
knew her and knew her reputation, and they said that they would not believe her
under oath. You have to judge their credibility.

…

The fact is, members of the Jury, she is,
as I have said the most crucial witness in this case; and even if she were an
independent person, I would direct you in strong terms that you must scrutinize
her evidence most care-

[Page 1060]

fully, but because she is a person with a
criminal record and of ill repute, admittedly ill repute, then you should be
even more careful in weighing her evidence which is uncorroborated or
unsupported so far as the statements to her are concerned.

and concluded, as I have already quoted, that
the jury was left in no doubt. However, in the present case when one turns to
the trial judge’s charge, there is no such emphasis on the frailties of Carl
Taylor’s evidence. Taylor’s
intoxication is referred to; it is said that he was “trying to help himself”
but that is in reference to his submission to treatment for alcoholism not to
his possible seeking of leniency from the authorities. Once the learned trial
judge used the expression “Carl Taylor goes out if you believe him”, I am of
the opinion that these slight references to the character of the testimony
given by Carl Taylor can afford no justification for the application of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. I cannot say that a jury
properly charged, and particularly that a jury given the required accomplice
warning as to the evidence of Carl Taylor, could not, acting judicially, have
failed to convict the appellant. This is especially true in light of the
matters to which I shall refer hereafter. Therefore, I cannot find the
certainty of no miscarriage of justice which would permit the application of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. Upon this ground, the appeal
must be allowed and a new trial directed.

The third ground of appeal argued in this Court
as I have set out above deals with the defence of intoxication in reference to
the ability of the accused to form the required specific intent to commit the
crime of murder. In view of the direction for a new trial which I believe is
necessary as a result of the second ground of appeal, it is not necessary to
deal with the third ground. However, I am of the opinion that the issue should
be clarified so that the trial judge upon the new trial may properly instruct
the jury. Further, with respect, I am of the opinion that the decisions of the
Judicial Committee and of this Court do not

[Page 1061]

support the views expressed in his reasons of
Limerick J.A., who said:

Ground (e). There was evidence upon which
the jury could find as they did and as they are the exclusive judges of the facts
this Court, in the absence of error in law on the part of the trial Judge,
cannot interfere with the finding of the jury. Lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that the bodily harm inflicted was likely to cause death is not a
defence to a charge of murder. A person cannot escape liability by pleading he
voluntarily consumed so much alcohol that he was unable to appreciate the
probable consequents of his actions. See the judgment of Lord Denning in
Attorney-General for Northern Ireland v. Gallagher [1963] A.C. 349 at p. 380 approved by the Supreme
Court of Canada in Perrault v. R. [1971] S.C.R. 196 at p. 203.

…

The trial judge adequately and properly
instructed the jury as to the effect of drunkenness in relation to the charge
of murder and the facts of the case and, indeed, he instructed the jury that he
very much doubted if the appellant was able to form the necessary intent to
commit the crime of murder on account of his intoxicated condition. There was,
however, evidence including that of expert witnesses which, if believed, on
which the jury could find the appellant had the ability to form the intent to
inflict bodily harm which he should have known was likely to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not, and this court cannot substitute its
opinion for that of the jury on this question of fact.

It is true that in Attorney General for Northern Ireland v. Gallagher[16], Lord Denning said at p. 380:

(a) It may impair a man’s powers of
perception so that he may not be able to foresee or measure the consequences of
his actions as he would if he were sober. Nevertheless he is not allowed to set
up his self-induced want of perception as a defence. Even if he did not himself
appreciate that what he was doing was dangerous, nevertheless if a reasonable
man in his place who was not befuddled with drink would have appreciated it, he
is guilty: see Rex v. Meade, [1909] 1 K.B. 895; 25 T.L.R. 359; 2
Cr. App. R. 54, C.C.A., as explained in

[Page 1062]

Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, 502-504.

But at p. 381, Lord Denning continued:

The general principle which I have
enunciated is subject to two exceptions:

1. If a man is charged with an offence in
which a specific intention is essential (as in murder, though not in
manslaughter), then evidence of drunkenness, which renders him incapable of
forming that intention, is an answer: see Beard’s case, [1920] A.C. 479,
501, 504. This degree of drunkenness is reached when the man is rendered so
stupid by drink that he does not know what he is doing (see Reg. v. Moore (1852),
3 Car. & Kir. 319), as where, at a christening, a drunken nurse put the
baby behind a large fire, taking it for a log of wood (Gentleman’s Magazine,
1748, p. 570); and where a drunken man thought his friend (lying in his bed)
was a theatrical dummy placed there and stabbed him to death (“The Times”,
January 13, 1951). In each of those cases it would not be murder. But it would
be manslaughter.

And when Fauteux C.J.C. cited this decision with
approval in Perrault v. The Queen[17],
at p. 203, he continued with the words:

Lord Denning then indicated that the
general principle of English law as to drunkenness, illustrated as above in (a),
(b) and (c), is subject to two exceptions which, in my
opinion, in view of the finding of facts in this case, have no application in
this instance.

Therefore, I am of the opinion that the jury
must determine whether the accused was so affected by intoxication as to
“render him incapable of forming that intention”: Attorney General v.
Gallagher, supra. If the jury has any reasonable doubt that the Crown has
failed to prove that the accused, despite his intoxication, had the ability to
form such a specific intent they must acquit him of murder, though they should
convict him of manslaughter. A careful reading of the learned trial judge’s
charge convinces me that it was quite accurate in this respect. I, therefore,
do not criticize the charge but only the inferences which may be drawn from
Limerick J.A.’s statements in respect to the defence of intoxication. The
appel-

[Page 1063]

lant’s third ground of complaint does not refer
to the charge but to the duty of a court of appeal under s. 613(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code  which provides:

613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal
where it is of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

I have quoted above Limerick J.A.’s disposition
of the question. In my respectful opinion, it is not sufficient to say:

There was evidence upon which the jury
could find as they did and as they are the exclusive judges of the facts, this
Court, in the absence of error in law on the part of the trial Judge, cannot
interfere with the finding of the jury.

The task of the Appellate Court was outlined by
Pigeon J. giving the majority judgment in Corbett v. The Queen[18] when he said at pp. 278-9:

Of course, if the judges of the majority
had held that their function was only to decide whether there was evidence,
this would be reversible error. The Code expressly provides that the appeal may
be allowed, not only when the verdict cannot be supported by the evidence but
also when it is unreasonable. In other words, the Court of Appeal must satisfy
itself not only that there was evidence requiring the case to be submitted to
the jury, but also that the weight of such evidence is not so weak that a
verdict of guilty is unreasonable. This cannot be taken to mean that the Court
of Appeal is to substitute its opinion for that of the jury. The word of the
enactment is “unreasonable” not “unjustified”. The jurors are the triers of the
facts and their finding is not to be set aside because the judges in appeal do
not think they would have made the same finding if sitting as jurors. This is
only to be done if they come to the conclusion that the verdict is such that no
twelve reasonable men could possibly have reached it acting judicially.

[Page 1064]

As Limerick J.A. pointed out, the learned trial
judge was highly doubtful that the jury could find that the appellant could
have formed the necessary specific intent. Therefore, as Pigeon J. said, the
Appeal Division must satisfy itself not that there was evidence but that the
weight of such evidence was not so weak as to make the verdict of the jury
unreasonable. This requirement certainly does not go to the extent of requiring
the Appeal Division to substitute its opinion for that of the jury but it does
call upon the Appeal Division to determine whether any twelve reasonable men
could possibly have reached that verdict. In view of all the evidence as to
gross intoxication of the appellant and the very evident doubt expressed by the
learned trial judge as to the appellant’s ability to form the necessary intent,
the prosecuting authorities might well consider whether the new trial which is
directed in these reasons might not be upon the charge of manslaughter.

For the reasons set out above, I would allow the
appeal and direct a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of New Brunswick affirming the conviction of the appellant at his trial for murder
punishable by life imprisonment before Barr J. sitting with a jury.

I think it desirable to observe at the outset
that this appeal is concerned with the second trial of the appellant on the
same charge, his conviction at an earlier trial having been set aside and a new
trial directed by the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, for the reasons which are
now reported in (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) at p. 540.

The following grounds of appeal are now raised
by the Notice of Appeal to this Court:

That the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding
that the learned trial court judge did not err in law

[Page 1065]

1. In not holding a voir dire for various
statements allegedly made by the accused appellant;

2. In not instructing the jury that the evidence
of Carl Taylor a Crown witness should be treated as the evidence of an
accomplice;

3. In finding that lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death
is not a “defence” to a charge of murder, and therefore erred in not holding
that the evidence of drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict
to manslaughter.

I have had the benefit of reading the reasons
for judgment prepared for delivery by my brother Spence who deals exhaustively
with these three grounds of appeal and after a comprehensive review of the fact
concludes that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial should be granted
on both the second and third grounds. Although I find myself in disagreement
with my brother Spence in the result, I am nevertheless satisfied that he has
accurately summarized the relevant evidence, which was also reviewed by
Limerick J.A. in the Court of Appeal whose reasons for judgment are now
conveniently reported in (1977), 18 N.B.R. (2d) at p. 523 et seq.

There can be little doubt that the deceased came
to her death as a result of a vicious beating administered by the appellant
during the night and early morning of January 4 and 5, 1974, and the appellant
is in fact reported to have made the observation in a tavern at noon on the 5th
that: “I beat her up; I don’t know if she is alive or dead.”

The first ground of error alleged by the
appellant has to do with statements made by him in the presence of two police
officers who came to the hotel or rooming house where he resided with the
deceased. The officers had been alerted by a radio call from their headquarters
which had in turn been occasioned by the fact that one Carl Taylor, who lives
in the house and had been with the appellant while the brutal beating was being
administered to the deceased, had telephoned to the hospital because of the
girl’s condition.

[Page 1066]

When the two police constables arrived at the
rooming house they were directed to the appellant’s bedroom (No. 25), and upon
entering they found the appellant standing by the bed on which the victim was
lying in an unconscious condition, with Carl Taylor sitting beside her.
Constable Arbour described the condition of the victim at this time in the
following passage:

Q. Would you describe her, please, as you
saw her?

A. She was lying crossways on the bed, her
feet dangling to the floor, but they weren’t touching the floor. She was
unconscious. Her eyes were half shut, she was breathing heavily, and it
appeared that she was snoring. She made snoring sounds. She was dressed in a
sweater and slacks. Mr. Carl Taylor, who testified earlier, he was sitting
on the bed on Miss Hitchcock’s righthand side, and Mr. Morris would be on
her lefthand side near the bed standing up beside her. When I entered the room,
I asked who had called the ambulance. Mr. Morris replied, ‘I did’, and I
then asked what the problem was, and Mr. Morris replied she had been
drinking all night and she had fallen down the stairs on her way to the
bathroom. At this time, Mr. Taylor spoke up and said, ‘Oh, she’s all
right, she’s just sleeping’. I then asked who she was, and Mr. Morris
replied, ‘My wife’, and I asked another question, when she had fallen down the
stairs. Again Mr. Morris replied, ‘About an hour ago’.

I agree with my brother Spence that in the
particular circumstances of this case, the learned trial judge was in error in
admitting the statements made by the appellant on this occasion without the
holding of a voir dire. The police officers were in uniform and the
girl’s condition must have made it obvious that they were investigating a
serious case of assault to say the least. I am, however, also in agreement with
my brother Spence for the reasons which he has stated, that the conduct of the
proceedings by appellant’s counsel who made no objection to the introduction of
this evidence notwithstanding the fact that a voir dire had been held in
respect to it at the first trial, when taken in conjunction with the mass of
evidence from the various occupants of the rooming house where the assault took
place, made the error in admitting in evidence the brief exculpatory statement
made by

[Page 1067]

the appellant to the police one which occasioned
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and that this is an appropriate
area in which to invoke the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

The second ground of appeal is directed to the
question of whether or not the evidence justified the conclusion that Carl
Taylor was an accomplice and whether the learned trial judge erred in failing
to give the appropriate warning to the jury that it would be dangerous to
convict on his uncorroborated evidence.

The role played by Taylor in relation to the
sordid events of the night and early morning during which the beatings were
administered to the deceased can be summarized as follows: Taylor spent the
earlier part of the evening drinking with the appellant and after the rough
treatment of the girl at the hands of the appellant had started, she was
brought by the appellant to Taylor’s room where further assaults of a violent
and vicious character took place. It was not until the early morning of the 5th
that the appellant dragged the now unconscious girl by her hair from Taylor’s apartment to his own. These were
the circumstances under which Taylor made his call to the hospital which ultimately resulted in the
arrival of the police.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the fact of his having been present during the terrible events of the night and
morning in question, and having taken no steps of any kind to stop the
appellant in his actions, was enough of itself to brand Taylor as an
accomplice, but I agree with my brother Spence that a person does not become an
accomplice merely by witnessing an act and taking no steps to prevent it and
that the evidence did not justify a finding that Taylor was an accomplice in
the sense of participating in the crime.

It is, however, contended that two statements
made by Taylor to the police tended to exonerate the appellant and that in this
sense he was an accessory after the fact, and the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that his evidence, like that of an accomplice, was such as
to make it dangerous to act upon it without corroboration.

[Page 1068]

In this latter regard, the only evidence relied
on as constituting Taylor an accessory after the fact is the following: (i) the
statement to the police to which I have referred when he said “Oh, she’s all
right, she’s just sleeping” and (ii) the admission made on cross-examination
that he had told the police officers that “nothing happened”. The context in
which the last mentioned statement was allegedly made when the police officers
first arrived and Taylor’s
alleged admission, occurs in the following passage of his cross-examination:

Q. Now, what did you tell the police
happened?

A. I told them nothing happened.

Q. You told them nothing happened. You told
them nothing happened.

A. I was so damn scared I did not know what
to say.

Taylor’s explanation of
both statements is that he was frightened of the police on his own account
because the beatings had taken place in his room, and he feared also that the
appellant might do him violence as he had threatened to do in the past. It is
significant also that he described his condition at the time that he was
talking to the police as “I was in bad shape; I was shook up; I had been
drinking—”. These latter statements are certainly supported by the evidence.

The history of the development of the concept of
“an accessory after the fact” is well described in Crankshaw’s Criminal Code  of
Canada, Seventh Edition, at p. 65:

The third and most important condition is
that a person in order to be an accessory after the fact must be shewn to have
done some act to assist the principal offender personally: R. v. Chapple, 9
C. & P. 355; either to conceal the crime or to evade the pursuit of
justice; so that where, for instance, a person is charged with being an
accessory after the fact to murder, the question for the jury is whether such
person knowing the murder to have been committed was either assisting the
murderer to conceal the death or in any way enabling him to escape being
brought to justice: R. v. Greenacre, 8 C. & P. 35. See also R.
v. Hansill, 3 Cox C.C. 397.

Acts intended to destroy or conceal things
which may be produced in evidence against a prisoner on his trial make the doer
of such acts an accessory after the fact: R. v. Levy, 7
Cr. App. Rep. 61, 28 T.L.R. 93.

[Page 1069]

One does not become an accessory after the
fact by merely neglecting to inform the authorities that a crime has been
committed or by forbearing to arrest the offender: 1 Hale 618, 619.

The test of an accessory after the fact
seems to be that he renders, to one known by him to have committed a criminal
offence, some active personal help to enable him to conceal his offence or
hinder his apprehension, trial or punishment, as by concealing him in the house
or shutting the door against his pursuers until he should have an opportunity
to escape, or by furnishing him with money or food to support him in hiding, or
by supplying him with a horse to enable him to fly from his pursuers, or a house
or other shelter to conceal him in, or by using open force or violence to
protect him, or by taking money from him to allow him to escape, or by bribing
his gaoler to let him escape, or by conveying instruments to the principal
offender to enable him to break goal.

In the present circumstances it appears to me to
be relevant to refer to the reasons for judgment of Lord Denning in Sykes v.
The Director of Public Prosecutions[19]
at p. 561 where he said, in part:

…if the acts of assistance were done, not
to hinder the arrest of the felon, but with another motive, such as to avoid
arrest himself (see R. v. Jones, [1948] 2 All E.R. 964),
or to make money for himself without regard to what happened to the felon (as
in the present case), he would not be guilty as an accessory after the fact.

In any event, the role of an accessory after the
fact is clearly defined in Canada by s. 23(1)  of the Criminal Code  which reads:

23. (1) An accessory after the fact to an
offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to the offence
receives, comforts or assists him for the purpose of enabling him to escape.

The two statements above referred to which are
relied on as evidence that Taylor was an accessory after the fact, must be read
in light of this definition.

At the time when the first statement was made,
according to the police officer, the victim was

[Page 1070]

unconscious—“Her eyes were half shut, she was
breathing heavily, and it appeared that she was snoring”. With all respect to
those who hold a different view, I can find no basis for construing Taylor’s
statement “Oh, she’s all right, she’s just sleeping” given under these
circumstances as justifying the inference that he was an accessory after the
fact as above defined, nor do I find it possible to read his admission that he
told the police “nothing happened” as referable to anything done or said by him
“for the purpose of enabling” the appellant’s escape. I am therefore of opinion
that the trial judge did not err in failing to instruct the jury that the evidence
of Carl Taylor should be treated as evidence of an accessory after the fact,
and accordingly, no question arises in this case as to the necessity of warning
the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice.

It will accordingly be apparent that I am in
agreement with Mr. Justice Limerick in the Court of Appeal that there is
no evidence that the statements hereinbefore quoted were made by Taylor in
receiving, comforting or assisting the appellant “for the purpose of enabling”
him to escape.

Finally, the appellant alleges that the Court of
Appeal erred in law “in finding that lack of knowledge, due to intoxication,
that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death is not a
defence to a charge of murder, and therefore erred in not holding that the
evidence of drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict to
manslaughter”. In this regard, I agree with my brother Spence, for the reasons
which he has stated, that Mr. Justice Limerick, speaking on behalf of the
Court of Appeal, was in error when he said: “…lack of knowledge, due to
intoxication, that bodily harm inflicted by any person is likely to cause death
is not a defence to a charge of murder”. In so stating the law,
Mr. Justice Limerick purported to be following the judgment of Lord
Denning in Attorney General for Northern Ireland v. Gallagher[20], but in so doing he appears to have
overlooked what Lord Denning said at p. 381 with respect to offences in
which a specific intention is

[Page 1071]

essential. His Lordship there said, in part:

1. If a man is charged with an offence in
which a specific intention is essential (as in murder, though not in
manslaughter), then evidence of drunkenness, which renders him incapable of
forming that intention, is an answer: see Beard’s case, [1920] A.C. 479
at 501 & 504. This degree of drunkenness is reached when the man is
rendered so stupid by drink that he does not know what he is doing.

While acknowledging the error in
Mr. Justice Limerick’s reasons for judgment, I see no justification for
the further allegation that he erred in not holding that the evidence of
drunkenness in this case should have reduced the verdict to manslaughter.

In the present case, Mr. Justice Spence has
made an express finding, with which I agree, that the trial judge correctly
instructed the jury in relation to the possible defence of drunkenness, and it
is the error which he found in the judgment of Mr. Justice Limerick that
appears to have evoked his suggestion that if a new trial is directed the
prosecuting authorities might well consider whether such new trial might be
upon the charge of manslaughter. In my view, however, no error made by the
Court of Appeal can alter the fact that a properly instructed jury, having
heard and seen the witnesses, brought in a verdict of guilty of murder. Here
there was no error in the charge of the learned trial judge and no errors made
in the Court of Appeal can affect the validity of the verdict rendered in
accordance with that charge.

For all these reasons, I would dismiss this
appeal.

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Judge’s charge
to jury—Failure to charge jury as to improprieties of witnesses—Witnesses’
disregard of judge’s direction not to discuss evidence—Change of testimony by
witnesses under oath—Adequacy of charge.

The victim in this murder was shot in a
parking lot separating two Hamilton hotels at approximately 11:50 p.m. on September 21, 1974. At about the same time
noise like a shot or a backfire attracted the attention of a passerby to the
parking lot where he saw a man running to a brown or copper coloured van with
lettering which he later identified as the name “Barber Appliance Services”.
This witness on entering the parking lot found the body of the victim on the
ground with what proved to be a fatal gun shot wound in the neck. The van had
been some five feet from the body and a man was seen running towards it and
entering the driver’s side while leaving the door ajar. Two other witnesses
testified that they had seen the van and one was able to take down what he
thought was the number of the licence plate. It seemed clear that the driver of
the van at this time was the murderer. The evidence was inconsistent with any
other rational explanation. The identified van was on the night in question in
the custody of Penoffio, the firm’s Hamilton manager. Penoffio lived in a house at 87
 Augusta Street, Hamilton, which was also occupied by a
friend named Matthews and which the accused was visiting on the evening in
question. The van was found next to this address shortly after the shooting and
at that time the house was occupied by the accused, Penoffio and Matthews. Both
Penoffio and Matthews were obviously potential suspects but neither told a
story putting the other in the hotel parking lot at the fatal hour. The Crown’s
case depended almost entirely on circumstantial evidence although in so far as
the statements of the accused and Penoffio were self-serving they were
dependent upon the jury’s assessment of their respective credibility. The
accused was convicted of murder and his appeal was dismissed without recorded
reasons by a unanimous Court of Appeal. The order

[Page 1073]

granting leave to appeal further limited
consideration by this Court to two alleged errors in the judge’s charge, first
in failing to caution the jury on the unreliability of the witness Matthews
who changed his testimony after discussing it overnight with the witness
Penoffio in breach of the trial judge’s direction forbidding such discussion
and second in failing to caution the jury on the unreliability of
Penoffio who, inter alia, had made previous contradictory statements
under oath, and who generally by his evidence and conduct had shown himself to
be an undesirable and untrustworthy character.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: There was some doubt as to whether
Matthews had heard the order made when Penoffio was giving evidence forbidding
discussions between witnesses. In view of this the trial judge cannot be said
to have been in error in failing to instruct the jury as to the unreliability
of Matthew’s evidence on account of Matthew’s having acted in breach of an
order of which he may well have been unaware. Further the change in Matthews’
evidence had no direct bearing on the whereabouts of Maxwell at the time of the
murder, its sole effect was to support the evidence of Penoffio as against that
of the accused. In these circumstances a change in evidence from “I cannot
remember” to saying “I have now been reminded” did not give rise to such an
inconsistency as to require a special caution in the judge’s charge.

There is no doubt that Penoffio was unreliable;
however the present case is distinguishable from Binet v. The Queen, [1954]
S.C.R. 52, where the witness was an accomplice and a perjurer. Here there was
no suggestion that Penoffio was an accomplice, it being on the contrary urged
that he was a suspect. Furthermore as the only vital issue was here the
identity of the driver of the van at the time of the murder, a matter on which
Penoffio gave no evidence, his perjury was not concerned with this single
material question and in the circumstances the trial judge was guilty of no
error in failing to give more instruction than he did in respect to this
witness.

[Page 1074]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting: In this case
any evidence as to who committed the crime was fragile at best. Circumstantial
entirely, there was in it ground for suspicion against Penoffio and Matthews as
well as against the accused. Credibility was central to the case against any
one of them and how the trial judge charged the jury on credibility in light of
the contradictions in Penoffio’s evidence under oath and the disobedience of
Penoffio and Matthews of the order against discussion of the evidence were
crucial to the proper disposition of the appeal.

The charge to the jury consisted of a
narrative review of the evidence leaving it to the jury to decide as to which
submissions or theories to accept. The inconsistent statements of Penoffio
under oath and the breach of the judge’s order to the witnesses were left to
the jury as going to simple credibility. The charge was inadequate, both as
regards Penoffio and Matthews there was non-direction amounting to
misdirection. Not only were these witnesses who might have had an interest in
exculpating themselves at the expense of the accused but also their interest was
associated with such testimonial improperties as called for a clear caution
against receiving and weighing their evidence by the standards applicable to an
independent witness. The defence here was that it was not the accused but more
likely Penoffio who killed the deceased. It was Penoffio who had motive, not
the accused. The conflict in their evidence was striking and related to the
van, a vital link in the murder. In more than one of Penoffio’s versions he
would have had easy access to the van. The jury was entitled to find that
Penoffio was a perjured witness and should have been warned in the terms
approved in Binet v. The Queen.

There were three circumstances which
certainly in their cumulative effect called for a strong caution by the trial
judge to the jury against accepting the evidence upon which the Crown’s case
was founded, first, the self-interest of the witnesses, second, the
inconsistent, contradictory statements under oath on vital issues and third,
the breach of the judge’s order; a caution especially necessary, absent
independent evidence corroborative of the tainted witnesses.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
recorded reasons an appeal from a conviction at trial by O’Leary J. sitting
with a jury on a charge of murder. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence,
Dickson and Estey JJ. dissenting.

C.C. Ruby, for the appellant.

D. Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson,
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This is an
appeal, by leave of this Court, from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal
dismissing, without recorded reasons, an appeal by Maxwell from his conviction
of murder after a trial before O’Leary J. and a jury. Leave to appeal was
granted by this Court on the following composite question:

Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
refusing to find that the trial Judge erred, in the circumstances of this case,
in (1) failing to caution the jury on the unreliability of the witness Matthews
who changed his testimony after discussing it overnight with the witness,
Penoffio, in breach of the trial Judge’s direction forbidding any such
discussion; and (2) in failing to caution the jury on the unreliability of the
evidence of Penoffio who, inter alia, had made previous contradictory
statements under oath?

The accused, thirty-two years of age at the
material time, was then the operator of a small painting and construction
business. He had served in the Canadian armed forces, worked as a prison guard,
in security service and as a special constable with the traffic division of the
Hamilton Police Department, and later as a house detective for a hotel before
going into business for himself. He worked concurrently part-time for Barber
Appliance Services and was at the time of the alleged offence doing some
painting for one Stone-house and for one Penoffio and was given a key to the
latter’s home in that connection. He was wont to sleep overnight in the homes
where he was working but did have a residence of his own.

[Page 1076]

The deceased, victim of the killing, one Maurice
Rodriguez, had been seen in one of the beverage rooms in the Elmar Hotel in Hamilton, Ontario,
on the evening of September 21, 1974 and was also seen to leave by himself at
about 11:30 p.m. He was shot
and killed a short time later in a parking area between the Elmar and another
hotel. There was evidence of a noise like a backfire or a shot being heard,
coming from the parking area, and of a man seen running to a parked van which
he drove away. Several witnesses described the van which had Barber Appliance
Services written on the side and one witness noted the licence number as it was
driven away. Shortly after midnight, about 12:05 or 12:10 a.m. in the morning of September 22, 1974, the van was located in
the driveway of a house belonging to the witness Penoffio. The fact that the
witness who took the licence number was mistaken as to one digit of the licence
did not impede the speedy discovery of the van. The house, at 87 Augusta Avenue, was about three to five
minutes’ driving time distant from the Elmar Hotel.

It is obvious, there being no evidence of any
other possibility, that whoever drove the van away from the parking lot was the
killer of Rodriguez.

The deceased had been a tenant of Penoffio at 87
Augusta for about a year, until Penoffio terminated the tenancy in April 1974
by notice to quit, allegedly because of the deceased’s misbehaviour which
brought the police to the premises several times. There was resulting hostility
between the deceased and Penoffio, who testified to harassing telephone calls
by a caller, whom he believed to be the deceased and who hung up when the
telephone was answered. There were other incidents, which need not be narrated,
indicating a bad relationship between the deceased and Penoffio.

Penoffio, at the material time, was the Hamilton manager of an appliance service,
Barber’s Appliance Services. The van seen leaving the scene of the murder
belonged to this firm and carried the firm name on its side. Penoffio had
picked up the

[Page 1077]

van on September 20, 1974 from the owner of the
firm and left his own car with the owner. Of the three or four keys to the van,
the owner had one, Penoffio had one and one was kept by an employee in Brantford where the firm also operated.

There was no evidence that the accused Maxwell
was at the Elmar Hotel in the evening of September 21. The accused knew the
deceased and, on the evidence, they were on friendly terms. There was no motive
on Maxwell’s part to harm or kill the deceased. The accused had slept at the
home of a witness, Stonehouse, on the night of September 20, being engaged in
doing some painting for him. The next evening, September 21, Stonehouse and a
friend of his invited the accused to join them for a drink at a tavern, the
Running Pump. He declined, saying he was going to visit Penoffio. Stonehouse
testified that he and his friend had offered to give the accused a lift and he
was dropped at 87 Augusta about
10:25 p.m., saying as he left
“I will see you cats later”. According to Stonehouse, the accused did not turn
up at the Running Pump, but Stonehouse did see Penoffio there that evening.

The accused gave evidence as did Penoffio and
also the then tenant of Penoffio, one Robert Matthews. It is the conflict in
their evidence, a conflict on crucial matters, that goes to the heart of the
two issues on which this Court gave leave.

I refer first to the evidence of the accused as
to the course of events after he came to Penoffio’s house at 10:25 or 10:30 p.m. on September 21. He testified that he
went there at Penoffio’s telephoned request to meet him about 10 p.m., the
accused believing it was to join him in going out for a few drinks to a tavern,
the Corktown, which they visited two or three times a week. The accused let
himself into the house with a key which he had been given while he was painting
on the premises. Penoffio was not at home—the accused even knocked at the
bedroom door—so he helped himself to a bottle of beer and, when Penoffio did
not return, assumed he had gone on

[Page 1078]

ahead to the Corktown. Finding a car key on the
kitchen counter, he took the van and drove to the Corktown looking for
Penoffio. He had a few draft beers and after fifteen or twenty minutes he drove
back to 87 Augusta and parked
the van in the driveway. Penoffio was not in the house and the accused took a
pint of beer from the refrigerator and went into the living room where he
turned on the television for the 11 o’clock news. He then listened to some
music and drank some more beer. About this time he heard and caught a glimpse
of someone leaving the house by the back door. He was unable to identify the
person but it was not Penoffio. Shortly thereafter, about midnight, Penoffio did come in from the back
door. A few minutes later the police arrived.

Penoffio testified that he awakened about 10:30
p.m. on the evening of September 21 and found the accused at his place with the
tenant Matthews. He said they watched television for a time, and then he and
the accused drove in the van to the Corktown, with Penoffio driving. The place
was full and Penoffio decided not to stay, gave the key of the van to the
accused and walked over to the Running Pump where he drank some beer and then
returned to the Corktown. He had left the accused at the Corktown about 11 p.m. and it was about midnight when he
returned. The accused was not there and, after having a beer, Penoffio walked
home, arriving about 12:05 to 12:10 a.m. The van was in the driveway and the accused was in the kitchen
having a bottle of beer. The police arrived shortly thereafter.

Penoffio testified at the trial that when he and
the accused were driving to the Corktown the accused had asked for the loan of
the van next day, Sunday, to enable him to move some furniture. Penoffio
agreed. The van at that time contained a large number of vacuum cleaners. It
was put to Penoffio on cross-examination that he had testified at the
preliminary inquiry that the accused had asked to borrow the van on the
following Tuesday to move a stove. The transcript, which the Court reporter
said was accurate, showed that he did say

[Page 1079]

Tuesday at the preliminary hearing but he said
at the trial that this was a mistake. Again, at the preliminary inquiry,
Penoffio testified that after drinking at the Running Pump on the evening of
September 21 (after he left the accused at the Corktown) he went directly home
without going back to the Corktown. He said then, it being about a quarter to
twelve, that

I walked up King
 Street to Catherine and up Catherine to my house. I
noticed the truck in the driveway and I knew the lights in my house were on.
So, I went to the back door and went into the kitchen.

At the trial he said his answers were untrue,
that he did not walk up King Street to Catherine and up to Catherine to his house, but that he walked
“up” Walnut from the Running Pump to the Corktown.

Walnut Street ran parallel to and was east of Catherine Street. Both were intersected by King Street and by Main
 Street which was below King
 Street. Caroline Street ran parallel to Catherine Street but at some distance to the west. The Elmar Hotel was at or near
the corner of Caroline and Main
and thus northwest of Penoffio’s house which was on Augusta at the corner of Catherine. The Running Pump was north of his house
and the Corktown was south of it. His evidence at the preliminary inquiry meant
that he would be walking south from the Running Pump close to midnight to get
to his house. His evidence at trial meant that he would be walking north on Catherine Street from the Corktown to get
home. A police officer had testified at the preliminary inquiry that while
Penoffio’s house was under surveillance shortly after midnight, he had seen Penoffio walking north on Catherine Street to the house. Penoffio’s
change of testimony at the trial thus made it conform to the police officer’s
testimony at the preliminary hearing. He gave evidence that he had sought but
not obtained from a police officer a copy of his evidence at the preliminary
hearing while in custody during the first trial of the accused. He had been
arrested for failure to appear at the first trial of the accused, which had
resulted in a mistrial, and had been released after

[Page 1080]

two days on his promise to appear at the second
trial.

It must be remembered, however, that the officer
was maintaining a surveillance of Penoffio’s house after the murder was
committed, and his testimony was that he saw Penoffio walking north to his
house at about 12:10 a.m.

Again, in his evidence at trial Penoffio stated
that he had never lent the van to Matthews. This was contrary to his evidence
at the preliminary enquiry where he said the opposite. He did say at trial that
the key to the van was usually kept on a ring on a nail in the kitchen of his
house and that different persons had had access to it.

I come to Matthews’ testimony. He stated in evidence
that he watched television until about 10:30 p.m. on September 21, after which he went to bed. According to him, the
accused arrived at the house while he was watching television but they did not
speak, although Matthews knew the accused. He said Penoffio was in his bedroom
(a downstairs room) and did not join in watching television before he,
Matthews, went off to bed. He said in chief that he could not remember whether
he had seen Penoffio at the house before going to bed.

The trial judge had made an express order, of
which both Penoffio and Matthews were aware, for the exclusion of other
witnesses from the court room while evidence was being given by one of them and
that witnesses who had completed their testimony were not to speak about the
case during any recess with those who had not. Matthews’ examination in chief
had concluded at the end of a day’s hearing and, despite the judge’s order,
Penoffio spoke to Matthews during the night recess and prior to his
cross-examination. In the result, admitting that Penoffio had spoken to him,
Matthews said on cross‑examination that he had dinner with Penoffio the
evening of September 21 at the house, that he talked with the accused when the
latter arrived, that he did see Penoffio that evening before going to bed. It
appears from the record that his change of testimony to say that he

[Page 1081]

saw Penoffio that night was prompted by Penoffio
and not be any fresh remembrance.

When the police arrived at 87 Augusta and interrogated the accused,
Penoffio and Matthews, all three were taken to the police station. Neither
Penoffio nor Matthews was searched at the house or at the station for a key to
the van but only asked whether they had one, and both men were released in the
early hours of the morning.

The accused, when taken to the police station,
was questioned there as to his whereabouts from 10 p.m. on the previous
evening. Informed that the police were investigating the shooting of Rodriguez,
the accused said he was more or less stunned and told them he knew nothing
about it. Asked later if he had a key to the van, the accused gave it to them
from a table where his personal effects were laid out. About 7 a.m. two police officers returned to
interrogate him further and told him he was charged with murder. There were no
police at the house between the time of the first search thereof at about 1
a.m. and a second search at about 7 a.m. On the second search the police found a shot gun with a single
unfired shell in a paper bag in a cupboard underneath the basement stairs of
the house. Alongside it was a box of similar shells. A spent shotgun shell was
found in the back yard of the adjoining premises about fifteen feet from the
back door of Penoffio’s house.

The shotgun, found in a dismantled condition,
was allegedly the murder weapon but there were no identifying prints on it.
Prints found on the box of cartridges did not match those of the accused and no
prints were taken of Penoffio in that respect. The accused disclaimed any
knowledge of the gun or of the cupboard under the stairs. Penoffio testified
that he never kept a gun in the house, and to his knowledge Matthews did not
have a shotgun in the house.

[Page 1082]

The only identifiable print of those found on
the van was one of the deceased. Some blood was found but could not be
identified as to grouping. There were spots of blood on the clothes of the
accused, which he explained by reference to a previous altercation with others,
or to cuts which occurred in the course of his work in painting around
eavestroughs, but again they were not sufficient for identifiable grouping.

There was no identification of the driver when
the van was driven away from the scene of the crime. Although a witness, Janice
Brady, who lived next door to 87 Augusta, testified that she heard the van drive in to Penoffio’s driveway
about 12.10 a.m. in the morning of September 22, she did not see either
the van or the driver. She did say that she saw the accused and Penoffio
together in front of Penoffio’s house about 10:20 p.m. on September 21. The accused’s
evidence was that she was mistaken on this point and, equally, he contested the
evidence of Penoffio and Matthews that he had been with them in Penoffio’s
house that evening.

This is a case where any evidence as to who
committed the crime was fragile at best. Circumstantial entirely, there was in
it ground for suspicion against Penoffio and Matthews as well as against the
accused. Credibility was very central to the case against any one of them, and
how the trial judge charged on this in the light of the contradictions in
Penoffio’s evidence under oath and of the disobedience by both him and Matthews
of the trial judge’s order against discussion of the evidence are, in my
opinion, crucial to the proper disposition of this appeal.

The charge to the jury consisted of a narrative
review of the evidence, largely according to the submissions thereon made by
counsel for the Crown and by counsel for the accused, ending with the statement
“Now, members of the jury, that is the two sides as it has been presented to
you. It is for you to decide which theories to accept and which to reject and
the decision is entirely yours”. In dealing with Penoffio’s inconsistent
statements under oath and with the breach of his order to

[Page 1083]

witnesses, the trial judge did not give any
special caution to the jury but left the matters to them as going to simple
credibility. I quote all that he said in this respect:

He [the accused] was asked whether Penoffio
and Matthews had concocted their story and his answer was yes and they could
also be confused and Janice Brady also is mistaken or confused when she says
she saw Penoffio and Maxwell together that evening.

Anne Nutting, a court reporter, testified
that her shorthand notes recorded the witness Penoffio as saying at the
preliminary hearing that Maxwell wanted to borrow the truck for Tuesday whereas
Penoffio said in the witness box here that at the preliminary hearing that he
had said Sunday, not Tuesday.

Anne Nutting also testified that her notes
recorded Penoffio as saying, again at the preliminary hearing, that he had
loaned the vehicle to Matthews whereas he said from the witness box that he had
not said that at the preliminary.

Now, it is for the jury to decide whether
Penoffio was incorrectly heard by or incorrectly recorded by the reporter or
whether he did in fact say Tuesday and not Sunday and that he did in fact say
that he loaned the vehicle to Matthews at the preliminary hearing. It is for
you to say who was in error, whether it is the reporter or whether it is
Penoffio, and if you find that Penoffio is indeed in error as to whether he
said those things at the preliminary, what effects, if any it is to have on his
credibility. These are matters for you to weigh and you should consider, of
course, whether people are making honest mistakes or deliberately misquoting,
and if they are making honest mistakes, in any event, whether there is
something wrong with their ability to recollect. These are matters for you to
take into account; whether or not they are reliable.

Something that is worthy of some comment,
though, is the fact that during the evidence of Penoffio I made an order
excluding witnesses from the court room and that order goes on—it was read by
the Clerk to advise those who have testified not to speak about the case to
those who have not. Now in spite of that order, Penoffio, it appears, spoke to
Robert Matthews during the night recess. In other words, while Matthews was
still in the course of giving his evidence and the next day Matthews gave
different testimony than he had the night before.

[Page 1084]

. .
.

He gave evidence before the recess for the
evening to the effect that he did not know if he saw Penoffio at 87 Augusta Street before he, Matthews, went
to bed on the evening of September 21st, and he indicated that he went to bed
about 10.30. The following day, he said, “after dinner I think Penoffio went to
have a sleep and I saw him again about 10.00 or 10.30 for about 15 minutes”. So
the change in his evidence was from not remembering whether he had seen
Penoffio to saying that he saw him for about 15 minutes between 10.00 and 10.30
and he went on to say that Dwight Maxwell was there when he was talking to
Penoffio in that fifteen minute period or, when he saw him for 15 minutes and
then he admitted that he had spoken to Penoffio last night—which would be
during the recess—about my evidence and Penoffio reminded me that I had seen
him before I went to bed.

Now, of course, the purpose of an order
excluding witnesses is to avoid the possibility of the evidence of one witness
being contaminated, as it were, or improperly influenced by hearing what other
witnesses have to say. Nevertheless, it is for you to say what effect the
failure to abide by my order has on the credibility of either Matthews or Penoffio.
As has already been submitted by counsel for the Crown, if they were planning
to concoct a story it is conceivable that they would have concocted it long
before the recess during which Penoffio spoke to Matthews, but there are
arguments both ways in the matter and it does not follow because one or both of
them failed to abide by the order, that you should automatically rule out the
evidence, but it is a matter for you to consider and I brought that to your
attention and you have heard from both counsel as to the views that you should
take.

Obviously the order is made for a purpose
and that is to prevent contamination from the receiving of suggestions and
there is not any doubt that the evidence of Matthews was so affected by what
Penoffio did. Whether he is to be believed is another matter and that is for
you to decide.

II

In my opinion, the trial judge’s charge to the
jury was inadequate, both as regards Penoffio and Matthews. There was
non-direction amounting to misdirection in respect of these two witnesses,
whose testimony was central to the Crown’s case against the accused. I say this
not only because

[Page 1085]

they were witnesses who may be said to have had
an interest in exculpating themselves at the expense of the accused, but
because their interest was associated with testimonial improprieties so as to
call for a clear caution against receiving and weighing their evidence by the
same standards applicable to an independent witness.

I should note, before proceeding to a discussion
of the relevant authorities, that the trial judge, although mentioning
Penoffio’s inconsistent statements and his breach of the trial judge’s order as
to out-of-court exchanges between witnesses, did not mention Penoffio’s failure
to appear at the first trial of the accused which ended in a mistrial.

One further matter deserves attention at this
point. The fact that counsel for the accused, in addressing the jury, may have
urged them not to accept the evidence of one or more key Crown witnesses is no
substitute for a necessary direction by the trial judge as to the caution with
which such evidence should be viewed where, as here, the circumstances and
evidence call for it. As Cartwright J. put it in Binet v. The Queen[1], at p. 54, (a case to which I will
return later), “I do not think that the circumstance that counsel for the
defence stressed the fact of the conflicting statements having been made in any
way absolved the learned trial judge from the duty of dealing with them”.

Counsel drew the attention of this Court to a line
of cases in England, e.g. R. v. Prater[2], and R. v. Russell[3], which speak of the desirability of
giving the warning against uncorroborated evidence where a witness may be
regarded as having some purpose of his own to serve, subject however to
application of the proviso as to no miscarriage of justice if such a direction
to the jury was

[Page 1086]

omitted. Lord Hailsham, in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Kilbourne[4] at
p. 447, expressly approved of the desirability of such a direction but there
appears to have been a recession in respect of its desirability, at least where
the self interest of a Crown witness is patent: see R. v. Whitaker[5].

However, judgments in this country have been
quite clear that the accomplice warning is not a requirement nor does it render
a jury verdict vulnerable if not given in respect of a witness who may be said
to have an interest of his own to serve but is not himself an accomplice: see R.
v. Dutrisac[6]. The
trial judge is not absolved, however, from the duty, measured by the particular
circumstances before him, of drawing the jury’s attention to a witness who may
be serving his own interests at the expense of an accused and of counselling
caution in weighing his evidence.

The present case, as I have already noted, goes
beyond the circumstances of a Crown witness affected by self-interest,
involving as it does a Crown witness who has also made prior inconsistent
statements under oath on a vital issue. As to such a witness, the proper
direction should be as indicated in Binet v. The Queen, supra. The
difference of opinion among the members of the Court in that case lay only in
whether (as the majority thought) there should be a new trial or whether (as
the minority of Cartwright J., as he then was, Rand J. concurring, thought)
there should be an acquittal. Cartwright J. said this (at p. 54):

The learned trial judge warned the jury in
terms to which no exception is taken of the danger of convicting on the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice but he failed to give them any direction
in regard to the fact that Giroux had on two previous occasions made statements
on oath which were in direct conflict with the evidence which he had given at
the trial on a vital point.

I respectfully agree with Barclay and Hyde
JJ. that, in the circumstances of this case, the omission to direct

[Page 1087]

the jury in this regard was an error in law
so serious as to require that the conviction be quashed. I do not find it
necessary to refer to all the authorities which were discussed by counsel. I am
in respectful agreement with Hyde J. that the applicable rule is correctly
stated by Errol McDougall J. who gave the judgment of the majority in Rex v.
Stack and Pytell [1947] 3 D.L.R. 747 at 762; 88 Can. C.C. 310 at 327 in
the following words:

Where the testimony of a principal Crown
witness is in direct conflict with a prior sworn statement made by him the
trial Judge must caution the jury in the strongest terms with respect to the
danger of accepting his evidence, and the failure to do so will necessitate a
new trial, notwithstanding that the trial Judge properly instructed the jury
with respect to the evidence of such witness in the event that they concluded
that he was an accomplice.

This principle was followed in R. v. Dutrisac,
supra, a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal and, earlier, by the same
Court in R. v. Rosenberg[7].

Two other judgments of this Court deserve
reference in respect of what was said in the Binet case. They are Lucas
v. The Queen[8], and
Rustad v. The Queen[9]. I
should note first that the majority in Binet, speaking very briefly
through Taschereau J., as he then was, said at p. 52, that they agreed with
Cartwright J. “that the learned trial judge failed properly to instruct the
jury on the great danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured
accomplice on a vital issue”. However, it is clear from the reasons of
Cartwright J. that the duty of a trial judge in respect of an accomplice who
had made inconsistent statements under oath on a vital issue was not only to
give the jury the usual warning as to corroboration, if they found that the
witness was an accomplice, but also to give them a caution in the strongest
terms of the danger of accepting his evidence. This was entirely apart from the
witness’ position as a possible accomplice, and I take Taschereau J.’s
statement of agreement with Cartwright J. as referring to the position of the
witness whether or not he be an

[Page 1088]

accomplice. The two Ontario cases above-mentioned proceed on this basis.

In the Lucas case, involving a charge of
murder, Kerwin C.J.C. considered Binet in the following passage of his
reasons (at p. 10):

I reject the submission of counsel for the
appellant that it was error in law on the part of the learned trial Judge not
to charge in accordance with Binet v. The Queen, [1954] S.C.R 52,
to the effect that there is great danger in accepting the evidence of an
admittedly perjured accomplice on a vital issue. Thomas was not an accomplice.
There was a mass of evidence pointing to the accused which makes it impossible
to find, as counsel submitted, that the evidence of Thomas was on a vital
issue, and finally, there was much evidence in the record which did corroborate
Thomas. The matter was left to the jury as one of weight and credibility and,
in my opinion, correctly so.

It is enough to distinguish Lucas from
the present case that in Lucas the witness, in respect of whose evidence
the omission of a caution of danger in acting upon it was urged as an error of
law, was found not to have given evidence on a vital issue. Cartwright J., who
dissented in the Lucas case, recognized this difference from Binet but
was prepared to carry Binet further as is evident from the following
portion of his reasons (at pp. 20-21):

I agree with the submission of counsel for
the appellant that it was the duty of the learned trial Judge to warn the jury
of the danger of accepting the evidence of Thomas in view of his admitted
perjury and of his bad record. Counsel for the appellant cited a number of
authorities. I will refer only to the following:

In R. v. Stack & Pytell (1946),
88 Can. C.C. 320 at p. 337,
[1947] 3 D.L.R. 747 at p. 762, Errol McDougall, J., giving the judgment of the
majority of the Court of Queen’s Bench, said:

Where the testimony of a principal Crown
witness is in direct conflict with a prior sworn statement made by him the
trial Judge must caution the jury in the strongest terms with respect to the
danger of accept-

[Page 1089]

ing his evidence, and the failure to do so
will necessitate a new trial, notwithstanding that the trial Judge properly
instructed the jury with respect to the evidence of such witness in the event
that they concluded that he was an accomplice.

This passage was approved by Rand, J., and
myself in Binet v. The Queen, [1954] S.C.R. 52 at p. 54, and I do
not read the judgment of the majority delivered by Taschereau, J., as casting
doubt upon it. The Court was unanimous in quashing the conviction; the
difference of opinion was as to whether there should be a new trial or a
directed verdict of acquittal. The Binet case is distinguishable from
the case at bar on the grounds that there is nothing to indicate that Thomas
was an accomplice in the murder of Crater and that his evidence was not direct
evidence on the vital issue as to who was the murderer. Thomas’ evidence was
however as to circumstances which, if it were believed, would weigh heavily
with the jury.

In short, as is also evident from his reference
to R. v. Ferguson[10], again
a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Cartwright J. felt that the warning
approved in Binet should also apply in respect of a disreputable
witness. He noted too that Kerwin J., as he then was, had agreed in his reasons
in Deacon v. The King[11], at
p. 536 with a passage from the Ferguson case to the above effect.

I am not required in this case to consider the
proposed extension by Cartwright J. of the kind of warning which Binet requires
in the case of a witness who gives inconsistent statements under oath on a
vital issue. Penoffio is not in the position of the witness in Lucas but
is in the position of the witness in Binet, apart from the accomplice
element.

Rustad v. The
Queen was concerned, inter alia, with the correctness or
acceptability of the trial judge’s charge as it concerned two witnesses who in
statements to the police prior to trial, statements not made under oath, had
failed to mention that the accused had told them that she had killed

[Page 1090]

the deceased. One of the witnesses, who
testified under oath at an inquest, did not mention the accused’s admission at
that time. The witnesses did give evidence as to the admission at the trial.
The trial judge in a long and detailed charge (which I have read) did not
caution the jury in the strong terms required under the Binet rule.
Ritchie J., who delivered the judgment of this Court (Cartwright J. being among
those who agreed with him) said this on the point (at p. 560):

Although it is true that Mr. Justice
McInnes would have been justified in using stronger language to describe the
weaknesses inherent in the evidence of both these witnesses, I am none the less
of opinion that he said enough to indicate that in weighing their evidence the
jury should give serious consideration to the inconsistencies in
Mrs. Shannon’s statements and to the failure of both women to come forward
with their stories at an earlier date. I think that the theory of the defence
that these two witnesses were unworthy of belief was expressed in the judge’s
charge with sufficient clarity to comply with the requirements indicated by this
Court in Deacon v. The King, and in the other cases referred to
in the reasons for judgment delivered by Sheppard J.A. on behalf of the
majority of the Court of Appeal. I would not quash the conviction on this
ground, but there are more serious omissions which require consideration.

In the result, the conviction of manslaughter
was set aside and a new trial directed on that charge because of the trial
judge’s failure to give proper direction to the jury as to the effect of the
accused’s intoxication on the truth or falsehood of the alleged incriminating
admissions to the two witnesses.

It may be that, in view of the order for a new
trial and the grounds on which it was put, the admissions were wrapped up in
the intoxication and hence the charge was defective in that composite context.
Furthermore, the charge to the jury in the Rustad case was much more
detailed and comprehensive than the charge in the present case and carried
caution even though not explicitly stated. The same observation may be made
about the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Agawa and
Mallet[12]. Martin
J.A. who spoke for the Court said this (at p. 394):

[Page 1091]

The learned trial Judge put the defence of
each of the appellants fully and with exemplary fairness to the jury. In the
course of his charge he reviewed the evidence given by each of the inmate
witnesses, previously referred to, and in so doing, almost invariably drew the
jury’s intention to the fact that the criminal record of the witness was filed
as an exhibit and referred to the previous contradictory statements made by
some of the witnesses at the preliminary hearing.

In the present case the inmate witnesses
were in no way associated with the commission of the offence, and it was not
incumbent upon the trial Judge to charge the jury that it was dangerous to act
upon their uncorroborated evidence because of their bad character: R. v.
Bouffard, [1964] 2 O.R. 111 at p. 127, [1964] 3 C.C.C. 14 at p. 30, 43
C.R. 124. Nor was such a direction required because of their possible motive to
obtain clemency, nor, in all the circumstances, by reason of the fact that they
had made contradictory statements on oath at the preliminary hearing: R. v.
Dutrisac, [1971] 3 O.R. 412 at pp. 417-8, 4 C.C.C. (2d) 13 at pp. 19-20,
15 C.R.N.S. 15; Lucas v. The Queen, [1963] 1 C.C.C. 1 at p. 10,
[1963] S.C.R. vi, 39 C.R. 101.

Although I do not doubt that there are
cases where the trial Judge should, as a matter of prudence, direct the jury to
view the evidence of a witness with caution, for example, because of his
unsavoury character, motives of self-interest, or previous contradictory
statements, here, in my view, considering the trial Judge’s charge in its
entirety, the jury were adequately directed with respect to the matters that
should be considered in assessing the credibility of the inmate witnesses.

When one turns to the reasons of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in the Rustad[13]
case, delivered by Sheppard J., Norris J.A. concurring, and also by Davey
J.A. to the same result (dismissal of the appeal from conviction of
manslaughter), there is a difference in view between the two sets of reasons as
to the effect of Binet, and I wish to refer to it.

Mr. Justice Sheppard treated the Binet case
as if it concerned the proper instruction to be given to the jury only in the
case of a perjured accomplice;

[Page 1092]

and, since the witness who had given
inconsistent statements both prior to trial and also under oath was not an
accomplice, the Binet warning was unnecessary. Again, he rejected case
law in England to the effect
that a witness who has given inconsistent statements may be regarded as
negligible, pointing out that that view was rejected by this Court in Deacon
v. The King[14]. The
Deacon case is not germane here because it concerned a Crown witness who
was declared adverse and consequently open to be examined by the Crown on
previous inconsistent statements. Although a trial judge could properly draw
attention to this on the issue of credibility, it afforded no ground for
obliging him to direct the jury to discount the evidence of the witness.

I take no issue here with what the Deacon case
held, but I do not think that Sheppard J.A. properly assessed the Binet case.
Indeed, he appears in his reasons to have ignored, as not having any materiality,
the inconsistency of statements made under oath and to have treated the case
before him as if it concerned only prior statements by the witnesses made to
police officers. He said this (at p. 338):

As the evidence of Mrs. Shannon and
the effect thereon of her prior statements are matters of weight and
credibility for the jury, the nondirection can be misdirection only if it
failed to comply with Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495
at p. 497, where Taschereau, J. said:

The rule which has been laid down, and
consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding Judge must, except
in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts
of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may
appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be
applied to the facts as they find them.

. .
.

The previous statements of
Mrs. Shannon are no part of the theory of defence but under the
circumstances of

[Page 1093]

this case are at the most a detail of
evidence or argument. This accused called no evidence and the learned trial
Judge instructed the jury as to the onus being on the Crown, the presumption of
innocence and as to those facts of which the Crown must assume the onus as
necessary to constitute the offence charged and the included offence of
manslaughter.

Davey J.A. was of the opinion that the Binet case
did not lay down any general rule of law or of practice and, moreover, he did
not see any disagreement between the majority and minority in that case on what
Cartwright J. had said in quoting from the reasons of Errol McDougall J. in R.
v. Stack and Pytell. He viewed Taschereau J.’s reasons for the
majority to rest not upon the fact that the impugned Crown witness who gave
perjured evidence was an accomplice but rather that the required direction in
that case applied to all perjurers who gave vital evidence, whether accomplices
or not. This, as I already noted, is also my assessment of the majority’s
reasons in Binet.

Davey J.A. referred also to Cartwright J.’s
reasons in Lucas, which I have quoted, and to the cases mentioned in
those reasons and felt that the rationale upon which Binet was decided
was reflected in them. He summed up as follows:

From these authorities it seems to me that
the obligation to give such a direction arises not from a distinct rule of law
or of practice, but from the obligation resting upon a trial Judge under Azoulay
v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, and Kelsey v. The
Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220, to review the substantial parts of the
evidence, and to give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may
appreciate the value and effect of the evidence, and how the law is to be
applied to the facts as they find them; and to present clearly to the jury the pivotal
questions upon which the defence stands; and that, although it is not necessary
that the trial Judge should review all the facts, it is not sufficient that the
whole of the evidence be left to the jury in bulk for examination.

From that it follows that the need for such
an instruction must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case and
the nature of the defence. A trial Judge

[Page 1094]

ought to point to all substantial
weaknesses in the Crown’s case. Where a principal ground of defence is the
unreliability of the Crown’s evidence, and the vital evidence is that of a self‑confessed
perjurer, whether an accomplice or not, I do not see how such a defence can be
adequately put to the jury without warning the jury of the danger of convicting
on such evidence, for the witness by his conduct has shown he has no respect
for his oath, and he is just as likely to be lying at the trial as on the
earlier occasion. Such was the case of Binet v. The Queen. The
same need arises, although perhaps not in the same degree, in the case of a
witness who has made previous contradictory statements not under oath upon a
vital point, or whose record shows him to be untrustworthy. Where the evidence
is not upon a vital point, or there is a substantial body of other evidence
implicating the prisoner, or where there is an explanation for the previous
untruthful statement, the nature of the instruction will vary according to the
circumstances; it must be sufficient to enable the jury to appreciate the value
and effect of the evidence in the light of the theory of the defence; it must
present to the jury the pivotal questions upon which the defence stands. If
judicial experience shows that it is dangerous to convict upon such testimony
the jury ought to be so told. If the circumstances are such as to allow the
defence and the evidence to be fairly put to the jury without giving the
warning, the warning need not be given.

Where a plausible explanation is given at
the trial for the previous contradictory statements, whether under oath or not,
it may be sufficient to leave the defence to the jury along with the salient
points touching the conflicting statements and the explanation without any
warning and allow the jury to say whether it is satisfied with the Crown’s
evidence at the trial and the explanation for the previous conflicting
statements, if in the opinion of the trial Judge the jury might safely convict
on that evidence. A jury ought not to be told there is danger in convicting on
such evidence, if in fact there is none.

In my view, whether what was said in Binet to
be a necessary direction arises from the nature of the circumstances and from
the nature of the defence, as Davey J.A. would have it, or is required as a
matter of law or practice, as in the two Ontario cases which applied Binet, the present

[Page 1095]

case, on its facts, exhibits a strong need for
that direction.

The defence here was that it was not the accused
but more likely Penoffio who killed the deceased. So far as motive was
concerned, it was Penoffio who had one, not the accused. The conflict in their
evidence was striking. The van was a vital link in the murder. Penoffio
testified that he gave the van to the accused about an hour or less before the
murder after they had gone out in it together. This was in contradiction to the
accused’s evidence that he had taken the van from the house to go looking for
Penoffio when he did not find him at home and had returned it to Penoffio’s
driveway about an hour before the murder.

The accused, Penoffio and Matthews were all at
87 Augusta when the police
came, and the van was then parked in the driveway. Penoffio gave unexplained
contradictory evidence as to his whereabouts at the material time; one version,
at the preliminary hearing, would have left him out on the street, without an
alibi, at the time of the murder; the other, at the trial, established
consistency with police evidence as to his whereabouts shortly after the murder
but that is all. In either case, he would have had easy access to the van.

There was again an unexplained contradiction
(the Court reporter had to be called when Penoffio denied what he said at the
preliminary enquiry) as to his story of the accused’s request to borrow the
van, first saying Tuesday and then, at the trial, Sunday. Moreover, Penoffio
testified at the trial that he had only allowed the accused to borrow the van
when he had said at the preliminary enquiry that Matthews used it. Once again
the Court reporter was called to verify this when Penoffio first denied it in
testifying at the trial.

These were all vital matters and the jury was
entitled to find that Penoffio was a perjured witness and should have been
warned in the terms

[Page 1096]

approved in Binet in such situations. Of
course, the required warning need not follow any precise formula (I think this
emerges from the reasons of this Court in the Rustad case), so long as
the trial judge makes it quite clear to the jury that it is dangerous for them
to act on the evidence of the inconsistent witness given on a vital issue,
especially when, as here, it is the evidence of that witness alone or of that
witness and an associate, Matthews, both possible suspects, that purports to
ensnare the accused. In short, since Penoffio’s evidence was central to the
Crown’s case, the trial judge would have been justified in stressing that there
was very great danger in acting upon it, especially when, in addition to the
inconsistencies in his evidence, Penoffio deliberately ignored the trial
judge’s order prohibiting out-of-court exchanges with other witnesses and
influenced Matthews to change his testimony.

Nothing approaching such a caution is found in
the trial judge’s charge. Indeed, the trial judge failed to bring into account,
when he talked of the contradictions in Penoffio’s evidence, the contradiction
in his evidence as to the direction in which he was walking the night of the
murder. Again, the trial judge failed to deal adequately with Matthews’
evidence on whether he actually saw or did not see Penoffio when the accused
arrived at the house at about 10:30 p.m. on September 21.

The breach of the trial judge’s order as to
communication between witnesses is a separate ground upon which a caution
should have been given to the jury in acting upon evidence of a witness who so
readily changed his testimony at the behest of a fellow witness to make it
conform to the latter’s evidence. It was conceded by Crown counsel that the
trial judge should have but did not tell the jury that they should act on a
witness’s own recollection and not on what the witness was told by another.
Indeed, evidence which is not that of the witness’s own independent
recollection of

[Page 1097]

what he is testifying to would not likely be
admissible: cf. R. v. Muise[15],
at p. 497. The trial judge’s charge got close to this issue but, in my
opinion, it did not sufficiently put the jury on guard against believing
Matthews on the vital question of the whereabouts of the accused at the time of
the murder.

Matthews’ first version that he could not
remember seeing Penoffio in the house at 10:30 p.m. when he, Matthews, went to bed was consistent with the accused’s
evidence on the point. Matthews’ change of testimony resulted in the
corroborating of Penoffio and contradicting the accused.

I am not concerned here with any issue of the
admissibility of Matthews’ evidence. In so far as he gave inconsistent
statements under oath on a vital issue, the rule of the Binet case would
apply equally to him as to Penoffio. In so far as he was involved in a breach
of the trial judge’s order, barring communication between witnesses, the trial
judge was not required to exclude his evidence (see the authorities cited in Dobberthien
v. The Queen[16], but
was obliged, when sitting with a jury, to tell them to receive the evidence
with caution when it was changed by reason of breach of the trial judge’s order
and related to a vital issue. If there had not been such a relation, the charge
could be considered as passable; see Lucas v. The Queen[17], at p. 10.

I think it important, in concluding these
reasons, that I stress two points. The first concerns an understanding of what
is a vital issue where a suspect has given contradictory statements under oath
in testifying for the Crown against the accused so as to call for a caution to
the jury against accepting inculpating evidence given by that witness. The
requirement of such a caution is not limited to cases where the witness has
given direct evidence. Where, as here, the evidence

[Page 1098]

against the accused is circumstantial only (and,
indeed, fragile), it is wrong to regard vital issues as being ultimate ones
only, such as an issue of identity, and to absolve the trial judge of giving
the caution merely because the Crown witness did not testify directly as to
identity. The witness could not perforce do so when the entire case against the
accused is built upon circumstantial evidence. Binet was a case where
there was evidence of an eye witness, but this cannot mean that a vital issue
must be defined only in terms of direct evidence so as to call in such cases
only for a caution against accepting the evidence of a witness who has given
inconsistent statements under oath.

Where substantially the only evidence against an
accused is that of witnesses who are themselves suspect, or have interests of
their own to serve, and it is circumstantial only, vital issues must be viewed
in the light of these facts and hence must be taken to relate to evidence that
establishes a crucial link in the chain of circumstances upon which the
allegation of culpability of the accused rests. The Lucas case does not
conflict with this view when regard is had to its quite different facts,
especially to the fact that the case against the accused did not depend (as it
does here) on the evidence of a questionable Crown witness.

The second point that deserves emphasis relates
to the breach of the trial judge’s order against out of Court exchanges between
witnesses who have not yet testified or have not yet concluded their testimony.
It is true that the trial judge, when making the order, expressed doubt that
all witnesses or potential witnesses had heard it. Penoffio was testifying when
the order was made, and whether or not Matthews was aware of it is, in my view,
irrelevant to the damaging effect of Matthews’ change of testimony when prompted
by Penoffio during the night recess before he, Matthews, returned to the
witness stand the next day. The deliberate breach of the order by Penoffio
required more of the trial judge than a charge that the matter was one of
credibility only, as if Pen-

[Page 1099]

offio and Matthews were impartial and
uncontaminated witnesses.

Moreover, Matthews did not say that he was
unaware of the trial judge’s order. He was asked this on cross-examination:

You had heard the instructions given by his
Lordship that you should not speak to anyone with respect to this case after
you left this Courtroom and before I cross‑examined you?

and his answer was:

It was kind of confusing afterward, I
thought.

When this is coupled with the fact that his
change of testimony resulted in his giving Penoffio’s recollection and not his
own on an issue as to the whereabouts of the accused and of Penoffio prior to
the murder, a vital issue in the chain of circumstances, the need for a strong
caution to the jury with respect to the acceptance of Matthews’ evidence is to
me unquestionable.

In fine, this case exhibits three circumstances
which, if not separately, then certainly in their cumulative effect called for
a strong caution by the trial judge to the jury against accepting the evidence
upon which the Crown’s case was founded. There was, first, the self-interest of
Penoffio and Matthews in exculpating themselves at the expense of the accused;
second, the inconsistent, contradictory statements under oath on vital issues;
and third, the breach of the trial judge’s explicit order against out of Court
exchanges involving witnesses who had yet to testify or who had not concluded
their testimony. The caution was especially necessary when there was no
independent evidence corroborative of the testimony of the tainted witnesses.

In view of the serious defects in the charge to
the jury, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and direct a new
trial.

[Page 1100]

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario dismissing the appellant’s
appeal from his conviction at trial before Mr. Justice O’Leary sitting
with a jury on a charge of having murdered one Maurice Rodriguez.

The Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to
give any recorded reasons for its decision which was a unanimous one and which
is now appealed to this Court on the limited grounds stipulated in the order
granting leave to appeal.

I have had the privilege of reading the reasons
for judgment prepared for delivery by the Chief Justice in which he has
reviewed the evidence in such detail as to make it unnecessary for me to do
more than recapitulate the salient facts in skeletal form.

The victim of this murder was shot while in a
parking lot separating the Town Manor hotel from the Elmar hotel in the City of
Hamilton at approximately 11:50 p.m. on the 21st of September, 1974. At about
this time the sound of a loud noise, like a shot or backfire, attracted the
attention of a passerby to the parking lot where he saw a man running to and
entering a brown or copper-coloured van with lettering on its side which he
later identified from a photograph as bearing the name of “Barber Appliance
Services”. On entering the parking lot, this witness found the body of the
victim lying on the ground with a gun shot wound in his neck which proved to be
a fatal injury. The van had been parked about five feet from where the body was
found and a man was seen running towards it and entering the driver’s side
although leaving the door ajar. Two other witnesses testified that they had
observed the van leaving the parking lot and one of them was able to take what
he thought was the number of the licence plate. I agree with the Chief Justice
that the driver of the van at this time was undoubtedly the murderer and I feel
that the identity of this individual is the pivotal or vital question in the
determination of this case. In this regard the evidence is indeed

[Page 1101]

inconsistent with any other rational conclusion
than that the perpetrator of the crime was the man who ran from the body and
entered the marked van.

I am also satisfied from the evidence that the
van was as its label indicates the property of Barber Appliance Services, a
firm with headquarters at Brantford and that on the evening in question, it was
in the custody of one Penoffio, who was the Hamilton manager of that firm and
who had left his own vehicle in the hands of the owner of the firm in exchange
for the use of the van.

Penoffio lived in a house at 87 Augusta Street
in Hamilton which was also occupied by a friend named Matthews and where the
accused was visiting on the evening in question. It was in the parking area
adjacent to Penoffio’s house that the brown van was found by the police shortly
after the shooting, and at that time the house was occupied by the accused,
Penoffio and one Matthews who appears to have stayed in the house all evening
listening to the television, drinking beer and sleeping. Penoffio and the
accused gave different versions of their activities during the evening and
these are accurately summarized in the reasons for judgment of the Chief
Justice. Both men were obviously potential suspects, but neither told a story
putting the other in the Elmar hotel parking lot at the fatal hour.

The Crown’s case depends almost entirely on
circumstantial evidence although in so far as the statements of the accused and
Penoffio are self-serving, they are entirely dependent upon the jury’s
assessment of their respective credibility.

The trial judge gave full and adequate
instructions on the manner in which circumstantial evidence should be treated
by the jury and it is not for a second Court of Appeal to enter upon the task
of reassessing the credibility of witnesses. I am satisfied that this is a case
where the jury’s verdict must stand unless it can be shown that

[Page 1102]

there was error on the part of the trial judge
in the instructions which he gave in his charge.

The order granting leave to appeal to this Court
limits our considerations to but two such alleged errors in the judge’s charge.
It appears to me to be convenient to consider them separately.

The first alleged error was “in failing
to caution the jury on the unreliability of the witness Matthews who changed
his testimony after discussing it overnight with the witness, Penoffio, in
breach of the trial judge’s direction forbidding any such discussion”.

In the course of the trial, the learned judge
made an order directing that all witnesses should be excluded from the court
room when they were not testifying and directing further that there should be
no communication between one witness and another who had not completed his
testimony.

It will be seen that the first question upon
which leave to appeal was granted is concerned with the failure of the trial
judge to caution the jury as to the unreliability of the witness Matthews
arising in part from his breach of the judge’s direction forbidding discussions
between witnesses and in part from the subsequent change of his evidence.

In my respectful opinion, this question can only
be answered in the affirmative on the ground that the witness Matthews knew or
ought to have known that the judge had given the direction therein referred to
and if it can be made to appear that the change in his testimony reflected
directly on the guilt or innocence of the accused, i.e. on the question of his
whereabouts at approximately 11:50 p.m. on the evening in question.

The trial judge’s order containing a direction
referred to in this question was made while Penoffio was still giving evidence,
but his own statement makes it more than doubtful whether the witness Matthews
was within earshot when that order was made. In this regard, the learned judge
said at the conclusion of Matthews’ evidence:

[Page 1103]

The words that passed between this witness
and a prior witness would be in contravention of the order made excluding
witnesses, the general order, but unfortunately I do not know whether the
witnesses heard that original order. They were already absent from the court
room and I do not know whether there is any loud speaker that relays that order
to the witnesses. It is perhaps a failing of communication.

Counsel for the defence then observed that
“Penoffio knew he shouldn’t be speaking to anybody that still has to give
evidence” and the trial judge then observed:

All the witnesses, we presume, know that,
but I wonder has a message gotten through to them. There is the order excluding
witnesses and that contains the further admonition not to discuss the evidence,
but it might be wise if a written copy of the order could be placed in the
witness room so the witnesses will be aware that there is a direct order that
they are not to discuss the evidence with someone who is still testifying or
still has not testified, so I am going to ask the Clerk to make sure that a
copy of the order that was made be placed in the witness room because I know
most of the witnesses, if not all of them, were absent from the court room when
the order was made. (The italics are my own.)

In view of this circumstance, I do not think
that the trial judge can be said to have been in error in failing to instruct
the jury as to the unreliability of Matthews’ evidence on account of his having
acted in breach of an order, the existence of which may well have been unknown
to him.

The change made in Matthews’ evidence after his
discussion with Penoffio is accurately summarized in the reasons for judgment
by the Chief Justice where he says:

Matthews’ first version that he could not
remember seeing Penoffio in the house at 10.30 p.m. when he, Matthews,
went to bed was consistent with the accused’s evidence on the point. Matthews’
change of testimony resulted in the corroborating of Penoffio and contradicting
the accused.

In my opinion, this change had no direct bearing
on the whereabouts of Maxwell at the time when the murder was committed, its
sole effect being to

[Page 1104]

support the evidence given by Penoffio as
against that of the accused.

For all the above reasons and with the greatest
respect for those who may entertain a different view, I am of opinion that the
first question posed in the order granting leave should be answered in the
negative and that there was no need for a further caution as to Matthews’ testimony
which was adequately summarized by the trial judge when he said:

So the change in his evidence was from not
remembering whether he had seen Penoffio to saying that he saw him for about 15
minutes between 10:00 and 10:30 and he went on to say that Dwight Maxwell was
there when he was talking to Penoffio in that fifteen minute period or, when he
saw him for 15 minutes... 

In so far as the changed version of Matthews’
evidence placed Maxwell and Penoffio in and around 87 Augusta Street at between
10:00 and 10:30 p.m., it is corroborated by the evidence of Janice Brady who
saw the two men together outside the house at about 10:20 p.m. I cannot
think that a change from saying “I cannot remember” to saying “I have now been
reminded” gives rise to such an inconsistency as to require a special caution
by the trial judge in addressing the jury.

The second alleged error specified in the
order granting leave to appeal is, however, concerned with the evidence of
Penoffio and raises the question of whether the learned trial judge was in
error in “failing to caution the jury on the unreliability of the evidence of
Penoffio who, inter alia, had made previous contradictory statements
under oath”.

There is no doubt that Penoffio’s evidence and
his conduct showed him to be an undesirable and untrustworthy character. In the
first place, Penoffio undoubtedly heard the order containing the judge’s
direction not to communicate with witnesses and he deliberately disobeyed.
Furthermore, he gave contradictory evidence under oath in the manner outlined
in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice, and lastly, he showed his
distaste for this whole proceeding by absenting himself from the first trial of
Maxwell making it necessary to

[Page 1105]

issue a warrant for his arrest before he
appeared at the second trial.

All these matters undoubtedly indicate that
Penoffio was unreliable but this is not a case like Binet v. The
Queen[18] where
a witness had sworn an affidavit before trial to the effect that the accused
was in no way involved in the crime of assault with which he was charged and
then appeared at the trial and having been sworn gave evidence that the accused
was a direct participant. The evidence at trial was not given until after the
witness had himself been convicted of the offence with which both had been
charged and tried separately. There can be no doubt that in the Binet case
the witness was an accomplice and a perjurer and it was on this ground that
this Court found “that the learned trial judge failed properly to instruct the
jury on the great danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured
accomplice on a vital issue”. The distinction between that case and the present
is that there was no suggestion that Penoffio was an accomplice, it being on
the contrary urged that he was a suspect. Furthermore, there is here, in my
opinion, only one “vital issue” which concerns the identity of the driver of
the van at the time of the murder and upon this question Penoffio gave no
evidence whatever, and while it can be said that he perjured himself, his
perjury was not concerned with the single question which lies at the root of
this whole case.

The circumstances here bear a close similarity
to those which Chief Justice Kerwin was dealing with in the case of Lucas v.
The Queen[19] as
appears from the following passage which has already been quoted in the reasons
for judgment of the present Chief Justice:

I reject the submission of counsel for the
appellant that it was error in law on the part of the learned trial Judge not
to charge in accordance with Binet v. The Queen, [1954] S.C.R.
52, to the effect that there is great danger in accepting the evidence of an
admittedly per-

[Page 1106]

jured accomplice on a vital issue. Thomas
was not an accomplice. There was a mass of evidence pointing to the accused
which makes it impossible to find, as counsel submitted, that the evidence of
Thomas was on a vital issue, and finally, there was much evidence in the record
which did corroborate Thomas. The matter was left to the jury as one of weight
and credibility and, in my opinion, correctly so.

The case of Rustad v. The Queen[20] is to the same effect. It is
contended that these cases are distinguishable from the present one on the
ground that in the Lucas case it was found that the question of evidence
did not relate to a vital issue, but it will be apparent from what I have
already said that I consider it to be plain that the identity of the man who
entered the van in the hotel parking lot is the only vital issue in this case
and, as I am satisfied that the evidence of Penoffio did not relate either
directly or indirectly to this question, I am of opinion that the learned trial
judge was guilty of no error in failing to give more instruction than he did in
respect to that witness.

As I have indicated, this case must turn in
great measure on circumstantial evidence and in this regard it appears to me
that one of the most striking circumstances is that the accused himself stated
that he had picked up the key of the van when waiting for Penoffio in his house
at about 10:00 p.m., whereas Penoffio states that he gave the key to the
accused when they were together in a tavern a short time later. Either story
would mean that the accused was in possession of the key enabling him to drive
the van some time before the murder took place, and there is no evidence that
the key was in anybody else’s possession until the police arrived at Augusta
Street shortly after the killing when it was found to be in the accused’s
pocket. The accused’s evidence was that he did not leave the house from
slightly before 11:00 p.m. until after the police arrived. If this were true,
it would mean that he was not the driver of the van when it left the parking
lot at 11:50 p.m. and therefore not the man who shot Rodriguez, but it

[Page 1107]

is obvious that the jury did not believe him
and, as I have said, I am not prepared to substitute my view of this witness’
evidence for that of the jury.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Murder — Motive not proven as part of Crown's
case nor absence of motive proven by defence — Whether trial judge erred in
failing to define ""motive"" and in failing to direct jury as to that
concept — No error on part of trial judge in circumstances of case.

The appellant Lewis and one Santa Singh Tatlay were
jointly charged with the murder of Parmjeet K. Sidhu, Tatlay's daughter, and,
under a separate count, with the murder of Gurmail Singh Sidhu, her husband.
The instrument which caused the deaths was an electric kettle rigged with
dynamite in such a manner as to explode when plugged into an electric outlet.
The kettle was sent to the couple by mail. It exploded with tragic results.

After a two-week trial before judge and jury, the
two accused were found guilty. The present appeal was brought from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing an appeal by Lewis
against conviction. The sole question upon which leave to appeal was granted by
this Court, was whether the trial judge erred in failing to define
""motive"", and in failing to direct the jury as to that concept having
regard to the fact that, relative to the appellant, the case for the Crown was
totally devoid of such evidence.

The relevant facts of the case are summarized in the
reasons for judgment at pp. 824-828.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Accepting the term ""motive"" in a criminal
law sense as meaning ""ulterior intention"", it is possible, upon the
authorities, to formulate the following propositions: (1) As evidence, motive
is always relevant and hence evi­dence of motive is admissible. (2) Motive is
no part of the crime and is legally irrelevant to criminal responsi­bility. It
is not an essential element of the prosecution's case as a matter of law. (3)
Proved absence of motive is always an important fact in favour of the accused
and

[Page 822]

ordinarily worthy of note in a charge to the jury.
(4) Conversely, proved presence of motive may be an impor­tant factual
ingredient in the Crown's case, notably on the issues of identity and
intention, when the evidence is purely circumstantial. (5) Motive is therefore
always a question of fact and evidence and the necessity of referring to motive
in the charge to the jury falls within the general duty of the trial judge
""to not only outline the theories of the prosecution and defence but to
give the jury matters of evidence essential in arriving at a just
conclusion."" (6) Each case will turn on its own unique set of
circumstances. The issue of motive is always a matter of degree.

Applying the foregoing propositions to the present
case, motive was not proven as part of the Crown's case, nor was absence of
motive proven by the defence. There was, therefore, no clear obligation in law
to charge on motive. Whether or not to charge became, therefore, a matter of
judgment for the trial judge and his judgment should not be lightly reversed.

Every summing-up must be regarded in the light of
the conduct of the trial and the questions which have been raised by the
counsel for the prosecution and for the defence respectively: per Alverstone
L.C.J. in R. v. Stoddart (1909), 2 Cr. App. R. 217 at p. 246. Counsel at
trial did not ask the judge to instruct on motive, and the judge obviously felt
that such instruction was not called for, in the light of the entire trial.

The necessity of charging a jury on motive may be
looked upon as a continuum, at one end of which are cases where the evidence as
to identity of the murderer is purely circumstantial and proof of motive on the
part of the Crown so essential that reference must be made to motive in
charging the jury. At the other end of the continuum, and requiring a charge on
motive, is the case where there is proved absence of motive and this may become
of great significance as a matter in favour of the accused. Between these two
end points in the continuum there are cases where the necessity to charge on
motive depends upon the course of the trial and the nature and probative value
of the evidence adduced. In these cases, a substantial discretion must be left
to the trial judge.

In the present case any instruction on motive would
have had to make clear that there was no obligation on the Crown to prove motive.
Reference would have to be

[Page 823]

made to the unsatisfactory state of the record as to
motive and the inconclusive cross-examination. The case fell squarely in the
middle of the continuum. As such, there was no duty in law on the trial judge,
in the circumstances of the case, to instruct the jury on motive as a matter of
evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in reference to Lewis'
defence. It was open to the judge to have charged on lack of motive but he
could not be faulted for having failed to do so. It was a matter within his
discretion.

Overriding all of this, a trial judge has a
difficult task to perform in charging a jury at the end of a lengthy trial, and
he must be given reasonable latitude in the discharge of that responsibility.
It is the charge as a whole that must be considered in determining whether
justice has been done. The fundamental point in the instant case was that
motive is always a matter of fact and evidence and, therefore, primarily for
the judge and jury rather than the appellate tribunal. Views will in all
likelihood differ in any case as to the evidence which should be alluded to,
and the evidence which may be disregarded, by the trial judge in the
preparation of his charge, but unless the result is such as to give rise to a
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, then the failure to refer to any
particular evidence should not be regarded as reversible error entitling the
accused to a new trial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia dismissing the appel­lant's appeal against his conviction for murder.
Appeal dismissed.

Kenneth G. Young, for the appellant.

Douglas A. Hogarth, Q.C., for the respondent. 

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant Lewis and one Santa Singh Tatlay were
jointly charged with the murder of Parmjeet K. Sidhu, Tatlay's daughter, and,
under a separate count, with the murder of

[Page 824]

Gurmail Singh Sidhu, her husband. The plot alleged by the Crown
was both novel and satanic. The instrument which caused the deaths was an
electric kettle rigged with dynamite in such a manner as to explode when
plugged into an elec­tric outlet. The kettle was sent to the couple by mail. It
exploded with tragic results.

After a two-week trial before judge and jury, the two accused
were found guilty. The present appeal is brought from a judgment of the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing an appeal by Lewis against
conviction. The sole question upon which leave to appeal was granted by this
Court, is whether the trial judge erred in failing to define
""motive"", and in failing to direct the jury as to that concept having
regard to the fact that, relative to the appellant, the case for the Crown was
totally devoid of such evidence.

The Facts

Parmjeet K. Sidhu and Gurmail Sidhu, to whom she had been
recently married, were killed in a violent explosion at approximately 10.00
a.m. on October 23, 1972, in a basement suite occupied by them in the City of
New Westminster. The mys­tery surrounding their deaths remained unsolved until
January 1976, when information obtained by the police resulted in the arrest of
Lewis, and subsequently, the arrest of his co-accused, Tatlay.

A cardboard box indicating that it had con­tained a ""Sunbeam
K22"" electric kettle was found at the scene of the explosion. The debris
contained metal fragments with nitrate residue. A nitrate based explosive
called ""forcite"" was used at the Craigmont mine near Merritt, British
Columbia, where both Tatlay and Lewis were employed. In common with most other
mine employees, both had ready access to such explosives. Lewis was employed at
the mine as, inter alia, a ""blaster"" and possessed a
""blasting certificate"". About forty per cent of the mine employees
had blasting certificates.

On October 24, 1972, on the floor of the bed-room closet of the
suite a brown paper wrapping

[Page 825]

was located bearing the address of the two deceased, a return
address in Kamloops, British Columbia, (which turned out to be fictitious) and
the word ""Fragile"" printed three times. The hand-writing was
identified as that of Lewis. The postal inscription indicated that the parcel
had been sent in the mail from Kamloops on October 19, 1972. The parcel was
delivered by a postal courier on October 23, 1972.

At all material times, Tatlay and Lewis were residents of
Merritt, some sixty miles from Kamloops. Parmjeet had lived with her father,
Santa Tatlay, in Merritt until April 1972. At that point, having just turned
eighteen, she went with Gur­mail to Alberta, where parental consent was not
required, and there married him. Some time in the late spring or summer of
1972, Tatlay approached James A. Mountain and asked for his assistance in
finding someone to kill Gurmail because Tatlay's daughter had run away with
Gurmail and Tatlay did not approve. Mountain refused. During the same period,
Tatlay approached William J. Todd, expressing concern that his daughter had married
a ""commoner"" and disgraced the family. He said that the commoner
would have to die and offered Todd $2,000 to kill Gurmail. Todd also refused.
There was no evidence at trial to indicate that Lewis was aware of Tatlay's
family problems or of Tatlay's approaches to Mountain and Todd.

The case for the Crown, as it related to Lewis, turned largely
upon the testimony of one Brabant, a chronic alcoholic and petty criminal of
some standing. Lewis and Brabant were friends They had known each other for
about eight years. They lived near each other in Merritt, and had made trips
together to other parts of Canada.

On October 17, 1972, Lewis and Brabant went to Kamloops, Brabant
wishing to purchase a pair of reading glasses, and Lewis ""to buy
something, a present or something."" In Kamloops the two men went to a
store, separated, and met again at the cashier's counter. On the counter in
front of Lewis was a box similar in size to the one found in Parmjeet's suite
following her death. The lid was

[Page 826]

open and according to Brabant the box contained a
""round"" metal object which was ""kind of shiny, shiny colour ...
chrome or nickel."" Two days later, on October 19, 1972, Lewis again
invited Brabant to accompany him to Kamloops. Lewis said that he had to
""mail a parcel"". Resting in the back seat of the car during the trip
was a parcel similar in size to the box containing the purchase made by Lewis
on October 17. The parcel was enclosed in brown paper of a kind similar to the
wrapper found in the New Westminster suite after the explosion.

Lewis and Brabant drank beer on the way to Kamloops and arrived
there before noon. Lewis parked the car close by the local post office.
According to Brabant, he told Brabant that he had to get an address out of the
'phone book. Lewis left the car and went into a nearby telephone booth where,
observed by Brabant, he examined the tele­phone book and wrote something down.
Shortly thereafter Lewis returned to the car and, in the presence of Brabant,
took the parcel out of the back seat and placed it on his lap. He then either
wrote something on the parcel or wrote something on a piece of paper using the
parcel for support. Lewis then took the parcel from the car and walked with it
to the post office. Upon his return, he said ""everything's set, let's
go."" During the balance of the day the two men drank and, accord­ing to
Lewis, bought machinery parts. In his tes­timony before the jury, it might be
said, Lewis acknowledged and accepted substantially the sequence of events on
October 17 and October 19 recounted by Brabant.

During the drive back to Merritt on October 19, according to
Brabant, Lewis said to him ""Art, you listen to the radio in the morning
... you're going to hear something about a boom or a blast or whatever it
is."" Brabant was admittedly ""drunk"" at the time. He did,
however, listen to the radio as suggested and a couple of days later heard of
the explosion in New Westminster. Brabant ""wrote down the date I had been
in Kamloops and what I

[Page 827]

had done in Kamloops ... on a piece of receipt or invoice or
paper I got from—from the place I got the part from."" The reason for his
concern was clearly expressed in these words:

In case something turned up and I was there when the thing
was bought and I was there when the thing was mailed so I figured I was going
to be in hot soup later with that so I marked it down to make sure I remember
what I did.

Lewis testified in his own defence. He conceded that he had gone
to Kamloops with Brabant on October 17, but said he bought an electric percola­tor
as an anniversary present to his wife, their wedding anniversary being October
1, and her birthday November 4. As a favour to Tatlay, whom he knew slightly,
he had agreed to mail, from Kamloops, a previously wrapped parcel, the contents
of which were described to him simply as a gift. He admitted placing on the
parcel all of the writing that appeared there, but he did so, he said, at the
request of Tatlay who wrote little or no English. Lewis denied that on the
second return journey from Kamloops to Merritt he had said anything to Brabant
about a boom or blast.

Lewis swore that he became aware of the New Westminster
occurrence through the local newspa­per. Concerned by the similarity of the
names reported to those which he had only shortly before written on the parcel
which he had mailed, he went to Brabant for advice. The advice, he said, was
not to go to the police for, never having been involved with the police, he
would not ""know what to say to them."" If he went to the authorities
""the East Indians will get you for sure,"" was Brabant's com­ment. In
short, said Lewis, he was advised ""to stay away from the police and mind
your own business and keep quiet.""

Later, according to Lewis' evidence, he approached Tatlay
underground at the mine, and said ""What kind of a mess have you gotten me
into? ... I am going to the police."" Tatlay, accord­ing to Lewis, replied
""If you go to the police I will get you, I will get your wife, and I will
get your

[Page 828]

kids and if I can't do it myself, I will hire it done or I will
get it done."" Lewis discussed the matter no further with anyone until his
arrest more than three years later.

Lewis gave two written statements to the police. In the first
statement, Lewis recounted that he had met Tatlay at the mine, Tatlay had asked
him to mail a parcel at Kamloops and Tatlay had given Lewis $2 for postage. The
statement continued that several days later Lewis heard around the mine that
Tatlay's daughter had been killed, but that he did not connect it in his mind
with anything that he, Lewis, had done. In the second statement he admitted
that, in his previous statement, he had not told the officers everything,
adding ""after the publicity about the double murder I realized that the
package that I mailed must have contained the bomb."" He then went on to
tell of the threat from Tatlay. Neither statement makes any mention of Brabant
or his accom­panying Lewis on both trips to Kamloops.

I have not attempted to traverse all of the evidence adduced
during the course of a lengthy trial, nor to make an independent review of the
evidence. I have thought it better, in the main, to summarize the facts which
counsel deemed salient to the point under consideration, as evidenced by their
recital in the lengthy factums filed in this appeal.

The Trial

The case for the Crown as against Tatlay was that he was very
seriously affected by his daughter leaving home to marry Gurmail without his
consent or approval, and had therefore arranged with Lewis for the conversion
of an electric kettle into a bomb and its dispatch by mail from Kamloops. The
case against Lewis was that he mailed a package at Kamloops, knowing that it
contained the lethal kettle addressed to the two deceased persons. The evidence
adduced by the Crown was largely circumstantial.

Lewis' defence was a simple one. He had been an innocent dupe.
For his part, Tatlay denied

[Page 829]

everything. In particular, he denied having met Lewis at the time
and place alleged by Lewis on October 18, 1972, or at all.

Counsel for Tatlay cross-examined Lewis very closely with respect
to the alleged meeting with Tatlay at the mine. Tatlay also called as his wit­ness
one Schmidt, an accountant with Craigmont Mines. Schmidt testified that,
according to the records of the mine, Lewis did not work on Octo­ber 17, 1972,
but had worked on the 12:00 midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift on October 18 and
October 19, while Tatlay had worked day shift between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
on October 18, 1972. Further evidence as to the layout of the mine and movement
of the underground personnel at shift change was such that the jury could
reasonably have concluded it to be virtually impossible for Lewis to have met
Tatlay at the time and place alleged. Schmidt's evidence left open the
possibili­ty of a meeting at about the same time at another place in the
general mine area, but this threw doubt on Lewis' version of what had occurred.
Tatlay denied that he had ever met Lewis or known him prior to 1976, and Lewis
agreed that he had not known Tatlay or his family prior to the parcel incident.

In addressing the jury, the counsel for Lewis accepted that
Brabant was not lying, but argued that Brabant was confused as a result of the
lapse of time between the explosion and the trial. More particularly, Brabant
was in error with respect to the statement by Lewis to the effect that if he
were to listen to the radio, he would hear a ""boom or blast"".
Secondly, it was not contested that the parcel mailed by Lewis contained the
rigged kettle which caused the deaths.

Lewis adduced little or no evidence as to his financial standing.
He was cross-examined, however, by Crown counsel with results which could only
be characterized, at the highest, as inconclu­sive. The Crown called no
witnesses for the purpose of establishing motive on the part of Lewis.

Lewis called several witnesses who spoke as to his good character
and his general reputation within the community.

[Page 830]

The trial judge dealt fairly and adequately with the theory of
the Crown and the theory of the defence. The Crown concedes that the judge did
not deal specifically with the question of motive in so far as Lewis was
concerned, but he did deal with the character evidence that had been adduced on
Lewis' behalf.

At the close of the judge's charge, counsel for Tatlay raised,
among other matters, the question of motive from Tatlay's point of view.
Counsel for Lewis raised three objections, to which I will later refer, but he
made no reference to motive.

During their deliberations the jury asked to have read back (i)
the evidence of Brabant with regard to whether or not Lewis had written
something down while in the telephone booth, and (ii) the cross-examination of
Crown counsel dealing with the financial situation of Lewis. Defence counsel
did not request that the judge at this time charge the jury on the concept of
motive.

At the end of the day, the critical question in Lewis' case was
whether or not, at the time he mailed the package, he knew that it contained a
bomb.

Appeal

On appeal, a number of grounds were relied upon. All were
rejected by a unanimous Court of Appeal. With respect to motive, the Court had
this to say:

Counsel for Lewis also submitted the charge was deficient in
failing to include a definition of ""motive"" and a direction regarding
the absence of proof of motive on Lewis's part. There was some evidence,
inconclusive, that Lewis's objective was money. In any event, the jury, as
intelligent people, could not fail to consider the matter. That they were
concerned is evidenced from the fact that they interrupted their deliberations
to return to the Court room and have read to them the cross-exami­nation of
Lewis dealing with his financial situation. This was done in a manner
satisfactory to counsel. The defence of Lewis was on the whole adequately and
fairly put before the jury by the Judge.

[Page 831]

Motive in Law

In ordinary parlance, the words ""intent"" and
""motive"" are frequently used interchangeably, but in the criminal law
they are distinct. In most criminal trials, the mental element, the mens rea
with which the court is concerned, relates to ""intent"", i.e. the
exercise of a free will to use particular means to produce a particular result,
rather than with ""motive"", i.e. that which precedes and
induces the exercise of the will. The mental element of a crime ordinarily
involves no reference to motive: 11 Hals. (4th ed., 1976), para. 11.

Difficulty arises, however, from the vagueness in law of the
notion of ""motive"". There would appear to be substantial agreement
amongst textwriters that there are two possible meanings to be ascribed to the
term. Glanville Williams in his Criminal Law, The General Part (2nd ed.,
1961) distin­guishes between these meanings:

(1) It sometimes refers to the emotion prompting an act,
e.g., ""D killed P, his wife's lover, from a motive of jealousy."" (2)
It sometimes means a kind of intention, e.g., ""D killed P with the motive
(intention, desire) of stopping him from paying attentions to D's wife.""
(p. 48)

It is this second sense, according to Williams, which is employed
in criminal law:

Motive is ulterior intention—the intention with which an
international act is done (or, more clearly, the inten­tion with which an
intentional consequence is brought about). Intention, when distinguished from
motive, relates to the means, motive to the end. (p, 48)

Smith and Hogan in their Criminal Law (4th ed., 1978) put
the matter in slightly sharper per­spective. Dealing with the first of the
above meanings:

If D causes an actus reus with mens rea, he is
guilty of the crime and it is entirely irrelevant to his guilt that he had a
good motive. The mother who kills her imbecile and suffering child out of
motives of compassion is just as guilty of murder as is the man who kills for
gain. (p. 63)

The authors discuss also the species of intention implicit in the
second meaning above:

[Page 832]

For example, D intends to (a) put poison in his uncle's tea,
(b) to cause his uncle's death and (c) to inherit his money. We would normally
say that (c) is his motive. Applying our test of ""desired
consequence"" (c) is cer­tainly also intended. The reason why it is
considered merely a motive is that it is a consequence ulterior to the mens
rea and the actus reus; it is no part of the crime. If this
criterion as to the nature of motive be adopted then it follows that motive, by
definition, is irrelevant to criminal responsibility—that is, a man may
be Iawfully convicted of a crime whatever his motive may be, or even if he had
no motive. (pp. 63-4)

Both of these texts were drawn upon in a brief discussion of
motive by Lord Hailsham in Hyam v. D.P.P.[1] at
pp. 73-4. The appellant in that case had had a relationship with a man who
became engaged to another woman B. The appellant had gone to B's house at night
and set fire to the house. While B escaped, her two daughters did not and the two
died of suffocation. The appellant's defence was that she had only intended to
frighten B. If one were to use the first sense of motive as emotion, the
appellant's admitted motive was jeal­ousy of B; if the second sense of motive
as ulterior intention, her motive was to frighten B so that she would leave the
neighbourhood. In the former sense, states Lord Hailsham, ""it is the
emotion which gives rise to the intention and it is the latter, and not the
former, which converts an act us reus into a criminal act.""

It is, however, important to realise that in the second
sense too motive, which in that sense is to be equated with the ultimate
""end"" of a course of action, often described as its
""purpose"" or ""object"" although ""a kind of
intention"", is not co-extensive with intention, which embraces, in
addition to the end, all the necessary consequences of an action including the
means to the end and any consequences intended along with the end. (p. 73)

In the case at bar, the parties have employed the notion of
""motive"" in the second of Williams' senses.

Accepting the term ""motive"" in a criminal law sense as
meaning ""ulterior intention"", it is possible,

[Page 833]

I think, upon the authorities, to formulate a number of
propositions.

(1) As evidence, motive is always relevant and hence
evidence of motive is admissible.

This statement is drawn from Smith and Hogan where the authors
state:

This means simply that, if the prosecution can prove that D
had a motive for committing the crime, they may do so since the existence of a
motive makes it more likely that D in fact did commit it. Men do not usually
act without a motive. (p. 64)

Support for this proposition can also be drawn from the
following: 11 Hals. (4th ed., 1976), para. 365; Howard, Criminal Law (1977),
p. 364; Wil­liams, p. 49, note 4; McWilliams, Canadian Criminal Evidence (1974),
pp. 299-300, 332; Cross on Evidence (4th ed., 1974), pp. 34-5; 1 Wigmore
on Evidence, paras. 118, 392; Phipson on Evidence (12th ed., 1976),
para. 382; Best on Evidence (12th ed., 1922), para. 453.

While evidence of motive is always relevant on the issue of
intent or identity, motive must be evidenced by human acts and there are limits
to the extent to which such acts may be introduced as motive: see R. v.
Barbour[2].

(2) Motive is no part of the crime and is legally irrele­vant
to criminal responsibility. It is not an essential element of the prosecution's
case as a matter of law.

In language reminiscent of Smith and Hogan, Schroeder J.A.
puts the matter this way in R. v. Imrich[3], at
p. 503:

When a defendant is indisputably shown to be the criminal,
evidence of motive is immaterial. Motive relates to a consequence ulterior to
the mens rea and the actus reus and, adopting this
criterion, motive is irrele­vant to criminal responsibility, viz., a man may be
lawfully convicted of a crime whatever his motive may be or even if he has no
motive. It is, of course, relevant as evidence for if the prosecution can prove
that the defendant had a motive for committing the crime it may do so, since the
existence of motive makes it more likely that the defendant did in fact commit
it ... All matters

[Page 834]

of motive are for the jury and are not to be dealt with as
matters of law. Motive is never to be confused with intent and it is wholly
inaccurate to say that without motive there can be no intent.

This majority view of the case was upheld upon subsequent appeal
to this Court[4].
Wigmore puts it succinctly in para. 118 of his first volume with the heading:
""Motive always Relevant, but never Essential."" The rationale for this
approach is explained in Pointer v. U.S.[5], at
pp. 413-4, where Harlan J. approved a passage from the trial judge's
charge and then commented upon it:

""The law does not require impossibilities. The law
recognizes that the cause of the killing is sometimes so hidden in the mind and
breast of the party who killed, that it cannot be fathomed, and as it does not
require impossibilities, it does not require the jury to find it. Yet, if they
do find it, it simply becomes an item of evidence in the case, which is only
evidentiary at best—that is, it is only an item of evidence going to show
whether a particular party may have committed an act, and sometimes going to
show the characteristics of that act ...""

It is not indispensable to conviction that the particular
motive for taking the life of a human being shall be established by proof to
the satisfaction of the jury. The absence of evidence suggesting a motive for
the commis­sion of the crime charged is a circumstance in favor of the accused,
to be given such weight as the jury deems proper; but proof of motive is never
indispensable to conviction.

Evidence of motive is merely circumstantial evi­dence like any
other circumstantial evidence, which may or may not be of importance depending
upon the facts of each case. But motive as a legal concept is not a necessary
element of the case to be proved by the prosecution and the prosecution is free
to adduce evidence or not. Paradoxically then, although motive is described as
""ulterior inten­tion"" in the sense of the end of a series of actions,
it is only useful in an evidentiary sense as a means

[Page 835]

of proving the anterior intention or the identity of the person
who committed the actus reus.

(3) Proved absence of motive is always an important fact in
favour of the accused and ordinarily worthy of note in a charge to the jury.

In support of this proposition is the judgment of Davis J. in Markadonis
v. R.[6] who,
prefacing his remarks with these words:

Moreover, I cannot escape from the view that the charge of
the learned trial judge did not present certain aspects of the case in favour
of the accused that should have been dealt with and considered.

pointed out the first of those aspects:

Firstly, the absence of any proof of motive. While it is not
the motive but the intent which is essential, proof of motive becomes of
importance where the evidence as here against the accused is entirely
circumstantial. (p. 665)

The comment of Mr. Justice Davis picks up the oft-quoted
statement of Channell J. in R. v. Ellwood[7] as
to the ""great difference between absence of proved motive and proved
absence of motive"". That statement warrants some explana­tion. Ellwood was
convicted of the murder of a mill employee named Wilkinson in the offices of
the mill. The accused had been identified by a number of witnesses as having
been in the vicinity of the mill office about the time in question. The
suggested motive was that the accused thought Wilkinson would have at that time
cashed the cheque for the wages of the mill employees and the accused was
planning to rob him of that money. The main ground of appeal was that no motive
was proved by the prosecution. Channell J. summarily dismissed this point, at
p. 182, after stating that ""there was here strong evidence"" on the
case as a whole:

It is complained that no motive was shown. There was not an
absence of suggested motive, nor a proved absence of motive. Robbery was
suggested. As was pointed out by the learned judge, there is a great difference
between absence of proved motive and proved absence of motive.

[Page 836]

In the case of R. v. Imrich, supra, motive and
opportunity, on one view, were central to the Crown's case. All the evidence
was circumstantial in nature and the Crown's theory as to motive was that the
accused was in financial straits and was being pressed by his creditors. As the
premises in question were insured, the accused thus set fire to them in order
to defraud the insurance company, according to the Crown, the accused having
had the exclusive opportunity to do so when he was alone in the house on the
afternoon of the fire. In the course of his dissent in the Ontario Court of
Appeal, Dubin J.A. said:

In the circumstances of this case, absence of motive would
not only have been destructive of the essential averment of an intent to
defraud, but also would have removed from the Crown's case a material fact as
part of its proof that the accused was the person who set fire to the premises.
(pp. 504-5)

Since opportunity alone could not found the case for the prosecution,
motive was material in his view.

In this Court, Mr. Justice Ritchie, in rejecting the views of
Dubin J.A., emphasized the evidence of exclusive opportunity and its effect on
the importance of motive:

In seeking to prove the identity of the culprit in such a
case as this, motive is immaterial if the opportunity to set the fire is shown
to have been exclusive. In my view, the whole theory of the Crown was that
Imrich had the exclusive opportunity to set this fire and on this issue
instructions relating to motive cannot be characterized as ""matters of
evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion"". It seems to me that
such an instruction could only have had the effect of leaving the jury with the
impression that lack of motive was of importance even where exclusive
opportunity was proven. (p. 628)

(4) Conversely, proved presence of motive may be an
important factual ingredient in the Crown's case, notably on the issues of the
identity and intention, when the evidence is purely circumstantial.

This is, in effect, merely a restatement of Davis J.'s comments
in Markadonis. In Barbour at p. 472, Mr. Justice Kerwin in
dissent pointed out: ""While the Crown is not obliged to adduce evidence

[Page 837]

of motive, the presence or absence of motive may be of very
considerable importance."" McWil­liams, at pp. 299-300, refers to the
opening statement of the Attorney General in Palmer's case (1856) that
""if we find strong motives, the more readily shall we be led to believe in
the probability of the crime having been committed; but if we find an absence
of motive, the probability is the other way.""

(5) Motive is therefore always a question of fact and
evidence and the necessity of referring to motive in the charge to the jury
falls within the general duty of the trial judge ""to not only outline the
theories of the prosecution and defence but to give the jury matters of
evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion.""

The latter portion of this proposition is drawn from the judgment
of Mr. Justice Spence in Col­pitts v. The Queen[8],
at p. 752, referred to by both Ritchie J. in Imrich at p. 626, and
by Dubin J. A. at p. 509, in support of their differing views of that case. I
think this latter conflict is instructive—in each case, there will clearly be
differences of opin­ion as to whether certain matters of evidence are essential
to the case for either party. A goad deal of latitude should be allowed to the
judgment of the trial judge as to which matters of evidence are essential or
not.

(6) Each case will turn on its own unique set of circum­stances.
The issue of motive is always a matter of degree.

The necessity of charging a jury on motive may be looked upon as
a continuum, at one end of which are cases where the evidence as to identity of
the murderer is purely circumstantial and proof of motive on the part of the
Crown so essential that reference must be made to motive in charging the jury.
The Crown's case against Tatlay was just such a situation. It was essential to
establish motive and the trial judge properly referred to motive in charging
the jury in relation to Tatlay. At the other end of the continuum, and
requiring a charge on motive, is the case where there is proved

[Page 838]

absence of motive and this may become of great significance as a
matter in favour of the accused. Between these two end points in the continuum
there are cases where the necessity to charge on motive depends upon the course
of the trial and the nature and probative value of the evidence adduced. In
these cases, a substantial discretion must be left to the trial judge. In Imrich,
for example, the evidence of exclusive opportunity was such that motive
receded into the background.

The Present Case

In the light of the foregoing propositions, I examine the case at
bar. One of the points to note is that the Crown put forward two alternative
theories as to the transaction between Tatlay and Lewis. The dominant theory of
the Crown was that Tatlay, enraged at his daughter's defiance, insti­gated
Lewis to fashion and mail the kettle-bomb which killed the couple.
Alternatively, the Crown suggested that Tatlay or some other person might have
made the bomb and that Lewis mailed the parcel, knowing it to contain a bomb.
The broad theory related to both Tatlay and Lewis, the narrow theory related only
to Lewis. Thus Lewis would stand convicted, as the trial judge pointed out in
his charge, if the jury accepted either theory:

Now, if you were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
Lewis made this bomb and that Tatlay procured him to do it, that is, enlisted
his services to do it, then I say—and I will tell you the law more
particularly in a few moments—that you would have evidence upon which you could
find—that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that these men were
guilty of murder.

Alternatively, it seems to me that even if you found that
Lewis did not fashion the lethal weapon but he was the courier, that is, he is
the one who mailed it and that he mailed it with the realization of what he was
mailing, again I would say that would be evidence if you are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt of that fact, to justify finding that he was guilty of murder.

The actus reus of the narrow theory is identified by the
Crown as the mailing of the parcel. This

[Page 839]

removes the materiality of motive as to proof of identity and
thus narrows the necessary mental element or mens rea to knowledge that
the parcel contained a bomb, the requisite specific intent following as a
matter of inference.

I turn then to the question whether motive was a matter of evidence
essential to the defence of Lewis. At the opening of his address to the jury,
Mr. Harris, counsel for Lewis, stated:

The key question is, of course, who did this. I add
something extra to what Mr. Braidwood said—why did they do it? Those two
questions, as far as I am con­cerned, can't be separated. When you ask who did
this, why they did it, why he did it. Those are fundamental questions.

and in the penultimate paragraph of his address he said:

One quick statement comes in at this point, and I think that
is motive. Such a diabolical deed must have a motive. Look to Jim Lewis. He has
no motive. In this courtroom—he did not know these people. He did not know of
the problems in Santa Tatlay's family. He had no motive to kill anyone. He has
said here ""I got the parcel. I didn't know its contents. I sent it
forward. I never intended to kill anyone, never intended anyone to be
harmed."" The man has no motive at all, and that is a very troublesome
aspect of this case. There is no motive there at all. Look at the motive of
Santa Tatlay, the tremendous motive of Santa Tatlay.

In the charge by the trial judge, there was no adversion to
motive in so many words. The effect of the acceptance of Brabant's evidence is
mentioned:

... this [Brabant's] testimony would tend to reflect on the
credibility of Lewis and tend to support the Crown's theory that Lewis had more
than an innocent knowl­edge. In fact, the Crown says it fairly supports the
proposition that he is a principal party to this heinous act—if at least he did
not fashion the kettle, he knew what it was and for what purpose it was
intended.

At a couple of points, the trial judge intimated quite strongly
that Schmidt's testimony was that the two accused ""would not have been
able to meet on the parking lot if they were changing shifts"".

[Page 840]

Again, there is no error in these remarks.

The trial judge covered the character evidence adduced by Lewis:

Briefly a man can always call evidence of his general
reputation in the community for the purpose of showing that you should believe
him when he testified, or if he has testified, or that he is not, because of
his background or character, the type of man who would commit the type of crime
of which he is accused.

Although it is true that the word ""motive"" is not used,
the jury was invited to consider whether Lewis was the type of man who would
commit the type of crime of which he was accused.

The judge reviewed the address of Lewis' coun­sel, Mr. Harris, to
the jury, summarizing the theory of the defence succinctly:

He [Mr. Harris] said that this man [Lewis] was really an
innocent dupe, and that he mailed this parcel all right, which ultimately
caused the explosion, but that he had nothing to do with the fashioning of this
lethal weapon.

The objections of counsel for Lewis to the charge were three in
number: (1) the treatment of Brabant's testimony concerning the round, shiny
metallic object in the box on the first trip to Kamloops; (2) the reference to
the existence of a conversation between Lewis and Brabant subse­quent to the
killings in which mention was made of ""boom or blast"", as
""sheer speculation""; and (3) the apparent foreclosure by the trial
judge of any opportunity for Lewis and Tatlay to have met at the shift change,
based upon Schmidt's testimony. All three objections were rejected by the trial
judge. The failure of defence counsel to object to the absence of reference to
motive in the judge's charge as to Lewis does not preclude objection being
taken before this Court. The objections taken at trial are, however, indicative
of the pri­mary concerns of defence counsel, and in the case at bar are of some
assistance in assessing the essentiality of reference to absence of motive.

[Page 841]

It is not surprising that counsel for Lewis con­centrated his
objections upon the three pieces of evidence to which I have referred. If Lewis
did buy a kettle, and not a percolator; if Lewis did mention a ""boom or
blast"" on the second Kamloops trip, and not in a later conversation with
Brabant; if it was impossible for Tatlay and Lewis to meet casu­ally at the
shift change at the mine, and they must have met otherwise; then Lewis'
""innocent dupe"" defence would have been left in tatters. Absence of
motive, although emphasized in a concluding paragraph of Mr. Harris' submission
to the jury, would carry little weight by comparison.

Counsel for Lewis properly emphasized in argu­ment before this
Court the crucial nature of the evidence or Brabant, an admitted criminal and
alcoholic, and urged that in assessing his credibili­ty and that of Lewis, the
absence of proven motive on the part of Lewis should be put in the scale in his
favour. This submission at first impression has a certain persuasiveness, but
when one reads and re-reads the evidence at trial, in particular the
cross-examination of Lewis, the submissions of counsel, and the judge's charge,
I do not think that one can properly attribute reversible error to the trial
judge in failing to direct the jury as to the concept of motive.

Applying the propositions which I have outlined earlier, it will
be seen that motive was not proven as part of the Crown's case, nor was absence
of motive proven by the defence. There was, therefore, no clear obligation in
law to charge on motive. Whether or not to charge became, therefore, a matter of
judgment for the trial judge and his decision should not be lightly reversed.
As Coyne J. A. said in R. v. Malanik (No. 2)[9],
at p. 164:

The summing-up must not be examined microscopically in a
critical spirit to make post facto fault-finding (Rex v.
Stoddart (1909), 2 Cr. App. R. 217, approved in Preston v. The
King, 7 C.R. 72, [1949] S.C.R. 156 at 162, 93 C.C.C. 81, 1949 Can.
Abr. 148) but solely to determine whether the summing-up as a whole in
the

[Page 842]

light of all the proceedings was such as to enable the jury
to appreciate the case before them and their powers and duty and to afford some
reasonable assistance to the exercise and performance of them in the case.

Every summing-up must be regarded in the light of the conduct of
the trial and the questions which have been raised by the counsel for the
prosecution and for the defence respectively: per Alverstone L.C.J. in R.
v. Stoddart[10], at
p. 246.

Counsel at trial did not ask the judge to instruct on motive, and
the judge obviously felt that such instruction was not called for, in the light
of the entire trial. Although the evidence of Brabant was important to the case
against Lewis, there was really very little conflict between the evidence of
Brabant and that of Lewis. The question was rather one of inference from
undisputed facts. Brabant testified to the purchase by Lewis of a round, shiny
object on October 17, 1972, con­tained in a box similar in size to that which
contained the kettle-bomb. Lewis did not deny the purchase on that date of a
round, shiny object contained in such a box. He said that the object was a
coffee percolator, and not an electric water kettle. It was left to the jury to
decide whether the object was as Lewis stated. In doing so, Lewis' explanation
of buying a present midway between anniversary and birthday could be appraised.

It is also important to note that there is no real conflict
between the evidence of the two men as to what occurred at the Post Office at
the time the parcel was mailed. Lewis explained that he was looking up the
address of a machinery company, but he failed to explain why this would be
neces­sary when, on his own testimony, he was in Kamloops frequently for the
purchase or repair of machinery parts needed on his ranch.

Finally, with respect to the evidence as to ""boom or
blast"", as I read the evidence, Lewis does not deny a conversation between
himself and Brabant

[Page 843]

in which the words ""boom or blast"" were used. His
position would seem to be that such a comment was made, or may have been made,
not during the journey back to Merritt on October 19, 1972, but at some later
date. The trial judge dealt with the ""boom or blast"" point in the
following manner, and I cite his remarks in extenso, having regard to
the importance of this part of the charge:

Brabant said that on the way home Lewis said ""Art, you
listen to the radio in the morning, you will hear about a boom or a
blast"". Brabant said he listened the next morning but didn't hear anything
unusual and he said he listened every morning for the next two or three days
and then one morning heard that there had been a blast in New Westminster
involving two people, and because of this incident, he looked for receipts from
stores in Kamloops from his Kamloops trips because he figured that he might in
some way be connected with it, so obviously this situation the Crown had
mentioned, caused him to be very apprehensive.

Now, also in cross-examination, Mr. Kaatz queried Mr.
Brabant regarding the testimony-regarding his testimony-that when they were
returning from Kamloops, Lewis said ""Art, listen to the radio tomorrow,
you are going to hear that a boom or a blast""'—Brabant reiterated that
Lewis had said this, and Mr. Kaatz suggested that perhaps Lewis could have said
that he heard—or Lewis had said he heard about a boom or a blast and Mr.
Brabant replied yes, but by looking at the transcript I cannot understand, the
way that conversa­tion went it would probably be more significant to you. In
any event, you will have to determine whether Lewis said that Brabant should
listen to the radio in a day or so to hear about a boom or a blast or whether
he said simply that he, Lewis, had heard about a boom or a blast. Frankly, in
the circumstances the latter suggestion does not seem consistent with the
situation—why would Lewis say that he had heard about a boom or a blast? Lewis,
of course, cannot recollect making such a statement.

Now, I pause here to point out that in his address, Mr.
Harris said he was not calling Mr. Brabant a liar but simply saying that any
discrepancy between Lewis and Brabant should be resolved in Mr. Lewis' favour
because of Brabant's propensity for liquor, and I suppose the fact that he had
a long criminal record, which I

[Page 844]

will deal with shortly. However, he also suggested that this
conversation about a boom or a blast took place when Lewis went to speak to
Brabant about mailing the parcel. I looked at my notes when Mr. Harris was
making that observation, and I also looked at the tran­script, and frankly I
find no such conversation at all. In fact, unfortunately, they did not as—Mr.
Kaatz did not put to Mr. Brabant in cross-examination, as normally he should
have, the fact that Lewis did go to him apparent­ly about this parcel, after he
heard about the blast. So far as you are concerned, I tell you right now, there
is no evidence from which you can infer that these gentlemen had any
conversations about a boom or a blast after Mr. Lewis learned about it, and for
you to think there was would be sheer speculation.

In the cross-examination of Lewis the following questions were
asked and answers given, but it was never made clear as to where, or at what
subse­quent time, Lewis discussed ""boom or blast"" with Brabant:

Q. And Mr. Brabant indicated you had said something
concerning listening to the radio for a boom or a blast?

A. No sir, I never made any statement like that.

Q. At a subsequent time did you discuss a boom or a blast
with Mr. Brabant? A. Yes, I did.

The charge continues:

In the course of his cross-examination, Mr. Brabant conceded
that he had been a fairly heavy drinker and had been in Essondale, I guess in
early 1972 for thirty days with regard to his drinking problem. He conceded too
in cross-examination, that he had had a number of convictions since 1936, some
involving breaking and entering and theft, and others simple theft, and one or
two involving possession of stolen property, and quite a few involving drinking
while driving. I pause here to point out that when a person is in the witness
stand, he can be cross-examined about any criminal record, and the basis for
permitting that type of cross-examination is to give the trier of the facts,
the jury, an opportunity to say ""Well now, this man appears to have a bad
background criminally. Can 1 place any credence on his testimony whatsoever?""
A lot will depend on the nature of the crime that he had been convicted of. You
might say, having regard to this man's background, the fact

[Page 845]

that he has been convicted of crimes involving moral
turpitude, things like that that you will not believe a thing he says—or you
may say alternatively, ""Well, he has a record but it is not that type of
record which would cause me to doubt his veracity"". Basically, I do not
think that Mr. Harris is saying that this man's record is such that he is
completely unreliable. The fact, as I gather, or the approach of Lewis and the
Defence—there is only one or two areas where there is any difference of opinion
or difference in evidence as to what occurred—that is different so far what
occurred any time Brabant was there—that is the question of the parcel and the
question of his conversation about the boom or the blast, but I think the nub
of the submission in that respect is this: that he obviously had to put it,
politely, a propensity for drink. (And apparently for, travelling to and from
Kamloops and drinking on the way). I assume it is better as a passenger, rather
than a driver. In those circumstances, you should not really place too much
reliance or credence or weight on Bra­bant's testimony because he might have
been a little far gone on the way back to really recall what Lewis said and in
fact, is conjuring up this conversation. However, the Crown points out that
when you look at this you have to consider the fact that he did listen to the
radio regularly apparently, according to his testimony, and that as soon as he
heard about the explosion he immedi­ately became apprehensive and started to
find material to justify his own presence in Kamloops and that when Lewis did
confront him about the fact that he said, allegedly ""Remember that parcel
we mailed"" and Bra­bant replied, according to Lewis—""The parcel you
mailed""—and the Crown says that these are pieces of evidence which
strongly indicate that, or should suggest strongly, that this conversation did
take place on the way, otherwise why would Brabant be apprehensive—why would
Brabant listen to the radio for a boom or a blast—or why should he be so
categorical about saying the parcel you mailed, not we mailed?

Now, if you accept Brabant's testimony as he has given it to
you here with regard, particularly with regard to the conversation about the
boom or a blast, then this testimony would tend to reflect on the credibility
of Lewis and tend to support the Crown's theory that Lewis had more than an
innocent knowledge. In fact, the Crown says it fairly supports the proposition
that he is a principal party to this heinous actif at least he did not fashion
the kettle, he knew what it was and for what purpose it was intended.

[Page 846]

It is not readily apparent how a charge on Lewis' motive or lack
thereof could have aided in assessing Brabant's credibility on the ""boom
or blast"" issue. In this regard, it is important to recall that, except
for denying that he got the return address from the telephone booth, or that he
spoke of an explosion, Lewis admitted to virtually all, if not all, of the
particulars of the two trips to Kamloops recounted by Brabant. There was no
apparent reason for Brabant to lie on any of the points. The defence did not
contend that Brabant was lying, only that he was confused. It was open to the
jury to find in the cross-examination of Lewis a much greater degree of
uncertainty, con­tradiction, and unexplained conduct than in the examination
and cross-examination of Brabant.

The evidence of Brabant did not stand alone. There was undisputed
evidence of the purchase in Kamloops of a round, shiny object in a box, and the
mailing of a box of similar size two days later, addressed in the handwriting
of Lewis, repeatedly marked ""Fragile"", and bearing the address of a
Kamloops motel as the return address. There was no explanation as to why Tatlay
would select Lewis, a stranger, to mail the lethal parcel, par­ticularly if it
were manufactured by some uniden­tified third party. I might note at this point
that there was no evidence led to confirm the purchase by Lewis of a coffee
percolator. Why go to Kamloops to buy a coffee percolator, rather than
purchasing one in Merritt? Why was the parcel not mailed by Tatlay or Lewis at
the post office in Merritt, rather than in Kamloops, sixty miles away? These
were among the questions put to the jury.

It was for the jury to assess the failure of Lewis to report what
had occurred to the proper authori­ties, upon discovery that he had been duped,
as he contended, into complicity in a fiendish murder plot. Over three years
passed before the facts came to light, and then not as a result of anything
done or said by Lewis. It was for the jury also to consider the lack of candor
in Lewis' statements to the police, his initial denial of the handwriting, and

[Page 847]

his failure to mention Brabant, the only person who could
incriminate him. No mention was made of any subsequent conversation with Tatlay
in the first statement yet, in the second statement, Lewis relied on the alleged
threat by Tatlay to explain his failure to report to the police.

While the absence of motive would have weighed in the balance of
credibility between Lewis and Brabant, and between Lewis and Tatlay, one cannot
say that absence of motive could, of itself, have been destructive of any essen­tial
element of the Crown's case.

Any instruction on motive would have had to make clear that there
was no obligation on the Crown to prove motive. Reference would have to be made
to the unsatisfactory state of the record as to motive and the inconclusive
cross-examination. Cast in terms of the earlier discussion of motive in
criminal law, the case at bar falls squarely in the middle of the continuum. As
such, there was no duty in law on the trial judge, in the circumstances of the
case, to instruct the jury on motive as a matter of evidence essential in
arriving at a just conclusion in reference to Lewis' defence. It was open to
the judge to have charged on lack of motive but, in my opinion, he cannot be
faulted for having failed to do so. It was a matter within his discretion.

There is something overriding all of this. A trial judge has a
difficult task to perform in charging a jury at the end of. a lengthy trial,
and he must be given reasonable latitude in the discharge of that
responsibility. It is the charge as a whole that must be considered in
determining whether justice has been done. The fundamental point in the instant
case is that motive is always a matter of fact and evidence and, therefore,
primarily for the judge and jury rather than the appellate tribunal. Views will
in all likelihood differ in any case as to the evidence which should be alluded
to, and the evi­dence which may be disregarded, by the trial judge in the
preparation of his charge, but unless the result is such as to give rise to a
substantial wrong

[Page 848]

or miscarriage of justice, then the failure to refer to any
particular evidence should not, in my view, be regarded as reversible error
entitling the accused to a new trial.

In the result, I am unable to find error on the part of the trial
judge, and I therefore reach the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia.

I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal. 

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Preliminary
inquiry—Cross-examination on pre-inquiry denied by magistrate—Certiorari
denied.

At a preliminary inquiry a magistrate allowed
an objection by counsel for the Crown to cross-examination of a prosecution
witness by counsel for the accused on the witness’ deposition at a pre-inquiry.
The Superior Court issued certiorari to quash the magistrate’s decision.
The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, and appellant
appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Certiorari lies
against a magistrate holding a preliminary inquiry only for lack of
jurisdiction and a decision concerning the admissibility of evidence, even if
erroneous, does not affect jurisdiction. In the instant case, nothing shows
that the questions disallowed were on a vital point and that the decision to disallow
them was apt to influence the outcome. Certiorari is a discretionary
remedy. In the exercise of this discretion with reference to proceedings at a
preliminary inquiry, it is essential to bear in mind that, in the interest of
the effective administration of criminal justice, it is of paramount importance
to avoid unnecessary delays, especially delays in bringing the case to trial.

Patterson v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409, followed; R. v. Norgren (1975), 27 C.C.C.
(2d) 488, referred to; R. v. Mahony, [1910] 2 I.R. 695, distinguished.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec[1]
affirming a judgment of the Superior Court[2] which
granted certiorari to quash the decision of a magistrate. Appeal
allowed.

Yves Berthiaume, for the appellant.

Jeff Boro, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This is an appeal by leave of this
Court from the judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal, (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d)
446, affirming the judgment of Malouf J., (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 158, granting certiorari
to quash a decision of a magistrate sustaining an objection of counsel for
the Crown at a preliminary inquiry. This inquiry was being held on two counts
of having illegally and wilfully attempted to obstruct, pervert or defeat the
course of justice contrary to s. 127(2)  of the Criminal Code , and
two counts of having illegally counselled or incited another person to commit
an offence contrary to s. 422 (a) of the Criminal Code . Prior
to the issue of a warrant, another magistrate before whom the information had
been laid had made ex parte and in camera a pre-inquiry on oath in
accordance with s. 455.3(1) (a). Counsel for the accused had
obtained from that magistrate a copy of the depositions so taken and when
cross-examining at the preliminary inquiry a witness called by the Crown from
whom a deposition had been taken at the pre-inquiry, he sought to put questions
related to such deposition. Counsel for the Crown objected, and after argument
and consideration of s. 10  of the Canada Evidence Act , the
magistrate sustained the objection. This decision is the order quashed by certiorari.

The first question which arises in this case is
whether certiorari lies to quash a decision on objections in the course
of a preliminary inquiry. It was conceded at the hearing that this is
completely unprecedented as far as reported cases go. No such case was referred
to by any of the judges below. In

[Page 307]

the Court of Appeal Kaufman J.A. said (at
p. 456):

That certiorari will lie, at least in
this Province, to review and quash, if necessary, a committal for trial, cannot
be denied: Chromium Mining & Smelting Corp. Ltd. v. Fortin et al., [1968]
Que. Q.B. 536. Why then, once we accept the principle that a review can be had
at that stage, should we not push the matter one step further and, in
appropriate cases, permit an examination of the proceedings even before
they are terminated? Why, for instance, should we refuse a review in cases such
as this, where even now it is apparent that the Magistrate has erred, not in
the exercise of his discretion, but on a fundamental right conferred by the Code?
Why waste time and effort and money to carry on with a preliminary hearing
which, if it results in committal, would have to be quashed? Why not correct
the error now?

With respect, I would point out that the
judgment in the Chromium Mining case was given prior to the judgment of
this Court in Patterson v. The Queen3. The facts of that case are thus
stated by Judson J. who spoke for five of the seven sitting judges (at
p. 411):

The accused was charged under
s. 237(1)  of the Criminal Code  with using an instrument with intent
to procure a miscarriage. During the cross-examination of the woman mentioned
in the charge, it appeared that she had given a written statement to the
police. There was an immediate request for its production. It was refused and
the magistrate said that he could not order it to be produced “at this time.”
Defence counsel then closed his cross-examination of this witness. The same
course was followed with another witness. After the Crown witnesses had given
their evidence, the accused did not make a statement nor call evidence. The
magistrate then committed him for trial. He did not in any way limit or
restrict the cross-examination. Counsel made no attempt to cross-examine on the
contents of the two statements or the recollection of the witness of those
contents. He simply said that he had no further questions.

The accused was committed for trial. On a motion
by way of certiorari it was ordered by the Supreme Court of Alberta that
the preliminary inquiry and the committal be quashed. On appeal,

[Page 308]

the Appellate Division restored the committal.
The judgment of the Appellate Division was affirmed in this Court and the
essential part of the reasons stated by Judson J., the ratio decidendi of
the case, is in these two paragraphs (at pp. 411-13):

I intend to confine these reasons within
the very narrow issues raised by the case and to repeat what has been
emphasized so often that if it is sought to review a committal for trial, there
is only one ground for action by the reviewing Court and that is lack of
jurisdiction. The refusal by the magistrate, on this hearing, to order
production of these statements does not go to the question of jurisdiction. In
the first place, I think that his ruling was correct and, further, even if it
was in error that there would still be no problem of jurisdiction.

…

Even if the magistrate, on a preliminary
inquiry, had the power to order production and failed to exercise it on request
in a case where an appellate tribunal thinks that he ought to have exercised
it, I would still hold that there was no jurisdictional defect. It would be no
more than error in the exercise of jurisdiction.

I cannot accept that what was said in Patterson
by the two judges who disagreed with Judson J. on what he said in the last
quoted paragraph, although one of them agreed on the conclusion, in any way
detracts from the authority of this statement of principle approved by a
majority of this Court. I must also note that most of the cases relied on in
the courts below deal with convictions not committals. At common law certiorari
lies against conviction not only for want of jurisdiction but also for
error of law apparent on the face of the record. In the old days the great
difficulty was that the record did not include depositions and therefore most
errors of law were not apparent, this was the reason why certiorari was
not allowed in the King v. Mahony[3]
from which Kaufman J.A. quoted at some length. Thus the views so expressed
were all obiter and all in relation to a summary conviction not a
preliminary inquiry and as to the importance of the distinction, I will quote
the following passages from the reasons for judgment

[Page 309]

given by McIntyre J.A. (as he then was) in R.
v. Norgren[4], at
pp. 489-90:

The learned Provincial Court Judge had
jurisdiction to embark upon the preliminary hearing. Central to the exercise of
that jurisdiction was the responsibility to determine the admissibility of
evidence tendered by the parties. The confession referred to was the sole
evidence against the respondent. It is now said, as it was said below, that the
Judge applied the wrong test in considering the admissibility of this evidence
and that certiorari should lie.

As I have said, the Judge below acceded to
that argument and ordered the writ.

If error was made in the admission of this
evidence, and for the purpose of this argument and for the purpose of this
judgment I am prepared to assume that error was made in the admission of the
evidence, such an error was at most an error in the exercise of the
jurisdiction properly possessed by the Provincial Court Judge, and it does not
go to or affect his jurisdiction. By making such an error he did not lose his
jurisdiction or exceed it—and certiorari will not lie to review his
decision.

I must observe how much stronger was the case
for Patterson than for Cohen. He had been denied production of statements made
by witnesses prior to the hearing, thus he had been denied information which it
may be presumed he had a substantial interest to obtain before the trial.
However, it was held that certiorari did not lie even on the assumption
that the refusal to order the production of the statements was erroneous. In
the instant case, the accused was denied no information, his counsel had a copy
of the deposition given at the pre-inquiry. It is not shown that the questions
disallowed really went to anything else than the credibility of the witness.
But a preliminary inquiry is not a trial and is not to be turned into a trial
because it happens that a pre-inquiry has been held prior to the issue of the
warrant. As it is, nothing shows that the questions disallowed were on a vital
point and that the decision to disallow them was apt to influence the outcome.
In fact, the judgments below would appear to stand for the

[Page 310]

proposition that any questionable decision by a
magistrate on the admission of evidence during a preliminary inquiry is open to
challenge by certiorari without waiting to see whether there will be a
committal or of what importance it will be in the end result.

In dealing with certiorari one must never
forget that it is a discretionary remedy. In the exercise of this discretion
with reference to proceedings at a preliminary inquiry, it is essential to bear
in mind that, in the interest of the effective administration of criminal
justice, it is of paramount importance to avoid unnecessary delays, especially
delays in bringing the case to trial. If certiorari is issued at the
stage of preliminary inquiry, there is a possibility of an appeal and how long
this may delay the trial is obvious: the application for certiorari in
the present case is dated February 10, 1975.

In my view there are cogent reasons for not
departing from the rule that against a magistrate holding a preliminary inquiry
certiorari lies only for lack of jurisdiction and a decision concerning
the admissibility of evidence, even if erroneous, does not affect jurisdiction.
In view of this conclusion, I do not consider it expedient to express any
opinion as to the merits of the objection sustained by the magistrate.

I would allow the appeal, reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and quash the writ of certiorari issued by the
Superior Court.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Juveniles—Orders committing juveniles
to group homes—Orders charging cost of care of juveniles to
municipalities—Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, s. 20(1), (2).

Municipal law—Committal of juveniles to
group homes—Whether municipalities obliged to bear cost—Juvenile Delinquents
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, s. 20(1), (2).

Seven juveniles were found to be delinquent
by the Juvenile Court and were committed to the care of Viking Houses, a
division of Marshall Children’s Foundation, operators of “group homes”. The
committal orders were made pursuant to s. 20(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, and orders were made pursuant to s. 20(2)
charging the cost of the care to the respondent municipalities to which the
juveniles belonged. The committal orders did not identify the particular home
to which each juvenile was to go, it being left to the institution to decide on
the actual placement. The orders were challenged by the municipalities, some by
certiorari and the others by appeal under s. 37 of the Act, on the basis
that the juvenile

[Page 1135]

court judges had no power under s. 20(1) to
order placement in a group home and that s. 20(2) was ultra vires the
Parliament of Canada. John Holland J., before whom the challenges came,
concluded that s. 20(1) did not authorize the order made but held that
s. 20(2) was intra vires. The Court of Appeal agreed.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

As decided in the Courts below the placement
or committal order in question cannot be brought within the terms of s. 20(1).
Viking Houses, as a division of Marshall Children’s Foundation, is a business
enterprise, indeed a private enterprise which did not have the approval of the
provincial government required to bring it within the terms of s. 20(1)(h)
or (i). The provisions of paras. (d), (f) and (g)
of s. 20(1), on which the appellants relied, did not authorize the making of
the orders in question. No adjudication was made in respect of the
constitutionality of s. 20(2).

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This case, which is here by
leave of this Court, arises out of six orders of Juvenile Court Judges affecting
seven juveniles. They were found to be delinquents and were committed to the
care of Viking Houses, a division of Marshall Children’s Foundation, operators
of so-called “group homes”, pursuant to s. 20(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3. In addition, orders were made, pursuant to s.
20(2) of the Act, charging the cost of the care of the juveniles to the
Regional Municipality of Peel and to the Regional Municipality of Metropolitan
Toronto, as being the two municipalities to each of which the juveniles
belonged. Three were found to belong to Peel and four to Metropolitan Toronto.
The cost of care imposed upon the municipalities was either $37.25 or $43 per
day, payable to Viking Houses.

Viking Houses operates some thirteen houses in Ontario, known as group homes. The factum
of the appellant, the Attorney General of Ontario, describes these homes as
follows:

Each of these group homes is run by
professional staff, none of whom actually resides in the individual homes. The
aim and goal of the group home is to provide “the least institutional and
impersonal alternative” to the traditional or biological family unit, for
children who either lack a traditional family, or who for one reason or another
are unable to adapt to and to cope with the conditions in their traditional
family unit. The ideal which the group homes strives for is to preserve at
least some of the informality and intimacy of the traditional family unit, in
circumstances where the children can develop human relationships which are
intimate and informal, rather than highly structured and formalized, and where
the children may be recognized and may develop as individuals, rather than as
mere roles. A

[Page 1137]

group home is, in a sense, a blend of a
family and of a peer group.

I should note that the various orders committing
the juveniles to Viking Houses did not identify the particular residence to
which each of them was to go but was, so to speak, a general committal to 247
Coxwell Avenue, Toronto, which is the head office of the Viking Houses, and it
was thus left to the institution to decide on the actual placement.

The orders committing the juveniles and charging
the cost of their care to the appellant municipalities were challenged by the
latter by certiorari in respect of some of the orders and by appeal
under s. 37 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act in respect of others. The
grounds of challenge were that the Juvenile Court Judges had no power under s.
20(1) to order the juveniles to go to a group home and that, in any event, s.
20(2), authorizing the making of orders requiring a municipality to which a
juvenile belongs to contribute to his or her support where an order has been
made under s. 20(1), is ultra vires the Parliament of Canada. John
Holland J., before whom the challenges to the six orders came, concluded that
s. 20(1) of the Act did not authorize a Juvenile Court Judge to direct that a
delinquent juvenile be placed in a group home but he did go on to hold that s.
20(2) of the Act was intra vires. His judgment was, in both respects,
affirmed on appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal in reasons delivered on
behalf of that Court by Arnup J.A.

The Attorney General of Ontario and Viking Houses were given leave to appeal to this Court, their
immediate interest being to set aside the disqualification of group homes. The
two municipalities raised the constitutionality of s. 20(2), whether or not s.
20(1) authorized placement in group homes. The required notices of the
constitutional issue were given to the Attorney General of Canada and to the
Attorneys General of the Provinces and interventions were sought and allowed by
the Attorney General of Canada and by the Attorney General of Quebec.

[Page 1138]

At the conclusion of the hearing on the main
appeal, the Court announced that the appeals of the Attorney General of Ontario
and of Viking Houses failed. This affirmed the relief sought and obtained by
the respondent municipalities in the Courts below. In the result, this Court,
in accordance with its general practice not to embark upon the decision of a
constitutional issue unless necessary for the disposition of the case before
it, advised the parties and interveners that it would not adjudicate upon the
constitutional issue and the parties and interveners would not be heard on it.
However, it also advised that written reasons would be given for the
disposition of the main appeal and these now follow.

The Juvenile Delinquents Act is an old
statute, being still in substantially the same form and carrying the same
approach to juvenile delinquency and crime as when first enacted by 1908
(Can.), c. 40. It is unnecessary in this case to detail the efforts made
through governmental and non-governmental agencies, both federal and
provincial, to replace the Act with one more contemporary in its thrust. They
have not yet succeeded. None the less, there are guiding considerations in the
present Act which are intended to establish a regime and associated sanctions
emphasizing rehabilitative objects. They enjoin the Courts to a liberal construction
of the Act and a socially-oriented approach to juvenile delinquency under which
a balance would be achieved between the interests of a delinquent juvenile and
the interests of the community to which the juvenile belongs. I refer to three
such provisions, much relied on by the appellants in urging this Court, as they
urged the Courts below, to give the relevant provisions of s. 20(1) (to which I
will come shortly) a wide enough interpretation to support the authority of a
Juvenile Court Judge to order committal to a group home. They are ss. 3(2),
20(5) and 38 and they read as follows:

3. (2) Where a child is adjudged to have
committed a delinquency he shall be dealt with, not as an offender, but as one
in a condition of delinquency and therefore requiring help and guidance and
proper supervision.

[Page 1139]

20. (5) The action taken shall, in every
case, be that which the court is of opinion the child’s own good and the best
interests of the community require.

38. This Act shall be liberally construed
in order that its purpose may be carried out, namely, that the care and custody
and discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall approximate as nearly as may be
that which should be given by his parents, and that as far as practicable every
juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as criminal, but as a misdirected and
misguided child, and one needing aid, encouragement, help and assistance.

I have no difficulty in accepting these quoted
provisions as being more positive in their direction than the general direction
of s. 11 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23 that statutes
shall be deemed remedial and be given such fair, large and liberal construction
and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of their objects. That does
not, however, carry the consequence that the defined powers of a Junevile Court
Judge may be enlarged beyond what the language in which they are couched may
bear on the widest reading, so as to enable him to make dispositions which may
better accord with a more modern view of treatment of junevile delinquents.
Courts cannot turn their role of construction into one of naked legislating,
however well-disposed they may be to solutions proposed for problems which
arise under deficient legislation. The proper recourse in such situations is to
the legislature to repair the deficiencies in its statute.

I come now to s. 20(1) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, and especially to clauses (d), (f)
and (g), which were the provisions relied upon by the appellants to
support the committals in this case to Viking Houses. The present s. 20(1) is
the third form in which committal authority was vested in the Juvenile Court
Judge. In the original Act, the provision was s. 16(1) reading as follows:

16. In the case of a child proved to be a
juvenile delinquent the court may adjourn the hearing from time to time for any
definite or indefinite period; and may impose a fine not exceeding ten dollars,
or may commit the child to the care or custody of a probation officer or of any
other suitable person; or may allow the child to remain in its home, subject to
the visitation of a proba-

[Page 1140]

tion officer, such child to report to the
court or to the probation officer as often as may be required; or may cause the
child to be placed in a suitable family home as a foster home, subject to the
friendly supervision of a probation officer and the further order of the court;
or may commit the child to the charge of any children’s aid society, duly
organized under an Act of the legislature of the province and approved by the
Lieutenant Governor in Council, or, in any municipality in which there is no
children’s aid society, to the charge of the superintendent of neglected and
dependent children for the province, if one there be, duly appointed under the
authority of any such Act; or may commit the child, if a boy, to an industrial
school for boys, or, if a girl, to an industrial school or refuge for girls,
duly approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.

An amendment in 1924 (1924 (Can.), c. 53, ss. 2,
3) revised the section, introducing what is now clause (g), and
it was in the following terms, as s. 17(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C.
1927, c. 108:

17. In the case of a child proved to be a
juvenile delinquent the court may

(a) adjourn the hearing or
disposition of the case from time to time for any definite or indefinite
period; and

(b) impose a fine not
exceeding twenty-five dollars, or commit the child to the care or custody of a
probation officer or of any other suitable person; or

(c) allow the child to remain
in its home, subject to the visitation of a probation officer, such child to
report to the court or to the probation officer as often as may be required; or

(d) cause the child to be
placed in a suitable family home as a foster home, subject to the friendly
supervision of a probation officer and the further order of the court; and

(e) impose upon the
delinquent such further or other conditions as may be deemed advisable; or

(f) commit the child to the charge
of any children’s aid society, duly organized under an Act of the legislature
of the province and approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, or, in any
municipality in which there is no children’s aid society, to the charge of the
superintendent of neglected and dependent children for the province, if one
there be, duly appointed under the authority of any such Act; or

[Page 1141]

(g) commit the child, if a
boy, to an industrial school for boys, or, if a girl, to an industrial school
or refuge for girls, duly approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.

It was in this revision that the Court was
empowered to order the parents or the municipality to which a delinquent
juvenile belongs to contribute to its support.

Further slight revisions were made by 1929
(Can.), c. 46, s. 20, giving the subsection a form and wording which
passed into R.S.C. 1952, c. 160 as s. 20(1) and which is still its form and
wording in the present statute. The only change that need be noted here is the
splitting of clause (b) in s. 17(1) of the previous Act into two
clauses which became (c) and (d) of the provision as it
now stands. The present s. 20(1) reads as follows:

20. (1) In the case of a child adjudged to
be a juvenile delinquent the court may, in its discretion, take either one or
more of the several courses of action hereinafter in this section set out,
as it may in its judgment deem proper in the circumstances of the case:

(a) suspend final
disposition;

(b) adjourn the hearing or
disposition of the case from time to time for any definite or indefinite period;

(c) impose a fine not
exceeding twenty-five dollars, which may be paid in periodical amounts or
otherwise;

(d) commit the child to the
care or custody of a probation officer or of any other suitable person;

(e) allow the child to remain
in its home, subject to the visitation of a probation officer, such child to
report to the court or to the probation officer as often as may be required;

(f) cause the child to be placed in
a suitable family home as a foster home, subject to the friendly supervision of
a probation officer and the further order of the court;

(g) impose upon the
delinquent such further or other conditions as may be deemed advisable; 

(h) commit the child to the
charge of any children’s aid society, duly organized under an Act of the legislature
of the province and approved by the Lieutenant‑Governor in Council, or,
in any municipality in which there is no children’s aid society, to the charge
of the superintendent, if one there be; or

[Page 1142]

(i) commit the child to an
industrial school duly approved by the Lieutenant‑Governor in Council.

I preface consideration of clauses (d),
(f) and (g) of s. 20(1) by noting that Viking Houses,
as a division of Marshall Children’s Foundation, is, as John Holland J.
expressed it in examining its organization, “obviously a business enterprise”
and, indeed, a private enterprise which does not have the approval of the
provincial government to bring it within the class of institutions mentioned in
clauses (h) and (i) of s. 20(1). The fact that there are qualified
institutions under clauses (h) and (i) is of some
significance in determining whether Viking Houses can be brought within clause
(d), providing for committal “to the care or custody of a probation
officer or of any other suitable person”. The context persuades me, as it
persuaded the Courts below, that a corporation (and Viking Houses is, in fact,
a corporate enterprise) is not within the words “any other suitable person”.
Counsel for Viking Houses did not base any argument in his factum on clause (d),
but did seek to rely on it in oral argument in support of the submissions made
on behalf of the Attorney General of Ontario. He would have this Court look
behind the corporate entity to the persons to be charged with the care or
custody of the committed juveniles. However, no persons are named in the orders
under review.

The Court was directed to a recent, as yet
unreported, judgment of Van Camp J., in the case of In re T.J.N., The
Regional Municipality of Peel v. Thomas MacKenzie and Viking Houses, decided
on July 10, 1978, in which an order committing the juvenile to the care of one
Thomas MacKenzie, on condition that he keep the juvenile in the Viking program,
was upheld. Thomas MacKenzie was a supervisor with Viking Houses, and Van Camp
J. held that he was within the words “any other suitable person” under clause (d).
It was pointed out by counsel for Peel in this case, who also appeared in
the case before Madame Justice Van Camp, that it was not argued before her that
a corporation could qualify under clause (d) but only that “other
suitable persons” referred to public officials, a contention that she rejected.
I do

[Page 1143]

not pass upon the correctness of Van Camp J.’s
decision. It will be time enough to do so when it or a like case comes before
this Court. The present case is not of that kind.

It is worth observing that probation officers
(who are defined in s. 2(1) as meaning “any probation officer for juvenile
delinquents duly appointed under any provincial statute or this Act”) do not
have any physical accommodation at their disposal in which the care or custody
of a juvenile, given under clause (d), is maintained. There is a
contrast here with clauses (e) and (f), where the
probation officer has a role when the juvenile is allowed to remain in his or
her own home or is placed in a “suitable family home as a foster home”. I do
not say that committal under clause (d) to the care or custody of
“any other suitable person” necessarily excludes maintenance of the juvenile in
some home setting, but it does, it seems to me, envisage primarily the kind of
personal supervision that a probation officer gives, or that might be given,
say, by a member of the Big Brother movement. “Care” or “custody”, in my
opinion, has the connotation of personal care or custody in the context of
clause (d) and of the whole of s. 20(1). The orders under review
here are far removed from that in committing the juveniles to a corporate
institution with an unidentified and changing staff.

Reliance by the appellants on clause (f)
is also misconceived. I note that none of the orders in issue here make any
reference to supervision by a probation officer (which is a requirement under
clause (f)), but I do not eliminate resort to clause (f) on that
ground alone, since it would be possible to remit the orders for proper
amendment. What I find to be insuperable is the attempted equating of a
committal to faceless Viking Houses with placement “in a suitable family home
as a foster home”. It seems to me that there is merit in the contentions of the
respondents that, unless the word “family” is given a meaning envisaging a home
which is that of persons with blood or marital ties or the like, the word
“family” would be redundant if a group home operated by Viking Houses were

[Page 1144]

regarded as falling under clause (f). The
staff of Viking Houses, as noted by John Holland J. in his reasons, has no
permanency and does not generally live in the group home. Nor does Viking
Houses purport to maintain its group homes for juveniles who are related.
Holland J. also observed in his reasons that no one seriously argued before him
that Viking Houses could qualify under clause (f).

Counsel for the appellants sought to draw
comfort for an expanded meaning of the word “family” from a trio of cases, namely,
Ramsey v. Provincial Treasurer[3],
Dodge v. Boston and Providence Railroad Corp.[4], and McMahon v. Amityville Union
Free School District[5]. None
of these has an applicable context for ascribing to the words “suitable family
home” a meaning that would embrace the group homes of Viking Houses.

The Ramsey case concerned the taxability
of a personal corporation under an Alberta Income Tax Act, the definition of a “personal corporation”
covering control “directly or indirectly by one person who resides in Alberta or by one such person and his wife
or any members of his family or any combination of them...”. A father and son
held the controlling shares in a company and it was held, on appeal, that the
son, who was married and lived with his wife and children in a house of his own
apart from his father, was not a member of the father’s family within the
definition in the Act. The Court adopted the meaning of “family” stated in the Dodge
case, supra, which declared that the primary meaning was “the
collective body of persons who live in one house and under one head or
management”. However, as the Court pointed out, the word may be used in
different senses; and, certainly, even in the sense adopted from the Dodge case
to be applied to a taxing statute, the meaning is hardly apt for importation
into s. 20(1) and clause (f) thereof.

[Page 1145]

The Dodge case itself shows how much
context and purpose relate to meaning. There, the defendant railway had
covenanted with the grantor to it of a right of way that “the said grantor and
his family” should enjoy free travel on the railway. A grandchild of the
grantor claimed this right at a time when she no longer lived with her
grandfather (as she once did). The Court limited the word “family” to
membership in the household and thus the grandchild was excluded
notwithstanding the blood tie. The issue in the McMahon case was, inter
alia, whether eight black children, who resided in a group home (to which
they had been committed) in a certain school district, were entitled to be enrolled
in a school of the district as being members of a “family home” under the New
York Education Law. They were in the care of a husband and wife who had no
children of their own and lived in, acting as foster parents. It was held that
they were entitled to enrolment. Again, I see no parallel with the issue
arising under clause (f) of s. 20(1).

There was, finally, reliance by the appellants
on clause (g) of s. 20(1), introduced, as previously mentioned,
in 1924. It was the contention of the appellants that the power given to the
Court “to impose upon the delinquent such further or other conditions as may be
deemed advisable” was an independent authority to make an order of committal,
if that be thought advisable. Its independence was said to flow from the opening
words of s. 20(1), empowering the Court to take “either one or more of the
several courses of action hereinafter in this section set out”. I do not
think that these words add any force to clause (g) or to any of
the other clauses of s. 20(1) which they do not inherently possess under their
particular formulations. Not all the “courses of action” involve placement or
committal and the phrase is simply addressed to the Court to empower it to act
under any one or more of the clauses of s. 20(1). Nothing, in my opinion,
turns on the place of clause (g) in the specification of the
clauses of s. 20(1).

[Page 1146]

John Holland J. was of the view that clause (g)
did not give authority to make any placement or committal order but,
rather, was introduced to enable the Court to impose conditions (or, I would
say, terms) on a juvenile delinquent in association with a placement or
committal order made under other provisions of s. 20(1). This view was endorsed
by the Ontario Court of Appeal and reinforced by Arnup J.A. in noting that the
word “further” connoted the imposition of conditions in addition to any imposed
pursuant to other provisions of s. 20(1) and that, moreover, the placement of a
delinquent in a group home was not the imposition of a “condition” as envisaged
by clause (g).

It is enough, for the purposes of the present
case, to agree with the Courts below that clause (g) does not
authorize a placement or committal order. It would be a strange reading of the
clause, not only grammatically but functionally, to hold that it embraces
placement or committal orders—without limitation of where or to whom—in the
face of specific provisions to those ends in clauses (d), (e),
(f), (h) and (i).

An application of clause (g) is
seen in R. v. Stral[6] where,
in the case of a juvenile found to be delinquent, he was required to deliver
his driver’s licence to the Court, the licence to be accordingly suspended for
four months. It does not appear from the report of the case whether the
Juvenile Court Judge put the delinquent under the care of a probation officer
pursuant to either clause (d) or clause (e) or
whether he suspended disposition for the four‑month period pursuant to
clause (a) or clause (b). In short, it is not clear
whether the licence suspension pursuant to clause (g) was related
to one of such courses of action. I should think that would be necessary.

Another illustration of the application of
clause (g) is found in R. v. Dapic,[7] where a juvenile adjudged to be
delinquent was put on probation and under a condition that he attend a certain
wilderness camp for approximately a five-week period. Although this could be
regarded as a form

[Page 1147]

of temporary detention, it does not support the
contention of the appellants that clause (g) may be used to order
committal to a group home.

I should add, in concluding these reasons, that
the dismissal of the appeals announced at the conclusion of the hearing was
without any order as to costs.

Appeals dismissed, no order as to costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Narcotic
drugs—Trafficking—Analyst’s certificate referring to package bearing different
date from one identified by arresting officer as one sent for analysis—No
evidence motion granted at trial—Whether accused given reasonable notice of
Crowns intention to use certificate at trial—Whether some evidence that
substance analyzed same substance as that purchased by police officer from
accused.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed
a Crown appeal against the acquittal of the appellant upon a charge of
trafficking in cannabis marihuana. The appeal to this Court involved the
significance of a discrepancy between the certificate of the analyst produced
at the trial and the evidence of the arresting officer (a member of the
Victoria City Police Force) who purchased a substance alleged to be cannabis
marihuana from the appellant. While a security envelope received by the analyst
from the Victoria Police Force bore the same number as the security envelope
received in return by the Victoria Police Force, the analyst’s certificate
stated that the material analyzed had been removed from a plastic bag marked
“PL7/Mar/76”. This was in conflict with the evidence of the police officer who
said he marked the plastic bag “PL9/Mar/76”.

The certificate was tendered by the Crown and
admitted in evidence. No objection was taken by the appellant and after a brief
examination of the police officer the Crown closed its case. Counsel for the
appellant then moved to have the case dismissed upon the basis that the Crown
had adduced no evidence that the substance purchased by the officer from the
accused was marihuana. The motion was granted and the appellant was acquitted.

In the Court of Appeal the majority considered
that the trial judge had disposed of the case on a no evidence basis and
allowed the appeal because they were of the view that some evidence had been
put before the Court and that the motion should have failed. Farris C.J.B.C.

[Page 997]

was of the opinion that the trial judge
dismissed the charge because no reasonable notice had been given of the Crown’s
intention to use the analyst’s certificate—a view not shared by this Court—and
therefore the certificate ought to have been excluded. He would have dismissed
the appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The appellant argued firstly that because of
the discrepancy between the evidence of the police officer and the certificate,
that is, the difference in date, the notice given was not reasonable since,
because of the discrepancy, it did not refer to matters which were alleged in
the information. This argument could not succeed. The Crown gave ample notice,
more than four months, of its intention to produce the certificate in evidence.
It did so. The Crown did at the trial what it said it would do in the notice,
no more and no less. The appellant was fully aware of the contents of the
certificate to be produced at trial.

The appellant’s second principal submission
could be put in this way. The analyst’s certificate, referring as it does to a
package bearing a different date from the one identified by the police officer
as the one he sent for analysis, has not established any connection between the
appellant and the substance analyzed. Therefore there was no evidence which
could go in proof of the charge, that is, that the appellant trafficked in
marihuana on the 9th of March 1976.

Section 9(1) of the Narcotic Control Act provides
that the certificate is admissible in evidence in a prosecution for an offence
under s. 7(1) of the Act. The certificate of analysis was therefore
properly admitted and it was evidence that something was analyzed and found to
be marihuana. This by itself was not sufficient for as stated in Regina v.
Millier and Cyr (1968), 65 W.W.R. 96, at p. 98, (affirmed [1969]
S.C.R. 955), “a certificate merely stating that some green plant material was
analyzed would be simply meaningless”, and in view of the date discrepancy this
certificate said little more. It was vital to the Crown’s case that it show
that the substance analyzed was the same substance as that purchased by the
police officer from the appellant. If there were no evidence of that fact when
the Crown closed its case, the trial judge was correct in acquitting. If,
however, evidence existed, the matter should have proceeded and at the
conclusion of the trial the trial judge should have weighed the evidence and
reached a conclusion.

[Page 998]

There was evidence before the trial judge to
identify the substance purchased with the substance analyzed. It was to be
found in the certificate itself and the evidence of the police officer which
identified the substance purchased with the substance sent to the analyst and
the substance received in return. The certificate could not be sufficient in
itself since the date discrepancy prevented the certificate alone from
establishing a connection between the accused and the substance analyzed. When
it was coupled with the police officer’s evidence, however, an evidentiary
connection was made, that is, some evidence was provided which connected the
accused with the substance analyzed.

Therefore it was error on the part of the
trial judge to dismiss the charge upon the ground that he did and the Court of
Appeal was right in directing a new trial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia[1],
allowing an appeal by the Crown against the acquittal of the appellant upon a
charge of trafficking in cannabis marihuana. Appeal dismissed.

Jeffrey Green and Melvin Hunt, for the
appellant.

D.R. Kier, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This is an appeal from the British
Columbia Court of Appeal which allowed a Crown appeal against the acquittal of
the appellant upon a charge of trafficking in cannabis marihuana. It involves
the significance of a discrepancy between the certificate of the analyst
produced at the trial and the evidence of the arresting officer who purchased a
substance alleged to be cannabis marihuana from the appellant.

The appellant was charged that he did on the 9th
day of March 1976 traffic in cannabis marihuana. At his trial, which took place
on March 10, 1977, he pleaded not guilty. The Crown called only one witness, a
Corporal Lawson of the Victoria City Police Force, who gave evidence of making
a purchase of a bag of green plant-like material from the appellant for $20. He
swore that he took the bag to the police station and marked it with his
initials “P.L.” and the date “9/Mar/76”

[Page 999]

on the inside of the bag. He then sealed the bag
with a piece of tape and put his initials “P.L.” on the tape and the date
“9/Mar/76”. He then placed the bag in a security envelope numbered E. 96092 and
filled in the form on the front of the envelope in his own handwriting. This
process involved writing his name, his regimental number 163, and the words
“Victoria City Police, 625 Fisgard Street, Victoria, B.C.”. He then put the
envelope in his locker at the police station. On March 26, 1976, he removed the
envelope from the locker, placed it in a larger envelope, and sent it by
registered mail to the Health Protection Branch in Vancouver where the analyst
whose certificate was sought was located. The registration receipt issued by
the Post Office bore No. 3818. He testified that on April 28th he received an
envelope containing the security envelope together with an original and a copy
of a certificate of analysis through the mail. He tendered the security
envelope in evidence at the preliminary hearing. He compared the original
certificate of analysis with the copy which accompanied it. On October 26,
1976, more than four months before the trial, he served the appellant with a
copy of the certificate and a notice of intention to use the certificate in
evidence. He swore that the security envelope and its contents, which he
received back from the analyst, were the same articles which he had sent for
analysis. He recognized them by his handwriting on the envelope, his name and
service number, and the number of the envelope. He recognized the bag
containing the purchased substance, which had been enclosed with the security
envelope in the larger envelope, by his initials and the date “9/Mar/76” which
he had put upon it.

At this point I should say that I have examined
the original exhibits filed at the trial and I observe that the security
envelope bears, in addition to the writing recognized and identified by the
police officer, in the section “Name of Analyst”, the handwritten
inscription “B. Walker” and beneath it the number 9818-5. The handwriting is in
writing not dissimilar from the signature of the analyst appearing on the
certificate of analysis and the number 9818-5 written on the security envelope
is the number of the analyst’s certificate. I set out below the certificate and
the notice of intent to produce.

[Page 1000]



[Page 1001]



[Page 1002]



[Page 1003]



[Page 1004]

It will be seen at once that while the security
envelope received by the analyst from the Victoria Police Force bore the same
number as the security envelope received in return by the Victoria Police
Force, that is No. E96092, the analyst’s certificate says that the material
analyzed had been removed from a plastic bag marked “PL 7/Mar/76”. This, of
course, is in conflict with the evidence of the police officer who said he
marked the plastic bag “PL 9/Mar/76” and it is this discrepancy which has
caused these proceedings.

The certificate was tendered by the Crown and
admitted in evidence. No objection was taken by the appellant and after a brief
examination of the police officer the Crown closed its case. Counsel for the
appellant then moved to have the case dismissed upon the basis that the Crown
had adduced no evidence that the substance purchased by the officer from the
accused was marihuana. The motion was granted and the appellant was acquitted.

Despite some uncertainty in the trial judge’s
reasons and some disagreement in the Court of Appeal as to the reason for
acquittal, it seems clear to me that the trial judge acquitted the appellant
upon concluding that the Crown had adduced no evidence of guilt. Certainly the
appellant’s motion was to that effect. The reasons for judgment concluded with
these words:

In order to come within the meaning of the
Statute, I rule that there must be a compliance, a sufficient compliance, with
the provisions of the Statute, to enable the Accused person to know precisely
the nature of the case against him. The Crown has failed to do that, in my
judgment, and is not, therefore, entitled to rely on the Certificate of
Analysis of the analyst, and, accordingly, there is no evidence, apart from the
Certificate, to implicate the accused with the offences as charged, and,
accordingly, I must allow the motion, and dismiss the charge.

In the Court of Appeal the majority considered
that the trial judge had disposed of the case on a no evidence basis and
allowed the appeal because they were of the view that some evidence had been
put before the Court and that the motion should have failed. Farris C.J.B.C.
was of the opinion that

[Page 1005]

the trial judge dismissed the charge because no
reasonable notice had been given of the Crown’s intention to use the analyst’s
certificate—a view I cannot share—and therefore the certificate ought to have
been excluded. He would have dismissed the appeal.

The appellant raised two principal arguments. He
argued firstly, as I understood him, that because of the discrepancy between
the evidence of the police officer and the certificate, that is, the difference
in date, the notice given was not reasonable since, because of the discrepancy,
it did not refer to matters which were alleged in the information. The
appellant relied on Regina v. Henri[2] for the proposition that a notice
must be reasonable both in time and in content. He argued that the notice in
the case before us was unreasonable on the basis of the Henri case. In
my opinion, the date discrepancy in the certificate before us in no way
approaches the lapses on the part of the Crown found in Henri. The
notices in that case were completely inadequate and as Branca J.A. said at
p. 56:

If one deliberately tried to draft a notice
which would be quite totally and completely confused and confusing and embody
complete uncertainty one would be hard put to excel the uncertainties, the
inaccuracies, and the confusion contained in each of the notices that I have
analyzed.

This is far from the situation here. The Crown
gave ample notice, more than four months, of its intention to produce the
certificate in evidence. It did so. The Crown did at the trial what it said it
would do in the notice, no more and no less. The appellant was fully aware of
the contents of the certificate to be produced at trial. In my view, this
argument must fail. The weight the certificate was entitled to receive is
another question but it is not touched in the notice argument.

I now turn to the second submission. I would put
it this way. The analyst’s certificate, referring as it does to a package
bearing a different date from the one identified by the police officer as the
one

[Page 1006]

he sent for analysis, has not established any
connection between the appellant and the substance analyzed. Therefore there
was no evidence which could go in proof of the charge, that is, that the
appellant trafficked in marihuana on the 9th of March 1976.

This argument must be considered in the light of
s. 9 of the Narcotic Control Act. Subsection (1) provides that
the certificate is admissible in evidence in a prosecution for an offence under
s. 7(1) of the Act. The certificate of analysis was therefore properly
admitted and it was evidence that something was analyzed and found to be
marihuana. This by itself was not sufficient for, as Maclean J.A. said for the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in Regina v. Millier and Cyr[3], at p. 98, “a certificate
merely stating that some green plant material was analyzed would be simply
meaningless”, and in view of the date discrepancy this certificate says little
more. It is vital to the Crown’s case that it show that the substance analyzed
was the same substance as that purchased by the police officer from the
appellant. If there were no evidence of that fact when the Crown closed its
case, the trial judge was correct in acquitting. If, however, evidence existed,
the matter should have proceeded and at the conclusion of the trial the trial
judge should have weighed the evidence and reached a conclusion.

In my opinion, there was evidence before the
trial judge to identify the substance purchased with the substance analyzed. It
is to be found in the certificate itself and the evidence of the police officer
which identified the substance purchased with the substance sent to the analyst
and the substance received in return. The certificate could not be sufficient
in itself since the date discrepancy prevents the certificate alone from
establishing a connection between the accused and the substance analyzed. When
it is coupled with the police officer’s evidence, however, an evidentiary
connection is made, that is, some evidence is provided which connects the
accused with the substance analyzed. The police officer swore to the identity
of the articles sent for analysis with those which he

[Page 1007]

received in return. He recognized the security
envelope in which the certificate and a copy were returned by its number and
the notations he had made upon it and upon the bag containing the drugs. The
security envelope contained the notation identifying the analyst and the number
of the certificate was written upon it. The certificate contained reference to
the notations made by the officer on the security envelope. Such notations may
provide further evidence of the identity of the substance analyzed and referred
to in the certificate. (See Regina v. Millier and Cyr, supra.) The
only discrepancy was the two day date difference. It was error to dismiss the
charge on the motion presented. In my view, Craig J.A. of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal was correct when he said there was some evidence of guilt and
that the no evidence motion should have failed.

Whether the trial judge, if the trial had
continued, would have found the case proved in the face of the uncertainties
caused by the date discrepancy may be doubtful. This is a question, however,
which is not before this Court. There was, as I have said, evidence before the
trial judge which it was his duty to weigh before reaching a conclusion. It was
error on his part to dismiss the charge upon the ground that he did. The
majority of the Court of Appeal was right in directing a new trial and I would
dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

                   Appellant was charged with first degree murder for
the death of his two adopted sons. As a consequence of his wife's difficulties
in adapting to the two boys' presence in the family, appellant had agreed to
leave the family home with them. Throughout the separation, the entire family
continued to meet but little progress towards reunification was made. His wife
still felt that she could not manage with the boys in the family. According to
appellant's testimony, one night, after a family supper, he told his wife that
he could no longer support two houses and that they had to come back together.
She became upset but finally gave him the impression that she accepted. The
wife and two daughters left around 8:00 p.m. At that time, the two boys were
already in bed. Appellant went to bed upstairs sometime after 10:00 p.m. and
was later awakened by the smell of smoke. He went downstairs and found the two
boys lying dead on a burning mattress. A police officer arrived shortly after
appellant's call at 1:00 a.m. and found the front door unlocked ‑‑
a fact presumably known by the appellant since he made no attempt to open the
door to the officer.

 

                   At trial, a fire expert testified that the fire had
been deliberately set and a pathologist gave evidence that the two boys were dead
before the fire began but he was unable to determine the precise cause of the
death. He estimated the time of death between 10:00 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.
Appellant gave evidence on his own behalf and adduced character evidence to the
effect that he was a kind and affectionate father who appeared to be genuinely
interested in the welfare of the two boys. Appellant's wife did not testify.

 

                   Convicted of second degree murder, appellant
appealed to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code . This section enables a court of appeal to allow an appeal from
conviction ""where it is of the opinion that the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence"". A majority of that Court dismissed the appeal. The present
appeal is to determine (1) whether the Court of Appeal failed to apply the
correct test for s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the Code where, as here, the
evidence against the appellant is entirely circumstantial; and (2) whether the
Court erred in failing to consider the absence of a material witness ‑‑
appellant's wife ‑‑ in determining whether the verdict is one that
a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.

 

                    Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Under s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the Code, a
court of appeal is required to decide whether the verdict of the jury was
unreasonable. While this involves a reconsideration of the facts, it also
requires the court to resolve a question of law by giving legal content to the
concept of ""unreasonable"". The application of the proviso thus always
involves a question of law and it is reviewable in this Court on appeal under
s. 618  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   The function of a court of appeal, under s. 613(1)(a)(i)
of the Code, goes beyond merely finding that there is evidence to
support a conviction. The court must determine on the whole of the evidence
""whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting
judicially, could reasonably have rendered"". While the court of appeal
must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the
test the court must re‑examine and to some extent reweigh and consider
the effect of the evidence. This process is the same whether the case is based
on circumstantial or direct evidence. In the Court of Appeal, the majority
found that there was sufficient evidence to justify the verdict and rejected
all rational inferences offering an alternative to the conclusion of guilt. It
is therefore clear that the law was correctly understood and applied.

 

                   This Court, in considering an appeal where the sole
issue raised is the application of s. 613(1) (a)(i), must put itself in
the place of the Court of Appeal and, pursuant to the powers given in s. 623(1)
of the Code, consider the matter anew and, if error be found, make such
order as the Court of Appeal should have made. Where it is shown that a crime
has been committed and the incriminating evidence against the accused is
primarily evidence of opportunity, the guilt of the accused is not the only
rational inference which can be drawn unless the accused had exclusive
opportunity. In a case where evidence of opportunity is accompanied by other
inculpatory evidence, something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice. In
the present case, a review of the evidence indicated that there was evidence
upon which a properly charged jury could reasonably have reached the conclusion
that appellant had a motive to kill the boys and that he had exclusive
opportunity to do so. There was no evidence of the presence of any other
persons, save the two boys, in the house that evening.

 

                   Finally, appellant's contention that the Crown
failed to call a witness, his wife, essential to the unfolding of the narrative
must fail. While the Crown may not be required to call a given witness, the
Crown's failure to call a witness may leave a gap in its case which will leave
the Crown's burden of proof undischarged and entitle the accused to an
acquittal. In this case, however, the assumption that appellant's wife had
something to say to complete the narrative rests on nothing more than
speculation as there was no evidence that she was present or possessed any
knowledge of what occurred.

2                 The appellant, Tomas Yebes, a
hairdresser, and his wife, Elvira, lived in the municipality of Surrey, near
Vancouver, with their two daughters, one born in 1971 and the other in 1973.
For some time, Mr. and Mrs. Yebes had been concerned with the plight of young
children in the poorer countries of the world, and in 1977 they began lengthy
procedures aimed at the adoption of two Chilean children. In 1979, two boys
were brought to Canada to reside with the Yebes family with a view to formal
adoption. One boy, named Gabriel, was born in September 1974, and the other,
Yerko (Tommy), in September 1975. The boys, it appears, did not fit as readily
into their new home as had been hoped. Mrs. Yebes complained of difficulties
with the boys because they would not accept and comply with the rules she had
established for the family. Mr. Yebes thought that his wife was too strict in
her management of the boys. These differences led to increasing domestic
conflict and, in July 1981, both Mr. and Mrs. Yebes sought the assistance of a
psychiatrist. Professional assistance did not, however, resolve their problems.
In September of 1981, at about the time the boys were formally adopted, Mrs.
Yebes had reached the stage where she could no longer tolerate the boys in her
home and the couple agreed to separate for a period of three to six months. Mrs.
Yebes remained in the family home with the two daughters, and Mr. Yebes moved
with the two boys to a rented town house in a housing development a short
distance from the family home. Mr. Yebes assumed responsibility for the
maintenance of the boys and for paying the rent on the town house, the mortgage
on the family home, and the utility bills. In addition, he saw to the care of
the boys, preparing their meals, insuring they attended school, and arranging
for day care when he was busy at work. Mrs. Yebes drew upon her savings to
maintain herself and the two girls.

 

3                 Throughout the separation the entire
family continued to meet. There were family dinners and visits, but there was
little progress toward a complete reunion and both Mr. and Mrs. Yebes were
worried and concerned about the situation. It seems that they both wanted to
end the separation but Mrs. Yebes was apprehensive about the boys. She did not
feel that she could manage with them in the family and expressed the wish that
they be readopted. On January 28, 1982, Mr. Yebes made inquiries regarding
readoption and upon learning that there would be delays and difficulties, asked
a family support worker to give him a letter saying that the boys could not be
readopted. This, he explained, might persuade Mrs. Yebes to accept the boys and
allow the family to be reunited. The period of separation was approaching six
months and Mr. Yebes admitted that he had to move back soon with his wife
because the lease on his town house was going to expire at the end of February.

 

4                 This was the state of affairs on
February 23, 1982. According to the evidence, Mr. Yebes and his wife had
planned a supper for the whole family at the town house that night. Mr. Yebes
picked the boys up at the day care centre at about 6:00 p.m. and took them home
to the town house. Mrs. Yebes and the two girls arrived at about 6:10 p.m. The
family had supper at about 6:30 p.m. and then Yebes and his wife went to the
bedroom and talked for half an hour about the domestic situation they were
facing. Yebes described the conversation with his wife in his testimony at
trial in these words:

 

I told my wife that we
have to come back together. The reason for it was that I told her that
financially we cannot stay separate. I could not support two households for
much longer. I told her that there is no way. We had to come together, and she
started to cry, and she got mad, upset, but she calmed down and she did give me
the impression that she accepted what I told her. Thereafter we came down.

 

 

5                 Mrs. Yebes left the town house between
8:00 and 8:05 p.m. to attend a single parents' meeting somewhere in Surrey. She
took the two girls with her and there is no evidence whatever of her presence
in the town house after her departure until she returned at Yebes' request
after the police had arrived and the bodies of the two boys had been
discovered.

 

6                 According to Yebes' evidence, the boys
were already in bed when his wife and two daughters left the town house at
about 8:00 p.m. Tommy, the younger, was sleeping in the upstairs bedroom which
adjoined Yebes' bedroom and Gabriel was sleeping downstairs on a mattress in a
small utility room. The boys had formerly slept in bunk beds in the upstairs
bedroom but, according to Yebes, he found it necessary to separate them because
they kept each other awake when together. Yebes said that he went to bed at
about 10:00 p.m. in the main upstairs bedroom. He put on a stereo headset with
a long lead running downstairs to the stereo set, so he could listen to music
while in bed. He went downstairs at about 10:45 p.m. to change the tape. He
returned and after awhile fell asleep, only to be later awakened by a noise.
Thinking it was one of the boys going to the bathroom or one of the neighbours
in an adjoining apartment, he went back to sleep. Aroused a second time by the
smell of smoke, he went downstairs to see if it was caused by his pipe and
found the room full of smoke. He went to the utility room where the boy,
Gabriel, was sleeping, and was able to push open the door. Inside, he saw the
two boys lying on a burning mattress. They were covered and it appeared as if
they had made no move to escape. He tried to pull one of the boys out but upon
reaching the living‑room he noticed that the boy's body was stiff and
lifeless. He then called the police.

 

7                 The police call was received by
Sergeant Shaw, of the R.C.M.P., at 1:00 a.m. on February 24. He arrived at the
town house within minutes of the call. When Shaw arrived, Yebes was at a window
on the second level of the building shouting, ""In here, in here"". The
police officer entered by the front door which he found to be closed but
unlocked, a fact presumably known to Yebes, since he made no attempt to open
the door for the officer. The police officer immediately proceeded up a flight
of steps to the second level and into the living‑room which was filled
with smoke. He at once saw one of the boys outside the door of the utility
room. The boy was obviously dead. He looked into the utility room and saw the
second boy, also dead, face down on the mattress. The mattress was still on
fire with a noticeable flame. While the officer was making these observations,
Yebes was on the telephone speaking to his wife. Shaw heard him say to her,
""They're dead, they're dead"".

 

8                  Another police officer, Constable
Harrington, arrived, followed by firemen who extinguished the fire in the
mattress. Harrington observed that Mr. Yebes was confused and detached. Mrs.
Yebes arrived and spoke to Mr. Yebes for about ten minutes. Following this
conversation, Mr. Yebes was escorted by Harrington to a police car in order to
make a statement. After making the statement, Yebes indicated that his hands
and feet had been burned in the attempt to rescue the boys, and Harrington took
him to a hospital for treatment.

 

9                 In the further course of the
investigation, the police found a dry bloodstain permeating the bedclothes on
the upstairs bed where Tommy slept. Later, tests revealed that the blood was
consistent with Tommy's blood type. They also found a damp stain in the bed.
Sergeant Shaw thought it was urine, but this was never confirmed because the
police laboratory was not equipped to test for urine. A butane lighter was
found downstairs in the utility room. The lighter was open in a position which
allowed the butane gas to escape. The lighter sparked when first tested, but it
did not produce a flame. It was then filled with butane from a container on the
mantelpiece and tested again. It ignited immediately producing a six‑inch
flame. When the lighter was shown to Mr. Yebes he acknowledged that it was his,
but stated that ""it did not work for [a] long time"". At trial he
explained that he had said this because the lighter leaked butane gas and
normally became empty half an hour after filling.

 

10               At trial, a fire expert, Mr. Hardman, was
called to give evidence on the cause of fire. He concluded that the fire had
been deliberately set. He testified that the burn pattern on the mattress
indicated that fire had not started at a single location and spread. Rather, it
had started at three separate locations. The burn pattern revealed further that
the fire had been started using a flammable liquid accelerant, such as
gasoline, paint thinner or alcohol, although no container was found in or about
the premises. Mr. Hardman was satisfied that the fire could not have been
caused by the butane lighter alone. He also concluded that there was no
evidence that the fire had been an explosive or flash fire.

 

11               Further expert evidence clearly proved
that the two boys were dead before the fire began. Fire tests were conducted in
the utility room by burning a mattress under controlled conditions. These tests
indicated that the fire of February 23 would have produced large quantities of
carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and soot within a few minutes of starting. A
toxicologist examined samples of blood taken from the boys and found only
minute traces, not exceeding normally expected levels, of carbon monoxide in
the hemoglobin and no traces of hydrogen cyanide. He also tested the blood for
a wide range of poisons and drugs and found none. An autopsy was performed on
the two boys on February 24, 1982. The pathologist, Doctor Cave, examined the
mouths, throats and lungs of the children and found no evidence of carbon
particles or staining. He also found no evidence of searing or singeing of the
bodies consistent with death caused by a flash fire. Based on his findings and
the findings of the toxicologist, Doctor Cave concluded that the boys must have
been dead before the fire started. Although Doctor Cave could rule out fire as
the cause of death, he could not determine the exact cause of death because of
the condition of the bodies. There was no evidence to suggest that the boys had
died of natural causes and the circumstances alone seemed to rule out this
possibility. However, Doctor Cave was able to state that the condition of the
bodies was consistent with death by asphyxiation. Doctor Cave made an attempt
to estimate the time of death by an examination of the stomach contents. He
said that this was an imprecise method of determining the time of death but,
based on his findings, he considered it unlikely that the boys were alive four
to six hours after their last meal. The evidence established that their last
meal had been eaten at about 6:30 p.m., which puts the time of death at not
later than 12:30 a.m. and possibly before 10:30 p.m.

 

12               When the police learned that the boys had
not died in the fire they immediately interviewed both Mr. and Mrs. Yebes. Mr.
Yebes was distraught at the outset of the interview and became more upset as he
described the discovery of the bodies. When the police officer, Sergeant
Tilley, told him that the evidence indicated that the boys had not died as a
result of the fire, Mr. Yebes completely broke down.

 

13               Evidence was also led at trial of an
event which occurred on February 7, 1982, approximately two weeks before the
death of the boys. Mr. Yebes called the police that night and complained of a
fire in the boys' bedroom which adjoined his own room. When a police officer
arrived he found a candle on a plate in the bedroom and evidence that a fire
had occurred. The boys explained that the fire had been caused by a
""monster"" who had been in the room. The officer examined the premises
and found no evidence of entry through the doors or windows. He also examined
the outside fence which could have been used by an intruder to gain access to
the bedroom window, but the new frost on the fence had not been disturbed. He
concluded that the boys had been playing with fire and had told the tale of the
monster to avoid reprimand.

 

14               There is one further piece of evidence
which should be noted. At trial, Mr. Yebes was asked whether or not he had
locked his front door on the evening the boys died. Mr. Yebes replied that,
while he could not specifically recall locking the door that night, he locked
the door every night and therefore believed that he would have locked it that
night as well. He was then asked whether he had unlocked the door at any time that
night and he answered that he had not. From this evidence, one would have
expected the door to be locked when Sergeant Shaw first arrived that night and,
more importantly, one would have expected Yebes to believe the door was locked.
And yet, when Shaw arrived the door was unlocked and Yebes appeared to know the
door was unlocked since he made no move to go downstairs to let the officer
inside. Instead, from the second floor he simply shouted to the officer,
""In here, in here"".

 

15               Yebes was charged with two counts of
first degree murder arising out of the death of the two boys. He was convicted
of second degree murder on each count before Wallace J. and a jury. He gave
evidence on his own behalf and adduced character evidence to the effect that he
was a kind and affectionate father who appeared to be genuinely interested in
the welfare of the two boys. The evidence also disclosed the efforts made by
Yebes and his wife to adopt and care for the boys. Mrs. Yebes did not give evidence
at the trial.

 

16               An appeal to the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia (Craig, Macdonald and Hutcheon JJ.A.) was dismissed with
Hutcheon J.A. dissenting. The sole ground of appeal in the Court of Appeal was
that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or
that it could not be supported on the evidence, pursuant to s. 613(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code . Craig J.A. followed Corbett v. The Queen,
[1975] 2 S.C.R. 275, and stated that the test under s. 613(1) (a)(i) is
""whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting
judicially, could reasonably have rendered"". He found that the verdict was
reasonable, stating:

 

Although I think that the
jury could reasonably conclude that Yebes did have a motive for unlawfully
causing the death of the two boys in this case, I think, also, that the jury
could reasonably conclude that regardless of motive Yebes had exclusive
opportunity to commit the crime. Motive is immaterial if the opportunity to
commit the crime is shown to have been exclusive: Imrich v. The Queen
(1977) 75 D.L.R. (3d) 244.

 

He further rejected the submission of counsel for the appellant that
the Crown could not rely on the proposition of exclusive opportunity because it
had failed to call Mrs. Yebes. Following Lemay v. The King, [1952] 1
S.C.R. 232, he stated:

 

 . . . counsel acting for
the prosecution has a complete discretion as to what witnesses he will call and
that a court will not interfere with the exercise of this discretion "". .
. unless perhaps it could be shown that the prosecutor had been influenced by
some oblique motive"" (Kerwin, J. at p. 240), or "". . . so long as he
exercises it fairly . . . ."" (Davey, J.A. in R. v. Haase (1965) 45
C.R. 113 at 119). Defence counsel did not at trial, or on appeal, suggest that
in not calling Mrs. Yebes as a witness Crown counsel "". . . influenced by
some oblique motive . . ."" had exercised his discretion unfairly.

 

                   

17                Macdonald J.A. agreed that Corbett,
supra, was the governing decision in the case although he expressed concern
about the apparent discrepancies in the statements of the test for s. 613(1) (a)(i)
found in Pigeon J.'s judgment. He stated that:

 

                   As to
this appeal, I agree with Mr. Justice Craig that 12 reasonable jurors, acting
judicially, could have found the appellant guilty of murder of the boys. I
would only add this with respect to the element of opportunity. The following
statement from the respondent's factum, with the additional words of mine which
are underlined, is valid:

 

                               

                   ""The
reality of the situation here was that only the accused was present in this
self‑contained suite with the two children. There can be no realism to
any suggestion that an individual could break into or enter the house,
accomplish the death of the children, place them on a mattress and set the
fire. There is no suggestion in the evidence that any such event or events
occurred nor indeed could they occur without the accused being aware of the
commotion such actions would cause.""

 

 

18                Hutcheon J.A., in dissent, also saw Corbett
as the governing decision but, like Macdonald J.A., found Pigeon J.'s statement
of the law to be somewhat unclear. In Corbett, Pigeon J. stated, at p.
279, that the test under s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code  is
whether ""the verdict is such that no twelve reasonable men could possibly
have reached it acting judicially"". Later, at p. 282, he stated that the
test is ""whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting
judicially, could reasonably have rendered"". Hutcheon J.A. thought that
the word ""possibly"" in the first formulation was inappropriate and he
adopted Pigeon J.'s second formulation as a more faithful rendition of the law.
Applying this test, he concluded that the jury's verdict was unreasonable. He
was of the view that evidence of motive was insignificant and that there was
insufficient evidence to justify a finding of exclusive opportunity on the part
of Yebes. In conclusion, he stated that ""the cumulative effect of the
facts on which motive and opportunity are based does not support"" the
proposition that Yebes' guilt was the only rational inference to be drawn from
the evidence.

 

19               In this Court, the appellant raised three
grounds of appeal but they may be conveniently expressed in two propositions.
First, the Court of Appeal failed to apply the correct test for s. 613(1)(a)(i)
of the Code where, as here, the evidence against the appellant is
entirely circumstantial. Secondly, the Court erred in failing to consider the
absence of a material witness (Mrs. Yebes) in determining whether the verdict
is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably
have rendered. No attack was made against the trial judge's charge to the jury.

 

20               As a general proposition, the verdict at
trial will stand where there is evidence before the jury going in proof of all
elements of the offence and where the trial judge has properly charged the jury
on all matters of law which arise in the case and has made such references to
the evidence as may be necessary to facilitate the application of the law to
the facts. However, s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code  provides
an additional basis for the challenging of the verdict at trial. A court of
appeal may allow an appeal against a conviction where it is of the opinion that
the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot
be supported by the evidence. It may be thought that this subsection does not
in a strict sense raise a question of law which would give a right to appeal to
this Court under s. 618(1)(a) of the Code. Indeed, the respondent
Crown asserted in its factum that there was no point of law dividing the
minority and the majority of the Court of Appeal in this case. This argument
was not, however, strongly pressed on the hearing of the appeal and, in my
view, cannot be sustained. It is frequently difficult to draw a clear line
between a question of law and a question of fact. While the law can be stated
in isolation from the facts, abstract statements of law unconnected to facts
are vague and elusive. Even when two judges state the law in precisely the same
terms each may actually differ in his understanding of the law and the
requirements for its application. Therefore, whether or not an appeal raises a
question of law can only be determined after an examination of both the
statements of law and the application of the law to the facts in the courts
below. Under s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the Code, a court of appeal is
required to decide whether the verdict of the jury was unreasonable. While this
involves a reconsideration of the facts, it also requires the court to resolve
a question of law by giving legal content to the concept of
""unreasonable"". This same point was made recently by this court in Mahoney
v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, where the Court was called upon to
determine whether a question of law is raised by the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
which allows the Court to dismiss an appeal notwithstanding an error of law at
trial, provided that ""no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred"". Speaking for Laskin C.J., Ritchie and Estey JJ., and myself, I
stated, at pp. 852‑53, that:

 

                          The authorities which have been referred to
make it clear, in my view, that this Court has long considered that the
application of the proviso involves a question of law and it has entertained
appeals where error in its application has been alleged. It has been shown that
the proviso may be applied only following a legal determination that errors
have been made at trial, but that ""no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred"", and then only according to a strict legal test. The
determination of what will constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice must involve the construction of those words in the context in which they
are used in the Statute, and such statutory construction has long been
considered a matter of law. The Court's decision involves an analysis of the
rights accorded by law to an accused and the measurement of the impact of the
errors which were made at trial. Once an appellant establishes in the Court of
Appeal that errors of law were made at his trial he becomes entitled to have
his appeal allowed and a new trial or an acquittal, depending on the
circumstances, unless the proviso is applied to annul those rights. The Court
of Appeal must consider the errors against the background of the whole trial.
While a reconsideration of the evidence is involved, clearly the inquiry goes
far beyond the determination of matters of fact.  The Court of Appeal
must give substance to the concept of ""miscarriage of justice"" and
this involves a legal determination. For all the above reasons, I am of
the opinion that the application of the proviso must always involve a question
of law and it is reviewable in this Court on appeal under s. 618  of the Criminal
Code . [Emphasis added.]

 

 

Lamer J., speaking for Dickson J. (as he then was) and himself, stated,
at pp. 857‑58, that:

 

                    In my
view, this Court has through judicial pronouncements defined the application of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) into a question of law. Indeed, the section suggests,
when considered alone, that the decision by the Court of Appeal is one of mixed
fact and law. But this Court has required as a prerequisite to the courts of
appeal applying the proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) that they first make a
finding that no jury properly charged could reasonably acquit. (Reference to,
amongst others, Spence J. in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739.)
Such a finding is, in my opinion, no less a decision on a question of law than
that made by a trial judge before directing a verdict of acquittal when he
comes to the conclusion that ""in view of the dubious nature of the
evidence"" no jury could reasonably convict. (R. v. Comba, [1938]
S.C.R. 396.)

 

 

While the reasons of the majority in Mahoney were based on s.
613(1)(b)(iii), I believe that they are equally applicable to s. 613(1)(a)(i)
and, therefore, following those reasons I am of the view that s. 613(1)(a)(i)
raises a question of law which can be reviewed by this Court under s. 618  of
the Criminal Code .

 

21                The leading case upon the question of
the applicability of s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code  is Corbett
v. The Queen, supra. In that case, Corbett was convicted of murder. The key
witness was the wife of the deceased. She had been wounded by the murderer
immediately after the shooting of her husband, but three days after the
shooting was able to identify Corbett as the killer. There were, however, some
discrepancies between her statement of the facts and the evidence of other
witnesses. The case was appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the
ground that the discrepancies in the evidence made the verdict
""unreasonable"" for the purposes of s. 613(1) (a)(i). The appeal
was dismissed with a dissent concerning the application of s. 613(1)(a)(i)
of the Code. In this Court, Pigeon J., speaking for the majority
(Abbott, Martland, Judson, Pigeon and Dickson JJ.) (Spence and Laskin JJ.
dissenting) said that the dissent in the Court of Appeal was not a dissent upon
a question of law but solely as to the application of law. This raised the same
question to which I have already adverted. Responding to a submission by the
appellant that the majority of the Court of Appeal, in their approach to s. 613(1) (a)(i),
erred in merely considering whether there was any evidence rather than reaching
their own conclusion on the weight of the evidence, he said, at pp. 278‑79:

 

                          Of
course, if the judges of the majority had held that their function was only to
decide whether there was evidence, this would be reversible error. The Code
expressly provides that the appeal may be allowed, not only when the verdict
cannot be supported by the evidence but also when it is unreasonable. In other
words, the Court of Appeal must satisfy itself not only that there was evidence
requiring the case to be submitted to the jury, but also that the weight of
such evidence is not so weak that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable. This
cannot be taken to mean that the Court of Appeal is to substitute its opinion
for that of the jury. The word of the enactment is ""unreasonable"",
not ""unjustified"". The jurors are the triers of the facts and their
finding is not to be set aside because the judges in appeal do not think they
would have made the same finding if sitting as jurors. This is only to be
done if they come to the conclusion that the verdict is such that no twelve
reasonable men could possibly have reached it acting judicially.
[Emphasis added.]

 

 

Later, at p. 280, he said:

 

                          

                          In my view, there is nothing from which it
might be deduced that the learned judge only considered whether there was
evidence. If there had been no evidence, it would have been the duty of the
trial judge to withhold the case from the jury. This is not what was
considered. The point dealt with assumed that the case was properly before the
jury. It was asked in effect whether they could reasonably answer
""Guilty"" and, in my opinion, that was the proper test before the
Court of Appeal.

 

 

And in reaching his conclusion, he said, at p. 282:

 

 

                    I do
not read the above as meaning that the duty of the Court of Appeal is to reach
its opinion on the basis of what its members think they would have decided if
sitting as the jury so that, if they are not convinced that they would have
rendered the same verdict, they are to find it unreasonable. If that is what
the learned judge meant, then I must disagree with him because that is not the
proper test. As previously noted, the question is whether the verdict is
unreasonable, not whether it is unjustified.  The function of the court
is not to substitute itself for the jury, but to decide whether the verdict is
one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have
rendered. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

22                These passages, especially those
portions underlined, have led to some uncertainty regarding the standard of
review to be employed under s. 613  of the Criminal Code . As I have
indicated above, the judges of the Court of Appeal were troubled by the
apparent inconsistencies in these passages and attempted to resolve them.
Hutcheon J.A., in dissent, concluded that the word ""possibly"", used
in the first passage, was inappropriate and that the last of the quoted
passages stated the law more faithfully. Macdonald J.A., on the other hand,
after citing the first of the passages quoted above, said with a hint of
resignation:

 

                          So
that is the definitive statement of the requirement of the subparagraph. I
think that as a judge of this Court I should simply endeavour to apply it,
leaving elaboration to the Supreme Court.

 

                   

23               I hasten to elaborate. I am in agreement
with Hutcheon J.A. that the word ""possibly"" in this context is
inappropriate. In my view, to adopt literally the proposition that the
appellate court could only consider whether the impugned verdict could possibly
have been reached would render review on appeal under the subsection almost
impossible. ""Reasonably could have reached"" must be the test, and
from a reading of the whole of Pigeon J.'s judgment I am of the view that it
was what was intended. The concept of reasonableness is clearly expressed in
the section which speaks of an unreasonable verdict. Therefore, curial review
is invited whenever a jury goes beyond a reasonable standard. In my view, then,
Corbett is the governing case and the test is ""whether the verdict
is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have
rendered"".

 

24               The appellant, while not quarrelling with
the authority of the Corbett case, argues that it was misapplied here in
a case depending entirely on circumstantial evidence. He argues that before a
jury may convict on purely circumstantial evidence, it must be satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt that the circumstances proved in the evidence are such as to
be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the
guilty person. The test is sometimes stated in a somewhat different form, but to
the same effect: the circumstances must be consistent with guilt and
inconsistent with innocence. The appellant submits that the majority of the
Court of Appeal erred in failing to apply this test.

 

25               In my view, the majority of the Court of
Appeal did not fail to apply the correct principles relating to the treatment
of circumstantial evidence. The function of the Court of Appeal, under s.
613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , goes beyond merely finding
that there is evidence to support a conviction. The Court must determine on the
whole of the evidence whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed
jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. While the Court of
Appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to
apply the test the Court must re‑examine and to some extent reweigh and
consider the effect of the evidence. This process will be the same whether the
case is based on circumstantial or direct evidence. In the Court of Appeal, the
majority clearly found that there was sufficient evidence to justify the
verdict and both Macdonald and Craig JJ.A. rejected all rational inferences
offering an alternative to the conclusion of guilt. It is therefore clear that
the law was correctly understood and applied.

 

26               This Court, in considering an appeal
where the sole issue raised is the application of s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the
Code, must put itself in the place of the Court of Appeal and, pursuant
to the powers given in s. 623(1) of the Code, consider the matter anew,
and if error be found make such order as the Court of Appeal should have made.
In pursuit of that objective, I can say that there was evidence before the jury
from which it could reasonably find that the two boys were dead before the fire
in the mattress was set and that they did not die from natural causes. There
was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find that the fire in the
mattress was not accidental but was set by a human hand with the aid of a
liquid accelerant. There was evidence upon which they could reasonably find
that the appellant Yebes had a motive for killing the boys and that he had an
opportunity to do so. If there were no further evidence upon which to support
the Crown's case there could be no doubt that the appellant would be entitled
to an acquittal, for evidence of motive alone would not be sufficient to base a
conviction and coupling opportunity with motive in the absence of other
evidence would not advance the case unless there were evidence of exclusive
opportunity. This point was made by McLennan J.A. in R. v. Ferianz
(1962), 37 C.R. 37 (Ont. C.A.) The two accused in the case were joint owners of
a building and it was clearly established that a fire in the building had been
deliberately set. The only evidence against the accused was evidence of motive
and opportunity. McLennan J.A., speaking for the Court (Porter C.J.O., Kelly
and McLennan JJ.A.) said, at p. 39:

 

                          The
only evidence against the accused on the first count of conspiracy to commit
arson was motive and opportunity. The motive suggested was to obtain the
insurance money and the opportunity suggested was that either or both accused
would have returned to Kingsville from Windsor and set the fire or hired
someone else to do it. There was no evidence that they did so and there was no
evidence of any connection between either accused and any person unknown who
might have started the fire. At least one other person had a motive at least
equally as strong as the accused.

 

                          

                          Although
motive may be an important element along with other probative and significant
facts in establishing guilt, motive by itself and standing alone amounts to
nothing or next to nothing in the way of proof that the accused committed the
crime charged in Count 1: Best on Evidence, 12th ed. 3845.

 

 

                          Evidence
of opportunity, unless it is exclusive opportunity, is on a somewhat similar
footing as evidence of motive. Mere opportunity is not accepted as
corroboration where corroboration is required or desirable: Burbury v.
Jackson,  [1917] 1 K.B. 16, 25 Cox C.C. 555 at 558; Forsythe v. The
King, [1943] S.C.R. 98, 79 C.C.C. 129, [1943] 2 D.L.R. 737, 5 Abr. Con. (2nd)
361. The accused or someone hired by either of them were not the only persons
who had the opportunity. Logically anyone who could have been in the building
about midnight had opportunity.

 

 

                          In
our opinion even considering the cumulative effect of opportunity and such
motive as there was in this case it is not sufficient to warrant a conviction
on the count charging conspiracy to commit arson.

 

 

A more recent statement of the same principle is found in R. v.
MacFarlane (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 458 (Ont. C.A.) where Martin J.A.,
speaking for the Court (Martin, Weatherston and Morden JJ.A.) said, at p. 460:

 

                   Since
there were no other circumstances connecting the appellant with the setting of
the fire, it was incumbent upon the Crown to establish that he had exclusive
opportunity to set the fire in order to support a conviction. There was
evidence from which the jury could draw the conclusion that the appellant had
the exclusive opportunity of setting the fire, but the evidence was not so
compelling as to require that conclusion. The trial Judge instructed the jury
that the Crown's case against the appellant was based on opportunity and motive
and in our view this instruction may have caused the jury to conclude that
those circumstances were suficient in the absence of a clear direction as to
the necessity for proof of exclusive opportunity to warrant a conviction.

 

                   

                           In
those circumstances a careful direction was required that unless the jury
reached the conclusion that the appellant had the exclusive opportunity of
setting the fire, they could not convict. In our view, the failure of the trial
Judge in the circumstances of this case to clearly instruct the jury on this
issue, constituted misdirection. Although there was perhaps some evidence of
motive it was of negligible weight since on the facts disclosed in the record,
there was no clear evidence that the appellant stood to benefit financially
from the fire. The trial Judge should have made this clear to the jury.

 

 

 

It may then be concluded that where it is shown that a crime has been
committed and the incriminating evidence against the accused is primarily
evidence of opportunity, the guilt of the accused is not the only rational
inference which can be drawn unless the accused had exclusive opportunity. In a
case, however, where evidence of opportunity is accompanied by other
inculpatory evidence, something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice.
This was the view expressed by Lacourcière J.A. in R. v. Monteleone
(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 489 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 493, where he said: 

                          It
is not mandatory for the prosecution to prove that the respondent had the exclusive
opportunity in a case where other inculpatory circumstances are proved.

 

 

 

It is also supported by further comments of Martin J.A. in R. v.
Stevens (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 518, at p. 534 et seq., and see, as
well, Imrich v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 622, per Ritchie J. at
p. 627.

 

27                Since there is no evidence in this case
directly connecting Yebes to the death of the children, the question which now
arises is: Did the appellant during the relevant times have exclusive opportunity
to commit the crime of murder? It is unquestionably established in the evidence
that after the dinner at which Mrs. Yebes and her daughters were present with
Yebes and the boys in the town house, Mrs. Yebes and the daughters left between
8:00 or 8:05 in the evening, leaving Yebes and two boys alone in the house.
There is no evidence whatever that she and the daughters, or any other person,
were present in the house until the entry of Sergeant Shaw at about 1:00 a.m.
The medical evidence established that before the fire was started the boys were
killed by some human intervention and that their deaths occurred not later than
12:30 a.m. and possibly before 10:30 p.m. The state of the fire in the mattress
and the condition of the bodies upon the arrival of the police at 1:00 a.m.
suggests that they died closer to 10:30 p.m. than 12:30 a.m. On that evening
the front door of the town house was closed but unlocked. Yebes' evidence was
that he habitually locked that door when he went to bed. He couldn't remember
whether he had locked it that night, but assumed that he had done so. He did
not remember unlocking the door at any time that evening. Yebes testified that
he did not give Mrs. Yebes a key to the town house but that the key‑ring
for his car keys held a key to the house and on occasion Mrs. Yebes would have
driven the car and had access to the key. There is no evidence as to where the
key was on the night in question but there is evidence that Yebes knew that the
door was unlocked. When the police officer arrived, Yebes called to him from
the second floor window, ""In here, in here"". The police officer
entered the unlocked door. Yebes made no move to open it for him. There is no
evidence of the presence of any other persons, save the two boys, in the town
house that evening. Only the unlocked front door could raise a question as to
exclusive opportunity. I am of the view that there was evidence before the jury
upon which a properly charged jury could reasonably have reached the conclusion
that Yebes had exclusive opportunity to kill the boys. I adopt the comment
quoted above by Macdonald J.A. to the effect that the reality of the situation
is that only Yebes had the opportunity as well as the motive to commit the
crimes charged. In my view, the first ground of appeal must therefore fail.

 

28               The remaining ground that the Crown
failed to call a witness, Mrs. Yebes, essential to the unfolding of the
narrative, must also fail in my view. The Crown has a discretion as to which
witnesses it will call in presenting its case to the court. This discretion
will not be interfered with unless the Crown has exercised it for some oblique
or improper reason: see Lemay v. The King, supra. No such
improper motive is alleged here. While the Crown may not be required to call a
given witness, the failure of the Crown to call a witness may leave a gap in
the Crown's case which will leave the Crown's burden of proof undischarged and
entitle the accused to an acquittal. It is in this sense that the Crown may be
expected to call all witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative of
events upon which the Crown's case is based. It is argued here that the failure
to call Mrs. Yebes as a Crown witness was just such a lapse on the part of the
Crown and it leaves open an alternative rational conclusion to that of Yebes'
guilt. It was argued for Yebes in this Court that Mrs. Yebes had a greater
motive than Yebes to commit the crime and also the opportunity. She should have
been called to properly complete the narrative.

 

29               It seems to me that this argument is
predicated upon pure speculation. It suggests that Mrs. Yebes should have been
called to complete the narrative of events which occurred in the town house
that evening when there is no evidence whatever that she was present or
possessed any knowledge of what occurred. The assumption that she had something
to say to complete the narrative is not based on evidence and rests on nothing
more than speculation.

 

30               What could Mrs. Yebes add to the
narrative? The whole tragic history of these children and this family was put
before the court by other witnesses. The facts leading up to the dinner on
February 23 were all before the court as were Mrs. Yebes' concerns and
attitudes, clearly expressed by Yebes and the other witnesses, including
medical and social welfare officials. Her only contribution to the narrative
would be related to what happened after her departure from the home at 8:00
p.m. and there is no evidence, or any suggestion that she was present, when the
deaths occurred and would have any knowledge on that subject. In the end, all
that she could have contributed was the bald assertion that she did not kill the
boys.

 

31               For the reasons given above, I would
conclude that the majority of the Court of Appeal were not in error in their
application of s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code . They
correctly applied the test in Corbett and I would dismiss the appeal.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Directed verdict ‑‑ Circumstantial evidence ‑‑
Arson ‑‑ Motion for a directed verdict of acquittal ‑‑
Test to be applied by the trial judge.

 

        Evidence
‑‑ Arson -- No direct evidence of the unlawful setting of the fire ‑‑
Whether the incendiary origin of the fire may be proved by circumstantial
evidence.

 

 

                   The
building where appellant's store was situated was destroyed by fire. The fire
began in appellant's portion of the building and after an investigation he was
charged with arson. At trial, the fire inspector admitted that the actual cause
of the fire could not be determined, but he reached the conclusion that the
fire was of incendiary origin because his investigation revealed no accidental
cause. At the close of the Crown's case based entirely on circumstantial
evidence, the defence made a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. The
trial judge reviewed the evidence extensively and found that the evidence in
total and its cumulative effect gave rise to suspicion only, and could not
justify the drawing of an inference of guilt. He then concluded that there
""was no evidence upon which a jury properly charged and acting reasonably
could find the accused guilty"", and therefore directed the jury to bring
in a verdict of not guilty. On appeal, the verdict of acquittal was set aside
and a new trial ordered. The Court of Appeal found that there was ""sufficient
prima facie evidence to justify a dismissal of the motion for a directed
verdict of acquittal"" and that the trial judge usurped the function of the
jury in weighing the evidence and drawing inferences from it. This appeal is to
determine whether the case should have been left to the jury.

 

 Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   A
trial judge is not justified to direct a verdict of acquittal where there is
before the court any admissible evidence which, if believed by a properly
charged jury acting reasonably, would justify a conviction ‑‑ the Shephard
test. This test is applicable to a case resting on direct as well as
circumstantial evidence. It is not the function of the trial judge to weigh the
evidence, to test its quality or reliability once a determination of its
admissibility has been made. It is also not for the trial judge to draw
inferences of fact from the evidence before him. These functions are for the
trier of fact, the jury. In the present case, the appellant argued that there
was no evidence as to the nature of the fire and therefore the commission of a
crime. Although the expert evidence of the fire inspector did not afford
evidence of an incendiary origin for the fire, the incendiary origin could be
inferred from other inculpatory circumstances which could link the appellant to
the fire. The evidence relating to appellant's motive, opportunity and the
contradictions in his statement to the fire inspector met the Shephard
test and the case should have been left to the jury. It was not open to the
judge in a jury trial to consider the weight of the evidence. This is the
function of the jury and it should be left to them.

1                 McIntyre J. ‑‑
This case raises the question of the test to be applied by a trial judge when a
motion is made by the defence for a directed verdict of acquittal after the
close of the Crown's case and before the defence has elected whether or not to
call evidence.

 

2                 The
appellant was the proprietor of a men's clothing store in Sudbury. The shop was
situated on the ground floor of a three storey building, the remainder of that
floor was occupied by a jewellery store, and the upper floors of the building
contained residential apartments. On January 12, 1980, the building was
destroyed by a fire which began in the basement of the appellant's portion of
the building.

 

3                 The
officials of the Sudbury Fire Department conducted an investigation into the
causes of the fire. On January 12, 1980, as part of the investigation, the
appellant was questioned by Inspector McLean and he gave the following
statement:

 

                          On
January 12, 1980, I closed the store at 17:00        hours and I locked the
cleaning staff in the store.                    The employees names were Laura
Tycoor and her             daughter. They have been cleaning the store for the                    past
two or three years. When they finished                        cleaning the
store, they called me to pick them up                    to drive them home. It
was approximately 18:15                 hours when I picked them up. I dropped
Laura off on                Kathleen Street and her daughter at the corner of               Gilmor
and Victoria. I then proceeded to my home on                Tielstar stopping
at the Pinto store for a                              newspaper.

 

 

                          When
I picked up the girls I accompanied the             girls downstairs to put
away the vacuum cleaner and                    cleaning supplies. The three of
us put on our coats              and left by the front door locking it behind
me.                    When I was in the store I could smell some smoke             but
I took it for granted it was the vacuum cleaner                    because
Laura had called me previously when she was       cleaning, complaining that
the vacuum cleaner was                    heating up and smoking. I told her to
unplug the                  vacuum cleaner and bring it downstairs.

 

 

                          When
I returned at 18:15 I looked at the vacuum        cleaner and it was so hot
that I could not touch  it. The vacuum cleaner was sitting very close to                                         empty
cardboard boxes. When I say close, I mean                    inches. When I
walked into the store I could smell              smoke and I could also see a
very fine cloud of                    smoke. I could not tell whether the smoke
was of               burning electrical wires but I presumed it was the                    vacuum
cleaner. It was at this time after placing                  the vacuum cleaner
in the basement area that we                    left. After dropping the girls
off I returned home                  arriving at approximately 19:00 hours.
When I                    walked into the house my wife informed me about the         fire
and I returned to store.

 

 

                          I
have $50,000.00 coverage on the stock,                  $25,000.00 on fixtures
and $37,500.00 business                    interruption. The insurance is under
my name and I             am the sole owner of the store. I am indebted to                    the
Toronto‑Dominion Bank for a business loan in              the amount of
approximately $50,000.00. I also owe             one supplier Lou Myles of
Toronto approximately              $30,000.00. I have been the owner of the
business                    for three years.

 

 

The
inspector was of the view that the fire was set. He admitted that the actual
cause of the fire could not be determined, but he reached the conclusion that
the fire was of incendiary origin because his investigation revealed no
accidental cause. No evidence of the employment of accelerants to cause or
advance the fire was found, but firemen testified that in a fire causing such
extensive damage there is often no indication of how it started. A number of
persons were known to have had access to the appellant's shop. In addition to
the front entrance, access could be gained into the basement through a door
connecting the appellant's basement with the adjoining jewellery store. There
was no evidence to show that the appellant was in extreme financial difficulty,
although he had substantial financial obligations somewhat in excess of what he
admitted in his statement. He was not shown to have been pressed by creditors,
nor was it shown that he would profit in any substantial degree from the fire.

 

4                 The
appellant was charged with setting the fire and was tried in April and May of
1981 in the Ontario District Court in Sudbury. At the close of the Crown's case
and before the appellant had elected whether to call evidence, the trial judge
on a defence motion directed a verdict of acquittal. With some apparent
reluctance, the jury acquitted. An appeal by the Crown was allowed and this
appeal comes as of right, in accordance with the provisions of s. 618(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

 

5                 The
trial judge observed that the case for the Crown rested entirely on
circumstantial evidence. He referred to the following words of Duff C.J. in
this Court in R. v. Comba, [1938] S.C.R. 396, at p. 397:

 

                          It
is admitted by the Crown, as the fact is,                   that the verdict
rests solely upon a basis of                    circumstantial evidence. In
such cases, by the long              settled rule of the common law, which is
the rule                    of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a                         prisoner
guilty upon such evidence, must be                    satisfied not only that
the circumstances are                        consistent with a conclusion that
the criminal act                    was committed by the accused, but also that
the                 facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other                    rational
conclusion than that the accused is the                    guilty person.

 

He laid
stress upon the Chief Justice's further words, at 

 

pp. 397‑98:

 

 

                           We
agree with the majority of the Court of                 Appeal, whose reasons
for their judgment we find                    convincing and conclusive, that
the learned trial                   judge ought, on the application made by
counsel for                    the prisoner at the close of the evidence for
the                   Crown, to have told the jury that, in view of the                    dubious
nature of the evidence, it would be unsafe              to find the prisoner
guilty, and to have directed                    them to return a verdict of
acquittal accordingly.

 

 

He went
on to conclude that the test is no different whether the evidence is direct or
circumstantial. In his view, the question to be answered was: is there some
evidence from which a jury properly instructed could reasonably come to the
conclusion that the accused had been proved guilty? He referred to the words of
MacKay J.A., speaking for the majority in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.
v. Kavanagh (1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 296, at p. 301:

 

                          It
was held by this court in R. v. Mackey,                    [1971] 3 O.R.
327, 4 C.C.C. (2d) 192, 14 C.R.N.S.     254, that on a motion for a directed
verdict a                     trial Judge can only rule on whether there is any
                   evidence which can properly be left to the jury.                  The
question of reasonable doubt and the applicability of the rule in Hodge's
Case does not arise at the close of the Crown's case where the accused has
not elected against calling evidence. In the case of a jury trial I am of the
opinion that it is immaterial whether the accused has or has not elected to
call evidence. The function of the trial Judge on the motion is only to decide
if there is any evidence to go to the jury. To hold otherwise would be to
permit the Judge to usurp the function of the jury.

 

 

Adopting
these words as the appropriate test, he reviewed the evidence extensively and
apparently being unsatisfied with its force and effect, he concluded:

 

                          I conclude then that the
evidence in total and its cumulative effect gives rise to suspicion only, and
cannot justify the drawing of an inference of guilt. There is then, in my
judgment, no evidence upon which a jury properly charged and acting reasonably
could find the accused guilty, and I therefore will direct the jury to bring in
a verdict of not guilty.

 

 

6                 The
Crown's appeal was allowed (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 489. It is evident that the
Court of Appeal had no quarrel with the general statement of law relating to
the test to be applied by a trial judge. Lacourcière J.A., writing for the
court (Martin, Lacourcière and Goodman JJ.A.), expressed a difference with the
trial judge, not on the law but on its application. He reviewed the evidence in
some detail and reached the conclusion that there was ""sufficient prima
facie evidence to justify a dismissal of the motion for a directed verdict
of acquittal"". The weight to be given to such evidence and the inferences
to be drawn from it were questions for the jury. He expressed the view, at p.
497, that:

 

                          . . . notwithstanding his
express statement to the contrary, the trial judge attempted to weigh the
evidence and to determine what inferences he himself, sitting without a jury,
would draw. In doing so, he effectively usurped the function of the jury.

 

 

7                 
There is only one question which arises in this appeal. Should the case have
gone to the jury after the defence had either called evidence or declined to do
so, or should the acquittal have been directed? At this point in these
proceedings it is not for this Court, nor was it for the Court of Appeal, to
reach a conclusion or even to consider the issue of guilt or innocence. Our
sole concern is to inquire whether there was a case made by the Crown at trial
which ought to have been left to the jury for that determination.

 

8                 The
law on this subject is well settled. In United States of America v. Shephard,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, Ritchie J., speaking for the majority of the Court, said,
at p. 1080:

 

                          I agree that the duty imposed
upon a ""justice"" under s. 475(1) is the same as that which governs a
trial judge sitting with a jury in deciding whether the evidence is
""sufficient"" to justify him in withdrawing the case from the jury and
this is to be determined according to whether or not there is any evidence upon
which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty. The
""justice"", in accordance with this principle, is, in my opinion,
required to commit an accused person for trial in any case in which there is
admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   

The
matter came up for discussion in this Court more recently in Mezzo v. The
Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802. In that case, the majority (Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ.) reaffirmed the authority of the judgment
of Ritchie J. in Shephard and reviewed many of the authorities on which
it is based. R. v. Comba, supra, relied on by the appellant and
adopted by the trial judge in the case at bar, was discussed and distinguished
from Mezzo in that it was a case where there was no evidence to go to
the jury. In relying on the Shephard case, I am in agreement as to the
law, both with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. The Shephard
test for the giving of a directed verdict applies to a case resting solely on
circumstantial evidence as well as one based on direct evidence. The question
of whether circumstantial evidence meets the requirement of the so‑called
rule in Hodge's Case (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, is for the jury
to determine. This was settled in Mezzo, at pp. 842‑43, in these
terms:

 

 I am aware, of course, that in R. v. Knox,
[1968] 2 C.C.C. 348, and R. v. Sawrenko (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 338, the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal for the Yukon
Territory held that, when faced with a motion for a directed verdict in a case
dependent on circumstantial evidence, it was the duty of the trial judge to
decide whether the evidence satisfied the rule in Hodge's Case. Only if it
did, was the case to go to the jury for determination of guilt or innocence. In
this sense a weighing process or an assessment of quality was contemplated on
the part of the judge. Those cases, however, were effectively overruled in
this Court in R. v. Paul, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181, and Lavoie v. The Queen,
[1977] 1 S.C.R. 193, and even in circumstantial cases the law now is that any
determination as to compliance with the rule in Hodge's Case would be
left to the jury. [Emphasis added.]

 

Where
there is before the court any admissible evidence, whether direct or
circumstantial, which, if believed by a properly charged jury acting
reasonably, would justify a conviction, the trial judge is not justified in
directing a verdict of acquittal. It is not the function of the trial judge to
weigh the evidence, to test its quality or reliability once a determination of
its admissibility has been made. It is not for the trial judge to draw
inferences of fact from the evidence before him. These functions are for the
trier of fact, the jury.

 

9                 Turning
now to the case at bar, the appellant does not dispute the validity of the Shephard
test. As I understand the principal argument advanced for the appellant, it is
that there was no evidence as to the cause of the fire. It is asserted that the
evidence of Fire Inspector McLean does not afford the basis for any finding
that the fire was of an incendiary origin. The most that can be made of it is
that the cause of the fire is unexplained. This proposition is vital to the
appellant's argument and, in his view, is decisive. If there is no evidence of
an incendiary origin for the fire, there is no evidence of the commission of a
crime. Other matters may be shown in evidence, there may be evidence of opportunity
or of motive, or of financial problems, or of hope of profit from the fire, and
there may be other suspicious factors but, in the absence of evidence of the
commission of a crime, they relate to no criminal conduct and are themselves no
evidence of criminal conduct. It was said to be error on the part of the Court
of Appeal to consider what could be suspicious circumstances in the absence of
a finding of evidence of the commission of a crime.

 

10               Lacourcière
J.A. acknowledged that the expert evidence of the fire inspector alone did not
afford evidence of the unlawful setting of a fire. He said: ""taken by
themselves, the findings of Inspector MacLean [sic] could at best
support the conclusion that the origin of the fire was unexplained"" (p.
492). However, later he said (at p. 493):

 

                          In most prosecutions for
arson, the Crown must depend on circumstantial evidence. The circumstances must
be sufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than a wilful and
intentional burning in order to rebut the presumption that the burning was of
accidental or natural origin. However, the facts and circumstances which tend
to prove the incendiary origin of a fire are often inter‑woven, as in the
present case, with other facts and circumstances which tend to connect the
accused with the crime such as the presence of a motive, and the clear
opportunity of the accused together with his subsequent incriminatory
statements.

 

                   

                          In
this connection, the Crown had adduced evidence from which the jury could
reasonably infer that the respondent had a motive to set fire to the building;
the learned trial judge made no reference to motive in his ruling. It is
conceded by Mr. Watt that the evidence of motive is not overwhelming. However,
the circumstances of the respondent's indebtedness to the bank and to his
suppliers, the fireman's evidence that there was not much stock visible when he
entered the respondent's premises despite the purchase of large quantities of
garments, the arrears of rent and the insurance coverage were sufficient to
leave the question of motive for the consideration of the jury.

 

 

He went
on to review some of the evidence which was court and concluded, as noted
above, that the trial judge had attempted to weigh the evidence and in so doing
had usurped the function of the jury.

 

11               
To reach a conclusion in this case, some consideration of the evidence is
involved. The Crown in seeking to establish its case tendered evidence which
for our purposes may be grouped under four headings:

 

                    1.
The nature of the fire.

 

                    2.
The motive of the appellant.

 

                    3.
The opportunity on the part of the appellant.

 

                    4.
Contradictions within the appellant's own                                                   statement.

 

Nature
of the Fire

 

12               As
has already been mentioned, the appellant argued that there was no evidence as
to the nature of the fire and, therefore, the commission of a crime. Evidence
on other questions which would ordinarily be relevant has no evidentiary value
and provides no evidence in the absence of proof of the incendiary nature of
the fire. It is true, of course, that neither the trial judge nor the Court of
Appeal considered that the evidence of the fire investigation, by itself,
offered any evidence as to the nature of the fire. At best, it was considered
by the Court of Appeal to leave the nature or cause of the fire unexplained.
May then evidence of other matters ‑‑ motive, opportunity,
financial difficulty and possibility of gain ‑‑ be considered as
evidence going to prove the crime of arson?

 

13               The
position of the Court of Appeal is supported in the authorities. The courts
have frequently recognized the fact that the corpus delicti, that is,
the act which constitutes the crime, in this case the setting of the fire, may
be proved by circumstantial evidence. This subject is dealt with at Chapter 17,
and following chapters, of McWilliams, Canadian Criminal Evidence (2nd
ed. 1984). At page 541, the author refers to the words of Wills, An Essay on
the Principles of Circumstantial Evidence (6th ed. 1912), at p. 326:

 

                          It
is clearly established law that it is not necessary that the corpus delicti
should be proved by direct and positive evidence, and it would be most
unreasonable to require such evidence. Crimes, and especially those of the
worst kinds, are naturally committed at chosen times, and in darkness and
secrecy; and human tribunals must act upon such indications as the
circumstances of the case present . . . .

 

 

In R.
v. Girvin (1911), 3 Alta. L.R. 387 (S.C. en banc), Beck J.
recognized the application of this principle to the crime of arson. He said, at
p. 398:

 

                           [T]here
is no proof here of corpus delicti, that is, that the cause of the fire
was otherwise than accidental. Fires occurring accidentally are common, and any
given fire must be assumed to have been accidental until evidence is adduced of
intention . . . . No doubt, the evidence of the corpus delicti and the
evidence of the guilt of an accused may often be more or less inseparable, and
that is quite properly suggested as the case here.

 

 

 

Beck J.
went on to hold in that case that there were no other inculpatory circumstances
going far enough to raise more than suspicion. The Supreme Court of Canada
(1911), 45 S.C.R. 167, dismissed the appeal, holding in the words of
Fitzpatrick C.J., at p. 169, that:

 

                    . . . there is evidence quite
sufficient to prove that the house was destroyed by a fire under circumstances
which clearly pointed to incendiarism, and that the accused might fairly be
presumed to have set the fire.

 

 

 

This
principle has been applied more recently. In R. v. Paul, [1977] 1 S.C.R.
181, the accused was charged with possession of goods knowing them to have been
obtained by the commission of theft. The Crown's case was that television sets
had been shipped in a sealed rail car which arrived at its destination with the
seal intact. The intended recipient never received the sets, they were found in
the possession of the accused. On that statement of evidence, the accused moved
for a directed verdict of acquittal on the ground that there was no evidence
that the sets were stolen. The motion was granted by the trial judge and
subsequently upheld in the Court of Appeal for Quebec, but on further appeal to
this Court the directed verdict was overturned and a new trial directed.
Ritchie J., for the majority of the Court, held that although there was no
direct evidence that the goods were stolen the fact that they were found in the
accused's possession would leave it open to the jury to find that they were
indeed stolen and that the accused was aware of that fact, thus the trial judge
should not have granted the motion for a directed verdict. Cross, in Evidence
(5th ed. 1979) cites, at p. 56, R. v. Burton (1854), Dears 282, 169 E.R.
728, a case in which the accused was seen to come out of a warehouse with a
quantity of pepper. As there was a great deal of pepper stored inside the
warehouse, it could not be proven that any had been taken. In convicting the
accused, however, Maule J. said, at p. 284:

 

                          If a man go into the London
Docks sober, without means of getting drunk, and comes out of one of the
cellars very drunk wherein are a million gallons of wine, I think that would be
reasonable evidence that he had stolen some of the wine in that cellar though
you could not prove that any wine was stolen or any wine was missed.

 

 

 

I am
therefore of the opinion that the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that
the incendiary origin of the fire could be inferred from other inculpatory
circumstances which could link the accused to the fire.

 

Motive

 

14               In
view of the fact that there must be a new trial, I do not wish to comment
extensively on the details of the evidence and possibly embarrass the trial
judge. There was, however, evidence of the removal of a valuable antique desk
by the appellant from his business premises to his home some two days before
the fire. There was evidence of a substantial indebtedness to a wholesale
supplier of goods. There was evidence of some difficulties with the retail
sales tax branch regarding tax owing in respect of the business operation and a
substantial assessment had been made upon the business for payment of arrears.
There was evidence of a substantial indebtedness to the bank and a bank
overdraft. There was, as well, evidence of the appellant's indebtedness arising
in connection with the purchase of a home in association with his sister which
involves substantial liability on two mortgages. There was evidence of
difficulties he had encountered in dealing with his insurance claim involving
varying claims and statements. This evidence was such that it should have been
left to the jury on the issue of motive.

 

Opportunity

 

15               There
was evidence of opportunity on the part of the appellant to set the fire. It
would be for the jury to decide whether or not it was exclusive opportunity.
However, since there is evidence of other inculpatory matters, evidence of any
opportunity, as opposed to exclusive opportunity, should go to the jury: see R.
v. Syms (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 114 (Ont. C.A.)

 

Appellant's
Statement

 

16               The
appellant's statement given to the fire inspector was contradicted in certain
particulars by the evidence of the cleaning staff. The contradictions
themselves afford some evidence, the significance of which would require the
consideration of the jury.

 

17               In
conclusion, I do not suggest that the inculpatory evidence is conclusive or
even persuasive. That is not the function of an appellate court. The resolution
of that question is for the jury upon proper instructions on the law after
having heard the evidence. I have made only slight reference to the inculpatory
evidence, but I would note that at trial it was strongly challenged on many
points. From cross‑examination of principal creditors it appeared that
financial obligations of the appellant were not unusual, considering all
circumstances and the nature of the business. No creditor expressed any fear as
to its security prior to the fire, and the appellant was not being pressed by
his creditors. This evidence might very well influence a jury to discount the
inculpatory evidence and find in favour of the appellant. This they would do,
however, in the exercise of the function imposed upon them by law as the true
finders of fact. It is not open to a judge in a jury trial to consider the
weight of the evidence. This is the function of the jury and it should be left
to them. I am of the view that there was evidence before the trial judge which
met the test propounded by Ritchie J. in United States of America v.
Shephard, supra. I am in substantial agreement with the reasons for
judgment of Lacourcière J.A. for the Ontario Court of Appeal and I would
dismiss the appeal and confirm the order for a new trial.

sexual assault, using a firearm while committing an indictable offence, and
stealing property worth in excess of $200. These offences were alleged to have
been committed approximately one month after the appellant's sixteenth
birthday. The judge requested a pre‑sentence report and adjourned the
matter of sentence.

 

                   Defence
counsel was first informed of the fact that the Crown might bring a dangerous
offender application under Part XXI of the Code just before the sentence
hearing. The hearing was adjourned to allow the Crown to consider the matter
and an application was later made. The trial judge, at the subsequent sentence
hearing, found appellant to be a dangerous offender and sentenced him to a
period of indeterminate detention. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision.

 

                   This
Court considered two constitutional questions: (1) whether or not the
provisions of Part XXI of the Criminal Code , in whole or in part,
infringe or deny the rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and/or 12 of the Charter ,
and if so, (2) whether or not Part XXI, in whole or in part, is justified under
s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   The
appellant also argued that his rights under s. 7  of the Charter  were
violated by the Crown's failure to give him notice, before his election of a
mode of trial and the entry of his plea, that it intended to bring, or
contemplated bringing, a ""dangerous offender"" application.

 

                   Held (Lamer
and Wilson JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Estey, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: Part XXI does not violate
the principles of fundamental justice. It does not authorize a sentence for
crimes for which an accused is not being tried. The sentence of indeterminate
detention that can be imposed under s. 688 is ""in lieu of any other
sentence that might be imposed for the offence for which the offender has
been convicted"". The individual, on a finding of guilty, is being
sentenced for the ""serious personal injury offence"" for which he was
convicted, albeit in a different way than would ordinarily be done. He is not
being punished for what he might do. The punishment flows from the actual
commission of a specific offence.

 

                   Part
XXI does not deprive a person of his liberty in contravention of the principles
of fundamental justice and thereby violate s. 7  of the Charter .
Fundamental justice has not been infringed by Parliament's identifying those
offenders who, in the interests of protecting the public, ought to be sentenced
according to considerations not entirely based on a ""just deserts""
rationale. Such a sentence serves both a punitive and preventative role and its
purpose, the protection of society, underlies the criminal law in general and
sentencing in particular. The respective importance of prevention, deterrence,
retribution and rehabilitation will vary in a rational system of sentencing
according to the crime and the circumstances of the offender. Part XXI merely
enables the court to accommodate its sentence to the common sense reality that
the present condition of the offender is such that he or she is not
inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint so that future
violent acts can quite confidently be expected of that person.

 

                   In
determining whether Part XXI violates fundamental justice the effects of
the legislation must also be subjected to scrutiny. However, whether the
""treatment meted out"" to the offender and how the means of
accomplishing it violate constitutional precepts are better discussed under ss.
9  and 12  of the Charter  because of their focus on specific aspects of
the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   An
indeterminate sentence under Part XXI does not amount to cruel and unusual
punishment in violation of s. 12  of the Charter . The legislative
objectives of Part XXI are of sufficient importance to warrant limiting the
rights and freedoms of dangerous offenders and the legislative classification
of the target group of offenders meets the highest standard of rationality and
proportionality that society can reasonably expect of Parliament. Preventive
detention is not cruel and unusual treatment in the case of dangerous
offenders, for the group to whom the legislation applies has been functionally
defined so as to ensure that persons within the group evince the
characteristics that render such detention necessary.

 

                   Since,
however, an enlightened inquiry under s. 12  must concern itself, first and foremost,
with the way in which the effects of punishment are likely to be experienced,
the parole process assumes great significance in assessing the
constitutionality of a Part XXI sentence, for the availability of parole can
truly accommodate and tailor the sentence to fit each offender's circumstances.
If the sentence imposed under Part XXI were indeterminate, simpliciter,
it would on occasion certainly result in sentences grossly disproportionate and
hence violate s. 12 . It is not necessary, however, for the parole process to be
restricted to considering matters solely concerned with the prisoner's
""dangerousness"" for that would result in a lesser requirement for the
dangerous offender than for other convicts.

 

                   The
imprisonment resulting from the successful invocation of Part XXI cannot be
considered arbitrary detention under s. 9  of the Charter . The
incarceration is statutorily authorized, and applies only to a narrowly defined
class of dangerous offenders so identified in accordance with specific conditions.
Moreover, the criteria in Part XXI are anything but arbitrary in relation to
the objectives sought to be attained.

 

                   The
lack of uniformity in the treatment of dangerous persons that arises by virtue
of the prosecutorial discretion to make an application under Part XXI does not
constitute unconstitutional arbitrariness. On the contrary, an absence of such
discretion would in many cases render arbitrary the law's application, for the
Crown would be required to proceed under Part XXI on the barest prima facie
case.

 

                   Section
11 (f) of the Charter  does not require that a Crown application
under Part XXI to declare the offender a dangerous offender be determined at a
trial by jury. Such an application does not fall within the scope of s. 11 (f)
of the Charter  for it is not equivalent to ""charging"" the
offender with ""an offence"". The process designating an offender
dangerous is simply part of the sentencing process.

 

                   Nor
does s. 7  of the Charter  mandate a jury determination of the issue.
Section 7  guarantees an accused a fair hearing but not the most favourable
procedures imaginable. The procedure at a Part XXI application is not unfair if
it denies an offender the right to a jury's determination of his or her
dangerousness. While the requirements of fundamental justice, at a minimum,
embrace the requirements of procedural fairness, these vary according to the
context in which they are invoked. Certain procedural protections, therefore,
might be constitutionally mandated in one context but not in another.

 

                   A
jury determination is not mandated here. The offender has already been found
guilty of an offence in a trial where he had the option of invoking his right
to a jury. The subsequent procedure does not affect his liberty to the same
extent as the initial determination of guilt or innocence. The legal
classification of the proceeding as part of the sentencing process does not
necessarily determine the scope of the procedural protection. It is not
insignificant, however, that the judge at such a hearing retains a discretion
to impose the designation or indeterminate sentence, or both. It is noteworthy,
too, that Part XXI provides considerable procedural protection to the offender.

 

                   A
""likelihood"" of specified future conduct occurring is the finding of
fact required to be established, not that it will occur. An individual can be
found to constitute a threat to society without requiring an ability to
predict the future. It is not illogical for a court to assert that it is
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the test of dangerousness has been
met, that there exists a certain potential for harm. Appellant, in
asserting that proof of a likelihood beyond a reasonable doubt still amounts
merely to proof of a likelihood, is challenging not the standard of proof but
the fact that certain persons found to be ""dangerous"" will, in fact,
act dangerously.

 

                   The
psychiatric evidence is admissible. Judges at Part XXI hearings do not assume
that psychiatrists can accurately predict the future; however, psychiatric
evidence is clearly relevant to the issue whether a person is likely to behave
in a certain way and, indeed, is probably relatively superior in this regard to
the evidence of other clinicians and lay persons.

 

                   Per Lamer
J. (dissenting in part): A person against whom a Part XXI application is
brought is one ""charged with an offence"" under s. 11  of the Charter 
and entitled to that section's particular guarantees. A person is ""charged
with an offence"" under s. 11  when a formal allegation is made against him
which, if true, would give a judge jurisdiction to impose a criminal or penal
sanction. Section 11 (f) guarantees anyone in jeopardy of being sentenced
to imprisonment for five years or more as a result of a determination of guilt
the right to have that determination made by a jury. To say that an application
under Part XXI is not a charge of an offence violates the spirit of the Charter 
and leaves without that protection those put in one of the most serious
jeopardies the law has created.

 

                   Part
XXI is very different from sentencing provisions. A conviction gives the judge
jurisdiction to impose a determinate sentence as set out in the provision
creating the offence. It is the finding of dangerousness, however, and not the
conviction for the personal injury offence, that gives the judge jurisdiction
to impose an indeterminate sentence. It is thus a separate offence.

 

                   The
offender against whom an application under Part XXI is brought has the right to
be presumed not dangerous until the Crown proves otherwise beyond a reasonable
doubt and he is entitled to the guarantees set out in s. 11 , including the
benefit of a jury's determination of dangerousness. Section 689(2) of the Code,
in that it provides that a Part XXI application shall be heard and determined
by the court without a jury, clearly restricts this right and must be declared
inoperative.

 

                   The
section could not be saved by s. 1  of the Charter , because no attempt
was made to justify the failure to provide a jury under Part XXI.

 

                   Per Wilson
J. (dissenting in part): It is a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7  of
the Charter  that an accused know the full extent of his jeopardy before
pleading guilty to a criminal offence for which a term of imprisonment may be
imposed. An accused, in deciding whether to plead guilty or not guilty, is
foremost concerned with the worst that can happen if convicted. The accused is
entitled to the protection of s. 7  if he probably would not have pleaded
guilty, had he known at the time of his plea that the Crown would be seeking an
order of preventive indeterminate detention. Knowledge of such an order cannot
be attributed by virtue of the presence of Part XXI in the Code.

 

                   Appellant
can either challenge his conviction or challenge the order under Part XXI
without attacking his conviction. An accused need not attack his conviction for
the court to be able to grant him a s. 24(1) remedy in relation to the order of
preventive detention.

 

                   The
reasons and conclusions of La Forest J. were adopted with respect to ss. 9  and
12  of the Charter .

1.                La Forest J.‑‑The
broad issues raised in this appeal are whether the dangerous offenders
provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, Part XXI,
ss. 687‑695, contravene the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms  to ""liberty"" and ""not to be deprived

if so whether they can be justified under s. 1  of the Charter  as being
""such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society"".

 

Facts
and Procedural History

 

2.                On
September 23, 1983, the appellant, Thomas Patrick Lyons, was arraigned on an
information containing four charges: unlawfully breaking and entering a
dwelling house contrary to s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal Code ;
unlawfully using a weapon or imitation thereof in committing a sexual assault,
contrary to s. 246.2(a) of the Code; unlawfully using a firearm
while committing an indictable offence, contrary to s. 83(1)(a) of the Code;
and unlawfully stealing property of a total value exceeding $200, contrary to
s. 294(a) of the Code. These offences were alleged to have been
committed approximately one month after the appellant's sixteenth birthday.

 

3.                The
appellant elected trial by a judge without a jury on all four charges and
waived his right to a preliminary inquiry. He subsequently entered pleas of
guilty to all counts in the indictment. O Hearn Co. Ct. J. of the County Court
Judge's Criminal Court for District No. 1, Nova Scotia, requested a pre‑sentence
report and adjourned the matter of sentence.

 

4.                Just
before the sentence hearing on November 4, 1983, defence counsel was informed,
for the first time, that the Crown might bring a dangerous offender application
under Part XXI of the Code. At the commencement of the hearing, the
Crown requested and was granted an adjournment to permit it to consider
bringing such an application. The application was subsequently made. On
November 8, 1983, consent to the application was obtained from the Deputy
Attorney General of Nova Scotia, as required by s. 689(1)(a) of the Code.

 

5.                At
the commencement of the hearing of the application on December 14, 1983, an
agreed upon statement of facts was read into the record. Evidence, including
expert psychiatric testimony, was tendered on behalf of both the Crown and the
appellant.

 

6.                Though
O Hearn Co. Ct. J. had at the outset warned the Crown attorney that he would
have an ""uphill fight"" owing to the age of the appellant, the judge
in the end found, on the basis of medical and other evidence presented to him,
that it had been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
qualified as a dangerous offender under the provisions of the Code. In
his view, it had been shown that the appellant had a ""sociopathic
personality"" and had so little conscience that it did not govern his actions.
He concluded that it could be said with ""a high degree of confidence""
that it was ""very likely"" that the appellant would constitute a
danger to the psychological or physical health and lives of others owing to
""his in‑built, perhaps congenital indifference to the consequences
to others, his lack of affect, his lack of feeling for others"". He
belonged, the judge stated, to a class of people who, though mentally able to
understand the law and to conform their conduct to its dictates, are so irresponsive
to the law that they must be dealt with by extraordinary measures.

 

7.                O
Hearn Co. Ct. J. also considered and rejected the appellant's contentions that
Part XXI of the Code was constitutionally invalid as offending against
the guarantees embodied in ss. 7 , 9  and 12  of the Charter , and proceeded
to sentence the appellant to an indeterminate period of detention in a
penitentiary.

 

8.                The
appellant's appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, was
unanimously dismissed for reasons given by Macdonald J.A. On January 31, 1985,
leave to appeal to this Court was granted.

 

9.                The
following constitutional questions were stated by the Court on March 26, 1985:

 

1. Whether the provisions of Part XXI of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, dealing with an application for finding, and sentencing, an
individual as a dangerous offender, in whole or in part, infringe or deny the
rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and/or 12 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2. If so, then are the provisions of Part XXI of
the Criminal Code , in whole or in part, justified on the basis of s. 1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

10.              The
appellant also argued that his rights under s. 7  of the Charter  were
violated by the Crown's failure to give him notice, before his election of a
mode of trial and the entry of his plea, that it intended to bring, or
contemplated bringing, a ""dangerous offender"" application under Part
XXI of the Code.

 

11.              The
Attorneys General of Canada, Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan
intervened in support of the constitutional validity of Part XXI. [Saskatchewan
withdrew January 29, 1987.]

 

History
and Analysis of Part XXI

 

12.              Part
XXI of the Criminal Code  establishes a scheme for the designation of
certain offenders as ""dangerous offenders"" and for sentencing such
persons to a penitentiary for an indeterminate period. It is the product of
frequently amended legislation that has existed in Canada, in one form or
another, since 1947. It has its genesis in the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908,
8 Edw. 7, c. 59, ss. 10 ‑16 (U.K.), under which a person convicted of a
crime was subject to a ""further sentence"" of not less than five or
more than ten years as preventive detention if he or she was found to be an
habitual criminal. During the debates in Parliament on that Act, its author,
Lord Gladstone, ""made it clear that it was intended to deal not with the
generality of `habituals' but only with that more limited body of `professional
criminals' or `persistent dangerous criminals' engaged in the more serious
forms of crime"" (Fox, The Modern English Prison (London 1934), at
p. 168).

 

13.              The
1938 Royal Commission established to investigate the penal system of Canada,
the Archambault Commission, in its report at p. 220 identified the initial
purpose of the British legislation as the reformation of professional or
persistently dangerous criminals, but observed that this did not occur in the
British practice. It observed, at p. 218, that:

 

Notwithstanding the best methods of punishment and
reformation that may be adopted, there will always remain a residue of the
criminal class which is of incurable criminal tendencies and which will be
unaffected by reformative efforts. These become hardened criminals for whom
""iron bars"" and ""prison walls"" have no terrors, and in whom
no hope or desire for reformation, if it ever existed, remains.

 

It thus
recommended that legislation be enacted to identify this residual class of
criminals and to provide for their indeterminate detention in a special prison.
The purpose of such detention was conceived of as ""neither punitive nor
reformative but primarily segregation from society"" (at p. 223).

 

14.              It
was against this backdrop that legislation dealing with habitual criminals was
first introduced in Canada in 1947. Section 18 of the Criminal Code
Amendment Act, S.C. 1947, c. 55, permitted the preventive detention
""for the protection of the public"" of ""habitual criminals"",
defined essentially as persons having a record of three previous indictable
offences and who are persistently leading a criminal life (s. 575c). Additional amendments (S.C. 1948,
c. 39, s. 43) provided for the sentencing in the same manner of ""criminal
sexual psychopaths"", defined as persons ""who by a course of
misconduct in sexual matters [have] evidenced a lack of power to control
[their] sexual impulses and who as a result [are] likely to attack or otherwise
inflict injury, loss, pain or other evil on any person"" (s. 1054a(8)).

 

15.              The
Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections (the Ouimet Report, 1969)
critically examined these laws and recommended their repeal for being at once
too inclusive, by applying to non‑dangerous offenders (e.g., property
offenders), and too exclusive, by requiring a recidivist history as a
precondition of their application. However, the Commission also recognized the
desirability, in policy terms, of such legislation. In the opening words of the
Report's discussion of the subject, it stated at p. 241:

 

It appears to the Committee that the protection of the
public from unlawful violence, or from unlawful conduct which represents a
serious threat to the physical safety of citizens, is one of the most urgent
problems of the criminal law.

 

The
Commission thus recommended that the extant legislation be replaced by better
tailored ""dangerous offender"" legislation. Its concerns were
reflected in the decision of this Court in Hatchwell v. The Queen,
[1976] 1 S.C.R. 39, where the present Chief Justice stated, at p. 43:

 

                   Habitual criminal legislation and
preventive detention are primarily designed for the persistent dangerous
criminal and not for those with a prolonged record of minor offences against
property. The dominant purpose is to protect the public when the past conduct
of the criminal demonstrates a propensity for crimes of violence against the
person, and there is a real and present danger to life or limb.

 

16.              The
present legislation, enacted in 1977, clearly pursues the historical purpose of
protecting the public, but is now carefully tailored so as to be confined in
its application to those habitual criminals who are dangerous to others. In brief,
Part XXI provides that where a person has been found guilty of a ""serious
personal injury offence"", the court may, upon application, find the
offender to be a dangerous offender and may thereupon impose a sentence of
indeterminate detention in lieu of any other sentence that the offender might
have received for the offence. The key provision is s. 688 which reads as
follows:

 

                   688. Where, upon
an application made under this Part following the conviction of a person for an
offence but before the offender is sentenced therefor, it is established to the
satisfaction of the court

 

(a) that the offence for which the offender has
been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a)
of the definition of that expression in section 687 and the offender
constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well‑being
of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing

 

 (i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender,
of which the offence for which he has been convicted forms a part, showing a
failure to restrain his behaviour and a likelihood of his causing death or
injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage upon other
persons, through failure in the future to restrain his behaviour,

 

(ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the
offender, of which the offence for which he has been convicted forms a part,
showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender as to
the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour, or

 

 (iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with
the offence for which he has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as
to compel the conclusion that his behaviour in the future is unlikely to be
inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint, or

 

(b) that the offence for which the offender has
been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (b)
of the definition of that expression in section 687 and the offender, by his
conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the
offence for which he has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his
sexual impulses and a likelihood of his causing injury, pain or other evil to
other persons through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses,

 

the court may find the offender to be a dangerous
offender and may thereupon impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for
an indeterminate period, in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed
for the offence for which the offender has been convicted.

 

17.              To
trigger the operation of this procedure, it is necessary by virtue of the opening
words of paras. (a) and (b) that the accused have been found
guilty of a ""serious personal injury offence"". The offences falling
within this expression are very serious violent crimes defined in s. 687 as
follows:

 

                    687. . . .

 

(a) an indictable offence (other than high
treason, treason, first degree murder or second degree murder) involving

 

(i) the use or attempted use of violence against another
person, or

 

(ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life
or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe
psychological damage upon another person.

 

and for which the offender may be sentenced to
imprisonment for ten years or more, or

 

(b) an offence or attempt to commit an offence
mentioned in section 246.1 (sexual assault), 246.2 (sexual assault with a
weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm) or 246.3 (aggravated
sexual assault).

 

Two of
the crimes of which the appellant was convicted fall within this definition.

 

18.              In
addition to having been convicted of a serious personal injury offence, s. 688(a)
and (b) provides that to qualify as a dangerous offender, it must also
be established that the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or
well‑being of others on the basis of evidence of the dangerous and
intractably persistent or brutal behaviour described in subparas. (i) to (iii),
or that the offender has shown an inability to control his sexual impulses and
a likelihood that he will thereby cause injury, pain or other evil to other
persons. The findings of the courts below that the behaviour described in s.
688 existed was not contested here.

 

19.              Owing
to the nature of the findings that must be made, provision is made for
psychological, psychiatric and criminological evidence (s. 690) as well as
character evidence (s. 692). Indeed, the evidence of at least two psychiatrists
is obligatory. As well, the judge is empowered to make directions and to remand
the offender for the purposes of observation (s. 691).

 

20.              Because
of the serious implications of the procedure for the accused, a number of
safeguards have been provided. Thus the consent of the provincial Attorney
General is required and the offender must, following the application, be given
at least seven days notice of the basis on which it is made (s. 689). The
offender is allowed to nominate one of the psychiatric witnesses (s. 690(2))
and failure to do so obliges the court to nominate one on his or her behalf (s.
690(3)). The offender also has a right to be present at the hearing (s. 693),
and to appeal against sentence (s. 694(1)). As well, the Solicitor General of Canada
is to be furnished with copies of the psychological, psychiatric and
criminological evidence and of the observations of the Court (s. 695). Finally,
and importantly, provision is made for review of the sentence at the expiration
of three years from its imposition and every two years thereafter (s. 695.1).

 

The
Issues

 

21.              Before
entering into a detailed discussion of the issues, it may be useful to note
that this case exemplifies the rather obvious point that the rights and freedoms
protected by the Charter  are not insular and discrete (see, e.g., my
comments in this regard in R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588.) Rather,
the Charter  protects a complex of interacting values, each more or less
fundamental to the free and democratic society that is Canada (R. v. Oakes,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p. 136), and the particularization of rights and
freedoms contained in the Charter  thus represents a somewhat artificial,
if necessary and intrinsically worthwhile attempt to structure and focus the
judicial exposition of such rights and freedoms. The necessity of structuring
the discussion should not, however, lead us to overlook the importance of
appreciating the manner in which the amplification of the content of each
enunciated right and freedom imbues and informs our understanding of the value
structure sought to be protected by the Charter  as a whole and, in
particular, of the content of the other specific rights and freedoms it
embodies.

 

22.              As
already mentioned, the case raises issues concerning ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and 12  of the
Charter . Indeed, several s. 7  issues are raised, the most fundamental of
which, and hence the one with which I propose to begin, being whether the
imposition of preventive detention for an indeterminate period offends against
the principles of fundamental justice. The remaining s. 7  issues focus not on
the punishment itself, but on the fairness of the process by which the
deprivation of liberty is occasioned. I therefore propose to discuss the issues
raised by the appellant under the following headings:

 

1. Does Part XXI violate s. 7  of the Charter ?
Specifically, does it offend against principles of fundamental justice to
impose preventive detention as punishment for committing a crime?

 

2. Does Part XXI violate s. 12  of the Charter ?

 

3. Does Part XXI violate s. 9  of the Charter ?

 

4. Does Part XXI violate s. 7  of the Charter 
in other respects? Are the procedures by which the deprivation of liberty is
occasioned, the standard of proof required under Part XXI, or the use of
psychiatric evidence in a Part XXI application, fundamentally unfair to
offenders sought to be designated as dangerous? (An aspect of the foregoing
inquiry concerns the more discrete question whether s. 11 (f) of the Charter 
requires that a Part XXI application be heard by a jury.)

 

5. Were the appellant's rights under s. 7  violated
by the Crown's failure to give the appellant notice before his election and
plea?

 

A.                Does
Part XXI by Imposing Indeterminate Detention     Offend Against Fundamental
Justice Under s. 7 of                the Charter?

 

23.              In
 Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, this Court held that
the phrase ""principles of fundamental justice"" sets out the
parameters of the right not to be deprived of life, liberty and security of the
person. These principles were stated to inhere in the basic tenets and
principles not only of the judicial system but also of the other components of
our legal system (at p. 512, per Lamer J.) Hence, to determine whether
Part XXI violates the principles of fundamental justice by the deprivation of
liberty suffered by the offender, it is necessary to examine Part XXI in light
of the basic principles of penal policy that have animated legislative and
judicial practice in Canada and other common law jurisdictions.

 

24.              The
appellant submits that Part XXI results in a deprivation of liberty that is not
in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice in that it permits an
individual to be sentenced for crimes he or she has not committed or for crimes
for which he or she has already been punished. If this statement correctly
described what in fact occurs under Part XXI it would, indeed, constitute a
violation of s. 7. The reality, however, is quite different. What section 688
does is to permit a judge to impose a sentence of indeterminate detention on an
individual for having committed an offence, which sentence is ""in lieu
of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence for which
the offender has been convicted"". (Emphasis added.) The individual is
clearly being sentenced for the ""serious personal injury offence"" he
or she has been found guilty of committing, albeit in a different way than
would ordinarily be done. It must be remembered that the appellant was not
picked up off the street because of his past criminality (for which he has
already been punished), or because of fears or suspicions about his criminal proclivities,
and then subjected to a procedure in order to determine whether society would
be better off if he were incarcerated indefinitely. Rather he was arrested and
prosecuted for a very serious violent crime and subjected to a procedure aimed
at determining the appropriate penalty that should be inflicted upon him in the
circumstances.

 

25.              Thus,
the appellant's contention that he is being punished for what he might do
rather than for what he has done or, in more traditional terms, that he is
being found guilty in the absence of a finding of the requisite actus reus,
must be rejected. The punishment, as I noted, flows from the actual commission
of a specific crime, the requisite elements of which have been proved to exist
beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

26.              Nor
do I find it objectionable that the offender's designation as dangerous or the
subsequent indeterminate sentence is based, in part, on a conclusion that the
past violent, anti‑social behaviour of the offender will likely continue
in the future. Such considerations play a role in a very significant number of
sentences. I accordingly agree with the respondent's submission that it cannot
be considered a violation of fundamental justice for Parliament to identify
those offenders who, in the interests of protecting the public, ought to be
sentenced according to considerations which are not entirely reactive or based
on a ""just de‑ serts"" rationale. The imposition of a sentence
which ""is partly punitive but is mainly imposed for the protection of the
public"" (Re Moore and the Queen (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 306 (Ont.
H.C.)) seems to me to accord with the fundamental purpose of the criminal law
generally, and of sentencing in particular, namely, the protection of society.
In a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention,
deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of
the crime and the circumstances of the offender. No one would suggest that any
of these functional considerations should be excluded from the legitimate
purview of legislative or judicial decisions regarding sentencing.

 

27.              It
is thus important to recognize the precise nature of the penological objectives
embodied in Part XXI. It is clear that the indeterminate detention is intended
to serve both punitive and preventive purposes. Both are legitimate aims of the
criminal sanction. Indeed, when society incarcerates a robber for, say, ten
years, it is clear that its goal is both to punish the person and prevent the
recurrence of such conduct during that period. Preventive detention in the
context of Part XXI, however, simply represents a judgment that the relative
importance of the objectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and retribution are
greatly attenuated in the circumstances of the individual case, and that of
prevention, correspondingly increased. Part XXI merely enables the court to
accommodate its sentence to the common sense reality that the present
condition of the offender is such that he or she is not inhibited by normal
standards of behavioural restraint so that future violent acts can quite
confidently be expected of that person. In such circumstances it would be folly
not to tailor the sentence accordingly.

 

28.              It
is noteworthy that numerous examples exist, both in Canada and abroad, of ways
in which the need to protect the public from the risk of convicted persons
reoffending has been taken into consideration by the judiciary and legislature
alike.

 

29.              The
case law criteria for imposing a life sentence closely parallel those embodied
in Part XXI. Indeed, life sentences and Part XXI sentences are primarily
imposed for the same purposes and on the same type of offender. In R. v.
Hill (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 145 (Ont. C.A.), Jessup J.A. stated, at pp. 147‑48:

 

                   When an accused has been convicted of
a serious crime in itself calling for a substantial sentence and when he
suffers from some mental or personality disorder rendering him a danger to the
community but not subjecting him to confinement in a mental institution and
when it is uncertain when, if ever, the accused will be cured of his
affliction, in my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of life. Such a
sentence in such circumstances, amounts to an indefinite sentence under which
the Parole Board can release him to the community when it is satisfied, upon
adequate psychiatric examination, it is in the interests of the accused and of
the community for him to return to society. The policy expressed in my opinion
is that of the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal: cf. Thomas, Principles
of Sentencing, at pp. 272‑9.

 

A
similar view was taken by Lieberman J.A. for the Alberta Court of Appeal in R.
v. Kempton (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 176, at pp. 191‑92. Indeed, it is
not without profound significance that the appellant could, theoretically, have
received a life sentence for one of the crimes for which he was convicted,
namely, breaking and entering a dwelling house contrary to s. 306(1)(b)
of the Code. This starkly emphasizes that the sentence actually imposed
differs in emphasis and degree, but not in kind, from that which he might
otherwise have received.

 

30.              It
is true that the Hill principle, which amounts to judge‑made
dangerous offender law, has clearly been limited by subsequent decisions.
However, the basis of the retrenchment has not been a rejection of the
principle of indeterminate detention for dangerous offenders. Rather, it has
been the concern that the Hill principle not be used to circumvent the
provisions of Part XXI with its attendant safeguards for the offender. As
Martin J.A., for the Ontario Court of Appeal, observed in R. v. Crosby
(1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 233, at p. 240:

 

                   The Crown, in our view, properly
invoked the dangerous offender legislation in this case. This court has said on
more than one occasion that rather than sentence a person who has been
convicted of a serious offence and who is a continuing danger to life
imprisonment, the prosecution should proceed under the dangerous offender
provisions, where the offender has greater protection.

 

31.              In
England, statutory provisions respecting the sentencing of dangerous offenders
did not exist before 1908 when preventive detention legislation to deal with
habitual offenders was enacted. Section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967,
1967, c. 80 (U.K.), abolished such detention but the principle that a
persistent recidivist should be detained for a longer period than the ordinary
criminal has been retained in the form of the ""extended"" sentence.
Under the relevant provisions, where the prosecution establishes certain
conditions demonstrating persistence and the like, the court may impose a
sentence in excess of the statutory maximum for the offence.

 

32.              In
addition, the English courts have departed from the usual range of sentences
(the so‑called ""tariff sentence"") for particular crimes and
employed the life sentence as an indefinite preventive sentence when an
offender ""appears, on the basis of his immediate offence, his previous
history and such psychiatric evidence as may be available, to be highly likely
to commit grave offences of violence in the future"" (D. A. Thomas, Principles
of Sentencing (2nd ed. 1979), at p. 37). The circumstances in which the
indeterminate term is considered appropriate were set out by the Criminal Division
of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Hodgson (1967), 52 Cr. App. R. 113, at
p. 114:

 

                   When the following conditions are
satisfied, a sentence of life imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1)
where the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very
long sentence; (2) where it appears from the nature of the offences or from the
defendant's history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit
such offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the
consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual
offences or crimes of violence. We think that these conditions are satisfied in
the present case and that they justify an indeterminate life sentence. The Home
Secretary has of course the power to release the appellant on licence when it
is thought safe to release him, if that time comes.

 

33.              Finally,
the legislation of other jurisdictions reveals the general acceptance of
preventive detention as a means of dealing with dangerous offenders. In their
comprehensive review of protective sentencing of dangerous offenders in the
United Kingdom, Floud and Young, Dangerousness and Criminal Justice
(London 1981), note that ""the laws of most, if not all, western countries
make provision for the sentencing of offenders against whom the public requires
special protection"". For example, they observe, Denmark provides for
protective custody of dangerous offenders who commit or attempt to commit
homicide, robbery, rape and other serious offences. Similarly, the Swedish
Penal Code of 1965 provides that ""internment may be imposed if the crime
... is punishable by imprisonment for two years or longer and in view of the
defendant's criminality, mental condition, conduct and other circumstances, a
long‑lasting deprivation of liberty, without duration fixed in advance,
is deemed necessary to prevent further serious criminality on his part""
(at p. 103). Norval Morris, in ""The Habitual Criminal"" (1967), 13 McGill
L.J. 534, also observes that a number of countries have enacted legislation
to deal with incorrigible or habitual offenders, and notes, at p. 536, that
generally three elements are included in the definition of the group targeted
for such punishment‑‑criminal qualities inherent or latent in the
mental constitution, a settled practice in crime, and a public danger.

 

34.              In
the United States, as well, there are many examples of legislation embodying
the principle of protective or preventive sentencing. For example, Title 18 of
the United States Code, § 3575 (repealed, effective November 1, 1986, s.
235 Pub.L. 98‑473), provided for a greatly increased range of penalties
if the defendant was shown to be a ""dangerous special offender"".
Section 3575(f) provided that ""A defendant is dangerous . . . if a period
of confinement longer than that provided for such felony is required for the
protection of the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant"".
This statute has withstood constitutional attack in several federal Court of
Appeal decisions (see U.S. v. Davis, 710 F.2d 104 (3rd Cir. 1983); U.S.
v. Stewart, 531 F.2d 326 (6th Cir. 1975), certiorari denied 426 U.S.
922; U.S. v. Neary, 552 F.2d 1184 (7th Cir. 1977), certiorari
denied 434 U.S. 864; and U.S. v. Cox, 719 F.2d 285 (8th Cir. 1983), certiorari
denied 466 U.S. 929).

 

35.              Similarly,
several state legislatures have enacted habitual offender, recidivist or
enhanced sentencing statutes, the constitutionality of which have, in
principle, been upheld by the Supreme Court (Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S.
552 (1967); see also, Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263 (1980), which
upheld a mandatory life term on a third felony conviction (at least where
parole eligibility is provided for, a requirement emphasized in Solem v.
Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983)).

 

36.              From
what I have said already, I do not think that it could seriously be argued that
the penological objectives embodied in Part XXI themselves violate s. 7  of the Charter .
However, it is clear that the present Charter  inquiry is concerned also,
if not primarily, with the effects of the legislation. This requires
investigating the `treatment meted out', i.e. what is actually done to the
offender and how that is accomplished. Whether this ""treatment""
violates constitutional precepts seems to me to be an issue more aptly
discussed under ss. 9  and 12  of the Charter , because these provisions
focus on specific manifestations of the principles of fundamental justice. For
convenience, I shall begin with s. 12 .

 

B.                Does
Part XXI Constitute Cruel and Unusual                Punishment Under s. 12 of
the Charter?

 

37.              The
appellant contends that Part XXI violates s. 12  of the Charter  in that
it imposes a punishment that is unusually severe and serves no valid
penological purpose more effectively than a less severe punishment (e.g. a
determinate sentence).

 

38.              This
issue was addressed in Re Moore, supra, and R. v. Langevin
(1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336 (Ont. C.A.) In Re Moore, Ewaschuk J. appears
to have been influenced by the fact that this Court had, in Ex Parte
Matticks (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 213 n, sub nom. Pearson v. Lecorre
[1973] S.C.R. vi, upheld the previous habitual offender legislation under s. 2(b)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III, which provides
that no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to ""impose or
authorize the imposition of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment"". If
that more Draconian legislation was valid, he reasoned, so must the present
legislation be valid. The reasons given by Ewaschuk J. for sustaining the
legislation may be summarized as follows: the legislation would be acceptable
to a large segment of the population; the specificity of the statutory
requirements ensured their application on a rational basis; the protection of
society is an important social purpose; the legislation is not an affront to
public standards of decency given the procedural safeguards built into the
process; and, finally, the legislation is tailored so as not to be
disproportionate to the crime and the offender's potential to harm others.
Although all punishment is in some degree degrading to human dignity, he
concluded, Part XXI is not impermissibly, or cruelly and unusually, degrading
to human dignity.

 

39.              While
I agree with much of this reasoning, it is unnecessary to examine it in any
detail. For since that decision, this Court, in R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey),
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, has had the opportunity to review the scope and meaning
of s. 12 , and it is against the backdrop of that case that this issue must be
decided. Smith dealt with whether s. 5(2) of the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1, in providing for a mandatory minimum sentence of
seven years on all persons found guilty of importing a narcotic, offended the
right of individuals not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or
punishment. A majority of this Court held that s. 5(2) did violate s. 12  and
was not sustainable under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

40.              Lamer
J., speaking for the majority, set out the parameters of the right not to be
subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following terms
at pp. 1072‑74:

 

In my view, the protection afforded by s. 12  governs the
quality of the punishment and is concerned with the effect that the punishment
may have on the person on whom it is imposed. I would agree with Laskin C.J. in
Miller and Cockriell, supra, where he defined the phrase ""cruel and
unusual"" as a ""compendious expression of a norm"". The criterion which
must be applied in order to determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual
within the meaning of s. 12  of the Charter  is, to use the words of
Laskin C.J. in Miller and Cockriell, supra, at p. 688, ""whether the
punishment prescribed is so excessive as to outrage the standards of
decency"". In other words, though the state may impose punishment, the
effect of that punishment must not be grossly disproportionate to what would
have been appropriate.

 

                   In imposing a sentence of
imprisonment, the judge will assess the circumstances of the case in order to
arrive at an appropriate sentence. The test for review under s. 12  of the Charter 
is one of gross disproportionality, because it is aimed at punishments that are
more than merely excessive. We should be careful not to stigmatize every
disproportionate or excessive sentence as being a constitutional violation, and
should leave to the usual sentencing appeal process the task of reviewing the
fitness of a sentence. Section 12  will only be infringed where the sentence is
so unfit as to be grossly disproportionate.

 

                   In assessing whether a sentence is
grossly disproportionate, the Court must first consider the gravity of the
offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular
circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences would
have been appropriate to punish, rehabilitate or deter this particular offender
or to protect the public from this particular offender. The other purposes
which may be pursued by the imposition of punishment, in particular the
deterrence of other potential offenders, are thus not relevant at this stage of
the inquiry. This does not mean that the judge or the legislator can no longer
consider general deterrence or other penological purposes that go beyond the
particular offender in determining a sentence, but only that the resulting
sentence must not be grossly disproportionate to what the offender deserves. If
a grossly disproportionate sentence is ""prescribed by law"", then the
purpose which it seeks to attain will fall to be assessed under s. 1 . Section
12  ensures that individual offenders receive punishments that are appropriate,
or at least not grossly disproportionate, to their particular circumstances,
while s. 1  permits this right to be overridden to achieve some important
societal objective.

 

                   One must also measure the effect of
the sentence actually imposed. If it is grossly disproportionate to what would
have been appropriate, then it infringes s. 12 . The effect of the sentence is
often a composite of many factors and is not limited to the quantum or duration
of the sentence but includes its nature and the conditions under which it is
applied. Sometimes by its length alone or by its very nature will the sentence
be grossly disproportionate to the purpose sought. Sometimes it will be the
result of the combination of factors which, when considered in isolation, would
not in and of themselves amount to gross disproportionality. For example,
twenty years for a first offence against property would be grossly
disproportionate, but so would three months of imprisonment if the prison
authorities decide it should be served in solitary
confinement . . . .

 

                   The numerous criteria proposed
pursuant to s. 2(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Eighth
Amendment of the American Constitution are, in my opinion, useful as factors to
determine whether a violation of s. 12  has occurred. Thus, to refer to tests
listed by Professor Tarnopolsky, the determination of whether the punishment is
necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose, whether it is founded on recognized
sentencing principles, and whether there exist valid alternatives to the
punishment imposed, are all guidelines which, without being determinative in
themselves, help to assess whether the punishment is grossly disproportionate.

 

41.              It
is clear from the foregoing that s. 12  is concerned with the relation between
the effects of, and reasons for, punishment. At the initial stage of the
inquiry into proportionality, those effects are to be balanced against the
particular circumstances of the offence, the characteristics of the offender
and the particular purposes sought to be accomplished in sentencing that person
in the manner challenged. If, in light of these considerations, the punishment
is found to be grossly disproportionate, a remedy must be afforded the offender
in the absence of social objectives that transcend the circumstances of the
particular case and are capable of justifying the punishment under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

42.              Let
us first consider the substantive ways in which the present legislation itself
seeks to accommodate the conflicting interests, on the one hand, of society in
seeking to protect itself from dangerous criminals and, on the other, of the
offender in not being subjected to punishment grossly disproportionate to the
offence and the circumstances of the individual case. It seems to me that the
legislative criteria embodied in s. 688 for designating offenders as dangerous
and for sentencing such persons tend, although not conclusively, to sustain the
legislation as not constituting a violation of s. 12 . I say ""not
conclusively"" for, as will be seen, it is only when s. 688 is read in the
context of the scheme as a whole that the legislation can be upheld.

 

43.              First,
the legislation applies only to persons convicted of a ""serious personal
injury offence"" as defined in s. 687. These offences all relate to conduct
tending to cause severe physical danger or severe psychological injury to other
persons. Significantly, the maximum penalty for all these offences must be at
least ten years' imprisonment. Secondly, it must be established to the
satisfaction of the court that the offence for which the person has been
convicted is not an isolated occurrence, but part of a pattern of behaviour
which has involved violence, aggressive or brutal conduct, or a failure to
control sexual impulses. Thirdly, it must be established that the pattern of
conduct is very likely to continue and to result in the kind of suffering
against which the section seeks to protect, namely, conduct endangering the
life, safety or physical well‑being of others or, in the case of sexual
offences, conduct causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons. Also
explicit in one form or another in each subparagraph of s. 687 is the
requirement that the court must be satisfied that the pattern of conduct is
substantially or pathologically intractable. Finally, the court has the
discretion not to designate the offender as dangerous or to impose an indeterminate
sentence, even in circumstances where all of these criteria are met.

 

44.              It
seems to me that having concluded that the legislative objectives embodied in
Part XXI are not only of substantial importance to society's well‑being,
but, at least in theory, sufficiently important to warrant limiting certain
rights and freedoms, one must equally conclude that the legislative
classification of the target group of offenders meets the highest standard of
rationality (and I use the word not as a term of art) and proportionality that
society could reasonably expect of Parliament. Not only has a diligent attempt
been made to carefully define a very small group of offenders whose personal
characteristics and particular circumstances militate strenuously in favour of
preventive incarceration, but it would be difficult to imagine a better
tailored set of criteria that could effectively accomplish the purposes sought
to be attained.

 

45.              However,
the legislative classification of offenders as dangerous is only one aspect of
the ""means analysis"" under s. 12 . It is equally important to consider
the constitutional validity, under s. 12 , of the actual ""treatment meted
out"". There can be no doubt that detention per se, and preventive
detention in particular, is not cruel and unusual in the case of dangerous
offenders, for the group to whom the legislation applies has been functionally
defined so as to ensure that persons within the group evince the very
characteristics that render such detention necessary.

 

46.              It
is argued, however, that it is not the detention itself but its indeterminate
quality that harbours the potential for cruel and unusual punishment. And
it is difficult to deny that the effects of an indeterminate sentence on a
dangerous offender must be profoundly devastating. It has, for instance, been
argued before the Court that the imposition of an indeterminate sentence,
because of its uncertainty, saps the will of an offender, removing any
incentive to rehabilitate himself or herself. However, this is equally true of
a ""determinate"" life sentence such as is provided for by s. 306(1) (b).
Indeed, in view of the provisions regarding parole it is possible, at least
theoretically, that a dangerous offender could be released consequent on his
first review, three years after the detention was imposed and well in advance
of the seven or so years an offender serving a life sentence must serve before
his or her first such review. This is, however, rather unrealistic. Evidence
before the Court indicated that between 1980‑86, only six dangerous
offenders were granted day parole, two of whom had served 10‑15 years,
three, 15‑20 years, and one, more than 20 years.

 

47.              In
truth, there is a significant difference between the effect of a Part XXI
sentence and other, more typical, sentences. When a person is imprisoned for an
absolute and determinate period, there is at least the certainty that the
incarceration will end at the termination of that period. The convicted person,
during the term of sentence, can remain in a passive state, secure in the
knowledge that he or she will be released thereafter. For the offender
undergoing an indeterminate sentence, however, the sole hope of release is
parole. The ordinary convict, it is true, can also choose to actively affect
the length of his or her sentence by attempting to conform his or her behaviour
to meet the expectations of the Parole Board. But whatever the legal nature of
the interest in the availability of parole may be in general, it seems to me
that, as a factual matter, the availability of parole is not as
important a factor in deciding whether a determinate sentence is cruel and
unusual as it is in assessing the constitutionality of a Part XXI sentence.

 

48.              This
is so because in the context of a determinate sentencing scheme the
availability of parole represents an additional, superadded protection of the
liberty interests of the offender. In the present context, however, it is,
subsequent to the actual imposition of the sentence itself, the sole protection
of the dangerous offender's liberty interests. Indeed, from the point of view
of the dangerous offender his or her detention is never complete until it is
factually complete. In this sense, each opportunity for parole will appear to
the dangerous offender as the sole mechanism for terminating his or her
detention, for rendering it certain. Moreover, it is clear that an enlightened
inquiry under s. 12  must concern itself, first and foremost, with the way in
which the effects of punishment are likely to be experienced. Seen in this
light, therefore, the parole process assumes the utmost significance for it is
that process alone that is capable of truly accommodating and tailoring the
sentence to fit the circumstances of the individual offender.

 

49.              In
my opinion, if the sentence imposed under Part XXI was indeterminate, simpliciter,
it would be certain, at least occasionally, to result in sentences grossly
disproportionate to what individual offenders deserved. However, I believe that
the parole process saves the legislation from being successfully challenged
under s. 12 , for it ensures that incarceration is imposed for only as long as
the circumstances of the individual case require.

 

50.              When
an indeterminate sentence is imposed, Part XXI provides for periodic review,
for the purposes of determining whether parole should be granted, of the ""condition,
history and circumstances of that person"" after the first three years
of detention and every two years thereafter. Section 695.1 provides as follows:

 

                   695.1 (1) Subject to
subsection (2), where a person is in custody under a sentence of detention in a
penitentiary for an indeterminate period, the National Parole Board shall,
forthwith after the expiration of three years from the day on which that person
was taken into custody and not later than every two years thereafter, review
the condition, history and circumstances of that person for the purpose of
determining whether he should be granted parole under the Parole Act
and, if so, on what conditions.

 

                   (2) Where a person is in custody
under a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period
that was imposed before the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1977 came into
force, the National Parole Board shall, at least once in every year, review the
condition, history and circumstances of that person for the purpose of
determining whether he should be granted parole under the Parole Act
and, if so, on what conditions.

 

The
criteria in light of which an application for parole is considered are
specified in s. 10(1)(a) of the Parole Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P‑2:

 

                   10. (1) The Board may

 

(a) grant parole to an inmate, subject to any
terms or conditions it considers desirable, if the Board considers that

 

(i) in the case of a grant of parole other than day
parole, the inmate has derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment,

 

(ii) the reform and rehabilitation of the inmate will be
aided by the grant of parole, and

 

(iii) the release of the inmate on parole would not
constitute an undue risk to society;

 

51.              While
the criteria embodied in s. 10(1)(a) do not purport to replicate the
factual findings required to sentence the offender to an indeterminate term of
imprisonment, they do afford a measure of tailoring adequate to save the
legislation from violating s. 12 . It must be remembered that the offender is
being sentenced indeterminately because at the time of sentencing he was
found to have a certain propensity. The sentence is imposed ""in lieu of
any other sentence"" that might have been imposed and, like any other such
sentence, must be served according to its tenor. The offender is not being
sentenced to a term of imprisonment until he is no longer a dangerous offender.
Indeed, s. 695.1 provides that the circumstances of the offender be reviewed
for the purpose of determining whether parole should be granted and, if
so, on what conditions; it does not provide that the label of dangerous
offender be removed or altered. Finally, the very words of s. 695.1 of the Code
and s. 10(1)(a) of the Parole Act establish an ongoing process
for rendering the sentence meted out to a dangerous offender one that accords
with his or her specific circumstances.

 

52.              It
may be argued that the legislation could be better tailored. For example, it
might have been argued that the review process should focus solely on whether
the offender continued to possess the characteristics that defined him or her
as a proper subject of indeterminate detention. Indeed, one might say that to
ask, as the Parole Board does, whether the individual has been reformed or
rehabilitated, is to pose a question that ex hypothesi cannot be
answered affirmatively, for it was implicit in the designation of the offender
as dangerous that he or she was not amenable to rehabilitation by usual means.
However, this argument must be rejected for a number of reasons.

 

53.              To
begin with, the criteria actually used serve to emphasize the point made
earlier in this judgment that sentencing, even under Part XXI, embodies a
complex of penological objectives. I do not think it can be argued, either as a
matter of logic or of common sense, that by virtue of a decision to sentence an
offender according to considerations based primarily on prevention,
other equally valid, subsisting penal goals cease to be relevant. To reiterate,
protecting society from the dangerous offender never wholly supplants the other
legitimate objectives embodied in a Part XXI sentence.

 

54.              Seen
in this light it would be preposterous to require of dangerous offenders only
that they demonstrate to the Parole Board that they have ceased to be
""dangerous"" (in terms identical to those used in Part XXI), for this
would require of them a lesser showing than is required of other convicts. It
seems to me that had s. 695.1 provided for a ""dangerous offender
review"", rather than a parole review, but borrowed the identical criteria
employed in the Parole Act, it would perhaps be more readily apparent
that the review provided for does, indeed, accomplish the requisite tailoring
sufficient to sustain the legislative scheme as a whole. Section 10(1)(a)(iii)
requires the Board to consider whether the release of the inmate would
constitute an ""undue risk"" to society; if the accused continues to be
dangerous then, by definition, this criterion remains unsatisfied. Section
10(1)(a) also requires that the Board be satisfied that the inmate has
derived the maximum benefit from incarceration and that the inmate's reform and
rehabilitation would be aided by release.

 

55.              These
criteria seem to me to be no less pertinent reflections of society's concerns
in releasing dangerous offenders than they are in releasing other offenders.
The fact that dangerous offenders may be less likely to satisfy these
requirements is primarily a function of their dangerousness, not of the
punishment imposed. Of course, the imposition of an indeterminate sentence may,
like all sentences, sap the will of the offender to rehabilitate himself or
herself. However, I would have thought the incentive to reform is far greater,
at least theoretically, in the case of a dangerous offender. In this regard, I
note that the availability of parole has been seen to validate mandatory life
sentences in the context of similarly motivated legislation in the United
States (see Solem v. Helm, supra, per Powell J., for the
majority).

 

56.              Furthermore,
I am not sure that to inquire into the presence or absence of less restrictive
means is wholly compatible with the insistence of this Court in Smith,
supra, that s. 12  only redress punishment that is grossly
disproportionate to the circumstances of any given case. The word
""grossly"", it seems to me, reflects this Court's concern not to hold
Parliament to a standard so exacting, at least in the context of s. 12 , as to
require punishments to be perfectly suited to accommodate the moral nuances of
every crime and every offender.

 

57.              I
would, therefore, conclude that Part XXI does not violate s. 12  of the Charter .

 

58.              Before
leaving this issue, however, I would make one further comment. The conclusion
that the liberty interest of a dangerous offender that is at stake in any
parole hearing is, as a practical matter, different from that of
""ordinary"" offenders serving determinate sentences might affect the
way in which the procedural adequacy of the review procedure might be viewed.
However, in view of my conclusion that the dangerous offender is not being
treated in a substantively unfair manner, and in view of the statement by Lamer
J. in Smith, supra, at p. 1075 that ""s. 12  is concerned with the effect
of a punishment and, as such, the process by which the punishment is imposed is
not ... of any great relevance to a determination under s. 12 "", I will
postpone consideration of this matter for scrutiny under s. 7  when I turn to a
discussion of some of the more specifically procedural issues.

 

C.                Does
Part XXI Violate s. 9 of the Charter by                  Authorizing Arbitrary
Detention or Imprisonment?

 

59.              Counsel
for the appellant contended that Part XXI violates the right of persons not to
be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned, contrary to s. 9  of the Charter .
He suggested that Part XXI results in arbitrary detention in the following
respects: the test of ""likelihood"" under Part XXI is
unconstitutionally vague; the labelling of persons as dangerous offenders is
arbitrary since it is based on inherently unreliable psychiatric evidence; and
there are no guidelines with respect to the invocation of Part XXI such that
the prosecutor has unfettered discretion as to when to make a dangerous
offender application.

 

60.              This
Court has not yet pronounced on the scope of s. 9  and the meaning of the words
""arbitrarily detained or imprisoned"" and I do not think this would be
an appropriate case to do so. The issue was not strenuously argued by the
parties or examined in depth in the courts below. More to the point, however,
is that, in my view, even assuming s. 9  were given the broadest possible
interpretation, the appellant's submissions in this regard must fail.

 

61.              There
has been considerable controversy in the lower courts as to whether the ambit
of protection afforded by s. 9  extends to imprisonment or detention
specifically authorized under existing law or whether s. 9  is ipso facto
satisfied when imprisonment is imposed in accordance with legislative
requirements (see the cases canvassed in R. v. Konechny (1983), 38 C.R.
(3d) 69, per Lambert J.A., dissenting, at pp. 70‑71). However, assuming
that the right to attack a sentence under s. 9  is not foreclosed by the fact
that it is legislatively prescribed, and that the statutory procedures have
been judicially complied with (see Mitchell v. Attorney General of Ontario
(1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 225 (Ont. H.C.), per Linden J., at p. 239), it
seems to me that in no sense of the word can the imprisonment resulting from
the successful invocation of Part XXI be considered ""arbitrary"".
Indeed, when one fleshes out the specific submissions of the appellant in this
regard they appear to be merely attempts to recast issues considered elsewhere
in this judgment. For example, although the first two submissions made under
this heading are directed to the alleged lack of proportionality or adequacy,
in constitutional terms, of the legislative means to the objectives sought to
be attained, they are not independently addressed to the arbitrary nature of
the imprisonment. To the extent that these arguments reflect the appellant's
concern that the procedure for the designation of offenders as dangerous is, in
general terms, impermissibly unfair, I will address these arguments later under
s. 7 , where they properly belong. Similarly, to the extent that they belie a
fear that punishment is being imposed without due concern for the circumstances
of the particular offender, I have already addressed these arguments under s. 12 .

 

62.              However,
even giving the word ""arbitrary"" its broadest signification, it is
readily apparent that not only is the incarceration statutorily authorized, but
that the legislation narrowly defines a class of offenders with respect to whom
it may properly be invoked, and prescribes quite specifically the conditions
under which an offender may be designated as dangerous. If these criteria are
themselves unconstitutional, it is because they otherwise fail adequately to
safeguard the liberty of the individual, not because they are arbitrary.
Indeed, as Ewaschuk J. observed in Re Moore, supra, at p. 314, "". .
. the legislative criteria for finding a person a dangerous offender [are]
perhaps the most detailed and demanding in the Criminal Code "".
Moreover, implicit in my discussion of the s. 12  issue is the common sense
conclusion that the criteria in Part XXI are anything but arbitrary in relation
to the objectives sought to be attained; they are clearly designed to segregate
a small group of highly dangerous criminals posing threats to the physical or
mental well‑being of their victims.

 

63.              As
I see it, then, the sole issue left for consideration under s. 9  is whether the
lack of uniformity in the treatment of dangerous persons that arises by virtue
of the prosecutorial discretion to make an application under Part XXI
constitutes unconstitutional arbitrariness. The appellant is not suggesting
that prosecutors, in his case or generally, have exercised their discretion
arbitrarily in this regard. Indeed, the affidavit evidence filed by the Crown
in the companion case of R. v. Milne indicates that from 1978‑86,
an average of only seven persons per year were sentenced under Part XXI. On
average, each offender committed 12.12 offences, 2.2 of which were violent and
3.53 of which were sexual in nature. This suggests that the legislation has, in
general, not been abused. I have no doubt that if and when it is alleged that a
prosecutor in a particular case was motivated by improper or arbitrary reasons
in making a Part XXI application, a s. 24 remedy would lie. However, I do not
think there is any warrant for presuming the executive will act
unconstitutionally or for improper purposes.

 

64.              More
important, however, is the fact that prosecutors always have a discretion in
prosecuting criminals to the full extent of the law, an aspect of which
involves making sentencing submissions. In this respect, I am in complete
agreement with Crown counsel's submission that "". . . it is the absence of
discretion which would, in many cases, render arbitrary the law's
application"". As he notes, ""the absence of any discretion with
respect to Part XXI would necessarily require the Crown to always proceed under
Part XXI if there was the barest prima facie case and the Court, upon
making a finding that the offender is a dangerous offender, would always be
required to impose an indeterminate sentence"".

 

65.              The
foregoing also dispenses with the argument, not pursued here, that the judge
ought not to have discretion with respect to whether he or she sentences an
offender found to be dangerous to an indeterminate sentence. As Ewaschuk J.
stated in Re Moore, supra, at p. 310, the offender cannot be
heard to complain of a discretion that can only operate to the offender's
benefit. Indeed, it is apparent that one feature of s. 5(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act that disturbed this Court in Smith, supra, was
the very fact that the imposition of sentence followed automatically upon
conviction.

 

66.              The
remaining argument is that the prosecutorial discretion results in a
geographical lack of uniformity and that this constitutes impermissible
arbitrariness. However, the appellant is not arguing, as the accused did in Morgentaler
v. The Queen that this lack of uniformity is mandated by the terms of
the legislation (which may or may not be a meritorious argument). Rather,
this argument appears to recast the prosecutorial discretion argument.
Moreover, variation among provinces in this regard may be inevitable and,
indeed, desirable, in a country where a federal statute is administered by
local authorities. In any event, it may be observed parenthetically that while
the affidavit evidence suggests that dangerous offender applications are made
more frequently in British Columbia (25% of all such applications) and, perhaps
surprisingly, never in Quebec, Newfoundland, Manitoba or Prince Edward Island,
no attempt has been made to explain the significance of this data, for example,
by relating it to the relevant population of offenders potentially coming
within the provisions of Part XXI.

 

67.              Having
dealt with the broader issues, I now turn to the more specifically procedural
issues raised by the appellant.

 

D.                Are
the Part XXI Procedures by Which this                    Deprivation of Liberty
is Occasioned and Reviewed    Fundamentally Unfair?

 

(i) Does Section 11(f) of the Charter 
Require a                                      Jury Hearing of a Part
XXI Application?

 

68.              Section
689(2) of the Code provides that an application under Part XXI shall be
heard and determined by the court without a jury. The appellant submits that
the procedure for designating an offender as dangerous is unfair and contrary
to ss. 7  and 11 (f) of the Charter , in particular, by denying the
offender the right to the benefit of a jury's determination of dangerousness. I
shall deal with the s. 11 (f) issue first.

 

69.              Section
11 (f) of the Charter  provides that:

 

11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) . . . to the benefit of trial by jury where
the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or a more
severe punishment;

 

70.              The
key issue, for s. 11  purposes, is whether the Crown application to declare the
offender a dangerous offender is equivalent to ""charging"" the
offender with ""an offence"", for it is obvious that such offenders are
liable to detention for periods much longer than five years.

 

71.              The
accepted view in Canada is that the process by which an offender may be
designated dangerous is simply part of the sentencing process. In the leading
case of Brusch v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373, this Court considered
whether an individual had a right under the former habitual offender
legislation to elect that the question whether he was an habitual offender be
determined by a jury. In that case, the relevant Code provision, in
contrast to the present legislation, provided for the imposition of a
""further sentence"" if it was ""found by a jury or a judge""
that the offender was an habitual criminal. Estey J., for the majority, held
that an offender did not have a right to an election even though the allegation
stating that the accused was an habitual criminal was contained in the
indictment. In his opinion, that allegation did not charge the accused with an
offence within the meaning of the relevant Code provisions. He stated,
at pp. 381‑82:

 

                   Moreover, ss. 825, 826 and 834 make
it clear that Parliament intended the provisions for an election should only
apply in certain indictable offences. Being a habitual criminal is not an
offence. A charge that an accused is a habitual criminal is added to an
indictment for an offence. Though Parliament in this sense contemplated that it
should be a part of the indictment, it does not thereby become a part of the
offence charged in the indictment. This is made clear by the provisions which
require that the accused shall first be arraigned and tried for the offence.
Then only if he be guilty of that offence will the court direct its attention
to the issue as to his being a habitual criminal and, if so, should there be
directed an indeterminate period of preventive detention. Throughout the
proceeding the offence or crime charged is treated in every respect, even as to
punishment, as separate and distinct from being a habitual criminal. With great
respect to those who entertain a contrary opinion, Part XVIII restricts the
right to an election to certain indictable offences. The addition of a charge
of being a habitual criminal, after the required notice, does not become a part
of the offence or crime charged in the indictment. There is, therefore, no
right, within the meaning of the provisions of Part XVIII, to a further
election upon the crime as charged, when a charge of being a habitual criminal
is added to the indictment.

 

Similarly,
Rinfret C.J. appeared to approve of statements made in R. v. Hunter,
[1921] 1 K.B. 555, where it was said by the Earl of Reading C.J. that the
process merely involved the assertion of a status or condition in the accused
which would enable the court, if it were established, to deal with him in a certain
manner (at pp. 375‑76).

 

72.              Cartwright
J. dissented. In his view, the accused should have had an election. He stated,
at pp. 391‑92:

 

                   On the hypothesis that the statement
added to the charge sheet stating the appellant to be a habitual criminal was
not the charge of an offence, in my opinion that addition had the effect of
changing the charge upon which the appellant had made his election to one
different in substance, with the result that the appellant never elected to be
tried by the learned judge on the charge on which he was tried. In Rex v.
Armitage [[1939] O.R. 417], the circumstances dealt with were different
from those in the case at bar but I think that case rightly decides that a
change in an indictment which makes it possible to impose a longer term of
imprisonment in the event of conviction cannot be regarded as an amendment in
matter of form only. When, pursuant to s. 827 of the Code, the judge
stated to the appellant that he was charged with an offence, he described only
the offence of breaking and entering and no notice of any sort was conveyed to
the appellant that if he elected trial by a judge on that charge he would at
the same time be giving up his right to have a jury determine the question
whether or not he was a habitual criminal.

 

73.              The
view that this procedure involves proof of a status or condition in the context
of a sentencing proceeding was expanded upon in Wilband v. The Queen,
[1967] S.C.R. 14, where Fauteux J., speaking for the majority, stated, at pp.
19‑20:

 

                   Dealing at first with the
applicability of the confession rule:‑‑There are cogent reasons to
hold, as did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, in this case, and the
Courts of Appeal for Manitoba and Alberta, respectively, in Regina v.
Johnston and Regina v. McKenzie, that the rule of evidence governing
the admissibility of statements made by a person charged with an offence has no
application in the case of statements made by a sexual offender to psychiatrists
conducting examinations in accordance with recognized normal psychiatric
procedures, in order to assist the Court in proceedings under s. 661  of the Criminal
Code .

 

                   One of the reasons flows from the
very nature of the issue involved in these proceedings. The issue, in these
proceedings which can only be resorted to if the accused has been convicted of
a sexual offence, is not whether he should be convicted of another offence, but
solely whether he is afflicted by a state or condition that makes him a dangerous
sexual offender within the meaning of s. 659 (b) of the Criminal Code .
To be so afflicted is not an offence. As to this aspect of the matter, the line
of reasoning adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the King v. Hunter
and this Court in Brusch v. The Queen, holding that a charge of being a
habitual criminal is not a charge of an offence but merely the assertion of a
status or condition, applies here on a charge of being a dangerous sexual
offender. Indeed, a reference to subs. 3 of s. 661  of the Criminal Code 
makes it clear that the object sought by Parliament, in enacting these special
provisions, is not to create an offence but to enable the Court, in cases where
a sexual offender is found to be a dangerous sexual offender, to pass upon him a
further sentence in lieu of or in addition to the sentence passed or which
could have been passed for the sexual offence of which he was convicted. These
proceedings do not involve the conviction of an offence, but the determination
of the sentence which may be pronounced after conviction. The confession
rule, which excludes incriminatory statements not affirmatively proved to have
been made voluntarily, is a rule which has been designed for proceedings where,
broadly speaking, the guilt or innocence of a person charged with an offence is
the matter in issue. The rule has not been established for proceedings related
to the determination of a sentence. I know of no binding authority holding that
its application extends, and can think of no valid reason why it should be held
to extend to examinations conducted by psychiatrists, in compliance with subs.
2 of s. 661  of the Criminal Code , in order that they could form and
subsequently convey to the Court an opinion as to the mental state or condition
of a sexual offender. [Emphasis added.]

 

74.              There
would seem to be no warrant for reconsidering the conclusion of this Court that
the ""label‑ ling"" procedure does not constitute the charge of
an offence. Nor do I think that a different conclusion can be justified for the
purposes of s. 11  of the Charter . As I observed in Canada v. Schmidt,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, the phrase ""Any person charged with an offence""
in the opening words of the section must be given a constant meaning that
harmonizes with the various paragraphs of the section. It seems clear to me
that for the purposes of s. 11  it would be quite inappropriate to conclude that
a convicted person is charged with an offence when confronted with a Part XXI
application. How can it be said that the right to the presumption of innocence
until proven guilty (s. 11 (d)) and the right to bail (s. 11 (e)),
for example, could have any application in the context of the unique post‑conviction
proceeding mandated by Part XXI?

 

(ii) Does Section 7 of the Charter 
Require a                                                     Jury
Hearing, and Do the Part XXI Hearing             and Review Procedures
Otherwise Meet the               Standard of Fairness Under that
Section?

 

75.              The
conclusion that the appellant is not entitled to the benefit of trial by jury
under s. 11 (f) does not, however, conclusively decide the question
whether he is entitled to a determination by a jury of the question of his
dangerousness, or, more generally, whether the procedural incidents of the
proceeding are constitutionally adequate to safeguard his liberty. Such
questions would appear to fall within the scope of a s. 7 inquiry, for s. 11 
does not limit s. 7 but merely serves to illustrate and, perhaps, amplify its
potential applications. This approach is consistent with the observations of Lamer
J. in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at pp. 502‑3 that:

 

                   Sections 8 to 14 are illustrative of
deprivations of those rights to life, liberty and security of the person in
breach of the principles of fundamental justice. For they, in effect,
illustrate some of the parameters of the ""right"" to life, liberty and
security of the person; they are examples of instances in which the
""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person would be violated
in a manner which is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice. To put matters in a different way, ss. 7 to 14 could have been fused
into one section, with inserted between the words of s. 7 and the rest of those
sections the oft utilised provision in our statutes, ""and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing (s. 7) the following shall be deemed
to be in violation of a person's rights under this section"".

 

76.              In
the context of s. 7, it seems to me that the nature and quality of the
procedural protections to be accorded the individual cannot depend on sterile
logic or formalistic classifications of the type of proceeding in issue.
Rather, the focus must be on the functional nature of the proceeding and on its
potential impact on the liberty of the individual.

 

77.              The
American experience is instructive in this context. In Specht v. Patterson,
386 U.S. 605 (1967), the petitioner was convicted of the crime of indecent
liberties under a Colorado statute which provided for a maximum sentence of ten
years, but he was sentenced instead under the Sex Offenders Act for an
indeterminate term, the trial judge having satisfied himself that the offender,
""if at large, [would constitute] a threat of bodily harm to members of the
public, or is an habitual offender and mentally ill"".

 

78.              On
appeal to the Supreme Court, Douglas J., speaking for the Court, stated, at pp.
608‑11:

 

                   The Sex Offenders Act does not make
the commission of a specified crime the basis for sentencing. It makes one
conviction the basis of commencing another proceeding under another Act to
determine whether a person constitutes a threat of bodily harm to the public or
is an habitual offender and mentally ill. That is a new finding of fact (Vanderhoof
v. People, 152 Colo. 147, 149, 380 P. 2d 903, 904) that was not an
ingredient of the offense charged. The punishment under the second Act is
criminal punishment even though it is designed not so much as retribution as it
is to keep individuals from inflicting future harm. United States v. Brown,
381 U.S. 437, 458.

 

                   The Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit in speaking of a comparable Pennsylvania statute said:

 

""It is a separate criminal proceeding which may be
invoked after conviction of one of the specified crimes. Petitioner therefore
was entitled to a full judicial hearing before the magnified sentence was
imposed. At such a hearing the requirements of due process cannot be satisfied
by partial or niggardly procedural protections. A defendant in such a proceeding
is entitled to the full panoply of the relevant protections which due process
guarantees in state criminal proceedings. He must be afforded all those
safeguards which are fundamental rights and essential to a fair trial,
including the right to confront and cross‑examine the witnesses against
him."" Gerchman v. Maroney, 355 F. 2d 302, 312.

 

                   We agree with that view. Under
Colorado's criminal procedure, here challenged, the invocation of the Sex
Offenders Act means the making of a new charge leading to criminal punishment.
The case is not unlike those under recidivist statutes where an habitual
criminal issue is ""a distinct issue"" (Graham v. West
Virginia, 224 U.S. 616, 625) on which a defendant ""must receive
reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard."" Oyler v. Boles,
368 U.S. 448, 452; Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 8. Due
process, in other words, requires that he be present with counsel, have an
opportunity to be heard, be confronted with witnesses against him, have the
right to cross‑examine, and to offer evidence of his own. And there must
be findings adequate to make meaningful any appeal that is allowed. The case is
therefore quite unlike the Minnesota statute we considered in Minnesota
v. Probate Court, 309 U.S. 270, where in a proceeding to have a person
adjudged a ""psychopathic personality"" there was a hearing where he
was represented by counsel and could compel the production of witnesses on his
behalf. Id., at 275. None of these procedural safeguards we have
mentioned is present under Colorado's Sex Offenders Act. We therefore hold that
it is deficient in due process as measured by the requirements of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400.

 

I do not
think that the fact that two statutes were involved rather than one in any way
qualifies the substance of the Court's reasons.

 

79.              In
U.S. v. Maroney, 355 F.2d 302 (1966), referred to in Specht, supra,
the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that proceedings
against the petitioner under a similar Pennsylvania statute violated the
petitioner's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment in denying him
the right to confront and cross‑examine the witnesses against him.
Freedman J., for the Court, stated, at p. 311:

 

                   The same factors, i. e., imposition
of greater punishment than that provided for conviction of a constituent
element after an additional finding of fact, led the Supreme Court to hold in
Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 75, S.Ct. 1, 99 L. Ed. 4 (1954) and Oyler v.
Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), that the habitual
offenders acts there involved, which provided for increased criminal punishment
because of prior convictions, created essentially independent criminal
offenses. This required that the determination of the issues of fact involved
in the statutory proceedings must conform to the constitutionally guaranteed
safeguards of due process in substantive criminal trials. In Oyler, the Court
said: ""Even though an habitual criminal charge does not state a separate
offense, the determination of whether one is an habitual criminal is `essentially
independent' of the determination of guilt on the underlying substantive
offense. Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 8 (75 S.Ct. 1, 99 L.Ed. 4)
(1954). * * *(A) defendant must receive reasonable notice and an
opportunity to be heard relative to the recidivist charge even if due process
does not require that notice be given prior to the trial on the substantive
offense."" (368 U.S., at 452, 82 S.Ct. at 503). If the determination of the
independent issue in Oyler, limited as it was to judicial records and identity,
made the new charge separate from the subordinate offense and thus required
full due process, it is surely required here, where the critical new issue, i.
e., whether petitioner, if at large, would constitute a danger of bodily harm
to the public, is a complex and personal one going far beyond mere records and
identification.

 

He next,
at p. 312, made the observations quoted by the Supreme Court in Specht, supra.

 

80.              Having
characterized the proceeding there as creating an essentially independent
offence, Freedman J. was led to state that the guarantee of a jury trial would
apply to such a proceeding ""if the Fourteenth Amendment makes it
applicable in state criminal cases"" (at p. 313). Nevertheless, it felt
bound by precedent to conclude that the right to trial by jury, guaranteed in
federal prosecutions by virtue of the Sixth Amendment, was not embraced by the
Fourteenth Amendment. At page 313, Freedman J. quoted ""the now classic
language"" of Cardozo J. in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319
(1937):

 

""The right to trial by jury and the immunity from
prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and
importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered
liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a `principle of justice so rooted in
the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as
fundamental.' * * * Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain
that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without
them."" (302 U.S., at 325, 58 S.Ct., at 152).

 

81.              I
am aware that the Supreme Court has, quite understandably, in Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968), since departed from Cardozo's view so as to
import a requirement of jury trials for serious state crimes. It would seem
reasonable, if not compelling, that in the ""scheme of ordered
liberty"" established under the American Constitution and incorporated into
state criminal procedure by the Fourteenth Amendment, offences of equivalent
seriousness should not be subjected to significantly different procedures
depending on whether the prosecution arose in a federal or state court.
Importantly, however, there is nothing in the case to suggest that the right to
a jury trial was intended to be extended to a post‑conviction sentencing
hearing where traditionally the jury has played no part.

 

82.              Indeed,
subsequent American case law has consistently rejected the suggestion in Specht
that the ""full panoply"" of criminal procedural protections including
the right to a jury determination, attach to such post‑conviction
proceedings. Typical of these cases is the frequently cited case of U.S. v.
Inendino, 463 F.Supp. 252 (1978 N. D. Ill.), aff'd 604 F.2d 458 (7th Cir.
1979), certiorari denied, 444 U.S. 932 (1979), where Decker J. of the
U.S. District Court, in considering the procedural adequacy of a statutory
enhanced sentencing proceeding very similar to that involved here, stated, at
p. 256:

 

                   Some courts and commentators have
interpreted Specht to mean that if a sentencing or other post‑conviction
proceeding involves new charges of criminal conduct, and results in increased
imprisonment, then it must be conducted in accordance with the procedures of a
normal criminal trial, see, e.g. United States v. Duardi, 384 F.Supp.
874 (W.D.Mo.1974), affirmed on other grounds 529 F.2d 123 (8th Cir.
1975). Dicta in the Specht case does support this view; for example, the
Court points out that the statute requires a ""new finding of fact""
which results in ""criminal punishment"", and quotes from a lower court
case holding that the defendant is entitled to ""the full panoply"" of
criminal trial rights . . . .

 

                   However, a closer examination of
related Supreme Court cases leads to the conclusion that the Court has drawn
a line between pre‑conviction and post‑conviction proceedings, and
has approved post‑conviction proceedings which provide less than the full
panoply of trial rights. The widest discretion and informality is permitted
in the normal sentencing procedure. [Emphasis added.]

 

However,
Decker J. notes, at p. 257:

 

                   The Supreme Court has required
more formality in presentence proceedings which may result in sentences longer
than the normal statutory maximum. In several early cases, the Court
rejected due process and double jeopardy challenges to recidivist statutes,
under which a defendant who had been previously convicted could receive an
enhanced sentence. The Court held that recidivist sentencing was not a second
punishment for the earlier crime, but rather increased punishment for the
latest offense, due to aggravated circumstances:

 

""(T)he repetition of criminal conduct aggravates
their guilt and justifies heavier penalties when they are again
convicted."" Graham v. West Virginia, 224 U.S. 616, 623, 32 S.Ct.
583, 585, 56 L.Ed. 917 (1912).

 

Thus, this proceeding was not governed by the formal
rules of criminal trial procedure.

 

                   However, in recognition of the
fact that these procedures may result in a substantial deprivation of liberty,
the Court has held that the defendant is entitled to representation of counsel,
Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 75 S.Ct. 1, 99 L.Ed. 4 (1954), and to
notice and opportunity to be heard, Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 82
S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962). Although the exact dimensions of these
rights have not been fully articulated, courts have held that they do not
include the right to trial by jury, see Turnbough v. Wyrick, 551
F.2d 202 (8th Cir. 1977); James v. Twomey, 466 F.2d 718 (7th Cir. 1972),
nor the right to grand jury indictment, United States v. Baca,
451 F.2d 1112 (10th Cir. 1971); see also, Beland v. United States, 128
F.2d 795 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 676, 63 S.Ct. 157, 87 L.Ed.
543, reh'g denied 317 U.S. 710, 63 S.Ct. 205, 87 L.Ed. 566 (1942).
[Emphasis added.]

 

83.              Similarly,
in the also oft‑cited case of U.S. v. Schell, 692 F.2d 672 (1982),
Logan J., for a majority of the Court of Appeals, 10th Cir., stated, at p. 677,
that he agreed with the vastly preponderant view of other circuit courts that
the Specht Court's quotation of Third Circuit language should not be
taken as dictating that the ""full panoply"" of procedural protections
apply to post‑conviction hearings. He notes, too, that this issue was not
before the Court in Specht.

 

84.              The
cases to which I have referred dealt primarily with the use of hearsay evidence
in such proceedings and with the question whether dangerousness could
constitutionally be proved simply on a preponderance of evidence rather than
beyond a reasonable doubt. Quite apart from the specific conclusions of the
American courts respecting these matters, I would adopt the functional reasons
given by those courts for viewing the ""labelling"" hearing to be the
kind of hearing that attracts a high level of procedural protection for the
offender. I find their approach to be more attuned to the distinctive nature of
such inquiries, and more congruent with the reality of the very profound
consequences that the labelling procedure harbours for the offender.
Nevertheless, I would conclude that it is not required, as a constitutional
matter, that the determination of dangerousness be made by a jury.

 

85.              It
is clear that, at a minimum, the requirements of fundamental justice embrace
the requirements of procedural fairness (see, e.g., the comments to this effect
of Wilson J. in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985]
1 S.C.R. 177, at pp. 212‑13). It is also clear that the requirements of
fundamental justice are not immutable; rather, they vary according to the
context in which they are invoked. Thus, certain procedural protections might
be constitutionally mandated in one context but not in another. Suffice it to
say, however, that a jury determination is not mandated in the present context.
The offender has already been found guilty of an offence in a trial at which he
had the option of invoking his right to a jury. Moreover, the procedure to
which he was subjected subsequent to the finding of guilt does not impact on
his liberty to the same extent as that initial determination. Indeed, this is
made clear by the same considerations that led this Court, in Brusch,
supra, to classify the proceedings as part of the sentencing process. While
the legal classification of the proceeding as part of the sentencing process
does not necessarily decide the question of the scope of the procedural
protection to be afforded the offender, the functional, factual considerations
animating that conclusion must be taken into account.

 

86.              Finally,
it is not insignificant that, unlike the situation in Maroney, supra,
the judge at such a hearing does retain a discretion whether or not to impose
the designation or indeterminate sentence, or both.

 

87.              It
is noteworthy, too, that Part XXI provides considerable procedural protection
to the offender. Section 689(1)(a) requires that the consent of the
Attorney General be obtained either before or after the application is made.
Section 689(1)(b) requires that ""at least seven days notice be
given to the offender by the prosecution, following the making of the
application, outlining the basis on which it is intended to found the
application"". Moreover, the offender has the right to attend, present
evidence and cross‑examine witnesses, in addition to a right of appeal in
the broadest terms on questions of fact, law or mixed fact and law.

 

88.              It
seems to me that s. 7  of the Charter  entitles the appellant to a fair
hearing; it does not entitle him to the most favourable procedures that could
possibly be imagined. I do not think it can be argued that the procedure at a
Part XXI application is unfair in so far as it denies to an offender the right
to a jury's determination of his or her dangerousness.

 

89.              In
other respects, however, the case law following Brusch has given a
judicial gloss to Part XXI that might, at some point, merit reappraisal by this
Court. In light of the foregoing discussion it might well be that the logic
that justified holding Part XXI applications to be part of the sentencing
process cannot now serve to justify the whittling down of procedural rights
that appears to have flowed therefrom.

 

90.              Furthermore,
it is clear from my earlier comments that the fairness of the process by which
the deprivation of liberty is occasioned cannot, in the case of a dangerous
offender, be considered in isolation from the process by which that deprivation
of liberty is reviewed. Given the severity of the impact of such review on a
dangerous offender's liberty interests, at least as opposed to those of an
""ordinary"" offender, it seems to me that considerations of
fundamental justice might require correspondingly enhanced procedural protections
at such a review. In this regard, I note that the Ouimet Commission recommended
that dangerous offenders be given a right to judicial review of their status
every three years, with the court having the power to release the offender (Report
of the Canadian Committee on Corrections (1969), at pp. 262‑63). I
agree that this would afford the convict greater safeguards, but I do not view
it to be constitutionally required. Indeed, as was pointed out by the court in
both Moore and Langevin, supra, the Parole Board is
supposedly more expert in determining whether release is warranted, and its
decisions are subject to judicial review, including review on Charter 
grounds. However, the fairness of certain procedural aspects of a parole
hearing may well be the subject of constitutional challenge, at least when the
review is of the continued incarceration of a dangerous offender. The fairness
of the review procedure, however, is not an issue in the present case.

 

(iii) Is the Standard of Proof Required Under                                                             Part
XXI, or the Use of Psychiatric             Evidence in a Part XXI
Application,             Fundamentally Unfair?

 

91.              The
appellant submits that Part XXI is fundamentally unfair in two other respects.
He contends, first, that s. 688, in requiring proof that the offender
constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well‑being
of other persons, or that there is a likelihood of the offender causing
injury, pain or other evil to other persons through a failure in the future to
control his or her sexual impulses, is fundamentally unfair in that the
standard of proof required of the Crown is lower than that traditionally
required in the criminal law process. Secondly, he argues that s. 690, by requiring
that psychiatric evidence be tendered on an application under Part XXI, is
fundamentally unfair to the extent that such evidence is an unreliable
predictor of future conduct.

 

92.              I
do not believe that either of these submissions is valid. First, it is
important to recognize exactly what is and what is not required to be proved on
such an application. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of s. 688 both
require proof that the offender represents a threat of some sort to
society. It is nowhere required that it be proved that the offender will
act in a certain way. Indeed, inherent in the notion of dangerousness is the
risk, not the certainty, of harm.

 

93.              The
appellant asserts that a ""likelihood"" is ipso facto not
susceptible of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He cites in support the
following statement of Isabel Grant, in her article ""Dangerous
Offenders"" (1985), 9 Dal. L.J. 347, at p. 360:

 

                   How does one prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that at some time in some setting, an individual
is likely to endanger some person. Surely if we add ""beyond
a reasonable doubt"" to a ""future likelihood"" the sum total can
be no greater than a balance of probabilities; a standard we would never accept
in a criminal trial.

 

However,
as Holmes has reminded us, the life of the law has not been logic: it has been
experience. The criminal law must operate in a world governed by practical
considerations rather than abstract logic and, as a matter of practicality, the
most that can be established in a future context is a likelihood of certain
events occurring. To doubt this conclusion is, in actuality, to doubt the
validity of the legislative objectives embodied in Part XXI, for to require
certainty in such matters would be tantamount to rendering the entire process
ineffective.

 

94.              Moreover,
I am not convinced, even as a matter of logic, that the appellant's submission
is sound. It seems to me that a ""likelihood"" of specified future
conduct occurring is the finding of fact required to be established; it is not,
at one and the same time, the means of proving that fact. Logically, it seems
clear to me that an individual can be found to constitute a threat to
society without insisting that this require the court to assert an ability to
predict the future. I do not find it illogical for a court to assert that it is
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the test of dangerousness has been
met, that there exists a certain potential for harm. That this is really
only an apparent paradox is aptly captured by Morden J. in R. v. Knight
(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 343 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 356 :

 

I wish to make it clear that when I refer to the
requisite standard of proof respecting likelihood I am not imposing on myself
an obligation to find it proven beyond a reasonable doubt that certain events
will happen in the future‑‑this, in the nature of things would be
impossible in practically every case‑‑but I do refer to the quality
and strength of the evidence of past and present facts together with the expert
opinion thereon, as an existing basis for finding present likelihood of future
conduct.

 

95.              Having
said the foregoing, it seems to me that when the appellant asserts that proof
of a likelihood beyond a reasonable doubt still amounts merely to proof of a
likelihood, it becomes apparent that what he is challenging is not the standard
of proof but the fact that certain persons found to be ""dangerous""
will, in fact, not have been dangerous. This is the problem of ""false
positives"", which I will address below.

 

96.              I
believe that the foregoing discussion also disposes of the contention that it
is fundamentally unfair to the offender to require proof of dangerousness to be
based, in part, on psychiatric evidence. Counsel for the appellant cited both
academic and judicial authority recognizing the inability of psychiatrists, or
anyone else for that matter, to predict accurately future events. This is
hardly a revelation. Indeed, the psychiatrists who testified at the hearing in
the present case expressly disavowed any such claim.

 

97.              It
seems to me that the answer to this argument can be briefly stated. The test
for admissibility is relevance, not infallibility. Judges at Part XXI hearings
do not assume that psychiatrists can accurately predict the future; however,
psychiatric evidence is clearly relevant to the issue whether a person is
likely to behave in a certain way and, indeed, is probably relatively superior
in this regard to the evidence of other clinicians and lay persons; see
Menzies, Webster and Sepejak, ""The Dimensions of Dangerousness""
(1985), 9 Law and Human Behaviour 1:49.

 

98.              In
People v. Henderson, 107 Cal.App.3d 475 (1980), the Court of Appeal,
Third District, stated, at pp. 485‑86:

 

                   Thus appointed psychological and
psychiatric experts have long been required by statute in . . . commitment
proceedings to bring to bear on the question of an individual's future conduct,
i.e., his dangerousness, their admittedly imprecise diagnostic
techniques . . . .

 

Although admittedly these techniques do not produce
certainty, the significance of this failure to meet an ideal of perfection is a
consideration for the trier of fact in weighing the effect of the
testimony . . . .

 

Similarly,
in Langevin, supra, at p. 355, Lacourcière J.A. stated:

 

                   I am of the view that, while the
unreliability studies may affect the weight of psychiatric predictions
of future dangerousness, they do not affect the admissibility of such
evidence. The statutory requirement of nomination of psychiatrists by both
sides to the issue preserves the principles of fundamental justice.

 

Also to
the point are the common sense observations of Ewaschuk J. in Re Moore, supra,
at pp. 310‑11:

 

                   I accept the submission that the
evidence of a psychiatrist, psychologist or criminologist is at times highly
speculative and in certain instances a lay person is in as good a position to
make a prediction as to future dangerousness. In the final say, the court,
however, must be so satisfied and not the expert witnesses. That is not to say
that experts may not assist the court, especially as to whether the
offender currently suffers from a psychological disorder, e.g.,
psychopathy, which may be relevant to the likelihood of future dangerous
conduct. [Emphasis added.]

 

99.              Finally,
the unreliability of psychiatric evidence also raises the problem of
""false positives"" (a statistical term representing the erroneous
overprediction of future violence), discussed, by Tobriner J. for the majority
of the California Supreme Court, in People v. Murtishaw, 175 Cal.Rptr.
738 (1981), at pp. 758‑59:

 

                   Numerous studies have demonstrated
the inaccuracy of attempts to forecast future violent behavior. Two
commentators summarized the results as follows: ""Whatever may be said for
the reliability and validity of psychiatric judgments in general, there is
literally no evidence that psychiatrists reliably and accurately can predict
dangerous behavior. To the contrary, such predictions are wrong more often than
they are right."" (Ennis & Litwack, Psychiatry and the Presumption
of Expertise: Flipping Coins in the Courtroom (1974), 62 Cal.L.Rev. 693,
737.) Professor Dershowitz in 1969 pointed to the skewed results characteristic
of psychiatric forecasts: ""it seems that psychiatrists are particularly
prone to one type of error‑‑over‑prediction . . . . (F)or
every correct psychiatric prediction of violence, there are numerous erroneous
predictions."" (Dershowitz, The Psychiatrist's Power in Civil
Commitment: A Knife That Cuts Both Ways (Feb. 1969), Psych. Today, at p.
47.) Cocozza and Steadman in 1976 reviewed the various studies and reported
that ""Whether one examined the legal, behavioral science, or psychiatric
literature on predictions of dangerousness, one constantly encounters
conclusions similar to the one reached by Dershowitz that psychiatrists are
generally inaccurate predictors."" (Cocozza & Steadman, op. cit.,
supra, 29 Rutgers L.Rev. at p. 1085.) In 1978 Professor Monahan undertook a
further review of studies of violence prediction and noted that the percentage
of false positives (erroneous predictions that a subject would engage in
violent behavior) never fell below 54 percentage and went as high as 99.7
percent. (Monahan, The Prediction and Control of Violent Behavior (1978), pp.
179‑196, in Hearings Before the House Subcom. on Domestic and International
Scientific Planning, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 175‑252.)

 

100.            This
problem does not appear to undermine the utility and fairness of the scheme so
much as to fortify the conclusion that the procedural protections accorded the offender,
especially on review, ought to be very rigorous. In its Report of the
Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders, the Butler Commission recognized
the difficulties in assessing dangerousness but nevertheless recommended that
the British Parliament enact dangerous offender legislation with reviewable
indeterminate sentences. It stated, at p. 60:

 

. . . the fact that we cannot quantify the probability
of future dangerous behaviour with actuarial precision is often allowed to
obscure the fact that we can point with some confidence to categories of people
who are more likely than others of the same sex and age‑group to act in
this way. Some kinds of sexual offence seem to be very
repetitive . . . . Men with several convictions of
violence are considerably more likely than their peers to be convicted of
violence in the future. Again, it is sometimes argued that even if there are
good grounds‑‑clinical or actuarial‑‑for assigning the
individual to a high risk group, he might be one of the minority in that group
who in the event will not behave in accordance with probability. But this
dilemma is inescapably involved in every decision which is based on
probabilities. All that can be done is to weigh the unpleasantness of the
consequences for the individual against the harm which he may do to others. If
the harm is likely to be slight the decision should be in his favour: if great
and highly probable‑‑for example, if a sexual offence is
accompanied by serious violence‑‑the best we can do is to make sure
that the precautions are as humane as possible.

 

Similarly,
Floud and Young, supra, reject the notion that in enacting dangerous
offender legislation Parliament unfairly sacrifices innocent persons in favour
of the public good (at pp. 48‑49):

 

                   This argument is misconceived. Errors
of prediction do not represent determinable individuals. It is not that we have
difficulty in identifying the subjects of predicted error with the methods
available to us; it is that they are in principle indeterminable. There are no
hidden individuals identifiable in principle, but not in practice, who
certainly would or would not reoffend. In this sense there are no innocent or
guilty subjects of predictive judgment.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The question is not `how many
innocent persons are to sacrifice their liberty for the extra protection that
special sentences for dangerous offenders will provide?' but `what is the moral
choice between the alternative risks: the risk of harm to potential victims or
the risk of unnecessarily detaining offenders judged to be dangerous'?

 

                   The essential nature of the
problem of preventing wilful harm is misrepresented by talk of balancing
individual and social costs. The problem is to make a just redistribution of
risk in circumstances that do not permit of its being reduced. There is a
risk of harm to innocent persons at the hands of an offender who is judged
likely to inflict it intentionally or recklessly‑‑in any case
culpably‑‑in defiance or disregard of the usual constraints. His
being in the wrong by virtue of the risk he represents is what entitles us to
consider imposing on him the risk of unnecessary measures to save the risk of
harm to innocent victims. [Emphasis added.]

 

I agree
with this reasoning. Accordingly, the appellant's submissions on this point
fail.

 

E.                Did
the Failure of the Crown to Give the Appellant       Notice Prior to his
Election or Plea Violate his                    Rights Under s. 7 of the
Charter?

 

101.            The
final issue raised by the appellant is whether his s. 7 rights were violated by
virtue of the fact that he was not advised of the Crown's intention to make a
Part XXI application before his election and, more significantly, before entry
of a plea of guilty. Given the serious consequences of such an application, it was
argued, he ought to have been given notice so as to enable him to make informed
decisions with respect to his election and plea.

 

102.            Section
689(1)(b) of the Code provides that a Part XXI application
""shall [not] be heard"" until ""at least seven days notice has
been given to the offender by the prosecutor, following the making of the
application, outlining the basis on which it is intended to found the
application"". Hence, it seems that the appellant's right to defend fully and
fairly the case against him is not impaired by the operational requirements of
Part XXI.

 

103.            It
seems, therefore, that the only prejudice the appellant can claim to have
suffered is that had he been forewarned of the Crown's intention to make a Part
XXI application, he might have elected a trial by judge and jury rather than by
judge alone, or might have pleaded not guilty rather than guilty to the charges
against him. It seems to me, however, that there is a limit beyond which it
would be unseemly for courts to inquire into or `go beyond' such decisions of
accused persons. For example, I do not think it would be proper to inquire into
whether and to what extent the absence of such notice impaired the ability of
the accused to plea bargain effectively, for ""justice should not be, and
should not be seen to be, something that can be purchased at the bargaining
table"" (Law Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper No. 15, Criminal
Procedure‑‑Control of the Process (1975), at pp. 39‑60).
Nor do I think it proper to consider that an accused might elect a trial by
jury in the hope that a jury would be less inclined to convict in circumstances
where he or she was liable to indeterminate incarceration.

 

104.            Counsel
for the appellant suggests that it is a principle of fundamental justice that
notice be given to an accused that he or she is not to be treated in the
ordinary course of procedure but that an increased penalty is to be sought
instead. As authority for this proposition he cites the American case of Oyler
v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448 (1982), and R. v. Vandale (1984), 13 W.C.B. 173.
However, these cases stand for quite the contrary proposition. In Oyler,
it was held that an accused must receive adequate notice and opportunity to be
heard relative to a recidivist charge but that due process did not require that
such notice be given prior to trial on the substantive offence.

 

105.            Furthermore,
in Vandale, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected the argument
that notice of the type here sought was mandated by s. 7  of the Charter .
Macdonald J.A., for the Court, stated at p. 4:

 

It is implicit in a plea of guilty that the accused has
knowledge of the law with respect to the sentence to which his plea exposes
him, and in the case of a person faced with an application under the dangerous
offender section the person would know his record, would know the sort of
information the authorities have about him, and that would be part of his
knowledge as to the potential of sentence involved in a plea of guilty.

 

However,
he observed that circumstances could be envisaged where a plea of guilty could
be set aside, namely, where the court was satisfied that the accused did not
fully understand the nature of the charge and the potential consequences of a
guilty plea. However, there was nothing in the facts of the case to suggest
that this knowledge was lacking. I observe that had such facts existed a remedy
would have been available to the accused quite apart from s. 24  of the Charter .

 

106.            It
seems to me to be difficult to articulate precisely in what sense the liberty
interests of the appellant were infringed by the absence of notice earlier than
is statutorily provided for. It is nowhere alleged, here or in the courts below
(where this issue was not even addressed), that the appellant did not
appreciate the potential consequences of his plea; indeed, Part XXI
itself can be seen to provide notification that the dangerous offender
provisions are invocable if ""serious personal injury offences"" are
committed by an accused. Nor is it alleged, for example, that the accused was
unfairly taken by surprise by the application, that he was not represented by
competent counsel, or that counsel pressured him to plead guilty against his
will, etc. (see, e.g., Lamoureux v. R. (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 369 (Que. C.A.))
Rather, the complaint appears simply to be that the appellant did not know that
the Crown was actually contemplating making a Part XXI application.

 

107.            Subsequent
dissatisfaction with the ""way things turned out"" or with the sentence
received is not, in my view, a sufficient reason to move this Court to inquire
into the reasons behind the election or plea of an offender, particularly where
there is nothing to suggest that these were anything other than informed and
voluntary acts; see, e.g., Antoine v. R. (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 375 (Que.
C.A.)

 

Conclusion

 

108.            I
would dismiss the appeal and answer the first constitutional question in the
negative. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider the second constitutional
question.

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

109.            Lamer J. (dissenting in
part)‑‑I have read the reasons for judgment prepared by my
colleague, Justice La Forest, and I am in substantial agreement with most of
what he has written. In particular, I agree with him that, in principle, the
imposition of a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate
period on an offender found to be a ""dangerous offender"" under Part
XXI of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, does not violate
the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  or the specific guarantees of s. 11  and that such a
sentence does not constitute arbitrary imprisonment under s. 9  or cruel and
unusual punishment under s. 12 .

 

110.            The
appellant has also challenged the procedure whereby an offender is found to be
a dangerous offender. While I agree with my colleague La Forest J. that most of
the arguments raised by the appellant fail, I find two of these arguments to be
very strong. The appellant argued that the procedure in Part XXI infringed his
rights under ss. 7  and 11  of the Charter  in that he was not given notice
of the Part XXI application until after he had pleaded guilty to the serious
personal injury offences and that s. 689(2) of the Code excludes the
jury from the determination of dangerousness.

 

111.            The
first question that must be decided is whether the offender against whom a Part
XXI application is brought is entitled only to the general protection of s. 7 
or whether he also benefits from the particular guarantees in s. 11 . Section 7 
guarantees the general right not to be deprived of one's life, liberty or
security of the person except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice. Section 11  enumerates some of the principles of fundamental justice
that apply in a particular context: where the person is ""charged with an
offence"", the principles of fundamental justice include the particular
guarantees set out in paras. (a) to (i) of s. 11 . If the person
is not ""charged with an offence"", it is necessary to determine the
principles of fundamental justice applicable in that context.

 

112.            In
my view, a person against whom an application under Part XXI is brought is a
""person charged with an offence"" under s. 11  of the Charter 
and is entitled to the particular guarantees set out in s. 11 . Generally
speaking, a person is ""charged with an offence"" under s. 11  if and as
of the moment that a formal allegation is made against him which, if found to
be true, will give a judge jurisdiction to impose a criminal or penal sanction
against him. Under Part XXI, if the court finds that the offender is a
dangerous offender then, rather than imposing a determinate sentence within the
limits provided for the offence for which the offender was convicted, the court
may impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate
period. The conclusion that the offender is a dangerous offender gives the
court jurisdiction to impose a greater sentence. The status of being a
dangerous offender is thus in my view an offence for the purposes of s. 11  and
the offender is charged with an offence when an application is brought under
Part XXI. Furthermore, the purpose of s. 11 (f) of the Charter  is
to guarantee that anyone in jeopardy of being sentenced to imprisonment for
five years or more as a result of a determination of guilt has the right to
have that determination made by a jury. To say that an application under Part
XXI is not a charge of an offence violates in my respectful view the spirit of
the Charter  and leaves without that protection offered most persons in
jeopardy when charged with an indictable offence those put in one of the most
serious jeopardies our law has created.

 

113.            Two
reasons have been advanced for concluding that s. 11  does not apply. First, it
is said that the accepted view in Canada is that the Part XXI procedure is not
a separate offence but is simply part of the sentencing process with respect to
the serious personal injury offence for which the offender was convicted. Two
decisions of this Court, Brusch v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373 and Wilband
v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 14, support this proposition. In addition, the
post‑Charter  cases of R. v. Simon (No. 2) (1982), 69 C.C.C.
(2d) 478 (N.W.T.S.C.), and R. v. Langevin (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336
(Ont. C.A.), held that s. 11  is not applicable to proceedings under Part XXI.
The wording of Part XXI and the fact that it follows immediately the part of
the Code entitled ""Punishments, Fines, Forfeitures, Costs and
Restitution of Property"" are also indications that Part XXI relates to
sentencing. None of this, however, is conclusive. The pre‑Charter
decisions of this Court are not, of course, determinative of the scope of Charter 
rights, but they do carry some weight (see R. v. Therens, [1985] 1
S.C.R. 613, at pp. 637‑40). The same is true of the post‑Charter
decisions of lower courts. Finally, it is not the form of the challenged
provisions but rather their substance which must be considered. It is clear
that Parliament, when enacting Part XXI, wanted this issue to be treated as
part of the sentencing process, but the question is not what was intended but
whether it falls within the letter and spirit of the Charter . In my view,
Part XXI is very different from sentencing provisions. A conviction gives the
judge jurisdiction to impose a determinate sentence between the minimum and the
maximum (if any) set out in the provision creating the offence. The judge will
make further findings of fact to help him decide which sentence within that
permitted range should be imposed. The permitted range of sentences is not
affected by these findings of fact. Thus, a conviction for a serious personal
injury offence gives the judge jurisdiction to impose a determinate sentence.
Under Part XXI, however, the further finding of fact that the offender is a
dangerous offender gives the judge jurisdiction to impose a different and more
severe sentence. It is not simply a finding made in the exercise of his
jurisdiction to impose a sentence but it is a finding that gives him new
jurisdiction to impose a more severe sentence, indeed a drastically more severe
sentence. It is the finding of dangerousness and not the conviction for the
personal injury offence that gives the judge jurisdiction to impose an
indeterminate sentence. The conviction for the serious personal injury offence
is the basis for commencing the proceedings under Part XXI but, in my
respectful view, Part XXI cannot be characterized as simply part of the
sentencing process with respect to the serious personal injury offence. Part
XXI involves the imposition of a punishment greater than that provided for the
serious personal injury offence after a new finding of fact, and is thus a
separate offence.

 

114.            The
second reason advanced for concluding that s. 11  does not apply to an
application under Part XXI is the ""all‑or‑nothing""
approach to s. 11  set out by the majority in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1
S.C.R. 500. In that case, it is stated that s. 11  must be restricted to
circumstances in which all of the rights set out in s. 11  are applicable. It is
suggested here that the presumption of innocence (s. 11 (d)) and the
right to reasonable bail (s. 11 (e)) cannot have any application in the
context of a Part XXI proceeding and that, as a result, s. 11  does not apply.
With respect, I disagree. In my view, the offender against whom an application
under Part XXI is brought has the right to be presumed not dangerous until the Crown
proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he is dangerous. The pre‑Charter 
case law imposed such a burden on the Crown: R. v. Jackson (1981), 61
C.C.C. (2d) 540 (N.S.C.A.) The mere fact that the terminology of guilt and
innocence is awkward in the context of Part XXI must not interfere with this
fundamental right. The right to bail in s. 11 (e) is not absolute but is
rather the right ""not to be denied reasonable bail without just
cause"". In the context of Part XXI, the offender will just have been
convicted of a serious personal injury offence such that there will always
exist a just cause for denying bail. This does not mean, however, that s. 11 (e)
has no application to Part XXI proceedings. All it means is that the norm set
out in s. 11 (e) will seldom enure to the benefit of the offender, as is
the case with respect to many other offences set out in the Code, such
as premeditated murder. I would thus conclude that an offender against whom an
application under Part XXI is brought is entitled to the guarantees set out in
s. 11 .

 

115.            This
brings us back to the two arguments set forth by the appellant: that the notice
was inadequate and that he was denied the benefit of trial by jury. The right
to the benefit of trial by jury is guaranteed by s. 11 (f) which
provides:

 

                   11. Any person
charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) . . . to the benefit of trial by jury where
the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or a more
severe punishment;

 

The
offence of being a dangerous offender is clearly one where ""the maximum
punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or a more severe
punishment"". As a result, the offender is entitled to the benefit of a
jury's determination of dangerousness. Section 689(2) of the Code, which
provides that an application under Part XXI shall be heard and determined by
the court without a jury, clearly restricts this right and must be declared
inoperative unless it can be saved under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

116.            The
Crown and the Attorneys General have not attempted to justify under s. 1  the
failure to provide a jury under Part XXI and, in my view, it would be very
difficult to do so. The determination which the jury would be called upon to
make under Part XXI is not unlike other determinations which juries make
regularly and cannot be said to be beyond the competence of a jury. There is no
evidence of any serious administrative problems which would be created by the
presence of a jury at that stage of the proceedings. In effect, there is no
suggestion that the failure to provide a jury is meant to serve any objective
""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally
protected right or freedom"" (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1
S.C.R. 295 at p. 352) or relates to ""concerns which are pressing and
substantial"" (R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 138‑39).
In these circumstances, I must conclude that s. 689(2) of the Code is
not saved by s. 1 .

 

117.            The
notice given by the Crown complied with s. 689(1)(b) which requires at
least seven days notice outlining the basis on which it is intended to found
the application. The appellant does not allege that he was prejudiced in his
defence to the Part XXI application because of any insufficiency of the notice
and the notice appears to me to be sufficient for the Part XXI proceedings.
Rather, he argues that he should have been given notice of the Crown's
intention to proceed under Part XXI before his election and plea on the serious
personal injury offence. It might well be that lack of notice violates an
accused's rights under the Charter  in regard of his trial for the
serious personal injury offence. However, if the appellant is alleging that he
was prejudiced in making his election and plea, then his remedy under s. 24(1) 
would be to challenge the proceedings leading to that conviction and to have it
struck so that he could elect and plead accordingly. He has not, however, made
any such allegation, challenged that conviction or sought any such remedy, so
it is unnecessary to consider whether we would have granted any remedy.

 

118.            I
would thus answer the constitutional questions in the following manner:

 

119.            Question
1:

 

                   Whether the provisions of Part XXI of
the Criminal Code  of Canada, dealing with an application for finding,
and sentencing, an individual as a dangerous offender, in whole or in part,
infringe or deny the rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and/or 12 of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

120.            Answer:

 

121.            The
procedure set out in Part XXI restricts the right guaranteed by s. 11 (f).
The substance of Part XXI does not infringe s. 7 , s. 11  or s. 12  and the
procedure does not otherwise infringe s. 7  or s. 11 . The appellant's arguments
under s. 9  fail.

 

122.            Question
2:

 

                   If so, then are the provisions of
Part XXI of the Criminal Code , in whole or in part, justified on the
basis of s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

123.            Answer:

 

124.            Section
689(2), the provision in Part XXI which restricts s. 11 (f), is not
justified on the basis of s. 1  of the Charter .

 

125.            As
a result, I would declare s. 689(2) of the Code to be inoperative, and I
would allow the appeal and quash the order declaring the appellant to be a
dangerous offender and the sentence of a term of detention in a penitentiary
for an indeterminate period. I would remit the matter to the County Court so
that the appellant can elect whether he wants the determination of dangerousness
made by a judge alone or by a judge and jury. I should note in passing that
there is no difficulty in this case because the trial court for the serious
personal injury offence can sit with a jury. However, legislation may be
necessary in cases where the trial court cannot sit with a jury.

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

126.            Wilson J. (dissenting in
part)‑‑I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my
colleagues, Justices La Forest and Lamer, but find it necessary to write brief
reasons of my own because I am persuaded of the merit of the appellant's
submission under s. 7  of the Charter . With respect to the appellant's
submissions under ss. 9  and 12  of the Charter , I would respectfully
adopt the reasons and conclusions of La Forest J. I leave open the question
whether a person against whom a Part XXI application is brought is a
""person charged with an offence"" within the meaning of s. 11 . It is
not necessary for me to decide this since I find that the appellant is
protected by the more general provision of s. 7 .

 

127.            It
is, in my view, a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7  of the Charter 
that an accused know the full extent of his jeopardy before he pleads
guilty to a criminal offence for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed.
Common sense impels me to the conclusion that the thought uppermost in an
accused's mind in deciding whether to plead guilty or stand upon his right to
be presumed innocent until proved otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt by the
Crown is: what is the worst that can happen to me if I am convicted of this
offence? I think we have to ask ourselves the following question: had this
accused known at the time he pleaded guilty that the Crown would be seeking an
order of preventive detention against him for an indeterminate period, would he
have pleaded guilty? If the answer to that question is probably not, then I
think the accused is entitled to the protection of s. 7  unless knowledge of his
exposure to such an order under Part XXI of the Code can properly be
attributed to him simply by virtue of its presence in the Code.

 

128.            I
have concluded that such knowledge cannot be attributed to the accused. The Code
expressly contemplates that notice will be given to the accused of the
Crown's intention to make a Part XXI application. True, it is only required to
be given seven days following the making of the application (s. 689(1)(b))
which is itself to be made ""following the conviction of a person for an
offence but before the offender is sentenced therefor"" (s. 688). But I
find this helpful rather than harmful in considering whether the appellant
should have envisaged such an application at the time he made his plea. I would
think also that the fact that such applications are rare and probably even
rarer in the case of 16‑year‑olds would make it unrealistic to
attribute such knowledge to appellant's counsel and, through him, to the
appellant.

 

129.            Having
said that, I turn to the point raised by Lamer J. towards the end of his
reasons. He states at p. 378:

 

It might well be that lack of notice violates an
accused's rights under the Charter  in regard of his trial for the
serious personal injury offence. However, if the appellant is alleging that he
was prejudiced in making his election and plea, then his remedy under s. 24(1) 
would be to challenge the proceedings leading to that conviction and to have it
struck so that he could elect and plead accordingly. He has not, however, made
any such allegation, challenged that conviction or sought any such remedy, so it
is unnecessary to consider whether we would have granted any remedy.

 

130.            In
my respectful view, it was open to the appellant to challenge his conviction or
to make no attack on his conviction but challenge the order under Part XXI. He
has gone the latter route. The accused may well have concluded that he was not
prejudiced so far as the finding of guilt was concerned by the fact that his
guilty plea was made in the absence of notice or knowledge that the Crown
intended to seek such an order, but that he was prejudiced with respect to the
making of the order. La Forest J. points out in his reasons that the order of
preventive detention was additional punishment for the offence. I see no
reason, therefore, why the accused should not take the position that he could
properly be sentenced to the maximum determinate sentence if this was thought
appropriate because this he could and ought to have envisaged, but that in
pleading guilty he did not and could not have envisaged the making of the Part
XXI order. This does not, however, mean that he must attack his conviction and
that, if he does not do so, the Court cannot grant him a s. 24(1)  remedy in
relation to the order of preventive detention. This would be a very restrictive
approach to Charter  remedies. The appellant might well have felt that he
would not succeed in a claim under s. 24(1)  to set his conviction aside, that
the Court would not view this as the appropriate and just remedy in the
circumstances, but that it might consider it appropriate and just to set aside
the order for additional punishment. I would resist any suggestion that an
accused alleging a violation of his Charter  rights must claim all or
nothing.

 

131.            For
the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, quash the order made under Part
XXI of the Code and the sentence of indeterminate detention and remit
the matter back to the learned trial judge for the imposition of the
appropriate determinate sentence.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for new brunswick

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Sexual assault ‑‑ Definition of the offence of
sexual assault ‑‑ Offence one of general rather than specific
intent ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 244,
246.1.

 

                   Respondent
was convicted of sexual assault contrary to s. 246.1(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . He entered the home of the complainant, a fifteen‑year‑old
girl, without invitation, seized her around the shoulders and arms and grabbed
her breasts. When she fought back, he said: ""Come on dear, don't hit me, I
know you want it."" She testified at trial that he tried to grab her
""private"" but did not succeed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal
expressed the view that the modifier ""sexual"" in the new offence of
sexual assault should be taken to refer to parts of the body, particularly the
genitalia. Because there was no contact with the complainant's genitals, the
conviction at trial was set aside and a conviction for common assault
substituted. The only question arising in this appeal is that of the definition
of the offence of sexual assault.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Sexual
assault is an assault within any one of the definitions of that concept in s.
244(1)  of the Criminal Code  which is committed in circumstances of a
sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim is violated. The
test to be applied in determining whether the impugned conduct has the
requisite sexual nature is an objective one: ""Viewed in the light of all
the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the assault visible to a
reasonable observer"". The part of the body touched, the nature of the
contact, the situation in which it occurred, the words and gestures
accompanying the act, and all other circumstances surrounding the conduct,
including threats which may or may not be accompanied by force, will be
relevant. The accused's intent or purpose as well as his motive, if such motive
is sexual gratification, may also be factors in considering whether the conduct
is sexual. Implicit in this view of sexual assault is the notion that the
offence is one requiring a general intent only. In the present case, there was
ample evidence before the trial judge upon which he could find that sexual
assault was committed. Viewed objectively in the light of all the
circumstances, it is clear that the conduct of the respondent in grabbing the
complainant's breasts constituted an assault of a sexual nature.

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d)
187, 40 C.R. (3d) 282, 55 N.B.R. (2d) 97, 144 A.P.R. 97, dismissing the
accused's appeal from his conviction on a charge of sexual assault and
substituting a verdict of guilty of common assault. Appeal allowed.

 

                   William
J. Corby, for the appellant.

 

                   John
S. MacPhee, for the respondent. 

 

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre J.‑‑This
appeal concerns the meaning of the term `sexual assault', as it is used in ss.
244  and 246.1  of the Criminal Code . For ease of reference, the sections
are reproduced hereunder:

 

                   244. (1) A
person commits an assault when

 

(a) without the consent of another person,
he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

 

(b) he attempts or threatens, by an act or
gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person
to believe upon reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his
purpose; or

 

(c) while openly wearing or carrying a
weapon or an imitation thereof, he accosts or impedes another person or begs.

 

                   (2) This section applies to all
forms of assault, including sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon,
threats to a third party or causing bodily harm and aggravated sexual assault.

 

                   (3) For the purposes of this
section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not
resist by reason of

 

(a) the application of force to the
complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

(b) threats or fear of the application of
force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

(c) fraud; or

 

(d) the exercise of authority.

 

                   (4) Where an accused alleges
that he believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the
subject‑matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is
sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would
constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence
relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to
consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

 

                   246.1 (1) Every
one who commits a sexual assault is guilty of

 

(a) an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years; or

 

(b) an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

 

                   (2) Where an accused is charged with
an offence under subsection (1) or section 246.2 or 246.3 in respect of a
person under the age of fourteen years, it is not a defence that the
complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject‑matter of
the charge unless the accused is less than three years older than the
complainant.

 

2.                The
facts may be briefly described. The respondent, Chase, was a neighbour of the
complainant, a fifteen‑year‑old girl. They lived in a small hamlet
near Fredericton, New Brunswick. On October 22, 1983, Chase entered the home of
the complainant without invitation. The complainant and her eleven‑year‑old
brother were in the downstairs portion of the house, playing pool. Their eighty‑three‑year‑old
grandfather was upstairs sleeping. Their parents were absent. The respondent
seized the complainant around the shoulders and arms and grabbed her breasts.
When she fought back, he said: ""Come on dear, don't hit me, I know you
want it."" The complainant said at trial that: ""He tried to grab for
my private, but he didn't succeed because my hands were too fast.""
Eventually, the complainant and her brother were able to make a telephone call
to a neighbour and the respondent left. Prior to leaving, he said that he was
going to tell everybody that she had raped him. The whole episode lasted little
more than half an hour. The respondent was charged with the offence of sexual
assault and was found guilty after trial in the Provincial Court. He appealed
to the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick where his appeal was dismissed, a
verdict of guilty of the included offence of common assault under s. 245(1)  of
the Criminal Code  was substituted, and a sentence of six months'
imprisonment was imposed: (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 187, 40 C.R. (3d) 282, 55
N.B.R. (2d) 97, 144 A.P.R. 97.

 

3.                In
the Court of Appeal, Angers J.A., speaking for a unanimous court (Stratton
C.J.N.B., Ryan and Angers JJ.A.), expressed the view that the principles
developed with respect to rape and indecent assault were of little assistance
in approaching the question of sexual assault. In his view, the modifier
""sexual"" should be taken to refer to parts of the body, particularly
the genitalia. He considered that a broader definition of the term could lead
to absurd results if it encompassed other portions of the human anatomy
described as having ""secondary sexual characteristics"". He also
expressed the view that sexual assault did not require or involve a specific
intent. Because there was no contact with the complainant's genitals, the
conviction at trial was set aside and a conviction for common assault
substituted. It becomes evident from the recital of these facts that the only
question arising on the appeal is that of the definition of the offence of
sexual assault.

 

4.                The
new sexual assault provisions of the Criminal Code  were enacted in the Act
to amend the Criminal Code in relation to sexual offences and other offences
against the person and to amend certain other Acts in relation thereto or in
consequence thereof, S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83, c. 125. They
replace the previous offences of rape, attempted rape, sexual intercourse with
the feeble‑minded, and indecent assault on a female or male. It is now
for the courts to endeavour to develop a realistic and workable approach to the
construction of the new sections. The key sections are 244 and 246.1, supra.
Section 246.1  creates the offence of sexual assault, an expression nowhere
defined in the Criminal Code . To determine its nature, we must first
turn to the assault section, 244(1), where an assault is defined in terms
similar, if not identical, to the concept of assault at common law. Section
244(2)  provides that the section applies to sexual assaults. It was suggested
in argument by the respondent that paras. (a), (b) and (c)
of s. 244(1)  are to be read disjunctively so that only para. (a) could
be applicable to the offence of sexual assault. This, it was said, must have
been the position taken by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal because, in its
consideration of s. 244 , it dealt only with para. (a), apparently
considering that contact was necessary to complete a sexual assault. I would
dispose of this argument by simply referring to the specific words of s. 244(2) 
which make the section applicable to sexual assaults. In my view,
however sexual assault may be defined, its definition cannot be limited to the
provisions of s. 244(1) (a).

 

5.                Since
judgment was given in this case in the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, other
appellate courts have dealt with the problem. As far as I am able to determine,
none has followed the approach of the Court of Appeal in this case. In R. v.
Alderton (1985), 49 O.R. (2d) 257, the matter was presented to the Ontario
Court of Appeal. In that case, the accused gained entry to an apartment
building at night, wearing a face mask. He entered the apartment of the
complainant who was alone and asleep in her bedroom. He seized her and forced
her back upon the pillows but after a struggle she managed to escape. The Court
of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a conviction of sexual assault made at
trial. Martin J.A., speaking for a unanimous court (Martin, Lacourcière and Finlayson
JJ.A.), said at p. 263:

 

                   We are, with the greatest deference,
unable to accept the views of the court expressed in that case [Chase].
Without in any way attempting to give a comprehensive definition of a
""sexual assault"" we are all satisfied that it includes an
assault with the intention of having sexual intercourse with the victim without
her consent, or an assault made upon a victim for the purpose of sexual
gratification.

 

                   We are all of the view that in the
circumstances of the present case, there was ample evidence upon which the jury
could find that the appellant committed a sexual assault upon the complainant
and, indeed, we think the evidence did not permit of any other conclusion.

 

As he
said, in these words, Martin J.A. was not attempting a comprehensive definition
of sexual assault, nor was he saying that the concept of sexual assault was
limited to an assault with the intention of having sexual intercourse or for
the purposes of sexual gratification. His view was that, where these elements
were present, it would be sufficient to categorize the assault as sexual. They
do not constitute the sole basis for a finding of sexual assault, nor may this
reference to them be taken as a finding that a specific intent is required for
the completion of the offence.

 

6.                In
R. v. Taylor (1985), 44 C.R. (3d) 263, the matter was considered in the
Alberta Court of Appeal. The accused, in seeking to discipline a teenage girl
placed in his care, tied the girl's wrists to an overhead metal support and
made her stand naked for periods of ten to fifteen minutes and, on one
occasion, administered several blows with a wooden paddle on the buttocks.
There were no other acts which could have been described as sexual in nature.
The accused was acquitted at trial. The Crown's appeal was allowed and a new
trial was ordered. Laycraft C.J.A., for a unanimous court (Laycraft C.J.A.,
Haddad and Belzil JJ.A.), said, at p. 268:

 

                   The new provisions do not define
""sexual assault"". However, ""assault"" is defined and thus
the new offences are an assault with some additional meaning required by the
modifier ""sexual"". In the offences which were replaced this was also
true of ""indecent assault"", a term which gave no difficulty in
judicial interpretation. For decades, juries were charged that indecent assault
was an assault in circumstances of indecency (R. v. Louie Chong (1914),
32 O.L.R. 66, 23 C.C.C. 250 (C.A.); R. v. Quinton, [1947] S.C.R. 234, 3
C.R. 6, 88 C.C.C. 231). Though this approach was susceptible to the comment
that it was simply an assertion that an assault is indecent if it is indecent,
it was nevertheless an approach perfectly understandable by generations of
juries, and eminently practicable in the administration of the criminal law.

 

He then
went on to discuss various authorities and rejected the Chase approach
with its reliance on the specific involvement of areas of the body and the
dictionary definitions of the term ""sexual"". He noted that all the
decisions he discussed rejected the Chase approach and he spoke
approvingly of the position of Martin J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal in Alderton,
supra, saying, at p. 269:

 

                   Without joining a battle of
dictionaries, it is my view that these words were intended to comprehend a wide
range of forcible acts within the definition of ""assault"" to which,
in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, there is a carnal aspect.
""Sexual assault"" is therefore an act of force in circumstances of
sexuality as that can be seen in the circumstances. Like Martin J.A. I would
not attempt a comprehensive definition of ""sexual assault"". The term
includes, however, an act which is intended to degrade or demean another person
for sexual gratification. Nothing in the new sections of the Code in my view restricts
the carnal or sexual aspect only to acts of force involving the sexual organs
and I respectfully disagree with the restricted meaning expressed in R. v.
Chase, supra.

 

It was
his view that the carnal aspect was to be judged objectively: ""Viewed in
the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the
assault visible to a reasonable observer?""

 

7.                In
the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the matter was considered in R. v.
Cook (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 18. In this case, on facts which clearly
revealed conduct which would qualify as sexual assaults, the Chase
approach was again rejected. Lambert J.A. did not attempt to give a precise
definition of sexual assault where Parliament had declined to do so, but he did
consider that the characteristic which made a simple assault into a sexual
assault was not solely a matter of anatomy. He considered that a real affront
to sexual integrity and sexual dignity may be sufficient.

 

8.                It
will be seen from this brief review of the cases that the approach taken by the
New Brunswick Court of Appeal in the case at bar has found little, if any,
support. All the cases cited have recognized the need for a broader approach
and all have recognized the difficulty in formulating one. While I would agree
that it is difficult and probably unwise to attempt to develop a precise and
all‑inclusive definition of the new offence of sexual assault at this
stage in its development, it seems to me to be necessary to attempt to settle
upon certain considerations which may be of assistance to the courts in
developing on a case‑to‑case basis a workable definition of the
offence.

 

9.                To
begin with, I agree, as I have indicated, that the test for the recognition of
sexual assault does not depend solely on contact with specific areas of the
human anatomy. I am also of the view that sexual assault need not involve an
attack by a member of one sex upon a member of the other; it could be perpetrated
upon one of the same sex. I agree as well with those who say that the new
offence is truly new and does not merely duplicate the offences it replaces.
Accordingly, the definition of the term ""sexual assault"" and the
reach of the offence it describes is not necessarily limited to the scope of
its predecessors. I would consider as well that the test for its recognition
should be objective.

 

10.              While
it is clear that the concept of a sexual assault differs from that of the former
indecent assault, it is nevertheless equally clear that the terms overlap in
many respects and sexual assault in many cases will involve the same sort of
conduct that formerly would have justified a conviction for an indecent
assault. The definitional approach to indecent assault, also an offence not
defined in the Criminal Code , therefore offers a guide in our approach
to the new offence, as recognized by Laycraft C.J.A. After many years of
dealing with the concept of indecent assault, the courts developed the
definition, ""an assault in circumstances of indecency"". This, of
course, was an imprecise definition but everyone knew what an indecent assault
was. The law in that respect was reasonably clear and there was little
difficulty with its enforcement. In my view then, a similar approach may be
adopted in formulating a definition of sexual assault.

 

11.              Applying
these principles and the authorities cited, I would make the following
observations. Sexual assault is an assault within any one of the definitions of
that concept in s. 244(1)  of the Criminal Code  which is committed in
circumstances of a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim
is violated. The test to be applied in determining whether the impugned conduct
has the requisite sexual nature is an objective one: ""Viewed in the light
of all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the assault
visible to a reasonable observer"" (Taylor, supra, per
Laycraft C.J.A., at p. 269). The part of the body touched, the nature of the
contact, the situation in which it occurred, the words and gestures
accompanying the act, and all other circumstances surrounding the conduct,
including threats which may or may not be accompanied by force, will be
relevant (see S. J. Usprich, ""A New Crime in Old Battles: Definitional
Problems with Sexual Assault"" (1987), 29 Crim. L.Q. 200, at p.
204.) The intent or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent
that this may appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in considering
whether the conduct is sexual. If the motive of the accused is sexual
gratification, to the extent that this may appear from the evidence, it may be
a factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual. It must be emphasized,
however, that the existence of such a motive is simply one of many factors to
be considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the
circumstances.

 

12.              Implicit
in this view of sexual assault is the notion that the offence is one requiring
a general intent only. This is consistent with the approach adopted by this
Court in cases such as Leary v. The Queen, [1978] l S.C.R. 29, and Swietlinski
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956, where it was held that rape and indecent
assault were offences of general intent. I am unable to see any reason why the
same approach should not be taken with respect to sexual assault. The factors
which could motivate sexual assault are said to be many and varied (see C.
Boyle, Sexual Assault (1984), at p. 74). To put upon the Crown the
burden of proving a specific intent would go a long way toward defeating the
obvious purpose of the enactment. Moreover, there are strong reasons in social
policy which would support this view. To import an added element of specific
intent in such offences, would be to hamper unreasonably the enforcement
process. It would open the question of the defence of drunkenness, one which
has always been related to the capacity to form a specific intent and which has
generally been excluded by law and policy from offences requiring only the
minimal intent to apply force (see R. v. Bernard (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d)
574 (Ont. C.A., per Dubin J.A.)) For these reasons, I would say that the
offence will be one of general rather than specific intent.

 

13.              Turning
to the case at bar I have no difficulty in concluding, on the basis of the
principles I have discussed above, that there was ample evidence before the
trial judge upon which he could find that sexual assault was committed. Viewed
objectively in the light of all the circumstances, it is clear that the conduct
of the respondent in grabbing the complainant's breasts constituted an assault
of a sexual nature. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the
conviction of common assault recorded by the Court of Appeal and restore the
conviction of sexual assault made at trial. The sentence of six months should
stand.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

                   Evidence
‑‑ Polygraph evidence ‑‑ Exclusionary rules ‑‑
Accused denying participation in conspiracy to commit robbery ‑‑
Motion by accused to take a polygraph examination and submit results in
evidence refused ‑‑ Whether such evidence admissible.

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Powers of the Court of Appeal ‑‑ Court of Appeal
ordering the reopening of the trial ‑‑ Whether the Court of Appeal
had jurisdiction to make such an order under s. 613(2) of the Criminal Code.

 

                   The
respondents were charged with conspiracy to commit a robbery. At trial, one of
their accomplices gave evidence for the Crown which directly implicated the
respondents. In their testimony, the respondents asserted that the evidence of
the Crown's witness was false and denied any participation in the alleged
conspiracy. After completion of the evidence at trial, the respondents made an
application to reopen their defence in order to permit each of them to take a
polygraph examination and submit the results in evidence. The trial judge
denied the motion, holding that the results of such an examination were
inadmissible, and respondents were convicted. A majority of the Court of Appeal
allowed their appeal from conviction, granted an order reopening the trial and
directing that the results of the polygraph examination be submitted to the
trial judge for a ruling as to their admissibility. This appeal is to determine
whether evidence of the results of a polygraph examination is admissible in
light of the particular facts of this case.

 

                   Held (Lamer
and Wilson JJ. dissenting on the merits): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre and Le Dain JJ.: The results of a polygraph
examination are not admissible as evidence. The polygraph has no place in the
judicial process where it is employed as a tool to determine or to test the
credibility of witnesses. The admission of such evidence would offend well established
rules of evidence, in particular, the rule against oath‑helping, which
prohibits a party from presenting evidence solely for the purpose of bolstering
a witness' credibility, the rule against the admission of past or out‑of‑court
statements by a witness and the character evidence rule. The polygraph evidence
is also inadmis‑ sible as expert evidence. The issue of credibility is an
issue well within the experience of judges and juries and one in which no
expert evidence is required.

 

                   Further,
the admission of polygraph evidence will serve no purpose which is not already
served. Such admission will disrupt proceedings, will open the trial process to
the time‑consuming and confusing consideration of collateral issues and
will deflect the focus of the proceedings from the fundamental issue of guilt
or innocence. It will also lead to numerous complications which will result in
no greater degree of certainty in the process than that which already exists.
The results recorded by the polygraph instrument, their nature and significance
will reach the trier of fact through the mouth of the operator. Human
fallibility will thus still be present, but now fortified with the mystique of
science.

 

                   Per La
Forest J.: There are two compelling factors for the exclusion of polygraph
evidence in judiciary proceedings: human fallibility in assessing the proper
weight to be given to the evidence cloaked under the mystique of science, and
the inadvisability of expending time on collateral issues.

 

                   Per Lamer
and Wilson JJ. (dissenting on the merits): Polygraph evidence goes directly to
the issue of an accused's credibility and should have been admitted in this
case. The Crown attacked the respondents' credibility by alleging that they
were lying under oath while the informer was telling the truth. The central
issue was whom to believe: the informer or the respondents. There was no other
evidence implicating the respondents in the alleged conspiracy. It would be
unjust, in these circumstances, to prevent the respondents from calling any
evidence of probative value indicating that they were telling the truth. This
was their defence to the charge and they should have been allowed to make it
under s. 577(3) of the Code.

 

                   The
rule that the Crown will not be allowed to adduce evidence solely to bolster
the credibility of its witnesses should not be extended to an accused where the
Crown's whole case is based on the accused's lack of credibility.

 

                   The
polygraph evidence was clearly relevant and did not fall within any of the
other exclusionary rules advanced by the Crown. The case of Phillion v. The
Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 18, was clearly distinguishable.

 

                   The
appeal should be allowed, however, and a new trial ordered. The Court of Appeal
had no jurisdiction under s. 613(2)  of the Criminal Code  to order that
the original trial be reopened.

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal, [1984] C.A. 443, 15 D.L.R. (4th)
89, 16 C.C.C. (3d) 462, 40 C.R. (3d) 193, allowing the appeal of the accused
from their conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery contrary to s. 423  of
the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed, Lamer and Wilson JJ. dissenting on
the merits.

 

                   Jean‑François
Dionne and François Landry, for the appellant.

 

                   Vincent
Rose and Joseph Elfassy, for the respondent Béland. 

 

                   The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre J.‑‑This
appeal involves the question of the admissibility in evidence in a criminal
trial of the results of a polygraph examination of an accused person.

 

2.                The
respondents, Béland and Phillips, were charged with conspiracy to commit a
robbery. The Crown led evidence to the effect that the respondents had
conspired with one Grenier and one Filippone to rob an armoured truck. No
robbery took place because Grenier disclosed the conspiracy to the police. He
later gave evidence for the Crown and his testimony was the only evidence which
directly implicated the respondents in the conspiracy. The respondents gave evidence
on their own behalf, denying any participation in the conspiracy and saying
that the evidence of Grenier was false. Each respondent during his testimony
said that he was prepared to undergo a polygraph examination. After completion
of the evidence at trial the respondents made an application to the trial judge
to reopen their defence, in order to permit each of them to take a polygraph
examination and submit the results in evidence. This motion was refused by the
trial judge who held that the results of such an examination were inadmissible
in evidence, in accordance with Phillion v. The Queen, [1978] l S.C.R.
18. The respondents were convicted. An appeal to the Court of Appeal by the
respondents succeeded. By a majority, the Court of Appeal granted an order
reopening the trial and directing that the results of the polygraph examination
be submitted to the trial judge, for a ruling as to their admissibility in
light of all the circumstances revealed in the evidence: [1984] C.A. 443, 15
D.L.R. (4th) 89, 16 C.C.C. (3d) 462, 40 C.R. (3d) 193. The Crown appeals to
this Court as of right under s. 621(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .
The parties agree that the sole issue in this appeal is whether evidence of the
results of a polygraph examination is admissible in light of the particular
facts of this case.

 

3.                In
the Court of Appeal (Bisson, Jacques and Malouf JJ.A.) the majority (Bisson and
Jacques JJ.A.) distinguished the case at bar from Phillion v. The Queen,
supra, on the basis that here the parties had each given evidence and their
credibility was clearly in issue, whereas Phillion on his trial had not
testified and any question as to his credibility did not arise. They were also
of the view that the trial judge, in considering the possible inaccuracies of
the polygraph and the uncertainty which could arise from its use, had confused
the issue of admissibility with that of weight.

 

4.                Malouf
J.A., in dissent, relied on R. v. Kyselka (1962), 133 C.C.C. 103 (Ont.
C.A.), in expressing the view that the evidence of the polygraph test was
inadmissible. He based his dissent on the proposition that a person may not
call witnesses to testify to the veracity of his own witnesses. He was, in
effect, relying on the rule against oath‑helping.

 

5.                The
leading case in this Court concerning the admissibility of polygraph evidence
is Phillion v. The Queen, supra, in which it was held that such evidence
should be rejected. Speaking for the majority, Ritchie J. expressed the view
that such evidence offended the hearsay rule. He said, at p. 24:

 

                   Statements made to psychiatrists and
psychologists are sometimes admitted in criminal cases and when this is so it
is because they have qualified as experts in diagnosing the behavioural
symptoms of individuals and have formed an opinion which the trial judge deems
to be relevant to the case, but the statements on which such opinions are based
are not admissible in proof of their truth but rather as indicating the basis
upon which the medical opinion was formed in accordance with recognized
professional procedures.

 

                   Entirely different considerations,
however, apply to the evidence of Mr. Reid who was neither a psychiatrist nor a
psychologist and does not appear to have had any other medical training. The
evidence indicates that he only saw the accused on the occasion when he
administered the polygraph test which was the day before he gave his evidence.

 

He
continued, at p. 25:

 

                   In my view, Mr. Reid had neither the
qualifications nor the opportunity to form a mature opinion of the propensity
of the man he was subjecting to the test either as to truthfulness or
otherwise. His opinion, however, was not based on the statements made by the
appellant, but on his own expertise in interpreting the recordings of the
machine. If the statements had been made to Mr. Reid alone, there is in my
opinion no doubt that they would have been inadmissible as self‑serving,
second hand evidence tendered in proof of its truth on behalf of an accused who
did not see fit to testify and I am not prepared to hold on the evidence of
this case that the presence of the polygraph machine or the expertise of its
operator made them admissible. The admission of such evidence would mean that
any accused person who had made a confession could elect not to deny its truth
under oath and substitute for his own evidence the results produced by a
mechanical device in the hands of a skilled operator relying exclusively on its
efficacy as a test of veracity.

 

Spence
J., with whom Laskin C.J. concurred, wrote separate reasons in which he agreed
that the evidence should be rejected, but he left open the question of whether
in other circumstances the polygraph evidence might be admissible.

 

6.                It
was the suggestion of the possibility of a different result in other
circumstances which was relied upon by the majority of the Court of Appeal to
distinguish the Phillion case. As has been noted, Phillion did not give
evidence himself but sought to rely on the evidence of the polygraph operator
to place his story before the jury and lend it credibility. In the case at bar
the two respondents each gave evidence at trial and now seek to invoke that of
the polygraph operator to support their credibility.

 

General
Rule Against Oath‑helping

 

7.                The
Crown appellant argues that the admission of polygraph evidence offends the
rule which prohibits a party from presenting evidence which has, as its sole
purpose, the bolstering of the credibility of that party's own witnesses. This
is sometimes referred to in the earlier cases as oath‑helping. There does
not appear to be any decision of this Court which has dealt specifically with
the rule, but there is other substantial authority supporting it. The leading
decision on this point in Canada is R. v. Kyselka, supra. In that
case, the three accused were charged with the rape of a mentally retarded 16‑year‑old
girl. The trial judge permitted the Crown to call a psychiatrist, who gave
evidence that because of her low mental age the complainant lacked sufficient
imagination to concoct a story. It was therefore likely that she would tell the
truth in court. The accused were convicted. On appeal, Porter C.J.O., speaking
for the court (Porter C.J.O., Kelly and McLennan JJ.A.), held that the evidence
of the psychiatrist should not have been admitted as its sole purpose was to
suggest that the complainant, because of her mental classification, was likely
to be a truthful witness. He said, at pp. 107‑8:

 

                   While the credit of any witness may
be impeached by the opposite party, R. v. Gunewardene, [1951] 2
All E.R. 290 at p. 294, there is no warrant or authority for such oath‑helping
as occurred in the circumstances of this case, reminiscent as it is of the
method before the Norman Conquest by which a defendant in a civil suit or an
accused person proved his case by calling witnesses to swear that the oath of
the party was true. If this sort of evidence were admissible in the case of
either party no limit could be placed on the number of witnesses who could be
called to testify about the credibility of witnesses as to facts. It would tend
to produce, regardless of the number of such character witnesses who were
called, undue confusion in the minds of the jury by directing their attention
away from the real issues and the controversy would become so intricate that
truth would be more likely to remain hidden than be discovered. For these
reasons this evidence was not admissible.

 

In R.
v. Burkart; R. v. Sawatsky, [1965] 3 C.C.C. 210, the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal, per Culliton C.J.S., on virtually the same facts followed Kyselka
in rejecting similar evidence. The rule has, as well, been supported in other
decisions, such as R. v. Clarke (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (Alta. C.A.),
a case in which both Kyselka and Burkart were cited and followed.
In Clarke, a murder case which was based largely on circumstantial
evidence, the Crown called as a witness a fellow prison inmate of the accused,
who gave evidence of an inculpatory statement made by the accused to the
witness in prison. In introducing the witness, Crown counsel asked a series of
questions which firstly revealed a lengthy criminal record and then dealt with
the witness's conversion or rehabilitation. This involved testimony by the
witness to the effect that he was now attending bible classes, that he was in
regular attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous classes, that he had made
restitution for certain offences in respect of which he had not actually been
prosecuted, that he had changed his attitude to the police and society,
generally, and that he had come to realize that his social problems were of his
own making, and that he now despised and rejected violence. The impropriety of
this evidence was attacked on appeal from conviction. McClung J.A., writing for
the court (Clement, McClung JJ.A. and Crossley J. (ad hoc)), held that,
while counsel must be permitted to present witnesses in the best allowable
light, the examination carried out in that case exceeded the permitted limit
because its overriding and dominant objective was the bolstering of the
witness's character and, therefore, his credibility. He supported his view by
reference to Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn rev., 1972), vol. 4, at pp.
233‑34:

 

                   §1104(A) Proving good character in
support; in general, inadmissible until impeached. Good character for
veracity is as relevant to indicate the probability of truth‑telling as
bad character for veracity is to indicate the probability of the contrary. But
there is no reason why time should be spent in proving that which may be
assumed to exist. Every witness may be assumed to be of normal moral character
for veracity, just as he is assumed to be of normal sanity. Good character,
therefore, in his support is excluded until his character is brought in
question and it thus becomes worthwhile to deny that his character is bad.

 

He
referred as well to the words of Lacourcière J.A., speaking for the Ontario
Court of Appeal, in R. v. Martin (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 425‑‑a
case where evidence was admitted that a Crown witness had earlier been tried and
acquitted of the murder with which the accused was charged‑‑who
said, at p. 433:

 

It is difficult, however, to justify the introduction of
this evidence during examination‑in‑chief. It was wrong if it was
an attempt to bolster and support the credibility of the prosecution's own
witness which was not yet under attack notwithstanding the obvious direction of
the defence theory.

 

A
similar view has been expressed in England where Lawton L.J. in R. v. Turner,
[1975] 1 All E.R. 70, speaking for the Court of Appeal, referred, at p. 75, to
the rule ""relating to the calling of evidence on the issue of credibility,
ie that in general evidence can be called to impugn the credibility of
witnesses but not led in chief to bolster it up"".

 

8.                Writers
on evidence have frequently commented on the rule. McWilliams in Canadian
Criminal Evidence (2nd ed. 1984), says, at p. 1078:

 

                   Evidence may not be given as to
witnesses generally to bolster their credit, though evidence of bad character
may be given to impeach their credit, in which case evidence of good character
may be given in rebuttal on that issue. Evidence of good character of witnesses
other than the accused may not be given to prove that they were not likely to
commit the offence for the obvious reason that it would be irrelevant.

 

Similarly,
Schiff in Evidence in the Litigation Process (2nd ed. 1983), vol. 1,
states, at p. 585:

 

                   As a general principle, before the
opponent has attacked the credibility of a witness, the party‑litigant
who called him may not support his credibility.

 

Schiff,
as well, adopts Wigmore's view that until credibility is attacked the witness
is presumed to be credible. In England, Sir Rupert Cross has dealt with the
subject in the fifth edition of his work on Evidence (1979), at pp. 269‑72.
He points out, at p. 271, that there is Commonwealth authority for an accused
to adduce psychiatric evidence of a mental condition which would render
doubtful the truth of a confession, but he goes on to say, at pp. 271‑72:

 

The requirement that the evidence should be about an
aberrant mental condition by an expert in such matters and not merely about
registrations on a machine by a witness capable of handling it is illustrated
by the preponderance of judicial reaction to evidence of the performance of a
polygraph. The fear that the admissibility of such evidence to cast doubt on
the veracity of a confession could lead to trial by machine rather than trial
by jury lay at the root of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. Phillion to exclude it. Of course a time may come when polygraphs are
considered infallible, but, in that event, the law of evidence, like much else,
would differ greatly from what it is at present.

 

                   As yet there does not appear to have
been a case in which evidence has been admitted for the sole purpose of
supporting the credibility of a witness called or to be called by the party
adducing it, nor does there appear to have been a case in which evidence has
been adduced for the purpose of rebutting the testimony of a witness called to
impugn the credibility of a witness on the opposite side. So far as the first
possibility is concerned it is to be hoped that it will be avoided on the
ground that witnesses are presumed to be credible.

 

And see
Phipson on Evidence (13th ed. 1982), para. 13‑63.

 

9.                From
the foregoing comments, it will be seen that the rule against oath‑helping,
that is, adducing evidence solely for the purpose of bolstering a witness's
credibility, is well grounded in authority. It is apparent that since the
evidence of the polygraph examination has no other purpose, its admission would
offend the well‑established rule.

 

Rule
Against Past Consistent Statements

 

10.              The
rule against oath‑helping is also consistent in principle with other
rules of evidence which in some degree may be said to overlap it and which are
based on similar principles. An example is the rule against the admission of
previous consistent statements of a witness. McWilliams, supra,
discusses this rule, at p. 353, and refers to the frequently quoted words of
Neville J. in Jones v. South‑Eastern and Chatham Railway (1917),
87 L.J.K.B. 775 (C.A.), at p. 779, that:

 

... statements may be used against a witness as
admissions, but ... you are not entitled to give evidence of statements on
other occasions by the witness in confirmation of her testimony.

 

This was
said in the context of a case where an injury was alleged to have been suffered
by the plaintiff while at her work, and it was sought to adduce evidence of a
statement she had made after the accident to a third party. McWilliams also
cites R. v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.), where Martin
J.A., speaking for the court (Arnup, Martin and Lacourcière JJ.A.), said, at p.
18:

 

                   The refusal of the trial Judge to
admit the evidence of other witnesses, whether in cross‑examination or
otherwise, of previous statements made by the appellant, involves two separate
rules of evidence:

 

I.                 The rule which precludes an
accused from                                      eliciting from witnesses self‑serving
            statements which he has previously made.

 

II.  The rule which provides that a witness,                                                        whether
a party or not, may not repeat his             own previous statements
concerning the                       matter before the Court, made to other       persons
out of Court, and may not call                                other persons to
testify to those                  statements.

 

                   Statements made by an accused which
infringe rule I are excluded as hearsay. The narration by a witness of earlier
statements made to other persons out of Court appears to be excluded under rule
II, because of the general lack of probative value of such evidence, save in
certain circumstances, in support of the credibility of the witness.

 

Wigmore,
supra, at p. 255, para. 1124, describes the rule in these terms:

 

When the witness has merely testified on direct
examination, without any impeachment, proof of consistent statements is unnecessary
and valueless. The witness is not helped by it; for, even if it is an
improbable or untrustworthy story, it is not made more probable or more
trustworthy by any number of repetitions of it. Such evidence would ordinarily
be cumbersome to the trial and is ordinarily rejected.

 

While
Martin J.A. in Campbell, and Wigmore, suggest that the statements are
excluded on the basis of hearsay and lack of probative value, another rationale
for the rule has been noted, namely, that such statements could be too readily
manufactured for use in later proceedings. In R. v. Hardy (1794), 24 St.
Tr. 199, Eyre C.J. said, at pp. 1093‑94:

 

...the presumption ... is that no man would declare
anything against himself, unless it were true; but that every man, if he was in
a difficulty, or in the view to any difficulty, would make declarations for
himself.

 

11.              The
rule is generally expressed in relation to past consistent statements. In the
case at bar, evidence would be given of statements made subsequent to the
evidence given by the respondents at trial. In my view, however, this leads to
no difference in principle. The concern is with consistent statements made out
of court. The fact that they may be made after evidence has been given at trial
would not change their probative value or reliability. In my view, the rule
against admission of consistent out‑of‑court statements is soundly
based and particularly apposite to questions raised in connection with the use
of the polygraph. Polygraph evidence when tendered would be entirely self‑serving
and would shed no light on the real issues before the court. Assuming, as in
the case at bar, that the evidence sought to be adduced would not fall within
any of the well recognized exceptions to the operation of the rule‑‑where
it is permitted to rebut the allegation of a recent fabrication or to show
physical, mental or emotional condition‑‑it should be rejected. To
do otherwise is to open the trial process to the time‑consuming and
confusing consideration of collateral issues and to deflect the focus of the
proceedings from their fundamental issue of guilt or innocence. This view is
summarized by D. W. Elliott in ""Lie‑Detector Evidence: Lessons from
the American Experience"" in Well and Truly Tried (1982), at pp. 129‑30:

 

                   A defendant who attempts to put in
the results of a test showing this truthfulness on the matters in issue is
bound to fall foul of the rule against self‑serving statements or, as it
is sometimes called, the rule that a party cannot manufacture evidence for
himself, and the falling foul will not be in any mere technical sense. The rule
is sometimes applied in a mechanical unintelligent way to exclude evidence
about which no realistic objection could be raised, as the leading case, Gillie
v. Posho shows; but striking down defence polygraph evidence on this ground
would be no mere technical reflex action of legal obscurantists. The policy
behind the doctrine is a fundamental one, and defence polygraph evidence
usually offends it fundamentally. As some judges have pointed out, only those
defendants who successfully take examinations are likely to want the results
admitted. There is no compulsion to put in the first test results obtained. A
defendant can take the test many times, if necessary ""examiner‑shopping"",
until he gets a result which suits him. Even stipulated tests are not free of
this taint, because of course his lawyers will advise him to have several
secret trial runs before the prosecution is approached. If nothing else, the
dry runs will habituate him to the process and to the expected relevant
questions.

 

12.              It
is therefore my opinion that evidence of the results of a polygraph examination
would clearly offend the rule against the admission of past or out‑of‑court
statements by a witness. All of the considerations upon which the rule is based
are as applicable to polygraph evidence as to other statements. The repetition
of statements by another witness adds nothing to their weight and reliability.
The ultimate decision as to the truth or falsity of the evidence of a witness
must rest upon the exercise of the judgment of the trier of fact. This is as
true of evidence of polygraph tests as of any other evidence. In the last
analysis, the trier of fact must reach its conclusion on the basis of the
evidence given by a human being in court. The evidence of the polygraph
operator if heard by the trier of fact adds nothing to the earlier statement of
the witness which is sought to be supported.

 

Rule
Relating to Character Evidence

 

13.              A
further rule which is related to the rule against oath‑helping, and consistent
with it in general application, is that concerning the use of character
evidence. McWilliams, supra, at p. 275, expresses the rule as it relates
to the Crown's position in these terms:

 

                   It is a fundamental principle of the
English common law that the prosecution is not allowed to prove that an accused
had committed the offence with which he is charged by evidence that he is a
person of bad character and one who is in the habit of committing crimes. Proof
of guilt of the accused is limited to the transaction which forms the charge
upon which he is being tried.

 

This
proposition is subject, however, to the qualification that where an accused
person puts his good character in issue in the case the Crown may then bring
evidence of bad character. There has been controversy as to how an accused
could put his character into issue. According to the early view, in giving
character evidence he was limited to evidence of general reputation, rather
than of specific incidents of good conduct. This position was somewhat at odds
with the view expressed by Duff C.J. in R. v. Barbour, [1938] S.C.R.
465, where he said, at p. 469:

 

Of course, a much wider latitude is allowed the accused,
who may adduce any evidence, of good character for example, tending to show,
not only that it was not likely that he committed the crime charged but that he
was not the kind of person likely to do so.

 

More
recent decisions have developed a compromise between the two extremes expressed
above. Brooke J.A. in R. v. Close (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 105 (Ont.
C.A.), at p. 113, observed that ""It is difficult to see how an accused
could give evidence of his own reputation"" and the courts have thus
accorded a wider scope to an accused. In R. v. McFadden (1981), 65
C.C.C. (2d) 9 (B.C.C.A.), Craig J.A. said, at p. 13:

 

                   The purpose of evidence of good
character is to show the accused is a person who is not likely to have
committed the act with which he is charged and, also, to enhance his
credibility. An accused may adduce evidence of good character (1) by calling
witnesses; (2) by cross‑examining Crown witnesses on the subject; (3) by
giving testimony. Normally, he may lead evidence of good character by adducing
evidence only of his general reputation, not by adducing evidence of specific
acts which might tend to establish his character. The Crown may call evidence
of bad character in rebuttal, but such evidence, also, must relate only to
general reputation: R. v. Rowton (1865), Le. & Ca. 520, 169 E.R.
1497. An accused may put his character in issue in the course of giving his
testimony, not by giving evidence of his general reputation, but by making
assertions which tend to show that he is a person of good character,
particularly with regard to the aspect of his character which is in issue.

 

See, as
well, R. v. McNamara (No. 1) (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), at
p. 348:

 

                   Mr. Robinette also argued that
character means general reputation and that the accused can only put his
character in issue by adducing evidence of general reputation. With respect, we
do not agree. The common law rule was that evidence of good character could
only be given by evidence of reputation, and could only be rebutted by evidence
of reputation and not by specific acts of bad conduct: R. v. Rowton
(1865), Le & Ca. 520, 169 E.R. 1497. That rule was, however, established at
a time when the accused could not himself give evidence. A long series of cases
in England (two of which were cited with approval in Morris v. The Queen,
supra) have held that an accused may put his character in issue by
testifying as to his good character. The word ""character"" in the Criminal
Evidence Act, 1898 has uniformly been held to mean not only reputation, but
actual moral disposition: Cross on Evidence, 4th ed. (1974), p. 426; Phipson
on Evidence, 12th ed. (1976), p. 218. It is true that when the accused
wishes to adduce extrinsic evidence of good character by calling witnesses,
such evidence is confined to evidence of general reputation, but that has no
application where the accused himself gives the evidence.

 

The
position is summarized by McWilliams, supra, at p. 282, in these terms:

 

                   When the defence seeks to put the
character of the accused in issue by cross‑examination of prosecution
witnesses, or by calling defence witnesses other than the accused it is
submitted that the rule should be strictly enforced, that is, it is confined to
evidence of general reputation. However, when the accused himself puts his
character in issue he is not so confined.

 

14.              An
example of the attempted use of character evidence to support the credibility
of a witness has already been cited in R. v. Clarke, supra. What is the
consequence of this rule in relation to polygraph evidence? Where such evidence
is sought to be introduced it is the operator who would be called as the
witness and it is clear, of course, that the purpose of his evidence would be
to bolster the credibility of the accused and, in effect, to show him to be of
good character by inviting the inference that he did not lie during the test.
In other words, it is evidence not of general reputation but of a specific
incident and its admission would be precluded under the rule. It would follow,
then, that the introduction of evidence of the polygraph test would violate the
character evidence rule.

 

Expert
Evidence

 

15.              It
was also argued that the polygraph evidence was receivable as expert evidence.
The polygraph operator, as an expert, was trained and qualified to give his
opinion as to the veracity of the witness, based solely on his interpretation
of the significance of the responses made by the witness to the questions put
on the examination.

 

16.              The
role of the expert witness was defined in this Court in R. v. Abbey,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 24. Speaking for the Court, Dickson J. (as he then was) said,
at p. 42:

 

                   With respect to matters calling for
special knowledge, an expert in the field may draw inferences and state his
opinion. An expert's function is precisely this: to provide the judge and jury
with a ready‑made inference which the judge and jury, due to the
technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate. ""An expert's
opinion is admissible to furnish the Court with scientific information which is
likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury. If on the
proven facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, then
the opinion of the expert is unnecessary"" (Turner (1974), 60 Crim.
App. R. 80, at p. 83, per Lawton L.J.)

 

It was
said in Davie v. Magistrates of Edinburgh, [1953] S.C. 34, at p. 40, by
Lord Cooper:

 

Their duty is to furnish the Judge or jury with the
necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so
as to enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the
application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence.

 

The
function of the expert witness is to provide for the jury or other trier of
fact an expert's opinion as to the significance of, or the inference which may
be drawn from proved facts in a field in which the expert witness possesses
special knowledge and experience going beyond that of the trier of fact. The
expert witness is permitted to give such opinions for the assistance of the
jury. Where the question is one which falls within the knowledge and experience
of the triers of fact, there is no need for expert evidence and an opinion will
not be received.

 

17.              Here,
the sole issue upon which the polygraph evidence is adduced is the credibility
of the accused, an issue well within the experience of judges and juries and
one in which no expert evidence is required. It is a basic tenet of our legal
system that judges and juries are capable of assessing credibility and
reliability of evidence. This question has been the subject of a comment by
Michael Abbell in ""Polygraph Evidence: The Case Against Admissibility in
Federal Criminal Trials"" (1977), 15 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 29, who said,
at p. 55:

 

                   Witness or defendant veracity has
seldom been viewed a technical issue on which `untrained' laymen are
unqualified to reach intelligent determinations after being exposed to all of
the evidence in a case. Indeed, it has been the traditional function of jurors
in our system to apply their own daily experiences to the testimony and the
other evidence presented to them to determine which witnesses are truthful. It
is the jurors' own ""ex‑ pertise"" in conducting their personal
and business affairs which our judicial system has long regarded as making them
specially qualified to make this determination.

 

I adopt
these words, and I am therefore of the view that polygraph evidence aimed at
supporting the credibility of the accused is not receivable as evidence in
Canada.

 

18.              In
conclusion, it is my opinion, based upon a consideration of rules of evidence
long established and applied in our courts, that the polygraph has no place in
the judicial process where it is employed as a tool to determine or to test the
credibility of witnesses. It is frequently argued that the polygraph represents
an application of modern scientific knowledge and experience to the task of
determining the veracity of human utterances. It is said that the courts should
welcome this device and not cling to the imperfect methods of the past in such
an important task. This argument has a superficial appeal but, in my view, it
cannot prevail in the face of the realities of court procedures.

 

19.              I
would say at once that this view is not based on a fear of the inaccuracies of
the polygraph. On that question we were not supplied with sufficient evidence
to reach a conclusion. However, it may be said that even the finding of a
significant percentage of errors in its results would not, by itself, be
sufficient ground to exclude it as an instrument for use in the courts. Error
is inherent in human affairs, scientific or unscientific. It exists within our
established court procedures and must always be guarded against. The compelling
reason, in my view, for the exclusion of the evidence of polygraph results in
judicial proceedings is two‑fold. First, the admission of polygraph
evidence would run counter to the well established rules of evidence which have
been referred to. Second, while there is no reason why the rules of evidence
should not be modified where improvement will result, it is my view that the
admission of polygraph evidence will serve no purpose which is not already
served. It will disrupt proceedings, cause delays, and lead to numerous
complications which will result in no greater degree of certainty in the process
than that which already exists.

 

20.              Since
litigation replaced trial by combat, the determination of fact, including the
veracity of parties and their witnesses, has been the duty of judges or juries
upon an evaluation of the statements of witnesses. This approach has led to the
development of a body of rules relating to the giving and reception of evidence
and we have developed methods which have served well and have gained a wide
measure of approval. They have facilitated the orderly conduct of judicial
proceedings and are designed to keep the focus of the proceedings on the
principal issue, in a criminal case, the guilt or innocence of the accused.
What would be served by the introduction of evidence of polygraph readings into
the judicial process? To begin with, it must be remembered that however
scientific it may be, its use in court depends on the human intervention of the
operator. Whatever results are recorded by the polygraph instrument, their
nature and significance reach the trier of fact through the mouth of the
operator. Human fallibility is therefore present as before, but now it may be
said to be fortified with the mystique of science. Then, it may be asked, what
does it do? It provides evidence on the issue of the credibility of a witness.
This has always been a collateral issue and one to be decided by the trier of
fact. Is the trier of fact assisted by hearing, firstly from witness
""A"" that he was not present at the scene of the crime, and then from
witness ""B"", a polygraph operator, that ""A"" was probably
truthful? What would the result be, one may ask, if the polygraph operator
concluded from his test that witness ""A"" was lying? Would such
evidence be admissible, could it be excluded by witness ""A"", could it
be introduced by the Crown? These are serious questions and they lead to
others. Would it be open to the opponent of the person relying upon the
polygraph to have a second polygraph examination taken for his purposes?
If the results differed, which would prevail, and what right would there be for
compelling the production of polygraph evidence in the possession of a
reluctant party? It is this fear of turmoil in the courts which leads me to
reject the polygraph. Like Porter C.J.O. in Kyselka, I would not wish to
see a return to the method of pre‑Norman trials where parties relied
heavily upon oath‑helpers who swore to their veracity. For a description
of the role of the oath‑helper in early times, see W. S. Holdsworth, A
History of English Law (7th ed. 1956), vol. 1, at pp. 305‑8, and W.
F. Walsh, Outlines of the History of English and American Law (1926), at
pp. 99‑100 (footnote II). I would seek to preserve the principle that in
the resolution of disputes in litigation, issues of credibility will be decided
by human triers of fact, using their experience of human affairs and basing
judgment upon their assessment of the witness and on consideration of how an
individual's evidence fits into the general picture revealed on a consideration
of the whole of the case.

 

21.              For
the above reasons, and following Phillion, supra, I would allow the
Crown's appeal. I would set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and confirm
the conviction recorded at trial. 

 

                   The
reasons of Lamer and Wilson JJ. were delivered by

 

22.              Wilson J. (dissenting on
the merits)‑‑I have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleague,
Justice McIntyre, on this appeal. He has set out the facts and the history of
the case in the courts below and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them here.

 

23.              My
colleague gives four basic reasons for excluding the polygraph evidence in this
case. They are:

 

(1)               the rule against oath‑helping;

 

(2)               the rule against past consistent                                                                    statements;

 

(3)               the rule relating to character
evidence;                                                        and

 

(4)               the expert evidence rule.

 

I must
respectfully disagree with him that these rules present a basis for excluding
the polygraph evidence and I will comment briefly on each.

 

24.              (1) The
Rule Against Oath‑helping

 

25.              Oath‑helping
or compurgation was, as I understand it, a method used to prove one's case in
pre‑Norman England. The accused in a criminal case or the defendant in a
civil case could prove his innocence by providing a certain number of
compurgators who would swear to the truth of his oath. The compurgators swore a
set oath. If they departed from it in the slightest, the ""oath burst""
and the opposing party won. The practice fell into desuetude in the 13th
Century.

 

26.              The
connection between oath‑helping and the admissibility of polygraph
evidence seems to me to be very tenuous. Oath‑helpers were not required
to have any knowledge material to the innocence or guilt of the accused. They
merely recited a particular oath and their oaths were not subject to rebuttal.
The polygraph operator, on the other hand, has subjected the accused to a
number of tests. He reports on the results of these tests and gives his expert
opinion as to whether the physiological reactions of the accused are similar to
those of someone telling the truth. He is open to cross‑examination on
his technique, his assumptions, his interpretation of the data and the accuracy
of the device. His evidence is only one of the many factors the jury will
consider when assessing the credibility of the accused.

 

27.              In
what sense then can polygraph evidence be said to be similar to the medieval
device by which the accused was guaranteed an acquittal if he could muster a
sufficient number of compurgators? Any suggestion of similarity would, it seems
to me, have to be based on the assumption that, despite the cross‑examination
of the polygraph operator, the calling of other operators to challenge
erroneous statements by the original operator, and the delivery of a proper
charge to the jury, the jury would automatically base its decision on the
polygraph operator's testimony. I think this is an unwarranted assumption. I do
not think we can make it even if my colleague's concern about the heightened
weight that might be given to polygraph evidence because of the ""mystique
of science"" has some validity. For reasons which will be given later I
doubt that this concern is a valid one.

 

28.              My
own view would be that the rule against oath‑helping is a curious point
of legal history that has little bearing on the issue of polygraph admissibility.
Oath‑helping was a method of proving one's case that ante‑dated the
modern concept of trial by evidence. Polygraph evidence, on the other hand,
fits squarely within the modern trial theory whereby witnesses are examined to
ascertain the truth.

 

29.              It
is suggested, however, that oath‑helping is the antecedent of a
""well‑established rule"" against the admissibility of evidence
adduced solely for the purpose of bolstering the credibility of one's own
witness. A number of authorities are cited in support of the proposition that
evidence may not be given in chief to bolster the credit of one's own witnesses
but, if evidence is given to impeach their credit, rebuttal evidence may be
given on that issue. It is noted, however, that the Canadian cases relied on in
support of the rule are all cases in which the Crown was attempting to lead
evidence‑in‑chief to bolster the credibility of a Crown witness. No
Canadian case was cited where an accused was denied permission to do this. I
have some concern, therefore, as to the scope of the ""well‑established
rule"" in Canada. I believe it would require an extension of the rule in
this case to apply it to the respondents. Perhaps it should be applied to Crown
and defence alike but this is not self‑evident. Analogies certainly can
be drawn from other areas of criminal evidence law to support a more permissive
approach to evidence led by an accused. For example, in R. v. Miller (1952),
36 Cr. App. R. 169, an accused was permitted to call evidence against a co‑accused
which would have been inadmissible if called by the Crown. Also, the English
Court of Appeal held in R. v. Wickham (1971), 55 Cr. App. R. 199, that
an accused may comment upon the failure of a co‑accused to testify
although the prosecution could not. The rationale of these cases is summed up
by Lord Morris in Lowery v. The Queen, [1974] A.C. 85 (P.C.), where he
said at p. 102:

 

It is ... one thing to say that such evidence
[commentary upon failure to testify] is excluded when tendered by the Crown in
proof of guilt, but quite another to say that it is excluded when tendered by
the accused in disproof of his own guilt.

 

30.              I
am very mindful of the fact that the respondents in this case took the stand in
order to deny their involvement in the conspiracy and that the only direct
evidence implicating them was that of Grenier, a self‑confessed
conspirator. The Crown, through Grenier, was impugning the credibility of the
respondents by saying that they were lying under oath. It was his word against
theirs. The respondents were, in effect, responding to an attack on their
credibility by the Crown by offering to take a lie detector test. Indeed, the
Crown's whole case was that the respondents were lying and that the informer
Grenier was telling the truth.

 

31.              Section
577(3)  of the Criminal Code  provides that an accused is entitled, after
the close of the prosecution's case, to make full answer and defence. It might
be said that this is precisely what the respondents were attempting to do
through the introduction of the polygraph evidence. Indeed, it has been held
that this section of the Code gives an accused the right to call such
witnesses and evidence as he may consider necessary: see R. v. Cook
(1960), 127 C.C.C. 287 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.)

 

32.              It
was held in R. v. Martin (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 425 (Ont. C.A.), that
the attack on the Crown witness's credibility has to be more explicit than
""the obvious direction of the defence theory"" in order to justify the
leading of credibility evidence. Again, however, in that case it was the Crown
that was seeking to bolster the credibility of its own witness. This Court has
not yet had occasion to discuss whether the rule should be applied against an
accused in a case such as this where the Crown's whole case is based on the
accused's lack of credibility. I do not believe, therefore, that there is a
""well‑established rule"" in Canada operating against the
respondents. Indeed, I note with interest that the passage quoted from Cross's
5th edition (1979) by my colleague was omitted from the 6th edition (1985) and
that there are other authors who do not recognize the existence of such a rule.
In my view, therefore, we would be making law in this area if we were to hold
such a rule applicable in the circumstances of this case. This is not to say
that we should not do so but merely that, if we do so, we should do so
advisedly. I will return to this point later when discussing the majority
decision in Phillion v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 18.

 

33.              (2)   The
Rule Against Past Consistent Statements

 

34.              The
second ground for exclusion of the polygraph evidence is that it infringes the
rule against the admission of past consistent statements. The cases and
authorities make it clear that these statements are excluded because they are
at best irrelevant and at worst fabricated and self‑serving. The
irrelevance rationale has, it seems to me, little applicability to polygraph
evidence. The argument that the mere repetition of a story has no bearing on
the truth of the story is, of course, a convincing one. Polygraph evidence,
however, is not merely evidence that the accused has said the same thing twice.
It is expert evidence on how closely his physiological responses during the
test correspond to those of someone telling the truth. It is, in my opinion,
clearly relevant.

 

35.              Nor
am I persuaded that the evidence should be excluded on the ground that by
""examiner shopping"" and by engaging in practice tests the accused may
be able to increase the likelihood of a ""successful"" test. Unless it
can be established that polygraph tests are per se without probative
value (and I do not think this has been or could be established), it would seem
to me that the possibility of abuse should be a factor going to weight rather
than to admissibility.

 

36.              (3) The
Rule Relating to Character Evidence

 

37.              It
is suggested that the admission of polygraph evidence is precluded by certain
rules relating to character evidence. Specifically, reliance is placed on the
authorities which preclude the accused from leading evidence of specific
incidents in order to establish his good character except through his own
testimony.

 

38.              I
have grave doubts that polygraph evidence is character evidence. McWilliams in Canadian
Criminal Evidence (2nd ed. 1984) distinguishes between character and credit
at p. 279:

 

                   In R. v. Hardy (1794), 24 St.
Tr. 199, the great Erskine said: ""Character goes to the issue, that is the
probability of the accused having committed the offence while credit goes to
the collateral issue, that is the weight to be attached to the testimony of the
accused"". See also R. v. McLean (1940), 73 C.C.C. 310 (N.B.S.C.
App. Div.). An accused puts his credit in issue as does any other witness if he
testifies, but he does not thereby put his character in issue. He puts his
character in issue by calling evidence of good character whether he testifies
or not.

 

I
believe this distinction is sound. As McIntyre J. acknowledges, polygraph evidence
is adduced ""solely for the purpose of bolstering a witness's
credibility"". It is not introduced to show that the accused is not the
sort of person who would commit the offence. It is introduced to provide
evidence that the accused's physiological reactions are consistent with those
of someone who is telling the truth.

 

39.              If,
however, I am wrong in this and the polygraph evidence can be viewed as going
to the accused's character as well as to his credibility, is there a rule
precluding the admission of this evidence? The general rule seems to be that if
the accused puts his character in issue by cross‑examining Crown
witnesses or by calling defence witnesses other than the accused, then evidence
tendered must relate to the general reputation of the accused and not to
specific incidents of good behaviour. If the accused himself testifies he may
give evidence of specific incidents. My colleague infers from these rules that,
since it is the polygraph operator and not the accused himself who is giving
evidence of specific incidents, the evidence must be excluded despite the fact
that the accused testified. This approach seems to me to create a very
artificial distinction: if the accused testifies and puts his character in
issue he may rely on specific incidents of good behaviour provided he relates
these incidents to the court himself. Yet, although an accused who has taken
the stand and put his character in issue is allowed to adduce evidence of
specific incidents to establish good behaviour, he is not allowed to call the
witnesses necessary to give meaning to these incidents. The spirit of the rule,
in my view, militates in favour of admission where the accused has testified.

 

40.              (4) The
Expert Evidence Rule

 

41.              The
point made here is that expert evidence is not necessary when the issue is the
credibility of a witness. This is an issue that juries are specially qualified
to decide. They do not require the assistance of experts in making such a
determination.

 

42.              In
my respectful view, the polygraph operator does not give an opinion on the
credibility of the witness. Rather, she interprets the physiological data and
gives an opinion as to whether the data pattern conforms to that of a person
who is telling the truth. The operator will also testify as to the nature and
accuracy of the device itself. The jury will consider this evidence along with
the other evidence going to the issue of credibility in order to reach their
final conclusion. Thus, the polygraph operator provides an expert opinion on
the interpretation of the polygraph results. This evidence is relevant to, but
not determinative of, the credibility issue.

 

43.              I
question whether the fear that the polygraph operator will usurp the role of
the jury is well‑founded. Juries of today are much more sophisticated
than they were when some of our restrictive rules of evidence were developed.
They are well versed in modern technology, thanks to the influence of the mass
media, and are not today in awe of scientific evidence as they might have been
a hundred or even fifty years ago. I think the decision of the British Columbia
Supreme Court in R. v. Wong (No. 2) (1976), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 511,
illustrates this very well. The jury in that case found the accused guilty even
although the polygraph tests conducted by both the police and the expert called
by the defence indicated that the accused had not killed the victim. Meredith
J. had admitted the polygraph evidence. He disagreed with the Ontario High
Court in R. v. Phillion (1972), 10 C.C.C. (2d) 562, that lie detector
evidence would inevitably dictate the jury's decision. He said at p. 514:

 

                   I do not share Van Camp, J.'s concern
on the evidence led in this case, that the jury ""by reason of the
technicality of the evidence, might be tempted blindly to accept the witness'
opinion"". Here, the evidence is reasonably comprehensible and I believe
the jury will have sufficient information to give proper assessment to its weight.
The evidence certainly does not suggest that the polygraph technique is
infallible; I do not think the jury will treat it as such.

 

44.              He
also disagreed with the Ontario Court of Appeal (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 191 that
the evidence should not be admitted because it went directly to the question of
whether the accused committed the offence. He said at p. 515:

 

                   I am not aware of any convincing
reason to exclude the opinion of the polygrapher because it bears on almost the
very question the jury is called upon to answer, unless the jury may be
inclined to give undue weight to it. Moreover, opinion evidence, I would have
thought, is frequently admitted in our Courts going directly to issues to be
resolved by Judge or jury.

 

Meredith
J. concluded that while polygraph tests are not one hundred per cent accurate,
they do have a high degree of reliability and, indeed, the police themselves
had initiated their use in this particular case.

 

45.              Meredith
J. was, however, reversed on appeal (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 196, following the
decision of this Court in Phillion. McFarlane J.A. stated succinctly at
p. 199:

 

The latter judgment makes it clear that the opinion
evidence about the polygraph tests should not have been admitted.

 

The Rule
Against Bolstering the Credibility of One's Own Witness

 

46.              Because
I do not believe that any of the other rules preclude the admission of
polygraph evidence, I return to the rule against bolstering the credibility of
one's own witness. The existing case law on this subject seems to be divisible
into two categories namely (1) cases in which the evidence was led for the sole
purpose of bolstering the witness's credibility; and (2) cases where evidence
was led that had the effect of indirectly bolstering the witness's credibility.

 

47.              (1)   Sole
Purpose the Bolstering of Credibility

 

48.              Only
three cases, all Canadian, and all involving Crown witnesses, seem to fall into
the first category. R. v. Kyselka (1962), 133 C.C.C. 103 (Ont. C.A.),
and R. v. Burkart; R. v. Sawatsky, [1965] 3 C.C.C. 210 (Sask. C.A.),
were both cases in which the Crown called a psychiatrist who testified that,
because the complainant was of low intelligence, she was unlikely to fabricate
a false story to tell the court. In both cases the evidence was held
inadmissible as evidence going solely to the witness's credibility. R. v.
Clarke (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (Alta. C.A.), followed Kyselka and
Burkart. In that case the Crown called a prison inmate as a witness. The
Crown asked a series of questions about the witness's conversion to a life of
honesty and about his rehabilitation as a lead in to his significant testimony
that an inculpatory statement had been made to him by the accused in prison.
The court held the preliminary questions to be improper as they served only to
bolster the credibility of the witness.

 

49.              (2)
Indirect Bolstering of Credibility

 

50.              In
two English cases and in one Australian case, the accused testified that he did
not commit the crime he was charged with and attempted to introduce psychiatric
or psychological evidence to support his version of what took place. The
evidence went to the accused's state of mind at the time of the crime. It did
not go directly to whether the accused was likely to tell the truth as a
witness. However, if the evidence was believed, it would have supported the
accused's version of what took place. Thus, it would have indirectly bolstered
the accused's credibility.

 

51.              The
first of these cases is Lowery v. The Queen, supra. Here the issue was
whether one accused could call evidence of a psychologist relating to the
respective personalities of the two accuseds. The psychologist's evidence
suggested that the second accused was more likely to have killed the victim
than the first was. Thus the credibility of the first accused was inferentially
bolstered. The Court held the evidence to be admissible. The key to the ruling
was that the evidence was clearly relevant to the issue of which of the two
accused to believe. As the Court puts it at p. 101:

 

                   The case being put forward by counsel
on behalf of King involved posing to the jury the question ""which of these
two men is the more likely to have killed this girl?"" and inviting the
jury to come to the conclusion that it was Lowery. If the crime was one which
was committed apparently without any kind of motive unless it was for the
sensation experienced in the killing then unless both men acted in concert the
deed was that of one of them. It would be unjust to prevent either of them from
calling any evidence of probative value which could point to the probability
that the perpetrator was the one rather than the other.

 

52.              The
subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Turner, [1975] 1 All
E.R. 70, however, treated Lowery as decided on and limited to ""its
special facts"". In Turner the accused had killed his lover. His
defence was provocation. He testified that when the woman told him that she had
slept with other men while he had been in prison, he lost all control. The
accused's counsel sought to call a psychiatrist to testify to the general
disposition of the accused. This evidence would suggest that the accused was generally
quite placid and was driven to a blind rage by the events preceding the
killing. By supporting the accused's version of what happened, the psychiatric
evidence inferentially bolstered the credibility of the accused. The Court of
Appeal held that this evidence must be excluded. The Court's reasoning
parallels that of McIntyre J. in dealing with the expert evidence rule. Lawton
L.J. states at p. 74:

 

Jurors do not need psychiatrists to tell them how
ordinary folk who are not suffering from any mental illness are likely to react
to the stresses and strains of life. It follows that the proposed evidence was
not admissible to establish that the appellant was likely to have been
provoked. The same reasoning applies to its suggested admissibility on the issue
of credibility. The jury had to decide what reliance they could put on the
appellant's evidence. He had to be judged as someone who was not mentally
disordered. This is what juries are empanelled to do. The law assumes they can
perform their duties properly. The jury in this case did not need, and should
not have been offered the evidence of a psychiatrist to help them decide
whether the appellant's evidence was truthful.

 

53.              A
recent Australian case has adopted the Turner approach. In R. v.
Nelson, [1982] Qd. R. 636 (Q. Ct. of Crim. App.), the accused was charged
with and convicted of throwing acid on his wife. The accused testified that he
did not intend to disfigure his wife. He sought to call a doctor to give
evidence that the traumas the accused had suffered made it unlikely that he
would have had the capacity to form the required intent. The Court held that
the evidence was properly excluded. It followed Turner in concluding
that ""to admit the evidence of Dr. Quinn ... would have amounted to an
usurpation of the function of the jury to decide a matter which they were able
to judge for themselves"" (p. 640).

 

54.              In
my view, polygraph evidence goes directly to the issue of the credibility of
the accused. It is evidence of the degree to which his or her physiological
reactions conform to those of a person who is telling the truth. Thus, the
issue of the admissibility of this evidence is more analogous to the first
category of case discussed above rather than to the second category. The second
category of case is concerned with evidence going to the likelihood that the
accused committed the offence and is only inferentially concerned with the
accused's credibility.

 

55.              The
cases on point seem to me, therefore, to support the contention that the Crown
will not be allowed to adduce evidence solely to bolster the credibility of its
witnesses. This rule could arguably be extended to apply to the accused by
analogy to Turner and Nelson. Although these two cases do not
deal with direct evidence as to the credibility of the accused, the
conservative conception of the jury's role embodied in them could be seen to
support the exclusion of polygraph evidence tendered by the accused. The
emphasis in Lowery, on the other hand, in permitting an accused to call
all relevant evidence would argue against drawing such an analogy.

 

56.              With
all due respect to those who think otherwise I would not extend the rule in Kyselka
to the respondents in this case and I take some comfort from Lowery and
from the minority judgment of this Court in Phillion. As in the case of Lowery
the central issue in this case is who to believe. It was the word of the
informer Grenier against the word of the respondents. Because no acts in
implementation of the alleged conspiracy had taken place, there was no other
evidence implicating the respondents in it. I believe that in these
circumstances it would be unjust to prevent the respondents from calling any
evidence of probative value indicating that they were telling the truth. This
was their defence to the charge. I think they should have been allowed to make
it under s. 577(3) of the Code.

 

57.              I
believe that the decision of this Court in Phillion is clearly
distinguishable from the case at bar. Phillion had admitted his guilt and did
not testify at his trial. This was crucial to the majority decision. Ritchie
J., delivering the judgment of the majority, stated at p. 25:

 

The admission of such evidence would mean that any
accused person who had made a confession could elect not to deny its truth
under oath and substitute for his own evidence the results produced by a
mechanical device in the hands of a skilled operator relying exclusively on its
efficacy as a test of veracity.

 

And
later at the same page:

 

                   The elementary right of an accused
not to give evidence is in no way at issue here, but that right having been
exercised, it appears to me to run contrary to the basic rules of evidence to
permit the substitution of the opinion of a polygraph technician for the
evidence which could have been given by the appellant himself.

 

He then
stated at p. 26 that:

 

                   For these reasons alone I am
satisfied that the learned trial judge was correct in excluding the results of
the polygraph test.

 

58.              As
has been pointed out by several commentators on Phillion, each court
which heard the case excluded the polygraph evidence on different grounds. The
trial judge held that, if it was admitted, the jury would place too much weight
on it. The Court of Appeal found that it was opinion evidence going to the very
question before the court and should not be admitted for that reason. And it
seems to be implicit in the majority judgment of this Court that the polygraph
evidence was inadmissible because it was hearsay. In my opinion the
polygrapher's evidence should not be characterized as hearsay. It was not being
admitted for the truth of the statement but merely for the limited purpose of
forming the basis of the expert's opinion. Evidence has frequently been
admitted by this Court for that purpose: see City of Saint John v. Irving
Oil Co., [1966] S.C.R. 581; R. v. Lupien, [1970] S.C.R. 263.

 

59.              While
the minority of the Supreme Court of Canada (Laskin C.J. and Spence J.)
concurred with the majority in Phillion that the polygraph evidence
should not be admitted in the circumstances of that case, it expressly left
open whether such evidence might not be admissible in ""other
circumstances"". I believe that the case at bar raises such ""other
circumstances"".

 

60.              It
is argued, however, by the Crown that polygraph evidence should not be admitted
because it is ""not reliable to an acceptable standard"". This is, of
course, not consistent with the view of the minority of this Court in Phillion
that there may be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to admit it.
It is, in effect, a plea for the acceptance in Canada of the Frye test
initially applied in the United States (see Frye v. United States, 293
F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923)) which has since been considerably eroded by the
courts of that country. The ""general acceptance"" test in Frye has
now given way in the United States to the ""reasonable reliability""
test. Mark McCormick in his article ""Scientific Evidence: Defining a New
Approach to Admissibility"" (1982), 67 Iowa L. Rev. 879, explains
why at p. 904:

 

The courts that have moved away from Frye have
obviously done so because of a perception that the standard is too rigid,
somewhat unclear, and an unnecessary and undesirable barrier to the
admissibility of scientific evidence in some situations. The effect of the
departure from Frye has been a liberalization in the admission of
scientific evidence. A discernible trend toward an expansive admissibility
standard plainly exists.

 

Based on
his analysis of the American cases modifying or rejecting Frye,
McCormick concludes that the traditional test of relevancy and helpfulness
provides a means for retaining the values of Frye without the cost of
its disadvantages.

 

61.              Having
regard to the fact that it is completely open to the opposing party to cross‑examine
the operator as to the weaknesses inherent in the process and to call an
opposing expert to dispute the validity or interpretation of the results, I see
no reason to exclude the evidence of the polygraph. It is, moreover, well
within the purview of the judge to issue a caution to the jury not to give
undue weight to polygraph evidence if he or she considers such a caution
warranted.

 

Conclusion

 

62.              The
polygraph evidence is clearly relevant. I am not persuaded that it falls within
any of the exclusionary rules advanced by the Crown. I believe this case is
clearly distinguishable from Phillion.

 

63.              In
the ordinary course the foregoing reasons would dictate a dismissal of the
Crown's appeal. However, I do not believe that the Quebec Court of Appeal had
jurisdiction under s. 613(2)  of the Criminal Code  to make the order it
did. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and order a new trial. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my colleague, McIntyre J. and
agree with his proposed disposition of this appeal. I prefer, however, to base
my decision solely on the following factors identified by him in the latter
part of his judgment, namely, human fallibility in assessing the proper weight
to be given to evidence cloaked under the mystique of science, and the
inadvisability of expending time on collateral issues.

                   The
accused was convicted of failing to provide a breath sample contrary to s.
235(2)  of the Criminal Code. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown asked
the court to impose a greater punishment because of previous convictions and
established that notice had been given to the accused prior to his plea in
compliance with s. 740 of the Code. The Crown produced a certified
extract of the accused's driving record, pursuant to s. 75 of the British
Columbia Motor Vehicle Act, as proof of the convictions. The certificate
was held admissible by virtue of s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act , and
the accused was sentenced to the minimum term of imprisonment. The accused's
appeals to the County Court and the Court of Appeal were dismissed. This appeal
is to determine (1) whether the certified extract of the accused's driving
record was admissible in evidence as proof of previous convictions, under the
common law, or through the combined effect of s. 37  of the Canada Evidence
Act  and of s. 75 of the British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act; and (2)
whether s. 7  of the Charter  required that sufficient notice be given to
an accused of the Crown's intention to prove the previous convictions by
producing a certificate.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   The
certified extract of the accused's driving record was admissible evidence at
the sentencing hearing to prove previous convictions. Sections 500(4)  and
594(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , which specifically deal with the
proof of previous convictions in proceedings under the Code, do not
indicate that proof of previous convictions may only be made as provided
therein. In the absence of an express provision setting out the exclusive mode
of proof of prior convictions in proceedings under the Criminal Code ,
the common law rule applies either through s. 7(2) of the Code or simply
because Parliament has never replaced it. The certificate was admissible at
common law because, irrespective of the hearsay rule, all credible and
trustworthy evidence is admissible at a sentencing hearing.

 

                   The
certificate, however, was inadmissible pursuant to s. 75 of the British
Columbia Motor Vehicle Act. Section 37  of the Canada Evidence Act 
is restricted to the proof of matters within provincial competence. While it is
true that a driving record is generally a matter within provincial competence,
the particular aspect of the driving record at issue here was prior convictions
under the Criminal Code . This was clearly a matter within federal
jurisdiction and s. 37  did not incorporate provincial legislation on this
subject.

 

                   Finally,
there was no merit in the accused's Charter  argument. The certificate
was admissible at common law and the absence, under the common law rule, of a
requirement that sufficient notice be given when proof is being made by
certificate did not violate the Charter . Although lack of notice could
deprive an accused of an opportunity to verify the accuracy of the certificate
and of cross‑examining the officer who would otherwise have testified to
prove the convictions, such a situation would rarely result in a violation of
an accused's right to a fair trial. In these rare cases, the challenge should
come through s. 24  of the Charter . In this case, there was no attempt to
establish that the lack of notice caused a violation of the accused's right to
a fair trial under the Charter . The accused did not even challenge the
certificate's accuracy.

Facts

 

2.                The
appellant was convicted in 1985 of failing to provide a breath sample, contrary
to s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code . For a second or subsequent offence,
the accused is, under s. 235(2) , liable to a greater punishment. At the
sentencing hearing, the Crown asked that the court impose a greater punishment
because of previous convictions and established that notice had been given to
the accused prior to his plea in compliance with s. 740  of the Criminal Code 
which requires that in order to impose a greater punishment the court must be
satisfied that the defendant, before making his plea, was notified that, upon
conviction, a greater punishment would be sought.

 

3.                As
actual proof of the convictions, the Crown simply produced a document entitled
""Certified Extract of British Columbia Driving Record"" pursuant to s.
75 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288 (as amended by S.B.C.
1982, c. 36, s. 16). The document listed previous convictions. The accused
objected to the production of the document on three grounds:

 

a)                that
said Notice of Greater Punishment lacked                    sufficient
particularity;

 

b)                that
he was not sufficiently identified in the                          ""Certified
Extract of British Columbia Driving                    Record"";

 

c)                that
the ""Certified Extract of British Columbia                     Driving
Record"" was not admissible at common law as                retained by s.
7(2)  of the Criminal Code  despite s.            75 of the Motor
Vehicle Act of B.C. and s. 37 of                    the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10, as        amended, which purport to allow
for its                    admissibility.

 

4.                In
this Court the appellant has not pursued the first two grounds, but has argued,
in addition to his third ground, that he was entitled, under s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , to notice of the Crown's intention to
proceed to proof of his previous convictions through the production of a
certificate.

Judgments

 

Provincial
Court of British Columbia

 

5.                Bendrodt
Prov. Ct. J. held that the Crown, when seeking a greater penalty pursuant to s.
740  of the Criminal Code  (repealed 1985), may rely upon the filing of
the certified extract of a B.C. Driving Record by virtue of s. 37  of the Canada
Evidence Act ; he held himself to be bound by the judgment of the B.C. Court
of Appeal in R. v. Porter (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 277. He further held
that the prosecution had established that the certified extract was indeed from
the record of the accused, and that there was no need to particularize the
previous convictions in the prosecution's notice of intention to seek greater
punishment (R. v. Taylor, [1964] 1 C.C.C. 207 (B.C.C.A.)) The case of R.
v. Reid, [1970] 5 C.C.C. 368 (B.C.C.A.), in his view stands only for the
proposition that, if the Crown chooses to particularize, it ought to do so
correctly.

 

6.                The
accused was sentenced to the minimum term of imprisonment‑‑three
months‑‑to be served intermittently on week‑ends.

(B.C.C.A., unreported, No. CA 001477, oral reasons delivered on March 29, 1984,
and summarized at 12 W.C.B. 100) in which the B.C. Court of Appeal held that a
certified extract of an accused's driving record could be introduced by the
Crown to prove previous convictions.

 

Court of
Appeal of British Columbia

 

8.                Seaton
J.A., writing for the Court, dismissed the appeal without reasons, emphasizing
that the case law of the B.C. Court of Appeal precluded any other result but
that it would be useful to have the views of the Supreme Court of Canada.

 

The
Issues

 

9.                The
issues in this case can be framed as follows:

 

10.              First
issue

 

11.              Is
the ""Certified Extract of British Columbia Driving Record"" admissible
in evidence as proof of previous convictions, under the common law, or is it
through the combined effect of s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act  and of
s. 75 of the British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act?

 

12.              Second
issue

 

13.              Does
section 7 of the Charter  require that sufficient notice be given to the
accused of the Crown's intent to proceed to proof of those convictions by
resort to that certificate?

 

The
First Issue

 

14.              Parliament
has the exclusive jurisdiction to legislate on the law of evidence in criminal
matters by reason of s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 . For
the most part, Parliament has left the common law in place. It has supplemented
the common law with the Canada Evidence Act , which deals generally with
evidence within federal jurisdiction, and specific provisions in the Criminal
Code  and other legislation. The only specific provisions dealing with the
proof of previous convictions in proceedings under the Criminal Code  are
ss. 500(4) and 594(1)(a) of the Code. The mode of proof set out
in those provisions was not followed in this case, and the certificate would
thus be inadmissible if these provisions set out the exclusive mode of proof of
convictions in criminal matters.

 

15.              Section
500(4)  provides that a copy of a conviction certified by the judge or the
proper officer of the court or proved to be a true copy is ""sufficient
evidence in any legal proceedings to prove the conviction of that person"".
Section 594(1) (a) adds that there is no need to prove the signature or
the official character of the person appearing to have signed the certificate.
The question that must be answered is whether, by providing this specific
method of proving prior convictions, the Criminal Code  excludes all
others.

 

16.              There
is nothing in either s. 500(4)  or s. 594(1) (a) to indicate that proof of
convictions may only be made as provided therein. Rather, s. 500(4) states that
the mode of proof provided therein is ""sufficient evidence"", which
tends to indicate that there are other modes of proof. The Ontario Court of
Appeal came to this conclusion in R. v. Blackstock (1950), 97 C.C.C. 201
at pp. 206‑7:

 

                   Much was said upon the hearing of the
appeal as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the proof of all or any of the
convictions. Mr. Borins contended that such proof must be made in compliance
with the provisions of s. 23 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c.
59 [now s. 23, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10], which provides a mode for the proof
in any of our Courts of ""any proceeding or record whatsoever"" of, in,
or before our own Courts or those of other countries. Mr. Mathews relies upon
s. 982 [now s. 594, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34] of the Code itself which
provides a method for proof of previous convictions. Proof of the numerous
convictions mentioned in the notice to the appellant was sought to be made in
documentary form of one kind or another. Undoubtedly upon the English
authorities, which I adopt, the three previous convictions which are mentioned
in s. 575C(1)(a) [now s. 688(2)(a), R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34]
must be proved strictly, although much more latitude is allowed with respect to
the proof of convictions not relied upon as comprising one of these necessary
three: see R. v. Turner, [1910] 1 K.B. 346; R. v. Franklin
(1909), 3 Cr. App. R. 48; R. v. Chatway (1910), 5 Cr. App. R.
151.

 

                   Neither s. 23 of the Canada
Evidence Act  nor s. 982 of the Code provide in effect that proof of
a previous conviction, or even strict proof, may only be made as provided
therein. Section 23  merely says that evidence of a proceeding or record
""may be made"" as therein provided, while s. 982  says merely that a
certain certificate of a previous indictment and conviction, or a certain copy
of a summary conviction shall, upon proof of the identity of the person of the
offender, be sufficient evidence of the conviction.

 

This
decision was followed in R. v. Wilkinson (1978), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 278 (B.C.
Co. Ct.) and 284 (C.A.) and, in my view, it is correct.

 

17.              In
the absence of an express provision setting out the exclusive mode of proof of
prior convictions in proceedings under the Criminal Code , the common law
rule would apply. The common law of evidence is in force either through s. 7(2)
of the Code or simply because Parliament has never replaced it.

 

18.              In
my view, the certificate is hearsay evidence and would not be admissible at
trial unless one of the exceptions was applicable. There was much argument in
this case as to the scope of the ""public documents"" exception. In my
view, it is not necessary to deal with that question. The certificate is
admissible at common law because, irrespective of the hearsay rule, all
credible and trustworthy evidence is admissible at a sentencing hearing. In R.
v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, Dickson J., as he then was, speaking for
a majority of the Court, wrote at p. 414:

 

                   It is a commonplace that the strict
rules which govern at trial do not apply at a sentencing hearing and it would
be undesirable to have the formalities and technicalities characteristic of the
normal adversary proceeding prevail. The hearsay rule does not govern the
sentencing hearing. Hearsay evidence may be accepted where found to be credible
and trustworthy. The judge traditionally has had wide latitude as to the
sources and types of evidence upon which to base his sentence. He must have the
fullest possible information concerning the background of the accused if he is
to fit the sentence to the offender rather than to the crime. [Emphasis added.]

 

19.              A
similar statement can be found in Cross on Evidence (6th ed. 1985) at
pp. 8‑9:

 

                   There are also significant
differences in relation to the mixture of rules which applies to issues of fact
which arise to be determined after the trial has concluded. In criminal cases
issues of fact often arise in relation to the basis for sentencing the accused,
or making some other order. In cases tried on indictment where the accused has
a criminal record, a statement of his previous convictions and antecedents is
prepared by the police in the form of a proof of evidence. This is intended to
be used at the sentencing stage, though it is clear that many of the statements
in it will amount to hearsay. It seems that this is immaterial so long as the
facts are not disputed, but that if they are, it is necessary to prove them by
evidence admissible under the rules for the trial.

 

20.              The
appellant did not dispute the fact of his convictions, but only the means by
which they were to be proved.

 

21.              Although
this conclusion is determinative of the first issue in this case, serious
queries with respect to the scope of s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act 
have been made in the past, as in this case by Seaton J.A. of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, and in my view should therefore be addressed.

 

22.              It
is argued in this case that, irrespective of the common law rule, the certified
extract of the driving record was admissible pursuant to s. 75(2) of the
British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act. The provincial legislation, which,
much like ss. 500(4) and 594(1)(a) of the Code, purports to be
permissive rather than exclusive, is said to be incorporated into the federal
law of evidence by s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act .

 

23.              This
Court has considered the scope of s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act  on
two occasions.

 

24.              In
Marshall v. The Queen, [1961] S.C.R. 123, the Court was dealing with
provincial legislation that purported to render inadmissible statements which
would have been admissible at common law. Kerwin C.J. stated at p. 127:

 

...by common law a confession is admissible when it is
proved to have been made voluntarily in the sense that it was not induced by
threats or promises. I agree with the trial judge that the statements here in
question were made voluntarily. If subs. 5 of s. 110 of the present Act
purported to alter this rule, its application in a trial under the Criminal
Code  is excluded by that part of s. 36  [now s. 37, R.C.S 1970, c. E‑10]
of the Canada Evidence Act  which is underlined because s. 7(1)  of the Criminal
Code   retains the old common law....

 

Cartwright
J. stated at pp. 129‑30:

 

It cannot assist the appellant unless s. 36  of the Canada
Evidence Act  can be interpreted as providing that where a law in the
province in which criminal proceedings are taken renders a statement made under
specified circumstances inadmissible in civil proceedings it shall be
inadmissible in criminal proceedings also. Parliament has power to so enact,
but it does not appear to me that the words of s. 36  are susceptible of the
suggested interpretation, and I am forced to conclude that even on the
assumption that the statement made by the appellant would have been rendered
inadmissible in a civil trial arising out of the motor vehicle accident out of
which the criminal charge against the appellant arose (a question which I find
unnecessary to decide) they were not rendered inadmissible on the trial of that
charge.

 

                   I realize that the view which I have
expressed restricts the operation of s. 36 within narrow limits in so far as
criminal proceedings are concerned, but the contrary view would involve the
possibility of the law as to the admissibility in evidence in criminal
proceedings of statements made by an accused person varying from province to
province and from year to year in accordance with provincial enactments dealing
with the rules of evidence in civil cases. It would, in my opinion, require
plainer words than have been used to enable us to construe s. 36 as having such
an effect.

 

25.              A
similar conclusion was reached in Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R.
60, where the Court held that the common law rule regarding the secrecy of
police informers was incorporated into the criminal law by s. 7(2)  of the Criminal
Code  such that provincial legislation could not, through s. 37  of the Canada
Evidence Act , affect that rule. Marshall was followed in R. v.
Richardson (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 403, with respect to a certificate of
ownership of a motor vehicle.

 

26.              Lagarde,
in Précis de la loi et des règles de la preuve en matière criminelle
(1954), came to the same conclusion (at p. 289):

 

[TRANSLATION]  Section 36 of the Evidence Act, which
refers to provincial laws on evidence, applies only where there are no other
appropriate provisions of the Evidence Act or the Criminal Code . As we have
seen, section 7 of the latter incorporates the provisions of the common law to
deal with what it does not cover. In a criminal proceeding, therefore, the
provisions of the Criminal Code  are applied, and where this is silent, the
provisions of the common law and of the Evidence Act. It is only when all these
sources have been exhausted that provincial laws on evidence come into play.

 

as did
Fortin in Preuve pénale (1984), at p. 18:

 

[TRANSLATION]  In conclusion, the incorporation of the
provincial law of evidence into the criminal law is more a matter of theory
than practice. Only provincial statutes on evidence which do not differ from
the rules specified by federal legislation or the common law are admissible. As
under section 7(2)  Cr.C . the common law is the supplementary law in evidentiary
matters, there is no void that must be filled by provincial law.

 

27.              In
my view, s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act  must be given a narrow scope.
I would thus agree with this Court's decisions in Marshall and Bisaillon
where it held that the admissibility of confessions and the privilege
respecting police informers are matters which are beyond provincial legislation
under s. 37 . To hold otherwise would allow unacceptable differences from
province to province on fundamental matters of criminal evidence. Section 37 
refers specifically to ""the laws of proof of service of any warrant,
summons, subpoena or other document"". The service of such documents is a
matter within provincial competence and, in my view, s. 37  should be restricted
to the proof of matters within provincial competence. While it is true that a
driving record is generally a matter within provincial competence, the
particular aspect of the driving record that is at issue here is prior
convictions under the Criminal Code . This is clearly a matter within
federal jurisdiction and, in my view, s. 37  does not incorporate provincial
legislation on this subject.

 

The
Second Issue

 

28.              If
the Crown does not give advance notice of its intention to use a certificate,
is there a violation of s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

29.              This
issue was not addressed by respondent's attorney in his factum. This is
understandable as the appellant, though referring in his argument in his factum
to lack of notice as violating s. 7  of the Charter , had not in this
Court, nor in the courts below, framed it as one of the issues of the case. Be
that as it may, I shall address this second issue briefly.

 

30.              It
is appellant's contention that lack of notice deprives the accused of an
opportunity to verify the accuracy of the certificate and of cross‑examining
the officer who would otherwise have testified to prove the convictions. Given
the manner in which the issue was raised in his factum, I understand the
appellant is arguing the common law, as regards hearsay in general in
sentencing matters, and particularly resort to a certificate in this case, to
be in violation of the Charter  because of the lack of a requirement that
notice must always be given that proof will be made by certificate. I cannot
subscribe to such a proposition. The conduct of a trial in general, including
the application of the rules of evidence in a given case, must not result in
the trial being unfair because the accused has been denied a full opportunity
to prepare his case, challenge and answer the Crown's case. If a rule of law,
statutory or common law, were framed in such a way that it would be per se
a violation of the right to a fair trial, then the statute would be declared
inoperative or the common law declared to be otherwise. This is not the case
here. I cannot see lack of notice irrevocably resulting in such a situation. In
itself the common law rule as regards the sentencing process is not in
violation of the Charter . This is not to say that lack of notice and
availability of the officer for cross‑examination in a particular case
could not result in a violation of the accused's right to a fair trial. In such
a case the challenge would come through s. 24  and remedy would inure to the
benefit of the accused upon proof of prejudice, or that the certificate
evidence be excluded under s. 24(2)  if the conditions of that subsection were
met. But rare would be such a case. After all, an accused has first hand
knowledge of his previous convictions. To know that the certificate is
inaccurate does not require his questioning anyone; to raise the matter is also
easy. Once the certificate's accuracy is seriously put in issue, it would be
incumbent upon the Crown to call whomever signed the certificate and make him
or her available for cross‑examination by the accused.

 

31.              But
the Charter  argument was not put to us within the structure of s. 24 .
Furthermore, and in any event, there was no attempt to establish that the lack
of notice in any way caused a violation of this accused's rights to a fair
trial under the Charter . The appellant in this case does not even
challenge the certificate's accuracy. I find no merit in his Charter 
argument. I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

ss. 25(1), 36(1).

 

                   Appellant
police officer committed a common assault, as defined in the Criminal Code,
which was also a ""major service offence"" under the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act . The major service offence was dealt with first. The
trial judge quashed the information for the charge of common assault under s.
24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  on the ground that
the accused was being tried twice for the same misconduct contrary to s. 11  of
the Charter  but the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench allowed an
appeal from that judgment holding that the common assault charge and the major
service offence constituted separate offences. An appeal to the Court of Appeal
was dismissed.

 

                   The
central issue here was whether the appellant's conviction of a ""major
service offence"" under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act 
precluded subsequent proceedings under the Criminal Code  for the same
misconduct on the ground that such proceedings would violate the accused's
right, under s. 11 (h) of the Charter , not to be tried twice for
the same offence. The first constitutional question queried whether a
prosecution by the Crown for a criminal offence arising from an act for which
the accused was convicted under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act 
violated s. 11  of the Charter .  If so, the second queried whether or not
the subsequent prosecution was justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Held (Estey
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed; the first constitutional
question should be answered in the negative.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Lamer, Wilson and La Forest JJ.: The rights
guaranteed by s. 11  of the Charter  are available to persons prosecuted
by the State for public offences involving punitive sanctions, i.e., criminal,
quasi‑criminal and regulatory offences, either federally or provincially
enacted. The section is intended to provide procedural safeguards in
proceedings which may attract penal consequences even if not criminal in the
strict sense.

 

                   A
matter could fall within s. 11  either because by its very nature it is a
criminal proceeding or because a conviction in respect of the offence may lead
to a true penal consequence. In cases where the two tests conflict the ""by
nature"" test must give way to the ""true penal consequence"" test.

 

                   If
a particular matter is of a public nature, intended to promote public order and
welfare within a public sphere of activity, then that matter falls within s.
11 . This is to be distinguished from private, domestic or disciplinary matters
which are regulatory, protective or corrective and which are primarily intended
to maintain discipline, professional integrity and professional standards or to
regulate conduct within a limited private sphere of activity.

 

                   The
R.C.M.P. Code of Discipline is concerned with the maintenance of discipline and
integrity within the Force and is designed to regulate conduct relevant to
being a member of the R.C.M.P. The proceedings before the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Service Court are accordingly neither criminal nor quasi‑criminal
proceedings. However, an officer charged and convicted under the Code of
Discipline faces a true penal consequence since conviction can result in
imprisonment for one year.

 

                   Nevertheless,
appellant does not have the benefit of s. 11 (h) because he was not being
tried and punished for the same offence. The ""offences"" were quite
different. One was an internal disciplinary matter where the accused was found
guilty of a major service offence and has accounted to his profession. The
other was the criminal offence of assault where the accused must account to
society at large for his conduct. The accused cannot complain, as a member of a
special group of individuals subject to private internal discipline, that he
ought not to account to society for his wrongdoing as a member of the public at
large.

 

                   Constitutionally
guaranteed procedural protections may be available in a particular case under
s. 7  of the Charter  even although s. 11  is not available. The appellant
in this case chose to base his case solely on s. 11  of the Charter .

 

                   Per Estey
J. (dissenting): A tribunal's power to couple a one‑year imprisonment
sentence with a virtually inevitable dismissal from the Force upon conviction
does not amount to a scale of punishment which reflects only the internal
disciplinary interest of the R.C.M.P. but also takes into consideration the
interest of the larger community in the suppression of the crime of assault
wherever committed. The test must be practical: whether the first court, upon
registering a conviction, was performing a task assigned by Parliament which,
by the scale of punishment available to the tribunal, is readily recognizable
as a process in which the general public's interest in the administration of
criminal law is recognized over and above the limited interest of internal
discipline. The subsequent proceeding under s. 245(1)  of the Criminal Code 
falls squarely within the prohibition in s. 11 (h) of the Charter 
and a breach of a right under that section cannot be justified by any
conceivable s. 1  reasonable limits analysis.

                   The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Lamer, Wilson and La Forest JJ.
was delivered by

 

1.                Wilson J.‑‑The
central issue on this appeal is whether the appellant's conviction of a
""major service offence"" under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. R‑9, precludes subsequent proceedings under the Criminal
Code  for the same misconduct. The resolution of this issue requires a
decision as to whether such a major service offence constitutes an
""offence"" within the meaning of s. 11  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and, if so, whether proceedings under the Criminal
Code  would violate the appellant's right under s. 11 (h) of the Charter 
not to be tried and punished again for the same offence. Before turning to
a consideration of these issues it is necessary to examine briefly the facts of
the case.

 

1. The
Facts

 

2.                The
appellant was at all material times a Constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. On August 21, 1981, one Donald Kerr was brought to the R.C.M.P.
detachment in Yorkton, Saskatch‑ ewan for a breathalyzer test. Kerr was
taken into a room where he met the appellant.

 

3.                The
appellant started to question Kerr concerning the incident giving rise to his
arrest. He asked Kerr who was driving the car at the time. Kerr indicated that
his sister was driving. The appellant suspected he was lying. He repeated the
question a couple of times, receiving the same response each time. The
appellant then grabbed Kerr, who was seated in a chair at the time, by the
throat and pushed him against a wall. The grab around the throat was sufficient
to cause a choking sensation to Kerr.

 

4.                After
a few seconds the appellant questioned Kerr again as to who was driving the
car. Kerr continued to maintain that his sister was driving. The appellant
slapped Kerr across the face with his open hand and repeated the question. Kerr
gave the same answer. However, after three or four slaps Kerr admitted that he
had been driving the car. At no time did Kerr respond physically to the
appellant's slaps. The defence has admitted, on these facts, that the appellant
committed a common assault as defined in the Criminal Code . As a result
of the assault Kerr suffered a sore throat, a ringing in his ears, and several
minor marks on his face.

 

5.                Two
charges were laid following this incident. On August 21, 1981 the appellant was
charged with common assault contrary to s. 245(1) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. The appellant was also charged under the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Act  as follows:

 

That at or near Yorkton, in the Province of
Saskatchewan, on the 21st day of August, 1981, that you were unnecessarily
violent towards a prisoner, to wit: Donald Kerr, by forcibly grabbing him and
slapping him in the face, contrary to Section [sic] (L), Section 25  of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act .

 

2. The
Courts Below

 

6.                On
June 2, 1982 the appellant appeared before Inspector S. G. Wilcox of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Service Court for trial of the charge laid under the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Act . The appellant was found guilty of a
""major service offence"" under s. 25(l) of that Act. The
section reads as follows:

 

                   25. Every member
who

 

                                                                    ...

 

(l) is cruel, harsh or unnecessarily violent
to any prisoner or other person;

 

                                                                    ...

 

is guilty of an offence, to be known as a major service
offence, and is liable to trial and punishment as prescribed in this Part.

 

The
maximum penalty imposed by s. 36(1) of the Act for such an offence is
imprisonment for one year. The appellant was assessed a fine of $300.

 

7.                On
February 2, 1983 the appellant appeared before His Honour Judge Meagher of the
Saskatchewan Provincial Court for trial of the charge of common assault under
s. 245(1)  of the Criminal Code . His counsel submitted that it would be
improper to proceed with this charge following the conviction under the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Act  since this would violate the accused's right
under s. 11 (h) of the Charter  not to be tried and punished twice
for the same offence. The trial judge accepted this submission and quashed the
information pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter . He held that both the
proceeding before the service tribunal and the proceeding before the criminal
court were penal in nature‑‑both involved a trial for an alleged
""offence"" and a possible term of imprisonment following a
determination of guilt. In his view, if punishment were meted out in each case,
the appellant would be punished twice for the same offence.

 

8.                The
Crown appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan. On July 5, 1983
that Court allowed the appeal. Kindred J. held that the trial judge had erred
in law in holding that the conviction under the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Act  precluded him from trying the appellant under the Criminal
Code . The two constituted different offences. The former was a trial before
a service tribunal for a breach of discipline amounting to a major service
offence applicable only to members of the Force, while the latter was a trial
in a court of record for a criminal offence applicable to all. The Court found
the appellant guilty as charged and assessed a fine of $250 to be paid within
one month or imprisonment for fifteen days.

 

9.                The
appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. On February 16,
1984 the appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the proceeding
before the R.C.M.P. service tribunal was purely ""disciplinary"". In
its view, that proceeding was concerned only with the professional aspect of
the appellant's conduct. It was still necessary for the appellant to answer to
society for the criminal aspect of his conduct. It held that s. 11 (h) of
the Charter  did not prevent the appellant from being tried and charged
for the criminal offence of assault because he was not found guilty and
punished for that ""offence"" within the meaning of s. 11  of the Charter .
Cameron J.A. stated:

 

                   A single act may have more than one
aspect, and it may give rise to more than one legal consequence. It may, if it
constitutes a breach of the duty a person owes to society, amount to a crime,
for which the actor must answer to the public. At the same time, the act may,
if it involves injury and a breach of one's duty to another, constitute a
private cause of action for damages, for which the actor must answer to the
person he injured. And that same act may have still another aspect to it: it
may also involve a breach of the duties of one's office or calling, in which
event the actor must account to his professional peers. For example a doctor
who sexually assaults a patient will be liable, at one and the same time, to a
criminal conviction at the behest of the state; to a judgment for damages, at
the instance of the patient, and to an order of discipline on the motion of the
governing council of his profession. Similarly a policeman who assaults a
prisoner is answerable to the state for his crime; to the victim for damage he
caused; and to the police force for discipline.

 

Cameron
J.A. concluded:

 

In the light of this I think Constable Wigglesworth's
contention must fail since the proceeding before the R.C.M.P. service tribunal
was purely disciplinary. It was concerned only with the professional aspect of
his conduct: the ""offence"" of which he was found guilty, a
""major service offence"", lay in the breach by him of his policeman's
duty not to treat his prisoners harshly, cruelly, or with unnecessary violence.
He must still answer to society for the criminal aspect of his conduct, or for
his ""criminal offence"".

 

Cameron
J.A. also added that he expressed no opinion as to the constitutionality of the
power given to the R.C.M.P. under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act 
to imprison members of its force found guilty of major service offences.

 

10.              By
order dated May 22, 1986, Dickson C.J. stated the following constitutional
questions:

 

1. Is a prosecution by the Crown for the offence of
common assault pursuant to s. 245(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, in
relation to an act for which the accused has been previously convicted and
fined for an offence of unnecessary violence towards a prisoner contrary to s.
25(1)  and Part II of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act , in violation
of s. 11 (h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2. If a prosecution by the Crown for the offence of
common assault pursuant to s. 245(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada in
relation to an act for which the accused has been previously convicted and
fined for an offence of unnecessary violence towards a prisoner contrary to s.
25(1)  and Part II of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act  violates s.
11 (h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is the
subsequent prosecution by the Crown justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?

 

3. The
Issue

 

11.              Section
11  of the Charter  reads as follows:

 

                   11. Any person
charged with an offence has the right:

 

(a) to be informed without reasonable delay
of the specific offence;

 

(b) to be tried within a reasonable time;

 

(c) not to be compelled to be a witness in
proceedings against that person in respect of the offence;

 

(d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial
tribunal;

 

(e) not to be denied reasonable bail without
just cause;

 

(f) except in the case of an offence under
military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury
where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or
a more severe punishment;

 

(g) not to be found guilty on account of any
act or omission unless, at the time of the act or omission, it constituted an
offence under Canadian or international law or was criminal according to the
general principles of law recognized by the community of nations;

 

(h) if finally acquitted of the offence, not
to be tried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the
offence, not to be tried or punished for it again; and

 

(i) if found guilty of the offence and if
the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission
and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.

 

12.              As
mentioned above, the first question to be considered is whether the appellant
has been ""charged with an offence"" within the meaning of the opening
words of s. 11 . The proper approach to Charter  interpretation was set
out by this Court in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295. At
page 344, Dickson C.J. stated:

 

The meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter 
[is] to be ascertained by an analysis of the purpose of such a
guarantee; it was to be understood, in other words, in the light of the
interests it was meant to protect.

 

. . . this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose
of the right or freedom in question is to be sought by reference to the
character and the larger objects of the Charter  itself, to the language
chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins
of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of
the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the
text of the Charter . The interpretation should be, as the judgment in Southam
emphasizes, a generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the
purpose of the guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter 's
protection. At the same time it is important not to overshoot the actual
purpose of the right or freedom in question, but to recall that the Charter 
was not enacted in a vacuum, and must therefore, as this Court's decision in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, illustrates, be
placed in its proper linguistic, philosophic and historical contexts.

 

13.              There
have been a large number of cases decided on the issue whether the accused has
been ""charged with an offence"" within the meaning of the section. A
number of these cases have recognized a so‑called ""disciplinary
exception"" to the application of s. 11 . Thus, in R. v. Mingo
(1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 23 (B.C.S.C.), s. 11 (h) was held to be
inapplicable to a criminal prosecution for the same conduct which had been the
subject of disciplinary proceedings against an inmate. A similar result has
been reached in cases dealing with proceedings following a conviction for a
disciplinary offence under the Penitentiary Service Regulations: for
example, Yeomans v. Gaw (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 311 (F.C.A.), and Howard
and Presiding Officer of Inmate Disciplinary Court of Stony Mountain
Institution (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 557 (F.C.T.D.), subsequently reversed but
in reliance on s. 7  of the Charter  at [1984] 2 F.C. 642 (C.A.); contra:
Russell v. Radley, [1984] 1 F.C. 543 (T.D.); Re Peltari and Director
of the Lower Mainland Regional Correctional Centre (1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d)
223 (B.C.S.C.); and Knockaert v. Commissioner of Corrections (1986), 18
Admin. L.R. 273 (F.C.T.D.), subsequently upheld by [1987] 2 F.C. 202 (C.A.) The
same conclusion that s. 11  does not apply to disciplinary proceedings has been
reached in cases involving proceedings brought pursuant to professional
disciplinary statutes: see, for example, Re James and Law Society of British
Columbia (1982), 143 D.L.R. (3d) 379 (B.C.S.C.); Rosenbaum v. Law
Society of Manitoba, [1983] 5 W.W.R. 752 (Man. Q.B.); Belhumeur v.
Discipline Committee of Quebec Bar Association (1983), 34 C.R. (3d) 279
(Que. S.C.); Re Law Society of Manitoba and Savino (1983), 1 D.L.R.
(4th) 285 (Man. C.A.); Re Fang and College of Physicians & Surgeons of
Alberta (1985), 25 D.L.R. (4th) 632 (Alta. C.A.)

 

14.              The
breadth of the opening words of s. 11  ""any person charged with an
offence"" suggests that the section may well apply to non‑criminal
proceedings. A few cases support this interpretation, holding that the rights
guaranteed by s. 11  of the Charter  are available to those
""charged"" with disciplinary offences. In Re Nash and The Queen
(1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 490 (Nfld. Prov. Ct.), it was submitted before Kennedy
Prov. Ct. J. that an internal disciplinary panel of the Royal Newfoundland
Constabulary contravened s. 11 (d) of the Charter  because it was
not an independent and impartial tribunal. In considering the meaning of the
word ""offence"" in s. 11 (d), Kennedy Prov. Ct. J. stated at p.
494:

 

The word ""offence"" is broad enough to apply to
any breach or charge whereby an accused can be punished. ""Offence"" is
broad enough to apply to any of the actions taken against members of self‑governing
professional groups and associations and is also applicable to offences
involving breaches of codes of conduct for such groups as police forces and
members of the armed services.

 

15.              An
equally broad interpretation of the word ""offence"" appears in Re
Lazarenko and Law Society of Alberta (1983), 4 D.L.R. (4th) 389 (Alta.
Q.B.), at p. 398 (subsequently disapproved by the Alberta Court of Appeal in Re
Fang and College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta, supra). In R.
v. B & W Agricultural Services Ltd. (1982), 3 C.R.R. 354 (B.C. Prov.
Ct.), the accused was charged with a violation of the Aeronautics Act 
even although his licence had already been suspended for 30 days by an Air
Transport Committee. Shupe Prov. Ct. J., noting that the term
""offence"" in s. 11  of the Charter  was much broader than the
term ""criminal offence"" in s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III, granted the accused's request for a
stay of proceedings based on s. 11 (h) of the Charter . There is
also some academic support for the broader interpretation of the word
""offence"" in s. 11 . Morris Manning, in Rights, Freedoms and the
Courts: A Practical Analysis of the Constitution Act, 1982 (1983) states at
p. 362 that the breach of a law which carries a penalty is a ""penal
matter"" and is thus an ""offence"". He adds that the absence of
the word ""criminal"" is indicative of the intent of the framers of the
Charter  to have s. 11  apply to more than purely criminal offences. At
page 83 in his text on Legal Rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:
A Manual of Issues and Sources (1982), McDonald J. states:

 

... ""offence"" may include ... ""offences
which may be committed only by persons who are members of certain
organizations, such as the Armed Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police.... The word ""offence"", which signifies ""a breach of
law"" or ""an infraction of law"", may be so broad as to include
conduct which constitutes a ground upon which, by statute, a professional body
may impose discipline upon its members, by disqualification, suspension or a
fine.

 

16.              It
is my view that the narrower interpretation of s. 11  favoured by the majority
of the authorities referred to above is in fact the proper interpretation of
the section. The rights guaranteed by s. 11  of the Charter  are available
to persons prosecuted by the State for public offences involving punitive
sanctions, i.e., criminal, quasi‑criminal and regulatory offences, either
federally or provincially enacted. A number of factors impel me to this
conclusion.

 

17.              I
turn first to the text of s. 11 . The Ontario Court of Appeal in Trumbley and
Pugh v. Metropolitan Toronto Police (sub nom. Re Trumbley and Fleming)
(1986), 55 O.R. (2d) 570, in concluding that s. 11  is concerned with only
criminal or penal matters, properly observed that ""the clear impression
created by s. 11 , read as a whole, is that it is intended to provide procedural
safeguards relating to the criminal law process"". Section 11  contains
terms which are classically associated with criminal proceedings:
""tried"", ""presumed innocent until proven guilty"",
""reasonable bail"", ""punishment for the offence"", ""acquitted
of the offence"" and ""found guilty of the offence"". Indeed, some
of the rights guaranteed in s. 11  would seem to have no meaning outside the
criminal or quasi‑criminal context. As Hugessen A.C.J.S.C. stated in Belhumeur
v. Discipline Committee of Quebec Bar Association, supra, at p. 281,
s. 11  [TRANSLATION]  ""is directed exclusively at procedure in criminal and
penal matters"". This same observation was made by Stevenson J.A. in Re
Barry and Alberta Securities Commission (1986), 25 D.L.R. (4th) 730 (Alta.
C.A.), at p. 734, and by Monnin C.J. in Re Law Society of Manitoba and
Savino, supra, at p. 292.

 

18.              The
Ontario Court of Appeal in Trumbley noted that the legislative history
of the section indicates that it was not intended to be restricted solely to
criminal law but was meant to extend to ""penal proceedings"" as well.
Section 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights reads as follows:

 

                   2. No law of
Canada ... shall be construed or applied so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) deprive a person charged with a
criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial
tribunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without just
cause; . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

Section
2(f) differs from s. 11  of the Charter  in that it refers to a
""criminal offence"" whereas the Charter  refers only to an
""offence"". As already mentioned, some authorities see this difference
as intended to give s. 11  a broader application than mere ""criminal
offences"": see R. v. B & W Agricultural Services Ltd., supra;
Morris Manning, Rights, Freedoms and the Courts, supra. But this
leaves open the issue of how much broader the application of s. 11  should be.
One possible inference is that the word ""criminal"" was deleted in
order to ensure that s. 11  would also be applicable to summary conviction and
provincial offence prosecutions under quasi‑criminal public welfare
statutes. The Canadian Bill of Rights was a federal statute which had no
application to prosecutions of provincial offences created pursuant to s.
92(15)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 . I would agree with the conclusion
of Toy J. in R. v. Mingo, supra, at p. 36:

 

                   In my respectful view, the authors of
the new Charter , when they employed the unqualified word ""offence"" as
opposed to ""criminal offence"", were doing nothing more than providing
for the equal protection of Canadian citizens from breaches of their rights
under provincial as well as federal laws in so far as public as opposed to
private or domestic prohibitions were concerned.

 

The same
view was expressed by Monnin C.J.M. in Re Law Society of Manitoba and Savino,
supra, at p. 292:

 

Section 11  speaks of a person charged with an offence;
its nine subsections deal with criminal matters....

 

Its main purpose is matters dealing with criminal
offences....

 

Section 11  certainly was primarily meant to cover crimes
or quasi‑ crimes whether under federal or provincial legislation.

 

19.              The
marginal note to s. 11  seems to support this interpretation of the section. It
reads ""Proceedings in criminal and penal matters"". The Attorney
General for Ontario and the respondent submitted, however, that the Court ought
not to place any emphasis on the marginal note to s. 11  in interpreting the
section. There is no doubt that the traditional view was that marginal notes
could not be used as aids to interpretation as they formed no part of the Act
which was passed by Parliament: see E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes
(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 133; P. B. Maxwell, Maxwell on the Interpretation of
Statutes (12th ed. 1969), at p. 10; W. F. Craies, Craies on Statute Law
(7th ed. 1971), at p. 195. But reference to marginal notes has been made in
some English authorities: see, for example, Eastern Counties and London and
Blackwall Railway Cos. v. Marriage (1860), 9 H.L. Cas. 31, at p. 41; Sheffield
Waterworks Co. v. Bennett (1872), L.R. 7 Ex. 409, at p. 421; Stephens v.
Cuckfield Rural District Council, [1960] 2 All E.R. 716 (C.A.), at p. 720.
And this Court has used statutory headings to assist in interpreting sections
of the Charter : see  Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 357. In that case, Estey J., writing for a unanimous Court,
held that the headings were deliberately included as part of the Charter  and
formed part of the resolution which Parliament debated. At pages 376‑77
he stated:

 

It is clear that these headings were systematically and
deliberately included as an integral part of the Charter  for whatever
purpose. At the very minimum, the Court must take them into consideration when
engaged in the process of discerning the meaning and application of the
provisions of the Charter . The extent of the influence of a heading in
this process will depend upon many factors including (but the list is not
intended to be all‑embracing) the degree of difficulty by reason of
ambiguity or obscurity in construing the section; the length and complexity of
the provision; the apparent homogeneity of the provision appearing under the
heading; the use of generic terminology in the heading; the presence or absence
of a system of headings which appear to segregate the component elements of the
Charter ; and the relationship of the terminology employed in the heading
to the substance of the headlined provision.

 

                                                                    ...

 

...I conclude that an attempt must be made to bring
about a reconciliation of the heading with the section introduced by it. If,
however, it becomes apparent that the section when read as a whole is clear and
without ambiguity, the heading will not operate to change that clear and
unambiguous meaning. Even in that midway position, a court should not, by the
adoption of a technical rule of construction, shut itself off from whatever small
assistance might be gathered from an examination of the heading as part of the
entire constitutional document.

 

It must
be acknowledged, however, that marginal notes, unlike statutory headings, are
not an integral part of the Charter : see Canadian Pacific Ltd. v.
Attorney General of Canada, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 678, at p. 682. The case for
their utilization as aids to statutory interpretation is accordingly weaker. I
believe, however, that the distinction can be adequately recognized by the
degree of weight attached to them. I find some support in the marginal note
therefore for the proposition that the opening words of s. 11  ""charged
with an offence"" restrict the application of the section to criminal or
quasi‑criminal proceedings and proceedings giving rise to penal
consequences.

 

20.              Another
factor which leads me to adopt a somewhat narrow definition of the opening
words of s. 11  is a concern for the future coherent development of the section
if it is made applicable to a wide variety of proceedings. Unless the section
is restricted to criminal or penal matters there may be serious difficulty in
giving the section a reasonably consistent application. The particular content
of the various rights set out in s. 11  may well vary according to the type of
proceeding if a broader definition is given to the opening words of the
section. It is beyond question that those rights are accorded to those charged
with criminal offences, to those who face the prosecutorial power of the State
and who may well suffer a deprivation of liberty as a result of the exercise of
that power. The content of those rights ought not to suffer from a lack of
predictability or a lack of clarity because of a universal application of the
section. As is obvious from a study of the various rights enumerated in the
section, they are crucial fundamental rights whose meaning ought to be made
crystal clear to the authorities who prosecute the offences falling within the
section. For this reason it is, in my view, preferable to restrict s. 11  to the
most serious offences known to our law, i.e., criminal and penal matters and to
leave other ""offences"" subject to the more flexible criteria of
""fundamental justice"" in s. 7 .

 

21.              While
it is easy to state that those involved in a criminal or penal matter are to
enjoy the rights guaranteed by s. 11 , it is difficult to formulate a precise
test to be applied in determining whether specific proceedings are proceedings
in respect of a criminal or penal matter so as to fall within the ambit of the
section. The phrase ""criminal and penal matters"" which appears in the
marginal note would seem to suggest that a matter could fall within s. 11 
either because by its very nature it is a criminal proceeding or because a
conviction in respect of the offence may lead to a true penal consequence. I
believe that a matter could fall within s. 11  under either branch.

 

22.              There
are many examples of offences which are criminal in nature but which carry
relatively minor consequences following conviction. Proceedings in respect of
these offences would nevertheless be subject to the protections of s. 11  of the
Charter . It cannot be seriously contended that, just because a minor
traffic offence leads to a very slight consequence, perhaps only a small fine,
that offence does not fall within s. 11 . It is a criminal or quasi‑criminal
proceeding. It is the sort of offence which by its very nature must fall within
s. 11 . I would agree, therefore, with the comments made by Linden J. in Re
McCutcheon and City of Toronto (1983), 147 D.L.R. (3d) 193 (H.C.) In that
case, the accused claimed the benefit of s. 11  following the alleged commission
of a parking offence. At page 205 Linden J. said:

 

                   This provision of the Charter  is
available only to persons charged with an offence. On my reading of the by‑laws
and the legislation, the applicant is such a person, having been charged with
offences when the summonses were issued against her.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   There can be no question that parking
infractions are ""offences"" as that word is used in s. 11  of the
Charter . The respondents contend that these are not the types of transgressions
against society s. 11  of the Charter  is directed at, since there is virtually
no stigma attached to a parking ticket. In my view, however, the degree of stigma
is of no significance.

 

23.              In
my view, if a particular matter is of a public nature, intended to promote
public order and welfare within a public sphere of activity, then that matter
is the kind of matter which falls within s. 11 . It falls within the section
because of the kind of matter it is. This is to be distinguished from private,
domestic or disciplinary matters which are regulatory, protective or corrective
and which are primarily intended to maintain discipline, professional integrity
and professional standards or to regulate conduct within a limited private
sphere of activity: see, for example, Re Law Society of Manitoba and Savino,
supra, at p. 292, Re Malartic Hygrade Gold Mines (Canada) Ltd. and
Ontario Securities Commission (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 544 (H.C.), at p. 549,
and Re Barry and Alberta Securities Commission, supra, at p. 736,
per Stevenson J.A. There is also a fundamental distinction between
proceedings undertaken to promote public order and welfare within a public
sphere of activity and proceedings undertaken to determine fitness to obtain or
maintain a licence. Where disqualifications are imposed as part of a scheme for
regulating an activity in order to protect the public, disqualification
proceedings are not the sort of ""offence"" proceedings to which s. 11 
is applicable. Proceedings of an administrative nature instituted for the
protection of the public in accordance with the policy of a statute are also
not the sort of ""offence"" proceedings to which s. 11  is applicable.
But all prosecutions for criminal offences under the Criminal Code  and
for quasi‑criminal offences under provincial legislation are
automatically subject to s. 11 . They are the very kind of offences to which s.
11  was intended to apply.

 

24.              This
is not to say that if a person is charged with a private, domestic or
disciplinary matter which is primarily intended to maintain discipline,
integrity or to regulate conduct within a limited private sphere of activity,
he or she can never possess the rights guaranteed under s. 11 . Some of these
matters may well fall within s. 11 , not because they are the classic kind of
matters intended to fall within the section, but because they involve the
imposition of true penal consequences. In my opinion, a true penal consequence
which would attract the application of s. 11  is imprisonment or a fine which by
its magnitude would appear to be imposed for the purpose of redressing the
wrong done to society at large rather than to the maintenance of internal
discipline within the limited sphere of activity. In ""Annotation to R.
v. Wigglesworth"" (1984), 38 C.R. (3d) 388, at p. 389, Professor Stuart
states:

 

...other punitive forms of disciplinary measures,
such as fines or imprisonment, are indistinguishable from criminal punishment
and should surely fall within the protection of s. 11 (h).

 

I would
agree with this comment but with two caveats. First, the possibility of a fine
may be fully consonant with the maintenance of discipline and order within a
limited private sphere of activity and thus may not attract the application of
s. 11 . It is my view that if a body or an official has an unlimited power to
fine, and if it does not afford the rights enumerated under s. 11 , it cannot
impose fines designed to redress the harm done to society at large. Instead, it
is restricted to the power to impose fines in order to achieve the particular
private purpose. One indicium of the purpose of a particular fine is how
the body is to dispose of the fines that it collects. If, as in the case of
proceedings under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act , the fines are
not to form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund but are to be used for the
benefit of the Force, it is more likely that the fines are purely an internal
or private matter of discipline: Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act , s.
45 . The second caveat I would raise is that it is difficult to conceive of the
possibility of a particular proceeding failing what I have called the ""by
nature"" test but passing what I have called the ""true penal
consequence"" test. I have grave doubts whether any body or official which
exists in order to achieve some administrative or private disciplinary purpose
can ever imprison an individual. Such a deprivation of liberty seems justified
as being in accordance with fundamental justice under s. 7  of the Charter  only
when a public wrong or transgression against society, as opposed to an internal
wrong, is committed. However, as this was not argued before us in this appeal I
shall assume that it is possible that the ""by nature"" test can be
failed but the ""true penal consequence"" test passed. Assuming such a
situation is possible, it seems to me that in cases where the two tests
conflict the ""by nature"" test must give way to the ""true penal
consequence"" test. If an individual is to be subject to penal consequences
such as imprisonment‑‑the most severe deprivation of liberty known
to our law‑‑then he or she, in my opinion, should be entitled to
the highest procedural protection known to our law.

 

25.              Before
turning to the application of the law to the facts of this case, I want to
emphasize that nothing in the above discussion takes away from the possibility
that constitutionally guaranteed procedural protections may be available in a
particular case under s. 7  of the Charter  even although s. 11  is not
available. The appellant in this case has chosen to base his case solely on s.
11  of the Charter . In view of this I make no comment on the
applicability of s. 7 .

 

26.              It
is clear that the R.C.M.P. Code of Discipline is concerned with the maintenance
of discipline and integrity within the Force. It is designed to regulate
conduct within a limited private sphere of activity, i.e., conduct relevant to
one's position as a member of the R.C.M.P. In considering the offences set out
in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act  in The Queen and Archer v.
White, [1956] S.C.R. 154, Rand J. stated at p. 158:

 

...the delinquencies in s. 30 [of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act ] are strictly of domestic discipline, that is, the
member, by joining the Force, has agreed to enter into a body of special
relations, to accept certain duties and responsibilities, to submit to certain
restrictions upon his freedom of action and conduct and to certain coercive and
punitive measures prescribed for enforcing fulfillment of what he has
undertaken. These terms are essential elements of a status voluntarily entered
into which affect what, by the general law, are civil rights, that is, action
and behaviour which is not forbidden him as a citizen.

 

At page
168 Abbott J. stated:

 

                   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Act  and the regulations made thereunder constitute a code of law regulating
the recruitment, administration and discipline of the Force.

 

In Inkster
v. Radey, [1979] 2 F.C. 457 (C.A.), Le Dain J. stated at p. 459:

 

The major service offences specified in section 25 of
the Act obviously relate to matters of discipline. They are not, generally
speaking, offences of the public character punishable under the Criminal
Code  or other statutes of a criminal nature, although they might in some
cases give rise to prosecution under the criminal law.

 

It would
therefore seem that the proceedings before the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Service Court fail what I have called the ""by nature"" test. They are
neither criminal proceedings nor quasi‑criminal proceedings. They do not
appear to be the kind of proceedings which fall within the ambit of s. 11 . But
it is apparent that an officer charged under the Code of Discipline faces a
true penal consequence. He or she may be imprisoned for one year pursuant to s.
36(1)  of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act  if he or she is found
guilty of a major service offence. As was stated by Joyal J. in Van Rassel
v. Canada, [1987] 1 F.C. 473, a case which also dealt with a s. 11 (h)
claim with respect to proceedings for a major service offence under the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Act , ""The statute as a consequence [of the
provision for imprisonment] is as much a penal statute as is the Criminal
Code "" (at p. 484). This would seem, therefore, to be that unusual case
where proceedings have failed the ""by nature"" test but have passed
the ""true penal consequence"" test. As I have indicated above, in a
case of conflict the ""by nature"" test must give way to the ""true
penal consequence"" test. I find, therefore, that s. 11  applies to
proceedings in respect of a major service offence before the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Service Court. Is the appellant entitled then to have the
prosecution for the alleged criminal assault stayed on the ground that
punishment for that offence would result in double punishment of the appellant
for the same offence contrary to s. 11 (h) of the Charter ?

 

27.              This
Court in R. v. Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, recently examined the scope
of the rule against multiple convictions enunciated in Kienapple v. The
Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. In Prince the accused's single act
caused injury to one person and allegedly caused the death of another person.
The accused was convicted of causing bodily harm in respect of the injured
victim. The Court considered whether she could also be tried for manslaughter
in respect of the deceased victim. The Court held that she could be so tried.
In its view, although a single act of the accused grounded both charges, there
was not sufficient correspondence between the elements of the two offences to
sustain the operation of the rule against multiple convictions. The two
offences, the Court found, involved distinct elements. In the course of his
reasons Dickson C.J. discussed the requirement that there be a sufficient nexus
between the offences charged before the rule against multiple convictions is
triggered. He said at pp. 494‑95:

 

                   In my opinion, the weight of
authority since Kienapple also supports the proposition that there must
be sufficient nexus between the offences charged to sustain the rule against
multiple convictions. In a unanimous judgment in McKinney v. The Queen,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 401, delivered orally by Laskin C.J., the Court saw no reason
for interfering with a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal
. . . . McKinney and others were charged and convicted of
hunting out of season and hunting at night with lights contrary to ss. 16(1)
and 19(1), respectively, of the Wildlife Act, R.S.M. 1970, c. W140. Both
charges arose out of the same hunting incident. O'Sullivan J.A. for the
majority held that the case involved two ""delicts"". Monnin J.A.,
dissenting on another issue, said that hunting out of season and hunting with
lights were two different ""matters"", totally separate one from the
other and not alternative one to the other. The judges of the Court of Appeal
all agreed that Kienapple was inapplicable. Thus, notwithstanding there
was but a single act of hunting, there were distinct delicts, causes or matters
which would sustain separate convictions.

 

                                                                    ...

 

If an accused is guilty of several wrongs, there is no
injustice in his or her record conforming to that reality.

 

In the
context of proceedings before disciplinary tribunals there is ample authority
for the view that disciplinary offences are separate and distinct from criminal
offences for the purpose of the rule against multiple convictions: see Re
Pelissero and Loree (1982), 140 D.L.R. (3d) 676 (Ont. H.C.); Re MacDonald
and Marriott (1984), 7 D.L.R. (4th) 697 (B.C.S.C.); Van Rassel v. Canada,
supra; Re Bridges and Bridges (Ont. Prov. Ct., per Colter
Prov. Ct. J., unreported); R. v. DeBaie (1983), 60 N.S.R. (2d) 78
(N.S.C.A.), and R. v. Belliveau (1984), 55 N.B.R. (2d) 82 (C.A.), at p.
86. In their text on The Doctrine of Res Judicata (2nd ed. 1969),
Spencer Bower and Turner state at p. 279:

 

An example is readily found in an inquiry instituted by
the disciplinary authority of a professional body, with a view to the expulsion
of one against whom conduct infamous in a professional respect is alleged. In
such a case it may be that the conduct alleged is no more and no less than
conduct in respect of which the accused person has already been acquitted by a
criminal court on a criminal charge. Neither a conviction nor an acquittal
before a criminal court on a criminal charge will bar the use of the same
conduct before such a tribunal on an application to suspend or expel; for the
purpose of the proceeding is not to punish the practitioner for the commission
of an offence as such, but to exercise disciplinary power over the members of a
profession so as to ensure that their conduct conforms to the standards of the
profession.

 

28.              I
would hold that the appellant in this case is not being tried and punished for
the same offence. The ""offences"" are quite different. One is an
internal disciplinary matter. The accused has been found guilty of a major
service offence and has, therefore, accounted to his profession. The other
offence is the criminal offence of assault. The accused must now account to
society at large for his conduct. He cannot complain, as a member of a special
group of individuals subject to private internal discipline, that he ought not
to account to society for his wrongdoing. His conduct has a double aspect as a
member of the R.C.M.P. and as a member of the public at large. To borrow from
the words of the Chief Justice quoted above, I am of the view that the two
offences were ""two different `matters', totally separate one from the
other and not alternative one to the other"". While there was only one act
of assault there were two distinct delicts, causes or matters which would
sustain separate convictions. I would respectfully adopt the following passage
from the reasons of Cameron J.A. in the court below:

 

                   A single act may have more than one
aspect, and it may give rise to more than one legal consequence. It may, if it
constitutes a breach of the duty a person owes to society, amount to a crime,
for which the actor must answer to the public.... And that same act may have
still another aspect to it: it may also involve a breach of the duties of one's
office or calling, in which event the actor must account to his professional
peers. For example a doctor who sexually assaults a patient will be liable, at
one and the same time, to a criminal conviction at the behest of the state; to
a judgment for damages, at the instance of the patient, and to an order of
discipline on the motion of the governing council of his profession. Similarly
a policeman who assaults a prisoner is answerable to the state for his crime;
to the victim for damage he caused; and to the police force for discipline.

 

29.              For
these reasons I would dismiss the appeal. I would answer the constitutional
questions as follows:

 

1. Is a prosecution by the Crown for the offence of
common assault pursuant to s. 245(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, in
relation to an act for which the accused has been previously convicted and
fined for an offence of unnecessary violence towards a prisoner contrary to s.
25(1)  and Part II of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act , in violation
of s. 11 (h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

30.              Answer: No.

 

2. If a prosecution by the Crown for the offence of
common assault pursuant to s. 245(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada in
relation to an act for which the accused has been previously convicted and
fined for an offence of unnecessary violence towards a prisoner contrary to s.
25(1)  and Part II of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act  violates s.
11 (h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is the
subsequent prosecution by the Crown justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?

 

31.              Answer: In
view of the answer to question 1 it is not necessary to answer this question. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

32.              Estey J. (dissenting)‑‑I
am in complete agreement with the judgment of Justice Wilson from p. 546
through p. 564 line b‑4 of the judgment, particularly the
conclusion that where there is a ""true penal consequence"" it cannot
be said as a matter of law that a tribunal with the responsibility of
conviction and sentencing is but a disciplinary court administering justice to
a professional or other body of specialized persons segregated for this purpose
from the general community. Therefore, I agree with Wilson J. when she
concludes that s. 11  of the Charter  applies to a trial conducted
pursuant to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. R‑9,
for a ""major service offence"".

 

33.              With
much reflection and all due respect I do not follow the line thereafter pursued
in the concluding few pages of my colleague's judgment in this appeal.

 

34.              The
distinguishing feature of the tribunal sitting under the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act  is that this tribunal was equipped by Parliament to
apply, following the registration of a conviction, a scale of punishment
ranging from a reprimand through a fine up to $500 to an ultimate penalty of
one‑year imprisonment. The statute in addition (s. 38) empowers the
convicting officer of the accused to recommend his removal from the Force upon
conviction. It can hardly be said, given the power under the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act  to couple a one‑year imprisonment sentence with a
virtually inevitable dismissal from the Force upon conviction, that Parliament
intended that the scale of punishment would reflect only the internal disciplinary
interest of the R.C.M.P. and not the larger community interest in the
suppression of the crime of assault wherever committed.

 

35.              It
is not irrelevant to note that Parliament when enacting the Criminal Code 
did anticipate the existence of a body outside the traditional courts
administering criminal law in or outside the Criminal Code  when it
enacted s. 11 of the Code:

 

                   11. Where an act
or omission is an offence under more than one Act of the Parliament of Canada,
whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, a person who does
the act or makes the omission is, unless a contrary intention appears, subject
to proceedings under any of those Acts, but is not liable to be punished more
than once for the same offence.

 

The
section makes no reference to any particular tribunal but deals entirely with a
prohibition against punishment more than once for the same offence. There is no
question but that here the one accused committed the single offence of common
assault and that he has been convicted and sentenced for that offence in a
court established by Parliament for that purpose and is now faced with the like
prosecution under another Act of Parliament, the Criminal Code  and
before another court.

 

36.              In
R. v. Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, the Chief Justice, in discussing the
principles underlying the rule against multiple convictions, states (at pp. 498‑99):

 

                   I conclude, therefore, that the
requirement of sufficient proximity between offences will only be satisfied if
there is no additional and distinguishing element that goes to guilt contained
in the offence for which a conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple
principle.

 

37.              The
facts in Prince, supra, are quite different from the circumstances in
this case. Not only were there two victims of the one stabbing action, but
also, the two offences under consideration, viz., causing bodily harm and
manslaughter, required proof of different elements. The first required proof of
bodily harm and the second required proof of the death of the baby. Clearly
there was an insufficient legal nexus to apply the rule against multiple
convictions in that case.

 

38.              This
case is completely different. Only one factual assault has occurred for which
the appellant has been tried and punished. The potential imposition of a one‑year
imprisonment pursuant to a ""trial"" by the tribunal clearly points to
this procedure as being in the nature of punishment to redress a social wrong
and not only in the nature of disciplinary proceedings. The possibility of
dismissal from the Force pursuant to s. 38 of the statute reinforces this view.
With respect, I cannot agree with the view of Wilson J. that the two offences
are in any way totally separate from or different from each other.

 

39.              The
test must be the practical one of determining whether the first court upon
registering a conviction was performing a task assigned by Parliament which by
the scale of punishment available to the tribunal is readily recognizable as a
process in which the general public's interest in the administration of
criminal law is recognized over and above the limited interest of internal
discipline.

 

40.              For
the reasons given above it is my view that this test is met in this case. The
subsequent proceeding under s. 245(1)  of the Criminal Code  falls
squarely within the prohibition in s. 11 (h) of the Charter  that
any person "" ... finally found guilty and punished for the offence""
has the right "". . . not to be tried or punished for it again"".
Furthermore, a breach of s. 11 (h) rights cannot be justified by any
conceivable s. 1  reasonable limits analysis. In any case, the Crown here has
made no attempt to do so. The right to be tried and punished only once for an
offence cannot, in my view, be fettered or circumscribed by Parliament. I would
allow the appeal and answer the first constitutional question ""yes"",
and the second constitutional question ""no"".

on appeal from the court of appeal for the yukon
territory

 

 

                   Torts ‑‑ Negligence ‑‑
Volenti non fit injuria ‑‑ Passenger riding in car driven by driver
known by him to have been drinking ‑‑ Injuries sustained in
accident ‑‑ Whether or not defence of volenti non fit injuria
available.

 

                   Trial ‑‑ Charge to jury ‑‑
Allegation of negligence ‑‑ Defences of volenti non fit injuria and
contributory negligence ‑‑ Possibility of jury's being confused by
charge ‑‑ Whether or not new trial should be ordered.

 

                   Appellant, a passenger in a car driven by
respondent, was injured when it turned over. Both had been drinking the night
before and on the day of the accident, and it appeared that respondent had been
drinking in the car as a passenger. Respondent took over as driver when
appellant could not start the car after stopping to pick up two hitchhikers.
Appellant got into the car as a passenger after a short exchange in which
respondent asserted that he was capable of driving. The accident occurred
shortly thereafter. The car veered as respondent turned to speak to a
hitchhiker in the back seat. Appellant attempted to grab the wheel and
straighten out the car's course but his attempts eventually resulted in the
car's overturning.








 

                   At trial, the defences of volenti non fit injuria
and contributory negligence were put to the jury. This appeal was from a
judgment of the Yukon Court of Appeal, which found the charge to the jury to be
adequate and dismissed plaintiff's appeal from the jury's verdict barring his
negligence claim by operation of the volenti principle. The appeal also
concerned the appellate court's deference to a jury's verdict.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   Per Estey, McIntyre,
Chouinard and Le Dain JJ.: The defence of volenti requires not merely
plaintiff's knowledge of a risk but his express or necessarily implied
acceptance of the risk of harm without recourse to law, along with an inference
that defendant took no responsibility for plaintiff's safety. Volenti
requires an awareness of circumstance and consequences rarely present at the
relevant time in drunken driver‑willing passenger cases.

 

                   The charge to the jury here, while consistent with
the authorities, should have gone one step further and explained that a finding
must first be made on the facts as required to support the application of the volenti
principle. If the factual requirements of the volenti principle were
present in the view taken by the jury, that would be the end of the matter and
the remaining questions relating to contributory negligence need not be
answered except as a matter of completeness lest for some reason the finding of
volens be set aside in circumstances not requiring a new trial. The jury
should have been instructed to direct their minds to the contributory
negligence issue only after they had considered and rejected the volens
defence.

 

                   The manner in which the defences of volens
and of contributory negligence were put to the jury was confusing and
misleading as to the implications of a finding that the plaintiff absolved the
defendant. The charge to the jury as a whole failed to make clear the
extraordinary nature of the volenti defence by making explicit the
interaction of the questions about defendant's negligence and plaintiff's
contributory negligence while failing to mention the more drastic implications
of a finding of volenti.

 

                   Any confusion resulting from the charge was overcome
by the answers given by the jury to the questions put to them. There were no
ambiguities in their answers suggesting actual confusion. Although the series
of questions was not without ambiguity, it was not unreasonable to conclude
that the jurors approached contributory negligence as an alternative solution
to volenti. The jurors had before them a clearly worded question on volenti.
It would be improper, however confusing the charge might have been, for this
Court to assume that the jury misunderstood the meaning of the question in the
face of such clear wording.

 

                   A jury's verdict in civil proceedings is accorded
great deference by the courts. Although the verdict here is not one that every
jury would have reached, it does not have the character of unreasonableness
that must be apparent on the face of a jury verdict before an appellate court
can upset it. The paramount principle operating here is the duty of the court
to sustain the jury's disposition without judicial interference so long as it
is reasonable to do so.

 

                   Per Wilson J.: The
trial judge adequately instructed the jury on all issues that they were required
to deal with. Their answers to his clearly framed questions showed that they
fully understood the questions and they should therefore be treated as
definitive.

 

                   Neither the charge on the defences of volenti non
fit injuria and contributory negligence nor the language or format of the
questions put could have misled the jury. The charge effectively brought home
to the jury the stringent nature of the volenti defence and it conformed
to the principles laid down by the Court relating to that defence. Good trial
practice required that the jury deal with all the issues at trial even if a
finding of volenti were made, in the event that that finding be
overturned on appeal.

 

                   It was open to the jury on the evidence to reach the
conclusion it did on the volens issue. No complaint was made about the
trial judge's charge or about the clarity of the jury's answers at any stage in
the proceedings. The sole basis of the appeal to this Court, that the defence
of volenti was not available in a case involving negligence on the
highway, was without merit.

1.                Estey
J.‑‑This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of
Appeal for the Yukon Territory, dismissing the plaintiff's appeal from a jury
verdict barring his negligence claim by operation of the principle, volenti
non fit injuria. It also concerns the appellate court's defence to the
verdict of a jury. The appellant (plaintiff) and respondent (defendant), co‑workers
at a construction site, became acquainted shortly before the car accident,
giving rise to the action, occurred. The night before the accident, the parties
had participated in an evening of drinking and partying in Haines Junction, a
town close to the construction camp where both lived. The morning of the
accident, drinking was resumed early. The parties decided to retrieve the
respondent's car, which had become stuck on the way home the night before, and
then drive into Haines Junction to retrieve the appellant's eyeglasses and to
try to find two young women whom they had met the previous night. On their
arrival in Haines Junction, the appellant and respondent each consumed more
alcohol. They left the bar, found the two women, and drove them approximately
fifty or sixty miles toward Whitehorse at their request. Having dropped the
women off, the parties started back to Haines Junction. The appellant had been
driving throughout. The respondent, while a passenger, had apparently been
drinking beer in the car. At some point on the return trip, the parties passed
two hitchhikers, and decided to stop to pick them up. When the appellant tried
to start the car again, he was unable to do so, and the respondent got into the
driver's seat and started the car. At about this time, the appellant saw some
friends passing in another vehicle, and, when they stopped, went to talk to
them. He returned to the car and went to the driver's side, but the respondent
was still in the driver's seat. In a short exchange, the respondent said that
he was capable of driving. The appellant then got into the car as a passenger.

 

2.                The accident occurred very shortly
thereafter. The respondent, while driving, turned to speak to the hitchhiker
sitting in the back seat. As he did so, the car veered to the right. The
appellant, according to the testimony of the other hitchhiker who was seated on
the front seat between the appellant and the respondent, attempted to grab the
wheel and straighten out the car's course. The respondent's attempts at
correction resulted, eventually, in the car's overturning on the right‑hand
embankment, causing personal injuries to the appellant. Samples of the
respondent's breath later registered at .25 and .24 in tests administered by
the police. 

 

3.                At trial, without objection from the
parties, only two defences, volenti non fit injuria and contributory
negligence, were put to the jury. The trial judge, after summarizing the
evidence, charged the jury on the volenti defence as follows:

 

                   One of
the defences of the defendant in this case is the maxim volenti non fit
injuria. Translated, that means ""to one who is willing no harm is
done"".

 

                   The
burden is on the defendant, in each case, to prove that the plaintiff,
expressly or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from
liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff, occasioned by the
defendant's negligence. In every case, the question is whether the plaintiff
gave an express or implied consent to accept or assume the risk without
compensation. In other words, did the plaintiff really consent to absolve the
defendant from his common‑law duty of care, saying or implying, in
effect, ""I am prepared to take the risk of your negligence and if I am
injured you will not be legally responsible for my damages."" The question
is not simply whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, but whether the
circumstances were such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that the whole
risk was intentionally incurred by the plaintiff.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   If you
find that there is evidence of an initial common design which would, as a
matter of common sense, entail the risk of injury, you might think that the appropriate
inference may be not that the defendant undertook to exercise due care
throughout, but that the plaintiff agreed to take upon himself the obvious risk
of harm. The burden lies upon the defendant of proving that the plaintiff,
expressly or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from
liability.

 

                   Therefore,
your test is not simply whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, but whether the
circumstances are such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that the whole
risk was voluntarily incurred by the plaintiff.

 

Immediately after his discussion of the volenti defence, the
trial judge said:

 

                   Having
earlier discussed negligence [which was done in an earlier general part of the
charge just before volenti was discussed], I want to turn to the allied
and associated matter of contributory negligence.

 

                                                                    ...

 

If you are satisfied by a
preponderance of evidence that Dube's conduct amounted to a breach of that duty
to take reasonable care for his own safety, then you would be justified in
ascribing to him a portion of the blame for his injuries....

 

The judge charged the jury that contributory negligence could arise in
two ways, ""firstly, from the plaintiff's active conduct in grasping the
steering wheel ...; secondly, you may find that the plaintiff was negligent
about his own safety, when he remained in the vehicle after the defendant took
over the driving, knowing what he knew of the defendant's condition at that
time"". He went on:

 

                   Now, if
you find that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant in the first
place, then you need not bother considering contributory negligence. However,
if you find that there was negligence on the part of the defendant, then you must
consider whether the defendant has proved contributory negligence, of either of
the two forms which I have mentioned, on the part of the plaintiff.

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

In contrast, no mention was made of the relationship between the two
routes, or defences, open to the jury.

 

4.                The jury was then requested to answer a
number of questions. These questions, and the answers given, are as follows:

 

1.                Was
there negligence on the part of the Defendant Robert Labar which caused or
contributed to the damage suffered by the Plaintiff in the accident?

 

                   Answer:
Yes.

 

2.                If
your answer to question No. 1 is ""yes"", of what did such negligence
consist?

 

                   Answer:

 

                   a) Labar
was operating a vehicle while impaired.

 

                   b) Labar
failed to maintain proper control of his vehicle.

 

                   c) Labar
failed to operate his vehicle with proper care when he turned to converse with
his passengers.

 

3.                Did
the Plaintiff Gregory Dube expressly or impliedly absolve the Defendant Robert
Labar from liability for negligence?

 

                   Answer:
Yes.

 

4.                If
your answer to question No. 3 is ""yes"" of what did such absolution
consist?

 

                   Answer:
By willingly assuming the role of passenger in the Labar vehicle with Labar as
the operator while knowing his state of impairment.

 

5.                Was
there negligence on the part of the Plaintiff Gregory Dube which caused or
contributed to the damage suffered by him?

 

                   Answer:
Yes.

 

6.                If
your answer to question No. 5 is ""yes"", of what did such negligence
consist?

 

                   Answer:
Dube's touching, grabbing or attempting to touch or grab the steering wheel was
a contributing factor.

 

7.                If
your answer to question No. 1 is ""yes"" and your answer to question
No. 5 is ""yes"", state in percentages the degree of fault or
negligence attributable to each:

 

                   Defendant
Robert Labar:   75%

 

                          Plaintiff
Gregory Dube:   25%

                   TOTAL: 
100%

 

8.                Disregarding
the apportionment of negligence you have made in response to question No. 7
above, at what amount, if any, do you assess the damages sustained by the
Plaintiff Gregory Dube under the following heads of damage?

 

                   (a) 
For pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life from the date of the accident
to date and  in future?                     $ 5,000

 

                   (b) 
For loss of income from the date of the accident until
today?                                                                              
15,000

 

                   (c) 
For loss of prospective earnings from this date
forward?                                                                                                      0

 

                         
TOTAL             $20,000

 

These damages were reduced to $15,000 to account for the plaintiff's
contributory negligence. However, because the jury had answered the third
question affirmatively, the plaintiff's action was dismissed. An appeal to the
Yukon Court of Appeal was also dismissed. Taggart J.A., writing for the Court
of Appeal, stated in part:

 

It seems to me, given the
very clear and accurate charge of the judge, the answer given by the jury to
question 3 must be taken to mean that the plaintiff had impliedly absolved the
defendant from liability for negligence and had done so having regard for their
answer to question 4, by willingly assuming the role of passenger in the
vehicle driven by the defendant at a time when he knew of the defendant's
incapacity to drive.

 

                                                                    ...

 

I think it was open to the
jury on the evidence to reach the conclusion they did on the issue of volens.
Being of that view I think that we ought not to interfere. 

 

 

 

5.                       The plaintiff's appeal to this
Court was argued on the basis that the defence of volenti is
inapplicable to a case involving negligence on the highways. This submission is
plainly inconsistent with four decisions of this Court: Car & General
Insurance Corp. v. Seymour, [1956] S.C.R. 322, Miller v. Decker,
[1957] S.C.R. 624, Lehnert v. Stein, [1963] S.C.R. 38, and Eid v.
Dumas, [1969] S.C.R. 668. However, while acknowledging that volenti
is in principle available to a defendant driver, these cases establish that the
defence will only be made out in unusual circumstances. The test has been
variously described. In the Seymour case, supra, Rand J. wrote,
at p. 324:

 

In such commitments the
question ought, I think, rather to be, can the defendant reasonably be heard to
say, as an inference from the facts, that the risk of injury from his own
misconduct was required by him to be and was accepted by the complainant as
such a term [of the undertaking]?

 

Rand J. conceived of volenti as a bilateral 

""exchange of terms"" governing the activity in which the
parties were engaged. Abbott J., dissenting in the Miller case, supra,
accurately paraphrased (at p. 626) the test set out by Kellock J. in Seymour,
supra, (at p. 332):

 

...for a negligent driver
to be completely relieved from liability, the plaintiff must have agreed
expressly or by implication to exempt the defendant from liability for damages
suffered by the plaintiff and occasioned by the negligence of the defendant
during the carrying out of the latter's undertaking. In other words, to
constitute a defence there must have been an express or implied bargain between
the parties whereby the plaintiff gave up his right of action for negligence.
As was pointed out by Kellock J. at p. 331, the question in each particular
case is, in the language of Lindley L.J. in Yarmouth v. France ((1887),
19 Q.B.D. 647 at 660), ""not simply whether the plaintiff knew of the risk,
but whether the circumstances are such as necessarily to lead to the
conclusion that the whole risk was voluntarily incurred by the plaintiff"".

 

Finally, in Lehnert v. Stein, supra, Cartwright J. (as he
then was) held (at p. 43) that:

 

...where a driver of a
motor vehicle invokes the maxim volenti non fit injuria as a defence to
an action for damages for injuries caused by his negligence to a passenger, the
burden lies upon the defendant of proving that the plaintiff, expressly or by
necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from liability for any
damage suffered by the plaintiff occasioned by that negligence, and that, as
stated in Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., p. 44:

 

The true question in every
case is: Did the plaintiff give a real consent to the assumption of the risk
without compensation; did the consent really absolve the defendant from the
duty to take care?

 

6.                Thus, volenti will arise only
where the circumstances are such that it is clear that the plaintiff, knowing
of the virtually certain risk of harm, in essence bargained away his right to
sue for injuries incurred as a result of any negligence on the defendant's
part. The acceptance of risk may be express or may arise by necessary
implication from the conduct of the parties, but it will arise, in cases such
as the present, only where there can truly be said to be an understanding on
the part of both parties that the defendant assumed no responsibility to take
due care for the safety of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff did not expect
him to. 

 

7.                Common sense dictates that only rarely
will a plaintiff genuinely consent to accept the risk of the defendant's
negligence. Glanville Williams wrote in Joint Torts and Contributory
Negligence (1951), at pp. 307‑08, that

 

the defence must be
restrictively construed and...rarely applies in negligence actions. In almost
every negligence action of modern times where the defence of volens has
been raised it has failed. This is because the cases in which a person truly
consents to run the risk of another's negligence are altogether exceptional.

 

He then drew the following conclusions as to the nature of the defence,
which were expressly adopted by this Court in Lehnert v. Stein, supra,
and in Eid v. Dumas, supra:

 

                   It is
submitted that the key to an understanding of the true scope of the volens
maxim lies in drawing a distinction between what may be called physical and
legal risk. Physical risk is the risk of damage in fact; legal risk is the risk
of damage in fact for which there will be no redress in law.... To put
this in general terms, the defence of volens does not apply where as a
result of a mental process the plaintiff decides to take a chance but there is
nothing in his conduct to show a waiver of the right of action communicated to
the other party. To constitute a defence, there must have been an express or
implied bargain between the parties whereby the plaintiff gave up his right of
action for negligence.

 

8.                The example given by Glanville Williams,
supra, at p. 308, of a person who, knowing that road traffic accidents
regularly occur, nevertheless decides to go for a walk along a roadside and
thereby runs the risk that he may be run down, illustrates the nature of the
distinction. That person could not reasonably be seen to have assumed the risk
in the manner required to support the defence of volenti. To permit the
defence to succeed on facts showing merely that the plaintiff knew of the risk
and yet chose to undergo it is inconsistent with the decisions of this Court, supra,
which require not merely knowledge, but express or necessarily implied
acceptance of the risk of harm without recourse to law by the plaintiff, along
with an inference that the defendant, for his part, took no responsibility for
the plaintiff's safety.

 

9.                The defence of volenti will,
furthermore, necessarily be inapplicable in the great majority of drunken
driver‑willing passenger cases. It requires an awareness of the
circumstances and the consequences of action that are rarely present on the
facts of such cases at the relevant time.

 

10.              The charge of the learned trial judge, on
the law of volens, was consistent with the authorities in our Court as
noted above. In my view, however, the instructions to the jury should have gone
one step further. The learned trial judge ought to have explained to the jury
that a finding must first be made on the facts as required to support the
application of the volenti principle. If the factual requirements of the
volenti principle are present in the view taken by the jury, that is the
end of the matter and the remaining questions relating to contributory
negligence need not in that event be answered except as a matter of
completeness lest for some reason the finding of a volens might be set
aside in circumstances not requiring a new trial. All this should have been
explained to the jury. The jury should have been instructed to direct their
minds to the contributory negligence issue only after they had considered and
rejected the volens defence. Without such a direction the charge failed
to make clear the consequences of a finding of volenti.

 

11.              I consider, with all respect to those who
have held otherwise, that in this case the manner in which the two defences
were put to the jury was misleading and confusing as to the implications of a
finding that the plaintiff had absolved the defendant. The portion of the
charge relating to volenti, although closely modelled, as the Court of
Appeal noted, on the language of Cartwright J. in Lehnert, supra,
must be considered in context. When so viewed, it can be seen that the jury
could easily have been confused as to the relationship between the two
defences, volenti and contributory negligence, and their relative
effects on the outcome of the action. 

 

12.              Prior to the enactment of legislation
allowing for apportionment of damages in cases where the plaintiff's own
negligence had contributed to his injuries (here, the Contributory
Negligence Ordinance, R.O.Y.T., c. C‑14), drawing a distinction
between the defences of volenti and contributory negligence was
unnecessary. Both had the same drastic effect of denying completely
compensation to the plaintiff. This is no longer the case. Apportionment
permits a sensible distribution of the financial burden of negligent conduct.
It is a more flexible and more appropriate response in the great majority of
cases in which negligent conduct of the plaintiff is argued to support a volenti
defence. Thus, it is of great importance to keep the two defences distinct (see
Salmond and Heuston on the Law of Torts (18th ed. 1981), at pp. 472‑73,
Glanville Williams, supra, at p. 308).

 

13.              Primarily, the nature of the volenti
defence was obscured by two aspects of the charge. First, there is the fact
that the trial judge passed quickly over the defence of volenti to the
defence of contributory negligence, using the words ""allied and associate
matter"" in such a way that the jury could have thought he was referring to
a relationship between the defences. Secondly, he instructed the jury that (as
has already been noted in another context above):

 

... if you find that there
was negligence on the part of the defendant, then you must consider
whether the defendant has proved contributory negligence ....

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

The impression given by these words is that the only circumstances in
which the plaintiff's failure to take due care for his own safety would not
affect the outcome of the action are those in which the defendant's own conduct
conformed to the standard expected of him by the law of negligence. In fact, of
course, there was another set of circumstances in which the plaintiff's
contributory negligence could have no effect on the outcome; that is, if the
jury finds the plaintiff has assumed the risk of the defendant's negligence
under the volenti rule. By making explicit the interaction of two of the
questions put to the jury (namely, the questions of the defendant's negligence
and the plaintiff's contributory negligence), but failing to mention the much
more drastic implications of a finding of volenti, the charge to the
jury as a whole failed to make clear the extraordinary nature of the volenti
defence. Further confusion could have resulted from the fact that the same
evidence, showing that the appellant willingly assumed the role of passenger while
knowing of the respondent's state of impairment, was put to the jury as support
for both defences with no instructions as to the distinction between them. 

                   

14.              Any confusion which might in this case
have resulted from the charge, however, must be considered to have been
overcome by the answers given by the jury to the questions put to them. There
are no ambiguities suggesting actual confusion in the language used by the jury
in their answers. The series of questions is not itself without some ambiguity,
as without a qualification such as is found in the first phrase of question
eight, they may be read as defining one problem with one solution rather than
one problem with two, inconsistent, solutions. However, it is not unreasonable
to conclude that the jurors may indeed have approached contributory negligence
as an alternative solution to that afforded by their answer on the issue of volenti.
Since no claim was made by the defendant against the plaintiff, the jury was
not concerned in answering any question with a finding of the plaintiff's
liability. It must be borne in mind that the jurors had present before them a
clearly worded question on volenti which expressly asked whether the
plaintiff had, by any conduct on his part, absolved the defendant from
liability for negligence. It would be improper, however confusing the judge's
charge might have been, for this Court to assume that the jury misunderstood
the meaning of question number three in the face of such clear wording. Questions
five through eight were surplus, given the answer to questions three and four,
and it is reasonable to conclude that the jury so understood them.

 

 15.             At the outset it was observed that the
courts accord a jury verdict rendered in civil proceedings with great
deference. With reference to a special verdict, it was said some time ago in
this Court, ""We also fully agree that answers by a jury to questions
should be given the fullest possible effect, and, if it is possible to support
the same by any reasonable construction, they should be supported"", per
Nesbitt J. in Jamieson v. Harris (1905), 35 S.C.R. 625, at p. 631.
Spence J. in McLoughlin v. Kutasy, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 311, wrote at p. 314:
""Every effort must be exerted to understand and give a reasonable
construction to the jury's answers remembering that jurors `are laymen who are
not accustomed to state matters with the particularity and clarity which more
trained men might exhibit' "". See also Grinnell Co. of Canada Ltd.
v. Warren, [1937] S.C.R. 353, and Pronek v. Winnipeg, Selkirk and Lake
Winnipeg Railway Co., [1933] A.C. 61.

 

16.              The jury's conclusion that the plaintiff
consented to bear the legal risk when he entered the car as passenger, knowing
of the defendant's state of impairment, is doubtless one that not every jury
would have reached. It does not have the character of unreasonableness,
however, that must be apparent on the face of a jury verdict before an
appellate court can upset it: Vancouver‑Fraser Park District v.
Olmstead, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 831, McCannell v. McLean, [1937] S.C.R.
341. This case is rather of the sort considered in Scotland v. Canadian
Cartridge Co. (1919), 59 S.C.R. 471, where Sir Louis Davies C.J. wrote at
p. 477:

 

                   I say
on this main and controlling issue I would as a juryman probably have found
against the plaintiff. But that is not my province. I have only to determine
whether in the conflict of evidence we have before us in this case, scientific
and practical, we find enough to justify reasonable men in reaching the
conclusion these jurymen did. After much consideration and thought I have
reached the conclusion, though not without much doubt, that there is such
evidence in the record and that I ought not, in view of the extreme
jurisdiction which juries are permitted to have over questions of fact, to set
aside their findings on mere doubts I may entertain or on my reaching on the
reading of the evidence a conclusion different from that the jury reached.

 

17.              The paramount principle here operating is
the duty residing in the court to sustain, so long as it be reasonable to do
so, the jury's disposition of the issues without judicial intervention. The
court is concerned, of course, at all times, with providing ultimate justice
consistent with the principles of the law. Here, two routes lie open to a
reviewing tribunal but in the selection of the appropriate route the paramount
principle of support of a jury verdict governs. Despite, therefore, the
potential of the jury charge to confuse, this appeal must be dismissed. It is
not apparent from their answers to the questions put that the jury members were
in fact, when in the throes of ultimate disposition of the issue, confused, nor
is their conclusion on the vital issue of volenti so unreasonable as to
justify its reversal by an appellate court.

 

18.              I therefore would dismiss the appeal with
costs to the respondent.

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

19.              Wilson
J.‑‑The facts of this case and its history in the courts
below are fully dealt with in the reasons of my colleague, Estey J., and it is
not necessary for me to repeat them here. I agree that the appeal should be
dismissed but am not fully in agreement with my colleague's reasons.

 

20.              I would respectfully support the unanimous
conclusion of the Court of Appeal for the Yukon Territory that the trial judge
properly instructed the jury in this case. I do not believe that the judge's
instruction on the defences of volenti non fit injuria and contributory
negligence misled or confused the jury. And I can see no basis on which to
conclude that the language or format of the written questions put to the
members of the jury would have caused any confusion in their minds. In my view,
the judge adequately instructed the jury on all the issues they were required
to deal with. He put clearly framed questions before them and received very
clear answers. I think their answers showed that they fully understood the
questions and I believe therefore that their answers should be treated as definitive.

 

21.              My colleague considers that the fact that
the judge's instruction on volenti was followed by an instruction on
contributory negligence would have confused the jury and made it appear that
these defences were interrelated. In this connection it should be noted that at
the end of the part of his charge dealing with the defence of volenti
the judge stated:

 

                   Having
earlier discussed negligence, I want to turn to the allied and associated
matter of contributory negligence.

 

It seems to me that the jury would have understood the judge to be
saying that contributory negligence was ""allied and associated"" with
negligence not with volenti. The judge was quite properly dealing one
after the other with the two defences put forward by the defendant.

 

22.              I believe that the judge's charge was
effective in bringing home to the jury the stringent nature of the volenti
defence. It conforms to the principles laid down by this Court. Indeed, it
parallels the language used by Cartwright J. (as he then was) in Lehnert v.
Stein, [1963] S.C.R. 38, at p. 43, which appears to have been consistently
followed in the courts below. I can find no error in it. The trial judge
emphasized in several places that it was not enough for the jury to find that
the plaintiff had voluntary assumed the risk of harm. They had to go on and
determine whether or not the plaintiff had agreed to absolve the defendant
either expressly or by necessary implication from any liability for negligence.
I believe this is a correct statement of the law as it currently stands. I
quote the relevant passage from the judge's charge:

 

                   The
burden is on the defendant, in each case, to prove that the plaintiff,
expressly or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from
liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff, occasioned by the
defendant's negligence. In every case, the question is whether the plaintiff
gave an express or implied consent to accept or assume the risk without
compensation. In other words, did the plaintiff really consent to absolve the
defendant from his common‑law duty of care, saying or implying, in
effect, ""I am prepared to take the risk of your negligence and if I am
injured you will not be legally responsible for my damages."" The question
is not simply whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, but whether the
circumstances were such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that the whole
risk was intentionally incurred by the plaintiff.

 

23.              My colleague is of the view that the trial
judge should have instructed the jury that a finding of volenti made it
unnecessary for it to answer the question concerning contributory negligence.
The difficulty with this is that if the defence of volenti were to be
rejected on appeal it would be necessary in order to avoid another trial to
have the jury's answer on the alternate defence of contributory negligence. It
seems to me to be good trial practice to have the jury deal with all the issues
at trial in case their finding on a specific issue is overturned on appeal. The
classic example is the jury's assessment of damages even although they have
made a finding of no liability.

 

24.              I agree, of course, that the judge might
have prefaced question 5 with the words ""If your answer to question 3 is
`no' ..."" but his failure to do does not in my view vitiate the jury's
answer to the question. The legal effect of its answer to question 3 was
determinative of the plaintiff's claim.

 

25.              I agree with the unanimous conclusion of
the Court of Appeal that it was open to the jury on the evidence to reach the
conclusion it did on the volens issue. That being so, the Court of
Appeal was, in my view, correct in refusing to interfere. No complaint has been
made about the charge at any stage of the proceedings; nor has counsel at any
stage alleged that the jury's answers were ambiguous or gave rise to any
uncertainty. The sole basis of the plaintiff's appeal to this Court was that
the defence of volenti is unavailable in a case involving negligence on
the highway. I agree with my colleague that this submission is without merit.

 

26.              For these reasons I would dismiss the
appeal with costs.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

 

                          Criminal
law‑‑Obscenity‑‑Accused charted with making obscene
publication‑‑Charge brought because of obscene photograph taken by
accused‑‑No evidence of publication or intention to publish‑‑Whether
including of word “publication” in charge an essential averment or mere
surplusage‑‑Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 15991)(a),
(8).

 

                   Appellant
was charged under s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  in that he
""unlawfully did make an obscene publication, to wit: a photograph of an
act of gross indecency"". There was evidence at the preliminary hearing to
support findings that the photograph was taken by the appellant and that the
photograph was obscene, but none as to an intention to publish it. The
committing magistrate decided that the word ""publication"" in the
charge was surplusage. An order for certiorari to quash the committal, granted
in the Supreme Court of Ontario, was set aside on appeal. At issue here was
whether an intent to publish an obscene photograph was an essential ingredient
for conviction of the accused under the charge as framed. Argument also centred
on the applicability of the test for obscenity under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

                   Held:
The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   The
test of obscenity laid down in s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  should
apply to the issue of obscenity in charges under the Criminal Code , whether
based on publication or not.

 

                   Section
159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  creates a number of offences which
are separate and apart. One of these offences, the making of an obscene
photograph, does not involve any necessary element of publication.

 

                   The
word ""publication"" introduced an element of publication into the
indictment. To be given any meaning the indictment as framed must have
encompassed something more than the mere making of a photograph. The surplusage
rule--that words in the indictment are said to be surplus in the sense that
they need not be proved in order to prove conviction--was inapplicable here in
that it would prejudice the accused.

 

                   The
accused could well have concluded that evidence of an intent to publish or
evidence of actual publication would form a necessary part of the Crown's case.
Although it might be possible to conclude, on a detailed analysis of the
meanings to be attributed to the word ""publication"" used in this
context, that neither an intent to publish nor an actual publication was
involved the accused should not be confronted with this sort of exercise in
making his response to a criminal charge.

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 503, 39
O.R. (2d) 571, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Osler J. allowing an
application to quash an order of Nadeau Prov. Ct. J. for committal to trial.
Appeal allowed.

 

                   Patrick
S. Duffy, Q.C., for the appellant.

 

                   Susan
Ficek, for the respondent.

 

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                       McIntyre
J.‑‑The principal question with which this
appeal is concerned is whether an intent to publish an obscene photograph is an
essential element for the conviction of a person charged, under s. 159(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code , that he ""unlawfully did make an obscene
publication, to wit: a photograph of an act of gross indecency"".

 

 

2.                       A commercial film developer
delivered to the police a series of photographs which it had received for
development. One of the photographs was the basis for the charge in this case.
The Crown elected to proceed by indictment. The appellant elected trial by
judge alone and a preliminary hearing was held.

 

 

3.                At the preliminary hearing there was
evidence from which a properly instructed jury could find that the photograph
was taken by the appellant and that it was itself of such nature that it
afforded evidence of obscenity. There was, however, no evidence of any
intention to publish the photograph. The committing magistrate committed for trial
despite the absence of such evidence. He concluded that the word
""publication"" in the charge was surplusage‑‑a non‑allegation‑‑which
did not form an essential ingredient of the charge.

 

 

4.                An application was made before Osler J.
in the Supreme Court of Ontario for certiorari to quash the committal
(reported at (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 289). The motion succeeded. Osler J. was of
the view that evidence of an intent to publish was a necessary element for the
proof of the charge and that to commit for trial in the absence of such
evidence was an excess of jurisdiction. This ruling, given his view of the
elements of the charge against the accused, was consistent with the majority
judgment in this Court in Skogman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93.

 

 

5.                The Crown appeal to the Court of Appeal
(Howland C.J.O., Brooke and Cory JJ.A.) was allowed with Brooke J.A. dissenting
(reported at (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 503). Howland C.J.O., for the majority,
reviewed the authorities dealing with the construction of s. 159 and its
predecessors. He came to the conclusion that publication was not an essential
element of the charge. The word ""publication"" where used in the
charge was, in his view, surplusage. He was also of the view that on a
construction of s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  a separate
offence of making an obscene photograph had been created. A conviction could be
obtained therefore in the absence of evidence of an intent to publish. There
was then evidence before the committing magistrate which would justify a
committal and the committal order was restored. The majority was also of the
view that the test for obscenity to be applied in cases under s. 159(1)(a)
of the Code should be that set out in s. 159(8)  whether publication was
involved or not. This displaced the common law test of obscenity laid down by
Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, at p. 371.
Brooke J.A. (in dissent) expressed the view that, given the construction of s.
159  in its complete context, publication is an element in the commission of an
offence under s. 159(1) (a). He would have upheld the reviewing court's
order to quash. In this Court the argument centred on the question of
publication and on the applicability of the test for obscenity under
s. 159(8) .

 

 

6.                The leading case on the interpretation
of s. 159(8) of the Code is Dechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
951. Dechow arose out of the prosecution of a sex shop operator under s.
159(1)(a) of the Code. There the appellant was charged that he: 

 

 

...unlawfully did have in
his possession, for the purpose of distribution, obscene materials consisting
of written matter, pictures, models, preparations, tape recordings, and other
devices, equipment and paraphernalia.

 

 

The appellant was convicted and the conviction was
upheld on a trial de novo. An appeal was taken to the Ontario Court of
Appeal on the question of whether the obscenity test laid down in s. 159(8)  of
the Criminal Code  applied to the articles which were the subject matter
of the case. The appellant's appeal was dismissed. The appellant appealed to
this Court upon the following question of law:

 

 

Did the Court of Appeal
err in holding that s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  applied to the articles
found by the trial judge to be obscene and that consequently the trial judge
did not err in holding that s. 159(8)  provided the sole test of obscenity in respect
of those articles?

 

 

Ritchie J., speaking for the majority of the Court
(Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.) held that the
meaning of the word ""publication"" where it appears in s. 159(8)  must
be determined not from the verb ""to publish"" but from the noun itself
meaning ""that which is published"". However, the manner in which the
offending articles were displayed in the shop when taken together with the
printed descriptions attached to the articles constituted an element of
publication. This would qualify the objects as publications within the meaning
of s. 159(8) of the Code. It followed that the test set out in the
subsection would apply. No question of the appli‑ cability of the Hicklin
rule arose. Ritchie J. concluded his judgment, however, by saying, at p. 968:

 

 

...I do not find it
necessary to consider what test is to be applied in determining whether or not
matters other than publications are obscene.

 

 

7.                Laskin C.J., for the minority (the Chief
Justice and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ.), did not regard the offending
articles as publications. He nevertheless concluded that the test in s. 159(8) 
should be applied in considering the question of obscenity. The Chief Justice
expressed the view that where the Criminal Code  had provided the
definitive test of obscenity which displaced the common law Hicklin
test, then in the interests of consistency that test should be applied in all
cases of obscenity. He would have applied the s. 159(8)  test in obscenity cases
not involving publications. He said, at pp. 962‑63:

 

 

                   I am
not only satisfied to regard s. 159(8)  as prescribing an exhaustive test of
obscenity in respect of a publication which has sex as a theme or
characteristic but I am also of the opinion that this Court should apply that
test in respect of other provisions of the Code, such as ss. 163 and
164, in cases in which the allegation of obscenity revolves around sex
considerations. Since the view that I take, in line with that expressed by
Judson J. in the Brodie case, is that the Hicklin rule has been
displaced by s. 159(8)  in respect of publications, I would not bring it back
under any other sections of the Code, such as ss. 159, 163 and 164, to
provide a back‑up where a sexual theme or sexual factors are the basis
upon which obscenity charges are laid and the charges fail because the test
prescribed by s. 159(8)  has not been met. 

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   It is
reasonable for a Court to apply the statutory standard, prescribed by
Parliament as a definition of an offence of a generic character, when it is
called upon to determine, in allied provisions of the Criminal Code , the
sense in which the expression of some offence, made punishable in other
circumstances, should be taken. Where no constitutional considerations are
involved but only the interpretation and application of the words of
Parliament, the judicial approach should be in the direction of consistency of
meaning of the same word used by Parliament where that word is a designation of
an offence which is a distributive one by reason of the specification of
different situations in which it may be committed. So it is with obscenity in
the various provisions of the Code under which it is an offence. If the
issue under any of those provisions is sexual exploitation, either alone or in
association with any of the subjects mentioned in s. 159(8) , then I think it
the proper course for this Court to apply in all such cases the standard or
test that s. 159(8)  prescribes for publications.

 

 

In my view, Laskin C.J. was not in conflict with the
majority on this point. The majority had clearly left the question open. As has
been pointed out, Howland C.J.O., for the majority in the Court of Appeal,
adopted the reasons of Lasking C.J. in Dechow and applied the s. 159(8) 
test. He said, at p. 513:

 

 

                   I am in
agreement with the above view expressed by Laskin C.J.C. that the test of
obscenity to be applied in the case of offences under s. 159(1) (a),
where no publication is involved, should be the same as the test prescribed
under s. 159(8)  in respect of publications. This would appear to be the proper
course to follow in the interests of consistency. There is no justification for
applying a different test of obscenity for non‑publication offences.

 

 

It is my view that he was right in law to do so. In my
opinion, the test of obscenity laid down in s. 159(8)  should apply to the
issue of obscenity in charges under the Criminal Code  whether based on
publication or not. For the reasons outlined by Laskin C.J. in Dechow,
the Hicklin test is no longer applicable in Canada in such cases.

 

 

8.                Turning now to the case at bar, s.
159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  provides:

 

 

                   159. (1) Every one commits an offence who

 

(a) makes, prints,
publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of
publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture,
model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or

 

 

This section creates a number of offences, one of which,
that of making an obscene picture, is said to be the subject of this charge. It
is an offence which is separate and distinct from the other offences there
mentioned and it involves no necessary element of publication. The various
offences are separated by commas and one does violence to no rule of
construction in recognizing them as separate concepts. I am in agreement with
Howland C.J.O. in this respect. After discussing various authorities, such as R.
v. Munster (1960), 34 C.R. 47; R. v. Modenese (1962), 38 C.R. 45; Brodie
v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681; R. v. Schell (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d)
342; R. v. McCormick, York Co. Ct. (Ont.), Ferguson Co. Ct. J., Jan. 10,
1980, unreported, and Dechow v. The Queen, supra, he said, at p.
515: 

 

 

                   There
are no dicta in the Dechow case to suggest that publication is a
prerequisite to every offence under s. 159(1) (a). On the contrary, both
the reasons of the majority and the minority recognize the need to consider the
test for obscenity in cases of non‑publications. The majority also
recognized that s. 159(8)  only applied to publications. Furthermore, some of
the offences included in s. 159(1) (a) such as ""possession for the
purpose of publication, distribution or circulation"" relate to a point of
time before publication has occurred.

 

 

9.                The real question raised in this case
then is not whether there is a separate offence of making an obscene article,
but whether the Crown in framing the indictment in this case has alleged the
separate offence of making an obscene publication. The committing judge and the
majority in the Court of Appeal considered the word ""publication"" in
the indictment could be disregarded as mere surplusage. This approach left a
simple charge of making an obscene photograph on which there was evidence which
would warrant a committal.

 

 

10.              The surplusage rule‑‑by which
a word or words in an indictment are said to be surplus in the sense that they
need not be proved in order to procure a conviction‑‑may not be
applied where it would prejudice an accused. This matter was recently canvassed
in this Court in Vézina and Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2, where
Lamer J., speaking for the unanimous Court, reviewed the authorities on the
question. He commenced his discussion with the statement, at p. 26:

 

 

                   Similarly,
the ""surplusage rule"", which as noted above, is the converse of s.
510(3), must also be seen as subject to the proviso that the accused not be
prejudiced in his or her defence.

 

 

Then after reviewing the apposite authorities he
concluded, by saying, at p. 28:

 

 

                   In
summary, the early Canadian cases on the ""surplusage rule"", e.g.
R. v. Coote (1903), 8 C.C.C. 199 (B.C.S.C.), do not specifically mention
the issue of prejudice, but many of the more recent cases, specifically those
noted above, expressly and repeatedly underline the issue of prejudice.
Prejudice to the accused is in my view, a clear limitation to the invocation of
the ""surplusage rule"". 

 

 

11.              It remains now to consider whether the
treatment as surplusage of the word ""publication"" in the indictment before
the Court would cause prejudice to the accused appellant. The word
""publication"", as used in the indictment, is capable of two differing
meanings. It could have the meaning ascribed to the noun
""publication"", that is, ""that which is published"", or it
could have the meaning of the verb ""to publish"". In either case an
element of publication is introduced into the indictment. This being so, can it
be said that the Crown has alleged the separate offence of making an obscene
photograph? If the answer is ""yes"", the word ""publication""
must be disregarded. If the word is to be given any meaning, then something
more than the mere making of an obscene photograph has been alleged. The
accused could well have concluded that evidence of an intent to publish or evidence
of actual publication would form a necessary part of the Crown's case. A
finding that the word is largely surplus would surely prejudice an accused who
had committed himself to a defence against an allegation involving publication.
It may be possible on a detailed analysis of the meanings which could be
attributed to the word ""publication"" in this context to conclude that
no intent to publish or no actual publication is involved. This is not,
however, the sort of exercise which should confront an accused in making his
response to a criminal charge.

 

 

12.              It is, therefore, my opinion that on the
indictment as framed, evidence was required of publication or an intent to
publish. The committal without such evidence cannot be sustained on the basis
of the majority decision of this Court in Skogman, supra. I would
therefore allow the appeal and restore the order of Osler J. quashing the
committal.

 

 

13.              Before leaving this case, I would observe
that the Crown was faced with a genuine dilemma in framing its indictment. The
offence alleged is found in s. 159  of the Criminal Code . This section,
in its various subsections, creates several offences relating to obscene
objects. Some of them involve publication or some element of public exposure,
others do not. The only definition of obscenity is in subs. (8). It refers only
to publications. There is then no statutory provision defining obscenity
applicable to non‑published material.

 

 

14.              The Crown in framing its indictment
attempted to apply the section by characterizing the offending object as a
publication‑‑presumably, to invoke the definition of obscenity in
subs. (8)‑‑and described the offending object as a photograph. This
approach led to the confusion which could have confronted the accused and which
has led to the allowance of this appeal. The Crown's approach to this matter,
in view of the wording of the section, may be understandable. The difficulty it
creates, however, should not be visited upon the accused. Section 159  of the Criminal
Code , by limiting the statutory definition of obscenity to publications,
creates on its face a problem which, in my view, has been solved or at least
accommodated in Dechow, supra. Its effect is to apply the
definition of obscenity in s. 159(8) of the Code wherever the word is
employed in the Code, whether for publication or not. This obviates the
need for any use of the word ""publication"" in framing indictments
where no publication is alleged. In the absence of a statutory amendment, this
approach would give effect to s. 159 , as a whole, and in my view should be
adopted.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Directed verdict ‑‑
Charge of rape ‑‑ Sufficiency of identification evidence ‑‑
Complain­ant’s observations of assailant made in difficult conditions ‑‑
Improper police identification procedures ‑‑ Trial judge finding
identification evidence unreliable to convict ‑‑ Whether trial
judge erred in directing a verdict of acquittal ‑‑ Test for a
directed verdict.

 

                   The only issue raised at the accused's trial for
rape was identification. Complainant, the only witness with respect to this
issue, was attacked on a street shortly after midnight and dragged behind a
shed where she was sexually assaulted. The incident took approximately twenty
minutes. She testified that although it was dark behind the shed she was still
able to see her assailant's face. She described him to the police on three
different occasions with some minor variations. Two weeks after the attack, the
complainant took part in a courtroom identification. She reacted visibly when
she saw the accused and told the police that he looked like her assailant, but
she was not sure because her view was obstructed by a sheriff. On a second
courtroom identification two days later, she positively identified the accused
as her assailant. She did so again at the preliminary hearing and at the trial.
At the close of the Crown's case, the trial judge weighed and considered the
quality of the evidence and granted a motion for a directed verdict. The
majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new
trial. This appeal is to determine whether the trial judge erred in directing a
verdict of acquittal despite the fact that there was some evidence as to the
identification of the accused. 








 

                   Held (Lamer and La
Forest JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ.: In deciding whether to grant a motion for
a directed verdict, the trial judge must determine ""whether or not there
is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a
verdict of guilty"". A trial judge is not entitled to withdraw a case from
a jury where there is admissible evidence which could, if believed, result in a
conviction, notwithstanding the frailties of the evidence. It is not the trial
judge's function to weigh or consider the quality of the evidence. The weight
that should be given to evidence, like questions of credibility, are matters
for the jury only. In the case at bar, there was direct evidence of
identification and the case should have been left to the jury with a proper caution.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Wilson J.: The governing test in Canada for a directed verdict is ""whether
or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed
could return a verdict of guilty"". This test may be susceptible of more
than one interpretation, but an examination of its antecedents support the view
that at this stage of the trial, the basis on which a trial judge can withdraw
a case from the jury is extremely narrow. Although some cases suggest that the
trial judge can direct a verdict only where there is no evidence at all, the
words ""no evidence"", in this context, are not to be taken literally
as meaning a total absence of evidence but rather as meaning no evidence
capable of supporting a conviction.

 

                   In determining whether or not to direct a verdict in
cases which turn on eyewitness testimony, the trial judge should address his
mind to the factors going to the quality of the identification evidence and,
where the frailties in the evidence can be remedied by a caution, he should
leave the matter to the jury.

 

                   In the present case, the trial judge erred in law in
directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis solely of the quality of the
initial identification evidence. The substantial consistency in the
complainant's description of the accused given on three separate occasions
prior to any improper police procedures required him to put the evidence to the
jury with a caution as to the inherent frailty of the identification evidence,
coupled with an instruction to consider carefully the conditions under which
the identification is made. A jury is in just as good a position as the trial
judge to assess the witness' opportunity for observation and the strength of
his evidence based on that opportunity. 

 

                   The courtroom identification neither destroyed the
complainant's fairly reliable initial evidence nor weakened it beyond the point
where it could not be taken care of by a properly worded caution. The conduct
of the police line‑up, while irregular, was not so irregular by Canadian
standards as to be beyond the capabilities of a jury, properly directed, to
balance the overall strengths and weaknesses of her evidence against the
prejudicial impact of the improper identification process and the difficulties
inherent in the complainant's initial observation of her assailant.

 

                   Per Lamer and La
Forest JJ., dissenting: The test to be applied by a judge when deciding
a motion for a directed verdict is ""whether or not there is any evidence
upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of
guilty"". When assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial judge
cannot assess the witness' honesty which is a matter for the jury but may
assess the witness' capacity to be accurate and his resulting reliability.
Thus, when applied to testimonial evidence, the test involves an assessment by
the judge of the circumstances under which a witness makes his observations.
These circumstances may undermine the reliability of the witness' accuracy.

 

                   In the case at bar, the trial judge did not err in
directing a verdict of acquittal. It is clear from his reasons that he applied
the proper test and that he addressed his mind to an assessment of the quality
of the identification evidence. He found that the difficult conditions under
which the observations were made and the improper identification procedures of
the police‑‑procedures that could tend to induce the witness into
mistakenly identifying someone‑‑made it too dangerous to rest a
conviction on her testimony, honest as it might well have been.

 

                   The majority of the Court of Appeal found that it
would not have been unsafe to convict, while the dissenting judge shared the
trial judge's view. This did not raise a question of law alone in the Court of
Appeal, and the Crown's appeal should have been dismissed.

                   The reasons of Dickson C.J. and Wilson J. were
delivered by 

 

1.                Wilson
J.‑‑I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my
colleague, Lamer J. He would allow the appeal on the basis that the majority of
the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to interfere with the trial judge's
decision because no question of law arose. With respect, I have a different
view. I think two questions of law arose.

 

2.                The first question of law concerns the
test to be applied in determining when a case should be withdrawn from the jury
because of the quality of the identification evidence. Although there is a
considerable amount of jurisprudence on the test for a directed verdict, some
confusion has been generated by the use of different terms to describe what may
or may not be different tests. An examination of the existing authorities is, I
believe, helpful in eliciting the proper principles.

 

3.                The second question of law raised by the
trial judge's decision is when subsequent improper police procedures so impair
the quality of earlier identification evidence that the case should be
withdrawn from the jury. It would appear that the trial judge would have
directed the verdict on either of these grounds. However, he clearly felt that
the second ground reinforced his conclusion on the first and this is not
surprising since the two are obviously linked. It would seem that the weaker
the initial identification evidence the less impropriety it would take to
undermine it totally. The stronger the initial identification evidence the
higher the degree of subsequent impropriety it might take to undermine it.

 

1. The Courts Below

 

4.                There is some disagreement in the courts
below as to the basis on which the evidence was withheld from the jury. It is
clear that Wright J. at trial felt that the complainant's testimony met the
test of extreme insufficiency required for a directed verdict. What is unclear
is whether this was because of the potential for inaccuracy in the
complainant's initial observation of her assailant or because of the
irregularities in her subsequent identification of Mr. Mezzo as the accused.
Wright J. analyzed the problem before him in terms of the English Court of
Appeal's decision in R. v. Turnbull, [1976] 3 All E.R. 549. The key
passage from Wright J.'s reasons reads: 

 

I have concluded that
these facts fall squarely within the directions in Turnbull, approved by the
Alberta Court of Appeal, and even where there has been a proper or adequate
identity parade, require that the case be taken from the jury.

 

                   In the
present case there is the additional factor that I do not believe the
procedure followed by the police in the subsequent identification of the accused
by the complainant at the police station was proper and that fact has
further damaged the complainant's identification evidence.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

5.                There is nothing in Wright J.'s reasons
to indicate that he considered the possibility of counteracting the frailties
in the complainant's initial observation of her assailant with a strongly
worded caution to the jury. His failure to do so may have been due to the fact
that he collapsed the issue of the quality of the initial identification with
the issue of the effect of the improper police procedures. This seems to be the
interpretation favoured by Matas J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal
(1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 272. He expressed the view that Wright J. could not
possibly have decided to direct a verdict on the basis of the complainant's
initial identification evidence alone as that would be to take the principles
in Turnbull too far.

 

6.                With respect, I think Matas J.A. may be
wrong in his assessment of what the trial judge did. I think that the trial
judge in the passage already quoted from his reasons did decide that the
frailties of the initial identification evidence were reason enough for
directing a verdict. He specifically states that ""even where there has
been a proper or adequate identity parade"" the case must be taken from the
jury. However, he went on to find that the ""additional factor"" of the
improper police procedures ""further damaged"" the complainant's
initial identification evidence. The question whether Wright J. erred in law in
his assessment of the complainant's initial identification evidence is
therefore validly raised. Indeed, as I hope to show in the ensuing analysis of
the authorities, Wright J. erred in taking the case from the jury on this
basis. The substantial consistency in the complainant's descriptions of the
accused given on three separate occasions prior to any improper police
procedures required him, in my view, to put the evidence to the jury with an
appropriate caution.

 

7.                Matas J.A. in his dissenting reasons
concluded that the trial judge was correct in directing a verdict. He thought
that ""the difficulty with the several descriptions furnished by the
complainant was compounded by the improper show‑up identifications""
(p. 284). He concluded that it was impossible to say ""if the complainant
identified the accused on the second occasion only as the man she saw in court
the first time or whether she was making a valid identification of the assailant""
(p. 285). Accordingly, for this reason Matas J.A. thought that the only course
open to the trial judge was to direct a verdict of acquittal.

 

8.                Hall J.A., speaking for the majority,
had a different view. He considered that the identification evidence of the
complainant should have gone to the jury for an assessment of its quality in
light of the opportunity she had to see him provided proper directions were
given by the trial judge. He found that the applicable principle was that enunciated
in R. v. Comba, [1938] S.C.R. 396, and adopted by the Alberta Court of
Appeal in R. v. Duhamel, [1981] 1 W.W.R. 22, rather than that put
forward in Turnbull which the trial judge had applied. In other words,
the proper test in Hall J.A.'s view was whether in light of the ""dubious
nature of the evidence it would be unsafe to find the prisoner guilty"". 

 

2. The Test for a Directed Verdict

 

9.                In Canada the governing test for a
directed verdict is set out by Ritchie J. in United States of America v.
Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067 at p. 1080, as follows:

 

... whether or not there
is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a
verdict of guilty. The ""justice"", in accordance with this principle,
is, in my opinion, required to commit an accused person for trial in any case
in which there is admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result
in a conviction.

 

I agree with Lamer J. that the division of views expressed by the
majority and the minority in Shephard is of little relevance here. It is
clear that in the present case the issue was not the credibility of the
complainant but the quality of her evidence based on her opportunities for
observation. However, I disagree with my colleague's view that ""
""quality"" of evidence is truly the realm of the trial judge"". A
jury is in just as good a position as a trial judge to assess the witness'
opportunity for observation and the strength of his or her evidence based on that
opportunity. Indeed, this is something that lay people are peculiarly well
equipped to do.

 

10.              In my view, both the law and the
traditional importance of the jury require a large measure of deference to be
accorded the jury even where quality as opposed to credibility is at issue.
Although by itself Ritchie J.'s test in Shephard may be susceptible of
more than one interpretation, an examination of its antecedents supports the
view that at this stage of the trial the judge's function is narrowly circumscribed
by the central role of the trier of fact.

 

11.              In R. v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R.
172, affirming (1948), 91 C.C.C. 210 (Ont. C.A.), this Court had occasion to
expand on the dual role of a trial judge sitting alone on a motion for a
directed verdict. In support of the motion the defence had argued that the
evidence adduced by the Crown should leave in the mind of the trial judge a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The trial judge proceeded to
weigh the evidence in relation to the reasonable doubt standard and acquitted
the accused. The Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal. However, Roach J.A. in
dissent was of the view that the trial judge had no jurisdiction at this stage
of the proceedings to consider the question of reasonable doubt. Rather, that
question was for the jury or for the judge qua jury only after the
defence had made its election to submit or not submit additional evidence and
after that evidence, if any, was in. Roach J.A. described the limited nature of
the trial judge's decision at this intermediate stage in terms of a choice
between ""evidence which...would justify a conviction"" and ""no
evidence"" as follows at pp. 215‑16:

 

                   The
question whether or not there was any evidence which, if believed, would justify
a conviction, is a question of law. I have recorded sufficient of the Crown's
evidence to make it perfectly clear that as a matter of law if the accused was
being tried by a Judge and jury, rather than by a Judge alone, the Judge would
have had to leave the case to the consideration of the jury either to acquit or
to convict. He could not have instructed the jury that there was no evidence
and directed them to return a verdict of acquittal. 

 

Roach J.A.'s dissenting reasons found favour with a majority of this
Court and it was unanimously agreed that a new trial should be ordered.

 

12.              A similar question as to the scope of the
trial judge's function on a motion for a directed verdict arose in the context
of circumstantial evidence in R. v. Comba, supra. In that case
this Court set aside a jury verdict of guilt. Sir Lyman Duff C.J. stated, in
effect, that cases comprised wholly of circumstantial evidence should be
measured against the rule in Hodge’s Case (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R.
1136. The rule states that where all the evidence is circumstantial the accused
can be found guilty only if the evidence is both consistent with guilt and
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. He also remarked that this
would have been an appropriate case to direct a verdict of acquittal. A line of
jurisprudence subsequently developed which incorporated the rule in Hodge’s
Case into the trial judge's deliberations on a motion for a directed
verdict, thus creating an exception where circumstantial evidence was concerned
to the narrow role of the judge at this stage of the trial.

 

13.              The divergence of views on this point was
not resolved until the mid 1970's. In John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R.
781, this Court stated that the rule in Hodge's Case was simply an
elaboration of the reasonable doubt standard. The logical extension of this
position occurred in R. v. Paul, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181, and Lavoie v.
The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 193, cases in which this Court held that the
rule in Hodge’s Case and the question of reasonable doubt does not arise
on a motion for a directed verdict. Although additional confusion has been
generated by Ritchie J.'s seeming approval in Shephard of the notion
that Sir Lyman Duff C.J. intended to create a special exception in Comba,
I think his remarks must be read in light of the clear rejection only a few
months later of the relevance of the Hodge's Case standard to directed
verdicts in Lavoie, supra. Laskin C.J. wrote the judgment of a
unanimous Court which included Ritchie J. and which reads in its entirety as
follows at p. 193:

 

                   It will
not be necessary to hear you, Mr. Gagnon. We are all of the opinion that there
was no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. On the motion by the
accused for a directed verdict, the rule in Hodge’s Case (1838), 2 Lewin
227, 168 E.R. 1136, does not apply, as this Court held in R. v. Paul,
[1977] 1 S.C.R. 181. The appeal is dismissed.

 

Accordingly, the notion of a Comba exception to general
principles in terms of the standard against which to measure circumstantial
evidence at this stage of a trial was finally put to rest and the restrictive
role of the trial judge reaffirmed.

 

14.              Some of the other antecedents to Shephard
lend further support to the view that the basis on which a trial judge can
withdraw a case from the jury is extremely narrow. As mentioned earlier, Roach
J.A. of the Court of Appeal in Morabito spoke in terms of ""no evidence""
and several other decisions describe the directed verdict question as the
""absence of evidence"" question. Perhaps the strongest statement to
this effect is by Pigeon J. in R. v. Kyling, [1970] S.C.R. 953. In the
course of his reasons he stated at p. 955:

 

                   The
first reason given by the majority for dismissing the appeal was that the
decision of the trial court was not really a nonsuit, but rather an acquittal
on the merits, for an insufficiency, not an absence, of evidence. It was
rightly pointed out that whereas the absence of any evidence is a question of
law, the insufficiency of the evidence is essentially a question of fact. The
right of appeal by the prosecution, however, is only on a question of law. 

 

And later at p. 956:

 

                   In The
King v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172, this Court held that a nonsuit
pronounced on a motion by the defence after the close of the case for the Crown
is a decision on a question of law, namely, the absence of evidence. This rule
was also held applicable to summary proceedings by the judgment in Feeley et
al. v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 59. I have found nothing in the 1955 Criminal
Code  that might imply a change in the principles underlying these
judgments, nor has anything to this effect been brought to our attention.

 

15.              The language in these cases would seem to
limit intervention by the trial judge to instances in which there is absolutely
no evidence at all. While this would seem to offer a simple and clear‑cut
standard, I believe that in this context ""no evidence"" is not to be
taken literally as meaning a total absence of any evidence but as meaning
rather no evidence capable of supporting a conviction.

 

16.              The dissenting reasons of de Grandpré J.
in Paul afford, perhaps, the clearest insight into the special meaning
of ""no evidence"". In that case Ritchie J. for the majority ordered a
new trial, thus overturning a directed verdict of acquittal at trial on a
charge of knowing possession of stolen goods. He stated at p. 189 that in his
view the admitted facts were such that ""a properly instructed jury might
reasonably have drawn the inference that they [the goods] did not get there
without having been stolen by somebody"". De Grandpré J. (Laskin C.J. and
Spence J. concurring) disagreed. He felt that evidence on two of the essential
elements of the offence in question was lacking. In the course of his reasons
de Grandpré J. wrote at pp. 185‑86:

 

                   There
is no question that on a motion for nonsuit the accused can only be released if
there is an absence of evidence. In this connection we need only refer to the
remarks of Pigeon J. in The Queen v. Kyling, [1970] S.C.R. 953, at p.
956:

 

                                                                    ...

 

As Pigeon J. points out,
the applicable principles were discussed more fully in Morabito and Feeley,
and I adopt the reasons expressed in those cases.

 

                   However,
the expression ""absence of evidence"" does not mean that the motion
for a nonsuit must be dismissed whenever there is an iota of evidence, no
matter how inconsequential this may be. On the contrary, a careful reading of Feeley,
referred to above, discloses that there were few iotas of evidence in that
case. Appellants had been acquitted at first instance on a motion for nonsuit,
and the Court of Appeal had set aside this acquittal and ordered a new trial.
This Court unanimously reinstated the judgment of acquittal with respect to
three of the four appellants. Cartwright J., as he then was, speaking for the
Court, emphasized that the various aspects of the evidence ""taken
together, are insufficient to make out a prima facie case""
(p. 64).

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

In de Grandpré J.'s view the Court of Appeal had not only applied the
correct principles of law but had also correctly concluded that the evidence
submitted by the Crown met the ""absence of evidence"" standard.

 

17.              The division of views in Paul in a
sense highlights the area in which a trial judge can legitimately impose his or
her assessment of the evidence on the trier of fact. As in Comba the
crucial evidence in Paul was circumstantial. The minority found that it
failed to establish any direct link between the goods in question and a theft.
Ritchie J. for the majority thought that the facts were such that one could
infer they had been stolen. He stated at pp. 191‑92:

 

                   As I
have indicated, however, I do not think that the judgment of Sir Lyman Duff in
the Comba Case, supra, in which he reiterates the rule in Hodge’s
Case has any application to the circumstances here disclosed. I am rather
of opinion, as indicated by Mr. Justice Pigeon in R. v. Kyling, [1970]
S.C.R. 953 at p. 957, that the true test to be applied before granting a
nonsuit is whether the Crown evidence gives rise merely to a suspicion or
whether it is such as to justify the drawing of an inference.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Thus, in a sense, what was a ""mere suspicion"" for the
minority was a ""valid inference"" for the majority. This debate over
the line between suspicion and inference is likely to appear in any case in
which circumstantial evidence of an essential element of the offence is
dubious. However, even where the critical link is purported to be established
by direct evidence, it can, in my view, be withheld from the jury only at that
same point, i.e., where the evidence approaches a similar level of
extreme dubiousness or insufficiency in the sense of simply raising a suspicion
or a conjecture of guilt and no more. 

 

18.              The traditional formulation of the test
for a directed verdict also suggests that the ""absence of evidence""
standard is not meant to be interpreted in literal terms. In Feeley v. The
Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 59, Cartwright J. (as he then was) for the Court summarized
the applicable principles as follows at pp. 60‑61:

 

                   It is
common ground that had the learned Magistrate refused the motion the appellants
would have had the right to call evidence for the defence if so advised and
counsel for the respondent submits that the decision of this Court in The
King v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172, establishes (i) that at that stage it
was open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no
evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed
jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that
whether or not there was such evidence is ""a question of law alone""
within the meaning of s. 1013(4) of the Code. I agree with this
submission.

 

Cartwright J.'s qualification of the appropriate standard in terms of
whether a properly instructed jury might convict appears throughout the
jurisprudence and is reflected by Ritchie J. in Shephard. Indeed, the
link made by Ritchie J. in Shephard between the test for a directed verdict
and that for sufficiency of evidence under s. 475  of the Criminal Code 
supports the notion that ""no evidence"" represents a degree of quality
rather than an absence of any evidence, good or bad. In addition, Ritchie J. in
the course of his reasons gives some indication of the point at which poor
quality evidence reaches that degree of extreme insufficiency. His implicit
approval of the refusal to issue a warrant for extradition in Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez, [1973] F.C. 1206, provides a concrete
illustration of identification evidence which is so dubious that a properly
instructed jury could not reasonably convict. In that case, Thurlow J. (as he
then was) of the Federal Court of Appeal described the evidence in question as
follows at p. 1214:

 

Indeed, I find it
inconceivable that a person should be put on trial on such flimsy evidence as a
purported identification made a year after the event by a person who did not
previously know the accused and whose only opportunity to observe him was a
fleeting one from a distance of some sixty feet, if indeed he ever got that
close. The evidence of the witness having selected the respondent's
identification card is not in itself evidence implicating the respondent, and
in the circumstances as described it tends to weaken rather than to strengthen
the identification made by Atilano at the hearing ... Nor was there anything
else to implicate the respondent or corroborate such identification.

 

19.              Unlike my colleague, Lamer J., I do not
think that the extension of the absence of evidence standard implicit in the
test of whether a properly instructed jury might convict vests in the trial
judge an unbounded discretion over the qualitative aspects of evidence. The use
of the terms ""no evidence"" and ""absence of evidence"" at the
very least imports a notion of constraint and stringency into the standard.
However, I do agree with my colleague that Sir Lyman Duff C.J.'s direction in Comba
with regard to the dubious nature of the evidence does not create a test of
dubiousness which is separate and distinct from the test in Shephard. In
my view Comba and Shephard are consistent with one another.
Certainly this was the view of Ritchie J. in Shephard. He remarked on Comba
at pp. 1081‑82 as follows:

 

                   It is
to be observed that there was no suggestion in the Comba case that any
of the evidence called by the Crown was either tainted or unreliable. It came
from witnesses whose integrity was at no time put in question and who testified
as to a variety of circumstances which had excited enough suspicion against the
accused to occasion his arrest and trial but which taken together did not
establish his guilt in accordance with the accepted standards of proof in such
cases which are described by Duff C.J. ... 

 

Ritchie J. then quotes Sir Lyman Duff C.J.'s formulation of the rule in
Hodge's Case. As mentioned earlier, this causes some confusion over
whether Comba imported the reasonable doubt standard into the test for a
directed verdict in cases based on circumstantial evidence. In light of this
Court's position in Paul and in Lavoie, it is my view that
Ritchie J. in Shephard was using Comba simply to illustrate his
point that poor quality evidence which merely raises a suspicion may
legitimately be withheld from the jury in contra‑distinction to evidence
that is poor in the sense of lacking in credibility. The question then is what
content is to be given to Sir Lyman Duff C.J.'s concept of dubiousness or to
Ritchie J.'s concept of a proper and reasonable basis for conviction. Can the
content be articulated in a way that is useful without being overly cumbersome
and inflexible?

 

20.              In the case at bar, Hall J.A. proposed the
Comba test of dubiousness as an alternative to Lord Widgery C.J.'s
direction in Turnbull which had been relied on by the trial judge.
Again, I do not think that the controversy in this case stems from competing
judicial tests. Apart from the question of Lord Widgery C.J.'s requirement of
corroboration for poor quality evidence which does not arise here, I do not
think there is such inconsistency between Turnbull and Shephard
that they must be viewed as imposing different standards. In fact, Turnbull
makes it quite clear that what is usually required in cases which turn on
eyewitness testimony is a direction to the jury as to the inherent frailty of
identification evidence coupled with an instruction to consider carefully the
conditions under which the identification is made. Lord Widgery C.J. elaborated
on the caution to be given as follows at p. 552:

 

                   Secondly,
the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in which
the identification by each witness came to be made. How long did the witness
have the accused under observation? At what distance? In what light? Was the
observation impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of
people? Had the witness ever seen the accused before? How often? If only
occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused? How long
elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to
the police? Was there any material discrepancy between the description of the
accused given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and his
actual appearance?

 

One can deduce from this catalogue of impediments to accuracy that
observations made under less than ideal conditions by witnesses can
nevertheless be put to the jury. This is consistent with the Shephard
formulation of the test.

 

21.              After giving several examples of good
quality evidence, Lord Widgery C.J. went on to suggest at p. 553 that where the
quality is poor ""as for example when it depends solely on a fleeting
glance or on a longer observation made in difficult conditions"", the trial
judge should withdraw the case from the jury and direct a verdict of acquittal.
Thus, at some point the adverse conditions for observation cannot be cured by a
caution. Again this is consistent with Ritchie J.'s implicit approval of Hernandez.
Unfortunately, Lord Widgery C.J. does not indicate, and it is perhaps
impossible to do so, when the borderline is crossed. No one would take issue
with the ""fleeting glance"" test; it represents the extreme of frailty
which cannot be cured by a caution. The real difficulty is with ""a longer
observation made in difficult conditions"". In this sense Turnbull
is more significant for what it does not lay down. If it sets out any principle
with regard to the test for a directed verdict, it is the principle that the quality
of a witness' identification is directly related to the extent of the witness'
opportunity for observation. However, Turnbull offers no workable
criteria for determining when conditions are so difficult that an eyewitness'
testimony should not be relied on or, in the language of the Canadian cases,
when valid inferences become mere suspicions. The only guidance Turnbull
gives is on the actual fact situation in Turnbull itself and in the
accompanying appeals. 

 

22.              The fact situation in Turnbull is
by and large unhelpful as the challenged evidence was recognition evidence and
was supported by ample additional evidence. Accordingly, it passed Lord Widgery
C.J.'s test and was found to have been properly put to the jury. In the other
two appeals dealt with by the Court at the same time the convictions were
quashed. However, they involved significantly worse conditions of observation
than those in the present case and in this respect resemble the evidentiary
basis in Hernandez. In R. v. Roberts the assailant was a stranger
to the complainant, the attack was over in a few moments, the place of the
attack was dark except for the flashing lights of the dance hall, the accused's
subsequent conduct was consistent with his denial of guilt and there were
significant contradictions in the descriptions of the identifying witnesses. In
R. v. Whitby the identifications were of a man in a balaclava who had
been seen for a short time during a robbery. One witness had seen him from the
rear only; the other witness gave a completely inconsistent description before
picking the accused out of a line‑up. There is very little one can point
to in either of these cases which would redeem the obvious untrustworthiness of
the identification evidence. Together with Comba and Hernandez
they serve to delineate the line beyond which it would be improper in law to
put the question of guilt or innocence to the jury. The case at hand requires
that one delineate the opposite boundary, namely that beyond which it would be
improper in law to withhold the question of culpability from the jury. I agree
that within these broad parameters deference should in general be paid to the
decision of the trial judge. Although the cases continually assert that whether
there is an ""absence of evidence"" is a question of law upon which
either party can appeal, this does not mean that the reviewing court should
automatically intervene whenever it disagrees with the trial judge's
assessment. However, unlike Lamer J., I do not believe that Wright J.'s
assessment of the complainant's initial identification evidence falls within
that area of deference.

 

23.              It seems to me that Turnbull
provides some useful guidance on how to delineate the line between suspicion
and inference and fill the analytic gap left by Lord Widgery C.J.'s reference
to ""difficult conditions"". One can infer from the kinds of
considerations enumerated in that case as going to the quality of
identification evidence that, at the very least, the trial judge should address
his or her mind to the same kind of considerations in determining whether or
not to direct a verdict. In addition, it would seem to follow that where the
frailties in the evidence can be remedied by a caution, the judge should leave
the matter to the jury. This, indeed, is the ultimate test; can the frailties
be remedied by an appropriate caution? It is not, in my view, good enough for a
trial judge to make a finding as to the quality of the evidence. He must go on
to determine whether the adverse conditions for observation can be taken care
of by an appropriate caution. If they can, then Ritchie J.'s test of
sufficiency in Shephard can be met, i.e., there is ""evidence
upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of
guilty"" (p. 1080).

 

24.              I do not mean to suggest that the trial
judge should in every case be held to a rigid tabulation of the factors listed
in Turnbull. A mechanical test would not reflect the infinite
particularity of possible fact situations. The Turnbull caution does,
however, identify a number of factors which can clearly affect the quality of
eyewitness evidence: length of observation, distance, light, obstructions to
view, recognition, time between original observation and subsequent description
to the police and discrepancies between that description and the accused's
appearance. No doubt there are many more. The consistency in the witness'
descriptions (relevant in this case), his or her degree of attention and
awareness at the time of the crime, and the witness' reaction at subsequent
encounters with the accused (also relevant in this case) are some that come
readily to mind. 

 

25.              In the present case the evidence, apart
from the suggestiveness of the courtroom identification, is dubious with regard
to only two of the Turnbull factors, namely the poor lighting during
most of the encounter and the fact that the assailant was a stranger to the
complainant. These factors will be present in a large number of rape cases. I
agree with Matas J.A. that we have to have regard to the realities of this
particular offence. Wright J. seemed especially concerned by the lack of
lighting. Admittedly in some circumstances, such as total darkness or the use
of masks, a single factor by itself may require a directed verdict. However, it
is clear from the Turnbull caution that imperfect or partial lighting
does not always undermine accuracy. In my view, the question of whether or not
it did so in this case should have been left to the jury. The complainant's
first impression occurred under streetlights. The ensuing twenty minutes or so
were in the dark but at close contact. The witness was fairly self‑possessed
a few hours later and was able at that point to give a general but coherent
description. Her subsequent descriptions including the police portrait were for
the most part consistent with that first description. In addition, she visibly
reacted when later shown the accused in the course of a courtroom
identification.

 

26.              In sum, except for the fact that her
assailant was a stranger, the darkness behind the CN sheds, and several minor
inconsistencies with regard to the length of hair and the fabric and length of
the coat, the complainant's identification was detailed and coherent. It would
be surprising indeed if such evidence was relegated to the category of mere
suspicion and conjecture. The trial judge correctly focussed on the lighting as
the crucial factor in relation to accuracy. However, I think that any weakness
generated by the partially lit conditions was well within the ability of the
jury to handle sensibly in combination with an appropriate caution. Any other
interpretation would be inconsis­tent with the scope and purpose of Lord
Widgery C.J.'s comparatively detailed direction in this regard and with the
stringency of the absence of evidence standard which underlies Ritchie J.'s
test in Shephard. It follows that Wright J. could not have directed
himself to these considerations and in particular to the question of whether
the dubiousness generated by the poor lighting could be adequately addressed in
a strongly worded caution. Thus, whether one regards Wright J.'s decision as
flowing from a misunderstanding of Turnbull or as a failure to apply Shephard,
the conclusion seems inescapable that he committed an error of law in directing
a verdict of acquittal on the basis solely of the quality of the initial
identification evidence.

 

3. The Effect of Improper Police Procedures

 

27.              I have considered Wright J.'s assessment
of the complainant's initial identification evidence in isolation from the
issue of the possible detrimental impact on it of the subsequent improper
police procedures. In practice, one could consider all the factors going to
quality of the evidence together and only then apply the Shephard test
with regard to the capacity of a properly instructed jury to convict on it.
This was the approach taken by Matas J.A. For purposes of the present
discussion I think it is helpful to proceed in two stages in order to clarify
the considerations which are appropriate on a motion for a directed verdict. It
will also be more efficient in a case such as this to take a two‑step
approach. Where the quality of a complainant's initial identification is so
unreliable, e.g. the fleeting glance, that even with a strongly worded
caution from the judge it could not support a verdict of guilt, there would be
no need to go on to consider the impact of subsequent improper police
procedures. However, where as in the present appeal, the initial identification
evidence meets the test of sufficiency, the trial judge must, in my opinion, go
on to the second stage and consider the impact on that evidence of the
subsequent police procedures. 

 

28.              The details of the line‑up procedure
employed in the present appeal were summarized by Matas J.A. and are reproduced
in my colleague's reasons. Several features of it are relevant to the quality
of the identification. Rather than place the accused in an identification
parade the police brought the complainant to view a number of prisoners as they
were brought into court. Mr. Mezzo was among them. There is no indication that
this procedure was adopted because of the accused's refusal to participate in a
proper parade or by urgency. The complainant knew the police had a suspect in
custody. She reacted visibly when she saw Mr. Mezzo but, because her view was
obstructed by the sheriff, she said that although Mr. Mezzo looked like the man
she could not be certain. In addition, the police were unable to say whether
Mr. Mezzo's name had been called, the charge read, or whether any of the other
prisoners called at the same time looked like Mr. Mezzo. The problems in terms
of evidential quality inherent in this first attempt to have the complainant
identify her assailant are fairly obvious.

 

29.              Because of the complainant's uncertainty
on this first line‑up, a second courtroom viewing was arranged at which
Mr. Mezzo's name was definitely called out. This time the complainant
positively identified Mr. Mezzo as her assailant. Matas J.A. comments that
""It is impossible to say if the complainant identified the accused on the
second occasion only as the man she saw in court the first time or whether she
was making a valid identification of the assailant"" (p. 285). He went on
to say that the problem is magnified when it is coupled with the other factors
of suggestiveness and the absence of Crown evidence on the particulars of the
line‑up. Matas J.A. therefore agreed with the directed verdict of
acquittal.

 

30.              Both the trial judge and Matas J.A. rely
on R. v. Smierciak (1946), 87 C.C.C. 175 in their assessment of the
impact of the line‑up. The accused in that case was charged with
attempting to pass a forged cheque by presenting it to a bank teller. When the
teller asked for a registration card the accused searched his pockets and
remarked that he must have left it in his car. He then walked out of the bank
and did not return. Although the teller would not have taken any special care
to observe the accused at the time of the transaction, the conditions for
observation were very good. The police subsequently showed her a single photo
of a suspect which she identified as the man. He was convicted. On appeal
Laidlaw J.A. stated at p. 177:

 

In addition to such
matters, and of the utmost importance, is the method used to recall or refresh
the recollections of a witness who is to be relied upon to identify a person
suspected of wrongdoing or who is under arrest. If a witness has no previous knowledge
of the accused person so as to make him familiar with that person's appearance,
the greatest care ought to be used to ensure the absolute independence and
freedom of judgment of the witness. His recognition ought to proceed without
suggestion, assistance or bias created directly or indirectly. Conversely, if
the means employed to obtain evidence of identification involve any acts which
might reasonably prejudice the accused, the value of the evidence may be
partially or wholly destroyed. Anything which tends to convey to a witness that
a person is suspected by the authorities, or is charged with an offence, is
obviously prejudicial and wrongful. Submitting a prisoner alone for scrutiny
after arrest is unfair and unjust. Likewise, permitting a witness to see a
single photograph of a suspected person or of a prisoner, after arrest and
before scrutiny, can have no other effect, in my opinion, than one of prejudice
to such a person. 

 

Consequently, Laidlaw J.A. quashed the appellant's conviction, stating
that the police procedures had rendered the teller's evidence valueless and, in
the absence of any other evidence, ""it would be unfair and unsafe to
convict him"" (p. 180).

 

31.              The parallel to the facts of the present
case is clear. Taken at its best we have here a fairly reliable initial
identification followed by two improper and suggestive line‑ups. However
Laidlaw J.A.'s concern in Smierciak, supra, seems to be as much
with prejudice to the accused as with the frailty of the complainant's
evidence. He concludes that because of the prejudice arising from the police
procedures it would be unfair and unsafe to convict. In contrast, it is the
frailty of the evidence aspect that appears to have been foremost in the minds
of both the trial judge and Matas J.A. in the present case. Indeed, Matas J.A.
specifically states that it is not necessary to consider the issue of the
exclusion of the evidence on the basis of either common law or constitutional
fairness principles.

 

32.              While suggestiveness and observational
impediments may feature in both the frailty issue and the fairness issue, the
two are approached from different standpoints and involve radically different
policy concerns. Where the frailty or accuracy of the identification is under
consideration, the standpoint is that of the complainant and of society. The
underlying concerns are to redress the harm caused to her and to society by
criminal behaviour and to ensure that the verdict is supported by proper evidence.
Where fairness is at issue, the standpoint is that of the accused and the
underlying concern is the affront to justice inherent in prejudicial and
needlessly suggestive procedures. In spite of these conceptual differences,
accuracy and unfairness are often treated as aspects of the same issue. This
can in some instances be explained by the fact that ultimately the two
standpoints converge. Obviously it would be unfair to convict an accused on
frail evidence. In addition, where evidence is excluded for fairness reasons,
the effect may be to render the remaining evidence frail. In the present
appeal, the appellant has argued accuracy and fairness as separate points. I
agree that they should be viewed as analytically distinct. The question whether
evidence should be excluded is not properly part of the decision to direct a
verdict except in the indirect sense mentioned above, namely where the
exclusion effectively undermines the other perfectly acceptable evidence.

 

33.              Laidlaw J.A.'s decision suggests that an
improper line‑up can destroy otherwise good evidence. This principle is
implicit in Matas J.A.'s conclusion in the present appeal and in the case of R.
v. Faryna (1982), 18 Man. R. (2d) 185 (C.A.) However, a retreat from
Laidlaw J.A.'s interventionist approach is displayed in the cases of R. v.
Sutton, [1970] 2 O.R. 358 (C.A.); R. v. Smith (1975), 12 N.S.R. (2d)
289 (C.A.); R. v. Engel (1981), 9 Man. R. (2d) 279 (C.A.) and R. v.
Simpson (No. 2) (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 122 (Ont. C.A.)

 

34.              In R. v. Faryna Huband J.A., with
whom O'Sullivan J.A. concurred, was of the view that the use of an improper
line‑up fatally weakened the Crown's case. As in the present appeal the
entire case turned on eyewitness evidence. However, unlike the present appeal,
the initial identifications given by the two complainants were extremely poor,
consisting in one instance of two encounters lasting a total of ten seconds and
in the other instance of one encounter lasting three seconds. In addition,
subsequent descriptions given by the complainants had several inconsistencies
and both picked the accused out of line‑ups in which the persons in the
line bore no resemblance to the accused. Huband J.A. distinguished R. v.
Smith, supra, on the basis of the extraordinary frailty of the initial
identifications of Mr. Faryna. He went on to describe the line‑up and its
impact on the Crown's case as follows at pp. 195‑96: 

 

                   She
next was asked to identify the accused when he was presented to her in a police
lineup, which can be best described as the situation in which the police
identified their suspect to her by means of juxtaposition, and distinction from
the others in the lineup. Having identified the man so indicated as her
assailant, there is a reasonable apprehension that her subsequent descriptions
of her assailant, both at the preliminary inquiry and at trial, were based on
impressions she formed of the man in the police lineup, rather than of the man
she saw for fleeting seconds at the time of the assault. This is not to impute
any ill motive to Mrs. Cudmore. It simply reflects the inherent danger in
identification evidence of this type and highlights the reasons why police
lineups must be conducted properly if any weight is to be given to the evidence
obtained as a result.

 

35.              While Huband J.A.'s decision may have been
warranted by the combination of the fleetingness of the initial encounters with
the bias implicit in identification by juxtaposition, it is clear that where
the reliability of the evidence rather than control of police behaviour or
prejudice to the accused is the over‑riding concern, the psychological
barriers generated by suggestive line‑ups do not always destroy otherwise
good evidence. In R. v. Sutton, supra, Jessup J.A. ordered a new trial
in part because the trial judge had failed to caution the jury with respect to
the frailty generated by an improperly conducted photo line‑up. The
implication is that those frailties could have been reme­died by a proper
direction. Likewise in R. v. Smith and R. v. Engel, supra, the
respective Courts of Appeal were of the view that a caution to the trier of
fact was all that was needed to counteract the damage caused by improper line‑up
procedures.

 

36.              In Smith, the strength of the
initial identification played a large part in the reviewing court's assessment
of the conviction at trial. MacDonald J.A. of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal
said at pp. 297‑99:

 

                   Counsel
for the appellant contends that the evidence of Mr. Walker, particularly in
view of the acquittal of Pace, is too weak and uncertain to found a conviction.
In support of this contention he referred to Regina v. Spatola (1970),
10 C.R.N.S. 143, Rex v. Brown and Angus (1951), 99 C.C.C. 141, Rex v.
Goldhar, Rex v. Smokler (1941), 76 C.C.C. 270, Regina v. Shaver
(1971), 2 N.S.R. (2d) 225, and Regina v. Kerwin (1974), 26 C.R.N.S. 351.
I subscribe to what was said in all those cases but would point out that here
Mr. Walker had ample opportunity of observing the facial features of the
appellant enabling him to receive an impression of a definite cast of
countenance. When the distinguishing red mark is added to this, in my opinion,
it cannot be said that Mr. Walker could not visualize the personal
characteristics and individuality of the appellant to the extent necessary to
enable him to identify him late on the day of the robbery in the lineup. This
being so, I would refer again to Regina v. Spatola, supra, wherein
Laskin, J.A., said in effect that identification evidence is for the jury to
evaluate on proper direction.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
object of the identification parade or lineup is to make sure that the ability
of the witness to recognize the suspect has been fairly and adequately tested.
I think it is desirable for the police to hold an identification parade before
the arrest, trial or preliminary inquiry, as the case may be. Such a parade or
lineup should be carried out by placing the accused, or the suspect, with a
sufficient number of people as similar physically as possible to him, leaving
the witness to pick him out if he can, without assistance.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   In the
present case my opinion is that the construction of the lineup was
unsatisfactory. The effect of such a defective lineup goes to the weight of the
identification evidence which, in the present case and notwithstanding the
unsatisfactory lineup was sufficient for the reasons already given to support
the conviction. 

 

37.              In R. v. Engel, supra, O'Sullivan
J.A., with whom Huband J.A. concurred, agreed with counsel that the line‑up
was a farce. Nevertheless he felt that the conviction should be upheld in view
of the fact that the trial judge sitting alone ""suitably warned himself of
the dangers inherent in the identification evidence and in the lack of
corroboration"" (p. 284).

 

38.              These cases reflect a deference to the
ability of the triers of fact to weigh poor quality evidence. This deference is
implicit in Ritchie J.'s restrictive formulation of the governing test in Shephard.
However, the case which best illustrates this confidence in the jury and which
perhaps approximates most closely to the facts in the present appeal is R.
v. Simpson (No. 2), supra.

 

39.              The accused in Simpson was charged
with attempted murder. The attempt occurred at night, albeit near a street
light. The complainant spent the whole time trying to fight off her assailant.
Afterwards she was able to give a description which generally corresponded to
that of the accused except that she got the colour of his eyes wrong. The
accused refused to participate in a line‑up. The police brought the
complainant to a courtroom where he was appearing in connection with another
offence. The accused entered the courtroom alone, handcuffed, and escorted by a
constable. The complainant immediately began to shake and cry and was taken
from the room. After she had calmed down she asked for another view in order to
be sure. She was then taken back into the courtroom whereupon she positively
identified the accused as her assailant.

 

40.              At Simpson's trial the judge charged the
jury as follows as related by Martin J.A. at p. 130:

 

You may think then that
Simpson being brought into court in this fashion diminishes, if not completely
does away with, the weight to be attached to Cathy's identification on that day
in that court room. But you might also feel that you are entitled to overlook
the unusual procedure, or at least not feel that it detracts from her
identification when you consider Constable Anderson's very vivid description of
how she reacted to seeing Simpson, saying ""That's the man"" or words
to that effect. When you are looking at a man handcuffed, surrounded by police
in a court room is one thing, but to react as Cathy did seems to me to be
another thing, you may find, or you may not find. You may disagree‑‑you
may agree. You may think then that her reactions may be sufficient, or a
sufficient act of identification which eliminates the problem of the method of
bringing Simpson in and the fact he was handcuffed and with the police. That is
one of the areas that you are going to have to make a decision upon.

 

Although the accused only contested the admission of the evidence of
the complainant's physical reaction to his appearance in court, I think that
Martin J.A.'s rejection of that ground and approval of the trial judge's
direction implied an approval of the trial judge's reliance on the ability of
the jurors to balance the prejudicial impact of the in‑court
identification process and the difficulties inherent in the complainant's
initial observation of her assailant against the overall strengths and
weaknesses of her evidence. The parallels with the circumstances in Mezzo
are quite striking. In both cases the initial encounter is under difficult
conditions but the complainant's subsequent descriptions are consistent and
fairly specific. If anything, the line‑up process in Simpson is
more suggestive than that in Mezzo. In both cases there are two viewings
and in both cases the witness has a physical reaction to the sight of the
suspect.

 

41.              I think that several conclusions can be
drawn from these authorities. First, the improprieties in the line‑up do
not necessarily destroy otherwise good evidence. Second, consistent with Shephard,
damage can often be remedied by a proper caution. Third, at this stage of the
analysis the assessment of the evidential basis for conviction depends not only
on separate assessments of the weaknesses in the initial observation and the
weaknesses in the conduct of the line‑up but also on the impact of one or
the other. As I stated at the outset, the stronger the initial identification
evidence the higher the degree of subsequent impropriety it might take to
undermine it. 

 

42.              It seems to me that the line‑up
procedure employed in this case was not so irregular by Canadian standards as
to be beyond the capabilities of the jury to weigh. Because of the failure of
the Crown to record the particulars at the courtroom encounter one must assume
that the viewings were tantamount to single show‑ups. However, in Marcoux
v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 763, a unanimous decision of this Court,
single show‑ups were approved by implication, at least in so far as
considerations of accuracy are concerned. The accused in that case refused to
take part in a line‑up. The complainant who had awakened to find a robber
in his hotel room in the early morning hours subsequently identified the
accused in the hallway of a police station and a few minutes later in a room
occupied by Mr. Marcoux and a police constable. At trial, the defence in a
motion for a directed verdict vigorously attacked the failure of the police to
conduct a proper line‑up. The trial judge refused the motion. On appeal
to this Court the central issues were whether line‑ups violated the
privilege against self‑incrimination and whether evidence of an accused's
refusal to participate in a line‑up is admissible. In the course of his
reasons for the Court Dickson J. (as he then was) discussed the use of single
show‑ups and in‑dock identification. Although he did not make any
specific finding with regard to Canadian law, he referred briefly to American
and British judicial criticism of the failure to use a proper line‑up in
the following passage at pp. 773‑74:

 

New York cases since People
v. Ballott (1967), 20 N.Y. 2d 600, have found the failure to employ a line‑up
by the police, absent imperative circumstances, violative of due process‑‑see
""Pre‑trial Identification"", (1971) 55 Minnesota Law
Review 779, at p. 791. The Court of Criminal Appeal of England has commented
adversely on the absence of an identification parade and failure to explain the
omission to hold one: R. v. Seiga, [1961] Crim. L.R. 541. In R. v.
John (unreported, abridged in (1973) Crim. L.R. 113), evidence was given by
a detective constable that the accused had refused an identification parade. On
appeal from conviction, it was urged, unsuccessfully, that the trial judge had
wrongly allowed one of the witnesses to identify the accused in the dock when
she had not identified him before the trial. Lord Justice Cairns, delivering
the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:

 

                    This
method of identification ought to have been avoided if possible. It might have
been possible in this case if the Appellant had been willing to submit to an
identification parade. Leaving out altogether the question of whether or not it
was reasonable for him to refuse an identification parade, the fact was that
the Prosecution did not have that very much better method of identification
available and, that being so, it does not appear to this Court to be wrong to
allow that method of identification to be used by that witness, Miriam Baker.

 

43.              The discussion in Marcoux concerns
the fairness or justice aspect of police procedures and of their impact on the
accused's rights. There is no suggestion that apart from due process
considerations the potential for inaccuracy generated by the station‑house
show‑up rendered the evidence against Mr. Marcoux unsafe as a basis for
conviction. The implication is that because Mr. Marcoux's refusal necessitated
the show‑up the fairness issue does not arise and that the trial judge
properly put the evidence to the jury in spite of the problems in the quality
of the initial observation and the subsequent identification. 

 

44.              In the present appeal the complainant's initial
identification evidence, in my view, was such as to require the trial judge to
put it to the jury with an appropriate caution. The conduct of the police line‑up
was clearly improper but again, on the basis of authorities such as Marcoux
and Simpson, not so improper as to be beyond the power of the jury to
handle given a proper direction by the trial judge. I do not think the police
line‑up had the effect of destroying the complainant's initial evidence
or weakening it beyond the point where it could not be taken care of by a
properly worded caution. Indeed, the visible reaction of the complainant to Mr.
Mezzo was, if anything, supportive of her earlier testimony and her obvious
desire to be sure before she made a positive identification in the courtroom
bore witness to her good faith and credibility. Matas J.A. raises the
possibility that all the complainant was doing in the second courtroom
encounter was recognizing the person she had seen on the first encounter. With
respect, I think this is to seriously underestimate a witness who had given a
perfectly sensible and commendable reason for wanting to have an unobstructed
view before committing herself. But these are, in my opinion, all matters for
the jury to weigh once the judge has drawn them to its attention.

 

45.              The question remains whether the
improprieties in the line‑up were such that the evidence of the
complainant's identification of Mr. Mezzo as her assailant should be excluded
for reasons of common law or constitutional fairness. The ""imperative
circumstances"", namely the accused's refusal to participate in a proper
line‑up, present in Marcoux and Simpson, are absent here.
In addition the police by failing to record the particulars of the procedure
have effectively made it impossible for the trial judge to caution the jury
with respect to this portion of the evidence other than by advising them to
assume the worst. In my view, these circumstances do raise a serious concern
over prejudice to the accused. However, I believe that the proper context for
that discussion would have been on a motion to exclude the evidence either on
the basis of R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272, and the accompanying
jurisprudence or under s. 24(1) of the Charter. No such motion was made
when the line‑up evidence was admitted at trial. Nor has the case been
approached on that basis either by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal.

 

46.              In light of the standard imposed in Shephard
I would agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the case should
have been put to the jury with a proper direction. I would therefore dismiss
the appeal. It will, of course, be open to the defence on the new trial, if so
advised, to move to have the line‑up evidence excluded for reasons of
fairness. 

 

                   The judgment of Beetz, Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard
and Le Dain JJ. was delivered by

 

47.              McIntyre
J.‑‑I have read the reasons for judgment prepared in this
appeal by my colleagues Lamer and Wilson JJ. I agree with Lamer J. that the
issue to be decided in this case, is whether the trial judge was in error in
directing a verdict of acquittal, despite the fact that there was admissible
evidence before the court as to the identification of the accused. With
deference to Lamer J., however, I am unable to agree with his disposition of
the matter. Like my colleague, Wilson J., I would dismiss the appeal and affirm
the Court of Appeal's order for a new trial.

 

48.              The facts have been outlined by Lamer J.
in some detail and need no repetition in these reasons. The Crown's case rests
upon the identification made by the complainant of the man who assaulted her.
The evidence she gave relating to the actual assault is adequately set out by
Lamer J., and the further identification evidence is set out in the
passages from the judgment of Matas J.A. in the Court of Appeal, which were
included in Lamer J.'s reasons.

 

49.              The trial judge followed the judgment of
Harradence J.A., speaking for the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Duhamel,
[1981] 1 W.W.R. 22, which in turn adopted and applied the reasons of Lord
Widgery C.J. in the English Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, in R. v.
Turnbull, [1976] 3 All E.R. 549. This led him to a consideration of the
quality of the evidence. In this process he indulged in a detailed weighing of
the evidence and he concluded that a verdict should be directed. He was also
moved towards his decision by what he considered to be improper police
procedures taken to procure further identification evidence in the proceedings.

 

50.              In the Court of Appeal (1983), 35 C.R.
(3d) 272, Hall J.A., speaking for the Chief Justice and himself, acknowledged
that a trial judge dealing with the question of a directed verdict should
consider the quality of the evidence. He said (at p. 277):

 

                   In sum,
the trial judge should, without making any finding of credibility, form a view
or opinion whether, because of the dubious nature of the evidence, it would be
unsafe to find the accused guilty. If he forms that opinion, he would be
justified in directing a jury to return a verdict of acquittal.

 

He went on to conclude that in the case before the court the evidence
was sufficient for the jury's consideration, after a proper direction from the
judge. The trial judge was in error ""not so much in adopting the wrong
test but in misapplying the test in Turnbull to the facts of the
case"". He indicated that the preferable language to employ was that
employed in R. v. Comba, [1938] S.C.R. 396. He set aside the directed
verdict and ordered a new trial. Matas J.A., in dissent, set out the facts of
the case clearly and completely. He reviewed many of the relevant authorities.
He was concerned with the frailties of visual identification and procedures
followed by the police in connection with the courtroom identification. He
would have dismissed the Crown appeal.

 

51.              The problem which arises here has its
roots in the tendency to overlook the division of duties inherent in a trial by
judge and jury. No authority need be cited for the proposition that in a jury
trial all questions of law are for the judge alone and, of equal importance,
all questions of fact are for the jury alone. The distinction is of fundamental
importance. It should be preserved so long as it is considered right to
continue the use of the jury in the criminal law. Much of the difficulty that
has arisen on this subject has been caused by a failure to recognize and
preserve this distinction. 

 

52.              The leading case in this Court on the
subject of directed verdicts is United States of America v. Shephard,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067. Ritchie J. wrote the majority judgment (Martland, Judson,
Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.), while Spence J. dissented with the
concurrence of Laskin C.J., Dickson and Beetz JJ. The United States applied for
Shephard's extradition. The only evidence adduced before Hugessen J., sitting
as an extradition judge, was an affidavit sworn by a co‑conspirator of
Shephard. Hugessen J. considered that he had to apply the test involved in
taking a case away from a jury and, saying the evidence was ""so manifestly
unreliable"", he declined to order extradition. An appeal to the Federal
Court of Appeal was dismissed and the matter came to this Court. Ritchie J.
agreed with the trial judge that the test to be applied was that expressed in
s. 475(1)  of the Criminal Code , which is set out hereunder in its
amended form:

 

                   475. (1) When all the evidence has been taken by the justice he shall

 

(a) if in his
opinion there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for the
offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same
transaction, order the accused to stand trial; or

 

(b) discharge the
accused, if in his opinion on the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is
made out to put the accused on trial for the offence charged or any other
indictable offence in respect of the same transaction.

 

He said, at p. 1080:

 

                   I agree
that the duty imposed upon a ""justice"" under s. 475(1)  is the same as
that which governs a trial judge sitting with a jury in deciding whether the
evidence is ""sufficient"" to justify him in withdrawing the case from
the jury and this is to be determined according to whether or not there is any
evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a
verdict of guilty. The ""justice"", in accordance with this principle,
is, in my opinion, required to commit an accused person for trial in any case
in which there is admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result
in a conviction.

 

Later, after referring to the trial judge's comments that the evidence
was ""manifestly unreliable"", he added, at p. 1087:

 

                   With
the greatest respect I cannot accept the proposition that a trial judge is ever
entitled to take a case from the jury and direct an acquittal on the ground
that, in his opinion, the evidence is ""manifestly unreliable"".
If this were the law it would deprive the members of the jury of their function
to act as the sole judges of the truth or falsity of the evidence and would
thus, in my opinion, be contrary to the accepted role of the jury in our legal
sytem.

 

53.              Ritchie J. has stated what has been called
the `classic statement' of the rule that has been the law of Canada since
before the Criminal Code  was adopted. In this, he has adopted as the
measure of sufficiency the concept of a prima facie case, that is, a
case containing evidence on all essential points of a charge which, if believed
by the trier of fact and unanswered, would warrant a conviction.

 

54.              Ritchie J. based his formulation of the
test to be applied by a trial judge on a line of authorities going back as far
as 1788. In R. v. Atwood and Robbins (1788), 1 Leach 464, 168 E.R. 334,
it was recognized, at pp. 334‑35, in the words of Buller J.:

 

The distinction between
the competency and the credit of a witness has been long settled. If a question
be made respecting his competency, the decision of that question is the
exclusive province of the Judge; but if the ground of the objection go to his
credit only, his testimony must be received and left with the Jury, under such
directions and observations from the Court as the circumstances of the case may
require, to say whether they think it sufficiently credible to guide their
decision on the case.

 

This is consistent with the well‑known expression of the rule in Metropolitan
Railway Co. v. Jackson (1877), 3 App. Cas. 193, where Lord Cairns L.C.
said, at p. 197: 

 

The Judge has a certain
duty to discharge, and the jurors have another and a different duty. The Judge
has to say whether any facts have been established by evidence from which
negligence may be reasonably inferred; the jurors have to say whether,
from those facts, when submitted to them, negligence ought to be
inferred. It is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance in the
administration of justice that these separate functions should be maintained,
and should be maintained distinct.

 

These words, though spoken in a civil case, were held to be applicable
in a criminal case in this Court in R. v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172 at
p. 174.

 

55.              In other early cases the rule was stated
and applied: see R. v. Dowsey (1866), 6 N.S.R. 93. This was a charge of
murder committed on a ship at sea. The only issue on the appeal was whether the
case should have been left to the jury. At page 119, Dodd J. said:

 

The facts of the case were
for the jury, and if there was any legal evidence upon which they could assume
the guilt of the prisoner, it was within their province to do so....If there
was any legal evidence against a party charged with a criminal offence, the
case cannot be withdrawn from the jury.

 

In R. v. Lloyd (1890), 19 O.R. 352, in the Ontario Supreme Court
where evidence given by a rape victim was weak, MacMahon J. said, at p. 357:

 

                   So in
the case in hand we may consider the evidence of the prosecutrix weak; we may,
in view of the admissions made during the trial, consider some of the
statements made against the prisoners Herman and George as improbable; but the
probable truth or falsity of the statements was for the consideration of the
jury, and although we may think they did not exercise a sound judgment in
reaching their verdict, we cannot say there was no evidence to be submitted to
them, and therefore the learned Judge was not bound to withdraw the case from
the jury.

 

In this Court in Girvin v. The King (1911), 45 S.C.R. 167, the prima
facie test was applied, at p. 169, in the words of Sir Charles Fitzpatrick
C.J.:

 

I have always understood
the rule to be that the Crown, in a criminal case, is not required to do more
than produce evidence which, if unanswered, and believed, is sufficient to
raise a prima facie case upon which the jury might be justified in
finding a verdict.

 

56.              It will be seen from the foregoing that
the rule enunciated by Ritchie J. in Shephard has a long and respectable
ancestry, firmly rooted in the concept that the functions of judge and jury are
separate and distinct. The confusion which has arisen in this matter stems
largely from the words of Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in R. v. Comba, supra,
where, after expressing the view, at p. 397, that the rule in Hodge’s Case
relating to the treatment of circumstantial evidence applied as part of the law
of Canada, he said:

 

                   We have
no doubt that the facts adduced have not the degree of probative force that is
required in order to satisfy the test formulated by this rule; which is one
that courts of justice in Canada are governed by and are bound to apply.

 

                   We
agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal, whose reasons for their
judgment we find convincing and conclusive, that the learned trial judge ought,
on the application made by counsel for the prisoner at the close of the
evidence for the Crown, to have told the jury that, in view of the dubious
nature of the evidence, it would be unsafe to find the prisoner guilty, and to
have directed them to return a verdict of acquittal accordingly. It is not, and
could not, with any plausibility, be suggested that the case for the Crown was
in any way strengthened or improved by the evidence put before the jury on
behalf of the defence.

 

                   The
appeal is dismissed.

 

The full significance of these words cannot be understood without a
careful consideration of what happened at the trial and on the appeal.

 

57.              The case concerned the murder of a young
girl. Comba was charged and convicted. The case against him was entirely
circumstantial and, while facts were revealed which could have been consistent
with guilt, nothing was shown which was not equally consistent with innocence.
The appeal to the Court of Appeal was heard by five judges ([1938] O.R. 200).
Middleton J.A. wrote the principal judgment for the majority, with shorter
concurring judgments by Masten, Fisher and Henderson JJ.A. Latchford C.J.A.
dissented. The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed and the accused
was acquitted. Middleton J.A. examined very closely the evidence led at trial.
Before doing so, he referred to the rule in Hodge’s Case and noted that
it had been approved in this Court in Fraser v. The King, [1936] S.C.R.
1. He referred to Rinfret J.'s quotation of the rule in that case from Wills, On
Circumstantial Evidence, in these terms: 

 

In order to justify the
inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the
innocence of the accused and incapable of any other reasonable hypothesis than
that of guilt.

 

He added that it was not enough that the facts are consistent with
guilt. Middleton J.A. then proceeded to examine closely the nine distinct
points relied upon by the Crown to support its case, and he found in each case
that the evidence was not inconsistent with Comba's innocence. He referred
again to Fraser v. The King, [1936] S.C.R. 296, and quoted the words of
Rinfret J. (as he then was), speaking for the Court in the Fraser case,
at pp. 300‑01:

 

                   It
would appear, therefore, that, when the evidence in a criminal case is purely
circumstantial and at the same time equally consistent with the innocence as
with the guilt of the accused, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England regards
that evidence as insufficient to justify the jury in convicting, holds the
verdict unsatisfactory and quashes the conviction, on the ground that it cannot
be supported, having regard to the evidence.

 

Middleton J.A. then stated (at p. 212):

 

                   Upon
this principle of law it is evident to the majority of the Court that this
verdict must be set aside and the verdict of acquittal recorded.

 

The other judges of the majority agreed with Middleton J.A. Masten J.A.
said, at p. 213:

 

I agree in the conclusion
that the conviction must be quashed on the ground that the Crown's evidence is
not incompatible with the innocence of the accused.

 

Fisher J.A. concluded his concurring reasons with the words (at p.
214):

 

                   My
conclusion is that the evidence is as consistent with the accused's innocence
as with his guilt, and that the jury was not justified in making the finding it
did.

 

Henderson J.A. entirely concurred with Middleton J.A. and said, at p.
215:

 

The chain of events is
consistent with his innocence and inconsistent with his guilt.

 

It is evident then that all four judges of the majority considered and
applied the rule in Hodge's Case to the evidence which had been led at
trial. They all found that the evidence was as consistent with innocence as
with guilt. Thus, it will be seen that Comba, as decided in the Ontario
Court of Appeal, is a ‘no evidence’ case and not inconsistent with the line of
authority which culminates with Ritchie J. in Shephard. It is in this
context that one must consider the words of Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in Comba
in the Supreme Court of Canada. At page 397, he restated the test from Hodge’s
Case in these words:

 

                   It is
admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict rests solely upon a
basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the long settled rule of
the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a
prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the
circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was
committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the
guilty person.

 

58.              He then concluded that the facts did not
have the probative force required to satisfy the rule. He expressed agreement
with the majority of the Court of Appeal, whose reasons he found convincing and
conclusive, that the trial judge should have told the jury that ""in view
of the dubious nature of the evidence, it would be unsafe to find the prisoner
guilty, and to have directed them to return a verdict of acquittal
accordingly"". These are the words that from time to time have caused
uncertainties. It has been suggested that the use of the word `dubious' has
given the trial judge a power or discretion to weigh and consider the quality
of the evidence and to remove it from the jury's consideration. In my view, no
such result occurred. The word `dubious', as used here, must be considered in
the context of the whole case and, particularly, the judgment of the majority
of the Ontario Court of Appeal which Sir Lyman Duff C.J. specifically approved.
The evidence was dubious only because in the application of the test in Hodge's
Case it cast the balance neither way. It led to no result and left no
evidence upon which a conclusion could be based. It is evident then that like
the Court of Appeal, this Court treated Comba as a `no evidence' case.
It is then consistent with past authority. Accordingly, there is no authority
from this Court which is inconsistent with Shephard. 

 

59.              I am aware, of course, that in R. v.
Knox, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 348, and R. v. Sawrenko (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d)
338, the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal for the Yukon
Territory held that, when faced with a motion for a directed verdict in a case
dependent on circumstantial evidence, it was the duty of the trial judge to
decide whether the evidence satisfied the rule in Hodge’s Case. Only if
it did, was the case to go to the jury for determination of guilt or innocence.
In this sense a weighing process or an assessment of quality was contemplated
on the part of the judge. Those cases, however, were effectively overruled in
this Court in R. v. Paul, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181, and Lavoie v. The
Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 193, and even in circumstantial cases the law now is
that any determination as to compliance with the rule in Hodge’s Case
would be left to the jury.

 

60.              The significance of all this is now
somewhat limited because of this Court's decision in R. v. Cooper,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 860, which has placed the rule in Hodge’s Case into the
general consideration of reasonable doubt. In any event on the law as it stood
when Comba was decided, it is clear that Sir Lyman Duff C.J. was treating
circumstantial evidence, which did not comply with the rule in Hodge's Case,
as no evidence at all going to show guilt. In this, he was not disturbing the
long line of authority against directed verdicts where there was some evidence
of guilt.

 

61.              Reliance was placed in argument upon the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in R. v. Duhamel, supra, and
the English case of R. v. Turnbull, supra, upon which it is largely
based. In Turnbull, Lord Widgery C.J., for the Court of Appeal, Criminal
Division (Roskill, Lawton L.JJ., Cusack and May JJ.), stressed the dangers of
injustice that can arise and in some cases have arisen because of errors made
in visual identification of persons charged with crime. At the same time, he
was at pains to make it clear that visual identification could not be
eliminated as admissible evidence in criminal proceedings. He dwelt at length
on the nature and scope of the directions which a trial judge should give to a
jury which had to deal with evidence of visual identification, and he said that
failure to give an adequate direction could result in convictions being
quashed. In all, he was referring to what he described as the quality of the
evidence. He said, at p. 552: 

 

If the quality is good and
remains good at the close of the accused's case, the danger of a mistaken
identification is lessened; but the poorer the quality, the greater the danger.

 

It is impossible to disagree with Lord Widgery C.J. when he speaks of
the danger of error in visual identification. Nobody could disagree with his
assertion of the need for a careful and complete direction to the jury with
regard to their treatment of such evidence. When, however, he introduces the
suggestion that the trial judge should consider the quality of the evidence
and, where he finds it wanting, take the case from the jury, he enters more
controversial ground and authorizes the trial judge to encroach upon the jury's
territory. Such a step blurs or even obliterates the clear line separating the
functions of judge and jury. Questions of credibility and the weight that
should be given to evidence are peculiarly the province of the jury. The term
‘quality’, as applied by Lord Widgery C.J., is really nothing more than a
synonym for ‘weight’. To consider it, the trial judge exceeds his function. I
am fully aware that untruthfulness on the part of a witness is not the only
factor which may render his evidence weak or even useless. The most honest
witness may be mistaken or, by external interference or distraction or by lack
of opportunity to observe, the value of his evidence may be diminished or even
eliminated so that it should receive little if any weight. All these
considerations affect the weight of the evidence and the jury, twelve
indifferent persons who must be unanimous to convict the accused, may with a
careful direction from the trial judge take account of all these relevant
factors and reach a conclusion with at least as much reliability as a single
judge.

 

62.              I do not adopt this position ""out of
deference to the verdict of a jury"". I do so because it merely accords
with the duty the law has imposed upon juries. There may have been a time when
a paternalistic approach to unsophisticated jurors was justified. That time is
now past and modern jurors represent a well‑educated, well‑informed
and experienced cross‑section of our society. If it is unsafe to preserve
in today's world the distinction between the functions of a judge and a jury,
that fact would count as an argument for the entire abolition of the jury
system rather than for a mere change in the law relating to the extent of the
jury's role. This would be a development that I would much regret.

 

63.              Turning to the case at bar, it is
acknowledged that there was direct evidence of identification. It should have
been left to the jury, with a proper caution in the terms suggested in Turnbull.
I would therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the direction for a new trial.
I agree with Hall J.A. that any question regarding the allegedly improper
police procedures in connection with the later identification in the courtroom
should be left for the new trial. 

 

                   The reasons of Lamer and La Forest JJ. were
delivered by

 

64.              Lamer
J. (dissenting)‑‑The issue in this appeal can be
simply stated as follows: Did the trial judge err in law in directing a verdict
of acquittal despite the fact that there was some evidence as to the
identification of the accused?

 

65.              The appellant was tried for rape before a
jury in the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba. The accused at trial and
throughout does not contest the fact that the victim was raped. He takes issue
solely with her identification of him as her assailant. She was the only
witness as regards that issue. At the close of the Crown's case, Wright J.
granted a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. The Court of Appeal, one
judge dissenting, allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial: (1983),
35 C.R. (3d) 272. The accused comes to this Court as of right under s. 618(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

 

The Facts

 

66.              On June 13, 1982, at approximately 12:45
a.m., the complainant was walking down Water Avenue in Winnipeg. She was
attacked by a man who grabbed her around the neck and pulled her behind the
C.N.R. sheds on Water Avenue, where he proceeded to sexually assault her. The
complainant managed to escape and ran to the street where she was rescued by a
passing motorist. According to the complainant, the entire incident took about
twenty minutes. The complainant stated that before being dragged behind the
shed she had an opportunity to see the man's face when he was beside her and
that she had a front view of his face long enough to see him. She admitted it
was dark behind the shed area but said that she was still able to see her
attacker's face.

 

67.              The most comprehensive summary of the
identification evidence is to be found in Matas J.A.'s reasons in the Court of
Appeal at pp. 278‑81:

 

                    The
complainant described her assailant to the police on three occasions. The first
description was given in the early morning of 13th June, a short time after the
attack. Later in the day, at about 2:00 p.m., the complainant gave a
description to a different police officer. And on 17th June, she described her
assailant to a police artist in order to have a sketch prepared.

 

                    At the
first interview, according to the police officer, the attacker was described as
male, white, 26 years old, with a chubby build, squinty eyes, a large mouth and
dark short hair. (The police officer noted this description of the assailant's
hair because the complainant said that the hair came to the top of the
assailant's ears.) The assailant was said to be wearing a blue coat, blue jeans
and suede shoes.

 

                    At the
second interview, the police officer was told that the assailant was male,
white, 26 years of age, 5 feet 9 inches to 5 feet 10 inches, with a heavy
build, chunky and muscular, squinty eyes, that he had dark hair just below the
ears, and that he was wearing blue jeans, dark‑coloured shoes, a light‑coloured
T‑shirt, and a blue three quarter‑length smock‑type jacket
with large patch pockets on each side.

 

                    The
complainant did not say anything about eye colour or skin tone or colour. At
the trial, she admitted she would not have been able to give that information
because the attacker was always in a dark area and it was difficult to tell
colours.

 

                    The
description given by the complainant to the police artist at the opening of
their session was that the assailant was male, Caucasian (with ‘some Indian
mix’), 27 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches, over 200 pounds and muscular, and
that he was wearing a three‑quarter‑length blue jacket, a beige‑coloured
T‑shirt, jeans and ""hush‑puppy""‑style shoes.This
was the first time actual weight was mentioned and was the first reference to
Indian background. Further discussion between the artist and the complainant
resulted in the sketch which was filed in court as Ex. 1. The complainant said
she thought that the sketch resembled her attacker but she had a feeling
something was missing. At the trial, the artist said Mr. Mezzo did not appear
to have an Indian background. 

 

                    Mr.
Mezzo was arrested on 27th June, 1982, about two weeks after the attack on the
complainant in this case. The complainant and two police officers testified
about the in‑court or docket identification of Mr. Mezzo which took place
on 28th June and 30th June, 1982.

 

                    It was
not suggested to the complainant that she take part in an identification line‑up.

 

                    Constable
Steinthorson telephoned the complainant on 27th June to ask her to come to the
Public Safety Building the next day for the courtroom identification. The
complainant met Constable Steinthorson at 9:00 a.m. the next morning. Constable
Steinthorson suspected Mr. Mezzo was her assailant. He knew Mr. Mezzo well enough
to know what he looked like and to identify him. He told the complainant that
they would be doing a courtroom identification; she was to accompany him to the
courtroom, where a number of persons would appear. The complainant expected to
see her attacker, but she did not know when. She also knew he was in jail.

 

                    At
about 10:00 a.m. the complainant went into the courtroom. She sat on the left
side of the public gallery, in the third row, with a rape crisis worker and
Constable Steinthorson. The prisoners came into the courtroom from a door on
the left. At about 10:45 a.m., when Mr. Mezzo, the fifth prisoner, came in and
sat down, the police officer saw the complainant react visibly by shaking and
moving from side to side. Mr. Mezzo was about 20 to 25 feet away from the
complainant. He was in the courtroom about 90 seconds. Shortly after Mr.
Mezzo's appearance, the complainant left the courtroom at the suggestion of the
police officer.

 

                    The
complainant told the police officer that Mr. Mezzo looked like her assailant
but she was not sure. Nevertheless, Constable Steinthorson felt that the
complainant had identified Mr. Mezzo as her attacker.

 

                    The
complainant explained to the court that she had not been sure of the
identification because her view of Mr. Mezzo was obstructed by a sheriff who
was standing beside Mr. Mezzo. She said she did not get a good look at Mr.
Mezzo for that reason.

 

                    The
police were unable to say whether Mr. Mezzo's name was called, or whether the
offence he was charged with was mentioned. No evidence was available about who
the previous prisoners were or what they looked like. Constable Steinthorson
agreed on cross‑examination that: `So as far as we know, the only
individual who came forward that morning who was of the rough description that
the complainant had originally given was Michael Mezzo.'

 

                    Later,
the complainant received a call from Constable Legge, who said he wanted her to
come in and identify some people. Constable Legge had become involved in the
case on 27th June. In his direct examination he explained his purpose in this
way:

 

 ""I indicated to her
at that time that in the course of our investigation we had a suspect in the
matter of the attack upon herself and we wished her to accompany myself to a
courtroom on that day and to view all the persons in the courtroom that day to
see if there is anything she could tell me about anyone in the courtroom.""

 

                    On
30th June, Constable Legge and the complainant seated themselves in the
courtroom in the first row, but this time on the right‑hand side. They
were 30 to 35 feet away from the prisoner. Although Constable Legge said he had
asked the Crown attorney to arrange not to call Mr. Mezzo's name, the name was
called. By coincidence, Mr. Mezzo was again the fifth person to come out of the
one door into the courtroom. The complainant positively identified Mr. Mezzo as
her assailant.

 

                    At the
preliminary hearing, the complainant identified Mr. Mezzo as her assailant. The
only people in the courtroom on that occasion were the judge, the Crown
attorney, Mr. Mezzo's lawyer and Mr. Mezzo.

 

                    At the
trial, the complainant identified a photograph of Mr. Mezzo, taken in June
1982, and identified the accused in the box. She described her assailant as 5
feet 8 inches to 5 feet 9 inches, 185 to 200 pounds, husky, 26 years of age,
with dark black hair, ear‑length, an oval face, squinty eyes, a long and
pudgy nose, a full mouth and lips, and dark tone skin similar to native in
racial origin. She said he had been wearing a beige T‑shirt, blue jeans,
dark suede shoes, and a navy blue jacket, three‑quarter length, like a
hip jacket, of heavy‑weight nylon.

 

                    The
description of the jacket corresponded to the jacket seized from Mr. Mezzo and
filed in court as an exhibit. It was different from her earlier descriptions.
And the description of Mr. Mezzo at the trial was more in accord with his
actual appearance in June 1982 than the first descriptions given by the
complainant to the police. 

 

The Law

 

68.              This Court's latest pronouncement as
regards the test to be applied by a judge when deciding a motion for a directed
verdict is to be found in the reasons of Ritchie J., writing for the majority
in United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067. It was
there reiterated that it was the same test as that to be applied by a Justice
of the Peace when deciding whether to commit an accused to trial. That test is
set out in s. 475  of the Criminal Code  as being whether ""in his
opinion the evidence is"" (or is not) ""sufficient to put the accused
on trial"". Before this Court's decision in Shephard, that test had
been interpreted in three different ways: the probable guilt test, the prima
facie case test where the judge cannot weigh the evidence at all to
determine sufficiency, and the prima facie test where the judge does
weigh the evidence.

 

69.              The Shephard decision has put to
rest the debate between probable guilt as against the prima facie test,
and comes down on the side of the proponents of the prima facie test.
But while there was agreement as regards the exclusion of the probable guilt
test, the Court divided as to the formulation of the prima facie test
and as to whether and to what extent the evidence could be weighed.

 

70.              Ritchie J. stated that the test laid down
in R. v. Comba, [1938] S.C.R. 396, was limited to cases where the
evidence was circumstantial and the test he laid down for the majority as to
the ""sufficiency"" of the evidence is as follows, at p. 1080:

 

... whether or not there
is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a
verdict of guilty. The `justice', in accordance with this principle, is, in my
opinion, required to commit an accused person for trial in any case in which
there is admissible evidence which could, if it were believed, result in a
conviction.

 

71.              In Shephard, an extradition case,
the evidence was that of an accomplice who gave affidavit evidence in which he
acknowledged that, if he co‑operated and gave successful evidence against
Shephard to the satisfaction of the American prosecuting authorities, all
charges against him would be dropped. It was common ground, that the test to be
applied by a judge in extradition matters is the same as that of a judge
sitting at a preliminary inquiry or a judge deciding a motion for a directed
verdict. I might mention that some cases have suggested that an extradition
judge's discretion may be more restrictive, but this has no bearing on this
case and I need not enter into that issue.

 

72.              In Shephard, Ritchie J. said that
(at p. 1084) ""Credibility in my view must always be a question for the
jury"" and not the judge, and (at p. 1087) ""I cannot accept the
proposition that a trial judge is ever entitled to take a case from the jury
and direct an acquittal on the ground that, in his opinion, the evidence
is `manifestly unreliable'.""

 

73.              The minority said the test was that which
had been set out in R. v. Comba, supra. Spence J. writing for the
minority said at p. 1076: 

 

 I am of the opinion that
the trial judge, upon considering whether he should direct a verdict at the
close of the Crown's case, has a discretion to direct a verdict not confined
only to those cases where the evidence was wholly circumstantial. Rather, his
discretion is, in the words of Chief Justice Duff, ‘whether the evidence is of
such a dubious nature as to be dangerous’. In Puerto Rico v. Hernandez, supra,
the evidence was dubious and dangerous to use as a basis for conviction because
the witness purported to make observations which the learned trial judge
believed were impossible. In the present case, the evidence is dangerous and
dubious because it was given by a witness who was quite evidently acting in
hope of a reward which had been promised to him in detail. I use Thurlow J.'s
words in Hernandez, ‘I find it inconceivable that a person should be put
on trial on such flimsy evidence ...’.

 

74.              At first blush, Ritchie J.'s unqualified
reference to ""credibility"" and ""unreliability"" could
support the proposition that the weight to be given to a witness' testimony is
the exclusive realm of the jury. But this interpretation does not survive a
closer analysis of his reasons in Shephard.

 

75.              The probative value, the weight to be
given to a witness' testimony, is resultant of an assessment of (1) the
witness' sincerity, honesty, and, (2) the witness' capacity to be accurate.
When Ritchie J. in Shephard, refers to a witness' credibility, or to the
reliability of the evidence, I take it, given the issue in that case, that he
was referring to the witness' honesty, not to the witness' capacity to be
accurate or not to be honestly mistaken.

 

76.              For this interpretation I find support in
Ritchie J.'s comments on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in the case of Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez, [1973] F.C. 1206. In Hernandez the
evidence was identification and what was then at issue was not the witness'
honesty but the witness' accuracy. Ritchie J. said at pp. 1087‑88:

 

                    I also
differ from the learned Chief Justice of the Federal Court in that I consider
there to be a clear distinction in principle between this case and that of Hernandez.
In the latter case Mr. Justice Thurlow characterized the evidence which the
extradition judge had found to be insufficient to justify the issuing of a
warrant for extradition, in the following paragraph:

 

                    After
having read and re‑read the evidence of the witnesses, Atilano and Ortiz
and after hearing the very able argument of counsel for the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico I am not persuaded that the evidence was reasonably sufficient to
warrant putting the respondent on trial. Indeed, I find it inconceivable that a
person should be put on trial on such flimsy evidence as a purported
identification made a year after the event by a person who did not previously
know the accused and whose only opportunity to observe him was a fleeting one
from a distance of some sixty feet, if indeed he ever got that close. The
evidence of the witness having selected the respondent's identification card is
not in itself evidence implicating the respondent, and in the circumstances as
described it tends to weaken rather than strengthen the identification made by
Atilano at the hearing ... Nor was there anything else to implicate the
respondent or corroborate such identification.

 

                    It
thus appears to me clear that in that case it was held that there was not
enough evidence to support a prima facie case against the accused and in
fact that it was `inconceivable that a person should be put on trial on such
flimsy evidence'. It was upon this ground that the extradition judge in that
case based his opinion as to insufficiency.

 

Ritchie J. thus distinguishes Shephard from Hernandez by
specifically referring to the witness' capacity to be accurate.

 

77.              When commenting on Comba, Ritchie
J. said at pp. 1081‑82:

 

                    It is
to be observed that there was no suggestion in the Comba case that any
of the evidence called by the Crown was either tainted or unreliable. It
came from witnesses whose integrity was at no time put in question and who
testified as to a variety of circumstances which had excited enough suspicion
against the accused to occasion his arrest and trial but which taken together
did not establish his guilt in accordance with the accepted standards of proof
in such cases which are described by Duff C.J. in the following passage: 

 

                    It is
admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict rests solely upon a
basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the long settled rule of
the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a
prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the
circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was
committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the
guilty person.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Here again Ritchie J. focuses on the distinction between accuracy and
honesty, this time by highlighting in the Comba test the fact that the
honesty of the witnesses, their ""integrity"", to use his words, was
not in issue and therefore was not being weighed by the judge.

 

78.              The distinction between a witness'
truthfulness and a witness' accuracy has sometimes been made by referring to
the former as the witness' credibility, and to the latter as the quality
of the witness' testimony. (See amongst others, R. v. Turnbull, [1976] 3
All E.R. 549 (C.A.); R. v. Sutton, [1970] 2 O.R. 358 (C.A.); R. v.
Spatola, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 241 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Duhamel, [1981] 1 W.W.R.
22 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Atfield (1983), 42 A.R. 294 (C.A.))

 

79.              My reading of the majority reasons in Shephard
is that when assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, that is when
determining whether ""there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury
properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty"", the judge cannot
assess the witness' honesty but may assess the witness' capacity to be accurate
and his or her resulting reliability. If I am wrong in reading that distinction
in Ritchie J.'s reasons, then I propose that this Court find that to be the
proper test. This is not a proper case for reconsidering Shephard with a
view to adopting the views of the minority; we have not been invited to do so,
nor do the issues in this case raise the matter squarely.

 

80.              ""Quality"" of evidence is truly
the realm of the trial judge. I could not put matters better than by quoting in
support of this proposition what Lord Devlin said in Trial by Jury
(1966), at pp. 62‑63, speaking of the trial judge's function:

 

... if he is not satisfied
that there is evidence on which reasonable men could act, he must not let the
case go to the jury. Again, so stated, the rule might seem to be a commonplace.
If there is not evidence upon which reasonable men could act, it must be
immaterial whether the case is left to the jury or not since their verdict
could only be negative. So the rule would be otiose were it not for the fact
that judges and juries can take a different view of what reasonable men should
think. When there is such a difference, it is not, as might be supposed, the
view of the jury who ex officio are the reasonable men that prevails,
but the view of the judge. This understood, the rule can be restated in its
true terms: the verdict cannot be supported unless a reasonable lawyer
thinks that there is evidence upon which reasonable men could act. There
can be no doubt about the difference between the reasonable lawyer and the
reasonable man. When twelve men unanimously return a certain verdict, they must
believe that there is evidence to support it. When the judge rejects their
verdict, he is not really telling them that not a single one among them is a
reasonable man. What he is telling them is that there is a certain minimum of
evidence which the law requires and that as a trained lawyer he is a better
judge than they are of what that minimum should be. What the minimum should
be is not a question of law but a question for lawyers.

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

81.              When applied to circumstantial evidence
this would mean that the question as to whether and to what extent the evidence
is dubious will be determined assuming the witnesses are being truthful. The
question would be: ""Would it be unsafe to convict?"" This would
involve, given the particular nature of circumstantial evidence, asking whether
innocence can be logically and reasonably excluded. Morris J. Fish, in
""Committal for Trial: ‘Some’ Evidence is Not ‘Sufficient’ ""
(1979), 39 R. du B. 607, at p. 618, suggests the following test, which I
would adopt:

 

 If guilt and innocence
are equally consistent with the facts, there is no evidence. If guilt is
more probable than innocence, there is some evidence, but unless
innocence can be logically and reasonably excluded, the evidence
is insufficient and the case should end with a discharge, non‑suit
or directed verdict. Finally, if innocence can be logically and
reasonably excluded, the evidence is sufficient and may be considered by
the trier of fact. Conviction will not automatically ensue. The trier of fact,
it need hardly be repeated, will only convict if ‘convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable
explanation of the facts established by the evidence’.

 

                    It has
somewhere been said that semantics teaches us to take our exercise in other
ways than by jumping to conclusions. In this vein, there is a purpose to the
foregoing discussion. A justice or judge should not jump to the conclusion that
there is evidence for a jury to consider whenever the facts are consistent with
guilt. He is bound to consider whether guilt can (not, of course, will)
properly and reasonably be inferred from the evidence. And he must bear in mind
that reasonableness is a question for him, not the jury:...

 

82.              When applied to testimonial evidence this
approach involves an assessment by the judge of the circumstances under which
the witness purports to be, not truthful (as in Shephard), but accurate
(as in Hernandez and in this case). The reliability of the witness'
accuracy may be undermined by the circumstances under which the witness was
called upon to register what he later on relates in the belief that it was and
still is accurate. This might be, when considering the accuracy of
identification testimony, the fact that the witness had only ""a fleeting
glance"", or had a ""longer observation"" but one ""made in
difficult circumstances""; or again the result of improper police
identification proceedings that would tend to induce the witness into
mistakingly identifying someone.

 

83.              A final observation. The only difference
in my view between the majority and the minority in Shephard is whether
the judge can assess the truthfulness of witnesses when assessing whether there
is sufficient evidence. With respect, I fail to see any essential difference
between the test expressed in Comba, and that expressed by the majority
in Shephard. The Comba formulation focuses on the nature of the
evidence (dubious) and the resulting unsafe conviction, while the Shephard
test focuses on the unreasonableness of the jury in founding a guilty verdict
on the evidence of a given case. A reasonable jury that was properly instructed
(the Shephard test), would never return a verdict of guilty ""where
the only evidence is of such dubious nature"" that the verdict of guilty
would be ""unsafe"" (the Comba test). I personally prefer the Shephard
formulation of the test. It is expressed in terms that apply to all kinds of
evidence while the Comba formulation more easily befits the kind of
assessment one would make when considering circumstantial evidence. What really
divided the Court in Shephard when assessing the quality of the evidence
was the fact that the minority was of the view that the judge could, whatever
the formulation of the test, consider the affiant's honesty while the majority
found that he could not. Now to come back to this case. 

 

The Trial Judge

 

84.              It is the appellant's position that the
trial judge in the case under appeal applied the test laid down by the majority
in Shephard and that he did not, nor did he need to on the facts of this
case (as would have been permissible under certain circumstances had the
opinion of the minority in Shephard prevailed in any way), consider the
witness' underlying credibility. He addressed the problem, says the appellant,
by considering the quality of the identification evidence, not by
weighing the witness' truthfulness.

 

85.              The trial judge's decision to grant the
motion for a directed verdict of acquittal rested on the finding that the
identification evidence was of too poor a quality to be relied upon. This
finding as regards the quality of that evidence is the resultant of two other
findings of fact: the difficult conditions under which the victim made her
observations as regards the identity of her aggressor and the improper police
identification procedures. He assumed she was being truthful and withdrew the
case because it was too dangerous to rest a conviction on her testimony, honest
as it might well have been. This I conclude from a general reading of his
reasons given in Court to the parties in the absence of the jury, and more
particularly the following passage:

 

                    I am
influenced significantly as to the law by the unanimous judgment of the Alberta
Court of Appeal in R. v. Duhamel, 1981, 1 W.W.R., 22 wherein Mr. Justice
Harradence quotes approvingly and at length from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal in England in R. v. Turnbull, 1976, 3 All England Reports, 549.
In particular I refer to pages 28 and 29 of the Duhamel judgement wherein Mr.
Justice Harradence sets out the principles expressed in Turnbull relative to
the potential for miscarriage of justice based on visual identification.
Towards the end of the statement of those principles the following declaration
is made and I would say is made in no uncertain terms:

 

 ""When, in the
judgment of the trial judge, the quality of the identifying evidence is poor, as
for example when it depends solely on a fleeting glance or on a longer
observation made in difficult conditions, the situation is very different. The
judge should then withdraw the case from the jury and direct an acquittal
unless there is other evidence which goes to support the correctness of that
identification.""

 

                    I miss
out a line which I do not think is relevant and continue:

 

 ""For example, X sees
the accused snatch a woman's handbag; he gets only a fleeting glance of the
thief's face as he runs off but he does see him entering a nearby house. Later
he picks out the accused on an identity parade. If there was no more evidence
than this, the poor quality of the identification would require the judge to
withdraw the case from the jury;""

 

Assistance in determining
the measurement of poor quality evidence as identified by the court in Turnbull
can be found in the paragraph immediately preceding the portion that I have
just quoted. This paragraph reads:

 

 ""All these matters
go to the quality of the identification evidence. If the quality is good and
remains good at the close of the accused's case, the danger of a mistaken
identification is lessened: but the poorer the quality, the greater the danger.
In our judgment, when the quality is good, as for example when the
identification is made after a long period of observation, or in satisfactory
conditions by a relative, a neighbour, a close friend, a workmate and the like,
the jury can safely be left to assess the value of the identifying evidence
even though there is no other evidence to support it; provided always, however,
that an adequate warning has been given about the special need for caution.Were
the courts to adjudge otherwise, affronts to justice would frequently
occur.""

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

86.              It is clear from this passage that the
judge was addressing his mind to an assessment of the quality of the
identification evidence. With ""quality"" in mind, he then considered
the circumstances of the observation and the police identification procedures.
As regards the conditions under which the observations were made, he said:

 

Now, it appears to me that
it follows from this statement that where the evidence of identification is
dependent solely on a witness who had no previous knowledge of an accused
person and whose opportunity for observation has been in difficult
circumstances, that evidence, in the view of the English Court of Appeal,
cannot be safely left with the jury.

 

                    In the
present case I am satisfied there is no evidence going to the correctness of
the identification other than that emanating from the complainant. The
complainant had only a very limited and restrictive opportunity to observe her
assailant. Although she may have been in his presence for as long as 20
minutes, the circumstances were such that her observations of the assailant
were made in very difficult conditions. The place where she was first
apprehended provided minimum lighting and the place behind the CNR shed where
the attack proceeded and where it is evident most of the 20 minutes, if it was
that, was spent, was very dark indeed. The complainant's description of her
assailant, although matching the accused in many respects, is, nevertheless,
one that could match any number of persons and contains no special identifying
characteristics. I have concluded that these facts fall squarely within the
directions in Turnbull, approved by the Alberta Court of Appeal, and even where
there has been a proper or adequate identity parade, require that the case be
taken from the jury.

 

As regards the police procedure, Wright J. said:

 

                   In the
present case there is the additional factor that I do not believe the procedure
followed by the police in the subsequent identification of the accused by the
complainant at the police station was proper and that fact has further
damaged the complainant's identification evidence.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

He reviewed the authorities on point, made reference to R. v. Faryna
(1982), 18 Man. R. (2d) 185 (C.A.), and read out the following passage in R.
v. Smierciak (1946), 87 C.C.C. 175 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 177, to which the
court in Faryna referred:

 

... of the utmost
importance, is the method used to recall or refresh the recollections of a
witness who is to be relied upon to identify a person suspected of wrongdoing
or who is under arrest. If a witness has no previous knowledge of the accused
person so as to make him familiar with that person's appearance, the greatest
care ought to be used to ensure the absolute independence and freedom of
judgment of the witness. His recognition ought to proceed without suggestion,
assistance or bias created directly or indirectly. Conversely, if the means
employed to obtain evidence of identification involve any acts which might
reasonably prejudice the accused, the value of the evidence may be partially
or wholly destroyed. Anything which tends to convey to a witness that a
person is suspected by the authorities, or is charged with an offence, is
obviously prejudicial and wrongful. Submitting a prisoner alone for scrutiny
after arrest is unfair and unjust.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Wright J. then concluded on this latter point as follows:

 

So it is clear I think
from the comments that I have made, the observations I have expressed, that I
am unable to find that the identification procedure followed reasonably meets
the standards expressed in the law that the Manitoba Court of Appeal has
approved. So this then becomes an added reason for concluding, as I have,
that the motion of the defence should be accepted in favour of a directed
verdict of acquittal and that is what I now propose to do. So we will call the
jury in.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

When the jury returned, Wright J. gave them only a summary of the law
in support of his reasons for his decision, as is apparent from his first
remarks to them: 

 

                    I am
going to read you a small portion of the law that is applicable in order
that you will understand what is taking place. The law, you will recall, I am
the one who decides as to its correctness or not and which I am applying at
this time is as follows:

 

 ""When in the
judgment of the trial judge the quality of the identifying evidence is poor as,
for example, when it depends solely on a fleeting glance or on a longer
observation made in difficult conditions, the judge should then withdraw the
case from the jury and direct an acquittal unless there is other evidence which
goes to support the correctness of the identification.""

 

                    That
statement of the law is made in the context of the issue of identification. And
as you all know that really is the issue that we have narrowed this case down
to.

 

                    I have
reviewed the evidence carefully that has been introduced by the Crown and you
have heard the Crown indicate that the Crown's evidence was complete earlier. I
have concluded as a matter of law that the circumstances are such as to fall
squarely within the framework of that statement that I just quoted to you. That
means that at this point I have to withdraw the case from you and direct this
verdict of acquittal.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

87.              I mention the difference between his
remarks to the jury and his reasons given previously in their absence, because
the former appear, when read out of context, to be elevating the ""fleeting
glance"" or ""difficult conditions"" situations to the level of a
test, whilst they are but relevant factual elements upon which a conclusion as
regards the quality of the evidence will be based.

 

The Court of Appeal

 

88.              In his dissenting reasons Matas J.A.
agreed with the trial judge and would have directed a verdict of acquittal. He
did express some concern as regards a possible misconstruction by the trial
judge of the applicable test at pp. 282‑83:

 

                    In my
respectful opinion, Wright J. takes the applicable principles expressed in Turnbull
too far if he meant to say that a judge should take a case from a jury
whenever identification of an accused is dependent solely on an identifying
witness who has no previous knowledge of the accused and whose opportunity for
observation has been in difficult circumstances. Many crimes of violence, for
example, rape or robbery, are committed in the absence of a witness other than
the victim and in the absence of independent corroborating evidence. And it
would be rare if the circumstances of the offence would not be difficult.
Depending on the circumstances of the case, it may be that the only just course
would be to direct a verdict of acquittal, as I think it was here. But the
decision to direct a verdict of acquittal must depend on the circumstances of
the case.

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

89.              Of course he is right, given the
hypothesis he postulates. The majority shared this concern. But the essence of
their decision was different and is found at p. 277 where Hall J.A., writing
for himself and Monnin C.J., stated that the error of law committed by the
trial judge was the misapplication of the proper test to the facts of the case.

 

                    It is
very easy to attribute to evidence the quality of being dubious, and therefore
a view to that effect should be arrived at with restraint and not lightly if we
are to have due regard for the process of trial by jury. In my view, the
evidence of identification in the present case was sufficient for the jury to
have passed on it after proper directions and instructions by the presiding
judge. In that respect, the error of law of the trial judge was not so much in
adopting the wrong test but in misapplying the test in Turnbull, supra,
to the facts of the case. The preferable language to employ is that set out in Comba,
supra, and adopted in Duhamel, supra.

 

90.              It appears to me, when reading all of
Wright J.'s reasons, that he applied the proper test, found the quality of the
evidence such that it would be unsafe to rest a conviction upon it, and
directed a verdict of acquittal. The manner in which he referred to ""the
fleeting glance"" and ""difficult conditions"" situations offers
some footing for the conclusion that he turned the examples into a test. But
the context in which these references were made was one where he specifically
referred in general terms to the ""quality"" of the identification as
being the purpose of the scrutiny. Added to that is the fact that it is
obviously the ""quality test"" that was on his mind when he addressed
the question whether the improper police procedure had ""partially or
wholly destroyed"" the ""value of the evidence"". The majority of the
Court of Appeal found that it would not have been unsafe to convict, while
Matas J.A. shared the trial judge's view that it would. This did not in my view
raise a question of law alone in the Court of Appeal, and the Crown's appeal
should have been dismissed.

 

91.              I would therefore allow this appeal and
restore the acquittal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Procuring ‑‑
Attempt to procure person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another
person ‑‑ Advertisement for secretary/sales assistant ‑‑
Interview indicating job requiring sexual intercourse with clients if necessary
to close sales ‑‑ Holding out of large financial rewards ‑‑
No offer of employment made ‑‑ Whether appellant's act or
statements constitute attempt to procure rather than mere preparation ‑‑
Whether sexual intercourse contemplated by appellant illicit sexual intercourse
within s. 195(1)(a) of the Criminal Code ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, s. 195(1)(a).

 








                   Appellant, who was in the business of selling
franchises of various kinds, placed advertisements in several newspapers for a
secretary/sales assistant. He conducted interviews with three female applicants
and with a police officer who posed as an applicant and recorded the interview
on a tape recorder. Appellant indicated to the applicants that a
secretary/sales assistant would be expected to have sexual intercourse with
clients or potential clients of the company where that appeared to be necessary
to conclude a contract. He also indicated that a successful secretary/sales
assistant could earn as much as $100,000 annually through commission or bonus
on the sale of franchises. Appellant did not make an offer of employment to any
of the three applicants who became uninterested after hearing the requirements
of the position. The police officer, while not made an offer, was told to think
it over and let appellant know when she expressed an interest in the position
notwithstanding its requirements. At trial, appellant was acquitted of counts
of (1) attempting to procure female persons to become common prostitutes and
(2) attempting to procure female persons to have illicit intercourse with
another person. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from acquittal on the
first count, but allowed the appeal with respect to the second and ordered a
new trial. Appellant appealed. At issue here are: (1) whether appellant's acts
or statements could, as a matter of law, constitute an attempt to procure
rather than mere preparation; and (2) whether the sexual intercourse
contemplated by appellant would be illicit sexual intercourse within s. 195(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   Per Beetz, McIntyre,
Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: The word ""illicit"" in s. 195(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code  must be given the meaning that has been assigned by
the weight of judicial opinion to the word ""unlawful"" in comparable
legislative tests‑‑as referring to sexual intercourse not
authorized or sanctioned by lawful marriage. The alternative meaning‑‑sexual
intercourse prohibited by the criminal law or other enactment of positive law‑‑apart
from reducing the scope of the offence of procuring a person to have illicit
sexual intercourse with another person so as to make it rarely, if ever,
applicable, is not reconcilable with other provisions of the Criminal Code .

 

                   The evil to which s. 195(1) (a) is directed is
procuring or soliciting, not the actual act of sexual intercourse itself. The
provision is parallel to and of the same kind as that in s. 195(1) (d),
which makes it an offence to procure a person to become a prostitute although
prostitution is not itself a crime. This is true of all the offences created by
s. 195. They are directed to conduct which is designed to encourage or promote
conduct which itself is not criminal. If fault be found with that legislative
policy it is for Parliament to make the necessary changes, not for the court to
do so by giving the word ""illicit"" in s. 195(1) (a) such a
restricted meaning as not only to give s. 195(1) (a) a very limited, if
not improbable application, but also to restrict very severely the application
of other important provisions of the Criminal Code  for the protection of
girls and women in which the words ""illicit sexual intercourse"" are
used. 

 

                   No satisfactory general criterion has been, or can
be, formulated for drawing the line between preparation and attempt. The
application of this distinction to the facts of a particular case must be left
to common sense judgment.

 

                   The distinction between preparation and attempt is
essentially a qualitative one, involving the relationship between the nature
and quality of the act in question and the nature of the complete offence,
although consideration must be given, in making that qualitative distinction,
to the relative proximity of the act in question to what would have been the
completed offence, in terms of time, location and acts under the control of the
accused remaining to be accomplished.

 

                   Relative proximity may give an act, which might
otherwise appear to be mere preparation, the quality of attempt. But an act
which on its face is an act of commission does not lose its quality as the actus
reus of attempt because further acts were required or because a significant
period of time may have elapsed before the completion of the offence.

 

                   The Court of Appeal's finding, that the offence of
procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person is
not committed unless sexual intercourse actually takes place, was accepted for
the purposes of deciding whether appellant's acts could, as a matter of law,
constitute the actus reus of an attempt to procure.

 

                   If the appellant had the necessary intent to induce
or persuade the women to seek employment that would require them to have sexual
intercourse with prospective clients, then the holding out of the large
financial rewards in the course of the interviews, in which the necessity of
having sexual intercourse with prospective clients was disclosed, could
constitute the actus reus of an attempt to procure. It would clearly be
an important step in the commission of the offence. Before an offer of
employment could be made in such circumstances an applicant would have to seek
the position, despite its special requirement. Thus such inducement or
persuasion would be the decisive act in the procuring. There would be little
else that the appellant would be required to do towards the completion of the
offence other than make the formal offer of employment. The holding out of the
large financial rewards in the course of the interviews would not lose its
quality as a step in the commission of the offence, and thus as an actus
reus of attempt, because a considerable period of time might elapse before
a person engaged for the position had sexual intercourse with prospective
clients or because of the otherwise contingent nature of such sexual
intercourse.

 

                   Per Lamer J.:
Agreement with Le Dain J.'s broad definition of ""illicit sexual
intercouse"" was only to the extent that those words were resorted to in s.
195(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . Accepting such a wide definition
depended on the fact that an essential ingredient of ""procuring"" or
of ""soliciting"" under s. 195(1) (a) was that what was being
done was done for lucre, gain, or some advantage.

                   APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 41, allowing in part the Crown's appeal from an
acquittal by Graburn Co. Ct. J. and ordering a new trial on the charge of
procuring females for illicit sexual intercourse. Appeal dismissed.

on his own behalf.

 

                   David Doherty,
for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of Beetz, McIntyre, Wilson and Le Dain
JJ. was delivered by 

 

1.                Le
Dain J.‑‑This appeal, which involves a charge of attempting
to procure a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person
contrary to s. 195(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , raises two issues:
the distinction between attempt and mere preparation, and the meaning of
""illicit sexual intercourse"".

 

2.                The appeal is from the judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal on March 17, 1983 setting aside the acquittal of the
appellant by Graburn Co. Ct. J. on August 13, 1982 of the charge of attempting
to procure a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person and
ordering a new trial of the appellant on that charge.

 

                                                                     I

 

3.                During the period covered by the
indictment, which is the three months ending on or about September 3, 1981, the
appellant was carrying on a business known as Global Franchises Marketing,
which was engaged in selling franchises of various kinds. During this period
the appellant placed an advertisement in newspapers in Ottawa, Hamilton and
Toronto inviting applications for the position of secretary/sales assistant and
conducted interviews with three women who responded to the advertisement and
with a police officer who posed as an applicant for the position and recorded
the interview on a tape recorder. The advertisement read as follows:

 

                                                      ENJOY TRAVEL

 

SECRETARY‑‑Sales
Assistant to Sales Executive. $600‑‑$800 per month to start plus
commission, bonuses, company benefits and expenses. Must be free to travel
extensively. Call 746‑2440 ask for Mel.

 

In the interviews the appellant indicated that a secretary/sales
assistant would be expected to have sexual intercourse with clients or
potential clients of the company where that appeared to be necessary to
conclude a contract. The appellant also indicated that a successful
secretary/sales assistant could earn as much as $100,000 per year through
commission or bonus on the sale of franchises. The appellant did not make an
offer of employment to the three applicants who testified at his trial. After
hearing what the position required they said they were not interested and the
interviews terminated. Nor did he make an offer of employment to the police
officer who posed as an applicant, but when she told him she was interested in
the position, despite its requirements, he told her to think it over and let
him know.

 

4.                The appellant was tried upon an
indictment containing two counts: attempting to procure female persons to
become common prostitutes, and attempting to procure female persons to have
illicit intercourse with another person. Graburn Co. Ct. J. acquitted the
appellant on both counts. He found that the appellant intended that a person
hired for the position should have sexual relations with clients or potential
clients, but he held, as a matter of law, that the acts or statements of the appellant
did not, in the absence of an offer of employment, constitute the actus reus
of an attempt to procure. In his opinion they were mere preparation. He
accordingly did not find it necessary to decide whether the sexual intercourse
contemplated by the appellant would be illicit sexual intercourse within s.
195(1) (a) or make those who engaged in it common prostitutes within s.
195(1) (d), as it then read.

 

5.                The Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin,
Houlden and Robins JJ.A.) (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 41, dismissed the appeal from
the acquittal on the charge of attempting to procure female persons to become
common prostitutes, but allowed the appeal from the acquittal on the charge of
attempting to procure female persons to have illicit sexual intercourse with
another person and directed a new trial of the appellant on that count of the
indictment. The Court held that the trial judge erred in concluding that the
acts or statements of the appellant could not, in the absence of an offer of
employment, constitute an attempt to procure rather than mere preparation. It
held that there was evidence from which the trial judge could have concluded
that there was both the mens rea and the actus reus
required for an attempt to procure. The Court also held that the sexual
intercourse contemplated by the appellant would be illicit sexual intercourse
within s. 195(1) (a). The appellant appeals from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal with respect to the second count of the indictment.

 

6.                The appellant, who appeared in person on
the appeal, expressed his grounds of appeal in several different ways, but in
my opinion there are only two issues that require consideration by the Court:

 

1.                Whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding
that the acts or statements of the appellant could, as a matter of law,
constitute an attempt to procure rather than mere preparation; and

 

2.                Whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding
that the sexual intercourse contemplated by the appellant would be illicit
sexual intercourse within s. 195(1)(a) of the Code. 

 

                                                                    II

 

7.                I propose to begin with the
consideration of what is meant by ""illicit sexual intercourse"" in s.
195(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , which, at the relevant time,
provided:

 

                   195. (1) Every one who

 

                   (a)
procures, attempts to procure or solicits a female person to have illicit
sexual intercourse with another person, whether in or out of Canada,

 

                                                                    ...

 

is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

 

8.                Martin J.A., delivering the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal, said with reference to the meaning of
""illicit sexual intercourse"" at p. 52:

 

                   ""Illicit
sexual intercourse"" in s. 195(1) (a) merely connotes sexual
intercourse with another not authorized by law and it is not necessary for the
sexual intercourse procured with another to be in itself criminal: see R. v.
Robinson (1946), 92 C.C.C. 223, [1948] O.R. 857, [1949] 2 D.L.R. 531.

 

9.                Various expressions have been used over
the years to qualify the sexual intercourse contemplated by certain criminal
law prohibitions enacted for the protection of girls and women. The English
statute 18 Eliz., c. 7, of 1575‑76 created the offence of
""unlawfully and carnally"" knowing and abusing any girl under ten
years of age. The same offence was contained in the English statute 9 Geo.
4, c. 31, of 1828, as well as the offence of ""unlawfully and
carnally"" knowing and abusing any girl between the ages of ten and twelve.
The statute 24 & 25 Vict., c. 100, of 1861, created the offence of
procuring a woman or girl under twenty‑one to have ""illicit carnal
connexion"" with any man. Section 2(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1885 (U.K.), 48 & 49 Vict., c. 69, made it an offence to procure
or attempt to procure any girl or woman under twenty‑one years of age,
not being a common prostitute, or of known immoral character, to have
""unlawful carnal connexion"" with any other person. The Criminal
Code, 1892 (Can.), c. 29, used the expressions ""illicit
connection"" (ss. 181, 182, 183, 184), ""unlawful carnal
connection"" (s. 185(a), (g), (h), (i)),
""illicit intercourse"" (s. 185(b)), and ""unlawfully and
carnally"" (ss. 187, 189). Section 185(a) created the offence,
modelled on s. 2(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, of
procuring or attempting to procure any girl or woman under twenty‑one
years of age, not being a common prostitute or of known immoral character, to
have ""unlawful carnal connection"" with any other person. The
expression ""unlawful carnal connection"" was retained in the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, s. 216(a), as amended by The Criminal
Code  Amendment Act, 1913 (Can.), c. 13, s. 9, and in the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 216(a). The expression ""illicit
connection"" appears in ss. 211, 212, 213 and 214 of the Code of
1927.

 

10.              The word ""unlawful"" in the
statutory contexts referred to above has been treated as synonymous with ""illicit""
and as referring to sexual intercourse outside of marriage. In H.M. Advocate
v. Watson (1885), 13 S.C.(J.) 6, 23 Scot. L.R. 267, the issue was the
meaning of ""unlawful carnal knowledge"" in s. 5 of the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1885, which created the offence of unlawfully and carnally
knowing or attempting to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between the
ages of thirteen and sixteen. Lord Craighill, in charging the jury, said that
""unlawful carnal knowledge is neither more nor less, where the woman is
over thirteen and under sixteen years of age, than carnal knowledge by one who
is not her husband.""

 

11.              In R. v. Karn (1909), 20 O.L.R. 91
(C.A.), the relevant issue was the meaning of the word ""unlawfully""
in s. 217 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, which provided that
""Every one who, being the owner or occupier of any premises, or having, or
acting or assisting in, the management or control thereof, induces or knowingly
suffers any girl under the age of eighteen years to resort to or be in or upon
such premises for the purpose of being unlawfully and carnally known by any
man"" was guilty of an indictable offence. It was contended, as in the case
at bar with reference to the word ""illicit"", that the word
""unlawful"" meant prohibited by the criminal law or other provision or
rule of positive law. The Ontario Court of Appeal unanimously rejected this
contention. Osler and Maclaren JJ.A. both quoted the following passage from the
judgment of Bramwell B. in Cowan v. Milbourn (1867), L.R. 2 Ex. 230, at
p. 236:

 

It is strange there should
be so much difficulty in making it understood that a thing may be unlawful, in
the sense that the law will not aid it, and yet that the law will not
immediately punish it. If that only were unlawful to which a penalty is
attached, the consequence would be that, inasmuch as no penalty is provided by
the law for prostitution, a contract having prostitution for its object would
be valid in a court of law. 

 

Osler J.A. referred to several sections of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, in which the words ""illicit connection"" appeared
and said at pp. 94‑95:

 

                    In
these sections the words ""unlawful"" and ""illicit"" appear to
me to be synonymous and to be used, in describing the act penalised, in the
sense of not sanctioned or permitted by law and as distinguished from acts of
sexual intercourse which are not regarded as immoral. See the Oxford and the
Century Dictionaries, sub verb. ""illicit"" and
""unlawful"".

 

Maclaren J.A., observing that ""the context and evil aimed at""
would generally throw light on the sense in which the word ""unlawful""
is used in a particular section of the Code, said at p. 95:

 

                    It is
frequently used as synonymous with ""illicit"" or as being simply
""not lawful"" or ""not authorised or permitted by law."" Such
meanings are given to it as usual ones in the leading dictionaries. Inasmuch as
any issue from such intercourse as took place in this instance would
undoubtedly be ""unlawful,"" it would not appear to be improper to
apply the word to the act itself.

 

Meredith J.A. said at p. 97:

 

                    In my
opinion, it is not a necessary ingredient, in the crime with which the accused
was charged, that the carnal knowledge should be criminal in its character; it
is enough if it be unlawful; and that it was unlawful in that sense is obvious;
if the accused were suing to recover money for the use of his ""premises""
for the purposes to which he permitted them to be put, he would fail because of
the unlawful character of the transaction; if the woman sued for an agreed
price of her prostitution, she would fail in like manner; if there were issue
of the connection, it would be unlawful; indeed, everything connected with and
issuing out of the gross immorality, would be unlawful.

 

12.              In R. v. Robinson (1948), 92 C.C.C.
223 (Ont. C.A.), the case which was cited by Martin J.A. in support of his
opinion as to the meaning of ""illicit sexual intercourse"" in s.
195(1) (a), the relevant issue was the meaning of ""unlawful"" in
s. 216(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, which made
it a criminal offence for anyone to procure or solicit any girl or woman to
have ""unlawful carnal connection"" with any other person. In rejecting
the contention that ""unlawful"" in that context meant ""contrary
to law"", Laidlaw J.A., with whom Henderson J.A. concurred, said at pp. 225‑26:

 

                   ""Lawful""
means authorized by law. The prefix ""un"" may mean simply
""not"", and ""unlawful"" may be properly used to mean
""not authorized by law"". It is in that sense that the word is used in
s. 216(1)(a) of the Code, and to give to it a different and more
restricted meaning in that section, as urged by counsel for the appellant,
would defeat the plain intention and purpose of the enactment. The wrong at
which that subsection is aimed is the act of a person in procuring or
attempting to procure or soliciting any girl or woman to have carnal connection
with another person who has no right to engage with her in that
act.... The essence of the offence created by the section under
consideration is the wrongful act of any person who procures or attempts to
procure or solicits any girl or woman to have carnal connection with any other
person or persons not authorized by law. The conduct of that person is the
criterion by which his or her guilt is to be determined and not the criminality
of the result brought about or attempted to be brought about by it.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                    Thus
in the present case while the act of carnal connection was not shown to be an
act contrary to the criminal law and it does not appear that criminal
proceedings would lie in respect of it, nevertheless it was not an act
authorized by law and in that sense was ""unlawful"" within the meaning
of that word as used in s. 216(1)(a). 

 

Hogg J.A., who was of the same opinion, quoted at length from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal in Karn, supra, and concluded at
p. 229 that the word ""unlawful"" in s. 216(1)(a)
""comprises acts which are known and defined as crimes, but embraces, as
well, acts which are not contrary to the law in a criminal sense.""

 

13.              In Attorney General v. Ryan (1957),
91 I.L.T.R. 164, the Supreme Court of Ireland (Maguire C.J., Kingsmill Moore
and Maguire JJ.) had to consider the meaning of the word ""unlawful""
in s. 2(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 (Ire.), No. 6, which
made it a criminal offence to attempt to have ""unlawful carnal
knowledge"" of a girl who was between fifteen and seventeen years of age.
The Court was referred to H.M. Advocate v. Watson, supra. With
reference to the meaning of ""unlawful"", Maguire C.J. is reported as
follows at p. 167: ""It seemed to his Lordship that a reasonable definition
of the offence with which the appellant stood charged was attempting to have
carnal knowledge of a female between the age of fifteen and seventeen years,
both parties being at the time of the attempt unmarried.""

 

14.              In R. v. Chapman, [1959] 1 Q.B.
100, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Devlin, Donovan and Ashworth JJ.) had to
consider the meaning of ""unlawful"" in s. 19(1) of the Sexual
Offences Act, 1956, 4 & 5 Eliz. 2, c. 69, which provides: ""It is
an offence, subject to the exception mentioned in this section, for a person to
take an unmarried girl under the age of eighteen out of the possession of her
parent or guardian against his will, if she is so taken with the intention that
she shall have unlawful sexual intercourse with men or with a particular
man."" It was contended, as in the other cases to which I have referred,
that ""unlawful"" meant contrary to some enactment of positive law. In
rejecting this contention, Donovan J., after referring to the language used in
earlier statutes creating sexual offences, said at p. 104:

 

No great assistance is to
be derived for present purposes from the language used in these earlier
statutes, except that it does suggest that the word ""unlawfully"" in
relation to carnal knowledge has not been used with any degree of precision. It
would be natural, however, for the framers of a statute, in days when the canon
law would be more in their minds than today, to refer to any intercourse
outside the bond of matrimony as ""unlawful""; and for their successors
when drafting consolidating Acts simply to repeat the word without a close
consideration of its necessity or precise meaning.

 

                    We
reject the argument that in section 19 of the Act of 1956 the word
""unlawful"" connotes intercourse contrary to some positive enactment.
The argument, at once, prompts the question why, if the intercourse in question
is already positively forbidden, section 19 should do it again.... the plain
purpose of section 19 is to protect young unmarried girls. That protection
would be largely, if not wholly, illusory if in every case it were incumbent on
the prosecution to prove that she was taken from her parents for the purpose of
intercourse of a kind positively forbidden by some enactment, and not for
intercourse not so forbidden. We do not think that such can have been Parliament's
intention.

 

And further with reference to the meaning of ""unlawful""
Donovan J. said at p. 105:

 

                    If the
two interpretations suggested for the appellant are rejected, as we think they
must be, then the word ""unlawful"" in section 19 is either surplusage
or means ""illicit."" We do not think it is surplusage, because
otherwise a man who took such a girl out of her parents' possession against
their will with the honest and bona fide intention of marrying her might have
no defence, even if he carried out that intention. In our view, the word simply
means ""illicit,"" i.e., outside the bond of marriage. In other words,
we take the same view as the trial judge. We think this interpretation accords
with the common sense of the matter, and with what we think was the obvious
intention of Parliament.

 

15.              Robinson, supra, was
followed on the meaning of ""illicit"" in s. 195(1)(a) of the Code
by the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Turner
(1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 76, where McFarlane J.A., with whom Davey C.J.B.C.
concurred, said at p. 79: ""I am satisfied that the word
""illicit"" in that section [s. 195(1) (a)] is used in the sense
of not being sanctioned or permitted by law and not necessarily in the sense of
constituting a criminal offence: vide R. v. Robinson (1948), 92
C.C.C. 223, [1949] 2 D.L.R. 531, [1948] O.R. 857."" 

 

16.              I am of the opinion that the word
""illicit"" in s. 195(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  must be
given the meaning that has been assigned by the weight of judicial opinion to
the word ""unlawful"" in comparable legislative contexts‑‑as
referring to sexual intercourse not authorized or sanctioned by lawful
marriage. The alternative meaning‑‑sexual intercourse prohibited by
the criminal law or other enactment of positive law‑‑apart from
reducing the scope of the offence of procuring a person to have illicit sexual
intercourse with another person so as to make it rarely, if ever, applicable,
is simply not reconcilable with other provisions of the Criminal Code .

 

17.              The evil to which s. 195(1) (a) is
directed is procuring or soliciting, not the actual act of sexual intercourse
itself. The provision is parallel to, and of the same kind as, that in s.
195(1) (d), which makes it an offence to procure or attempt to procure a
person to become a prostitute, although prostitution is not itself a crime.
Indeed, this would appear to be true of all the offences created by s. 195.
They are directed to conduct which is designed to encourage or promote conduct
which is not itself criminal. If fault be found with that legislative policy it
is for Parliament to make the necessary changes, not for a court to do so by
giving the word ""illicit"" in s. 195(1) (a) such a restricted
meaning as not only to give s. 195(1) (a) a very limited, if not
improbable, application, but also to restrict very severely the application of
other important provisions of the Criminal Code  for the protection of
girls and women in which the words ""illicit sexual intercourse"" are
used.

 

18.              It is highly unlikely that Parliament
intended, in s. 195(1) (a), which now prohibits the procuring of ""a
person"" to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person, to create
an offence that was limited to: (a) procuring a person to have sexual
intercourse with a female under the age of fourteen who is not his wife (s.
146(1)); (b) procuring a person to have sexual intercourse with a person who is
not his wife, is of previously chaste character and is between fourteen and
sixteen years of age (s. 146(2)); (c) procuring a person to commit incest (s.
150); (d) procuring a person to seduce a female person of previously chaste
character who is between sixteen and eighteen years of age (s. 151); (e)
procuring a person to seduce under promise of marriage an unmarried female
person of previously chaste character who is less than twenty‑one years
of age (s. 152); (f) procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with
a stepdaughter, foster daughter or female ward (s. 153(1)(a)); (g)
procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with a female person of
previously chaste character and under the age of twenty‑one years who is
in his employment or is in a common, but not necessarily similar, employment
with him and is, in respect of her employment or work, under or in any way
subject to his control or direction or receives her wages or salary directly or
indirectly from him (s. 153(1)(b)); (h) procuring a person, being the
owner or master of a vessel or a person employed thereon, to seduce or by the
exercise of his authority, to have illicit sexual intercourse on board the
vessel with a female passenger (s. 154); and (j) procuring a person to commit a
sexual assault on another person (ss. 246.1, 246.2 and 246.3). Procuring a
person to commit any of the above offences which involve a prohibition of
sexual intercourse in certain circumstances, apart from the unlikelihood of its
arising in most cases, is already made a criminal offence by s. 22 of the Code.
It is highly unlikely that Parliament would have considered s. 195(1) (a)
necessary for such a purpose. On this view of the meaning of ""illicit
sexual intercourse"" there would remain, however, the possibility of making
it an offence to procure a female person to have sexual intercourse with
another person in any of the above situations. This too, however, would
severely limit the application of s. 195(1) (a) and in a manner that
would appear to be contrary to an earlier expression of legislative intention.
For example, limiting the offence created by s. 195(1) (a) to procuring a
female person under the age of fourteen years or between fourteen and sixteen
years of age to have sexual intercourse with another person (s. 146(1) and (2))
would not only severely limit the extent to which s. 195(1) (a) could
apply to the kind of procuring to which it is obviously directed, but would be
contrary to the legislative intention earlier evidenced by the removal of the
age limit that was formerly in the provision which is now s. 195(1) (a).
(Cf. s. 185(a) of The Criminal Code, 1892, referred to above). 

 

19.              Finally, giving the word
""illicit"" the restricted meaning suggested would seriously restrict
or compromise the application of the other provisions of the Code for
the protection of girls and women in which the words ""illicit sexual
intercourse"" are used. I have referred to three of them: s. 153(1)(a),
which makes it a criminal offence to have illicit sexual intercourse with a stepdaughter,
foster daughter or female ward; s. 153(1)(b), which makes it a criminal
offence for a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with a female person of
previously chaste character and under the age of twenty‑one years who is
in his employment or is in a common, but not necessarily similar, employment
with him and is, in respect of her employment or work, under or in any way
subject to his control or direction or receives her wages or salary directly or
indirectly from him; and s. 154, which makes it a criminal offence for an owner
or master of a vessel or a person employed thereon, to seduce or, by the
exercise of his authority, have illicit sexual intercourse on board the vessel
with a female passenger. To these may be added the following provisions: s.
166(a), which makes it a criminal offence for a parent or guardian of a
female person to procure her to have illicit sexual intercourse with a person
other than the procurer; and s. 167, which makes it a criminal offence for the
owner, occupier or manager of premises, or one having control thereof or
assisting in the management or control thereof, to permit a female person under
the age of eighteen to resort to or to be in or upon the premises for the
purpose of having illicit sexual intercourse with a particular male person or
with male persons generally. Parliament cannot have intended that these
offences should be limited to cases in which the resulting sexual intercourse
is otherwise prohibited by the Criminal Code . This is particularly
unthinkable, for example, of the offence of having illicit sexual intercourse
with a stepdaughter, foster daughter or female ward.

 

20.              It may be noted that in s. 146 the Code
does not find it necessary to use the word ""illicit"" to qualify the
words ""sexual intercourse"" where what is specifically prohibited is
having sexual intercourse with a female person under the age of fourteen who is
not one's wife. It is also of interest to note the change made by New Zealand
legislation in the provision which corresponds to s. 195(1)(a) of the Code.
Section 218 of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1908 (N.Z.), No. 32,
provided: ""Every one is liable to two years' imprisonment...who, from
motives of lucre, by false pretences, or false representations, or other
fraudulent means, procures any woman or girl under the age of twenty‑one
years to have illicit carnal connection with any man."" It was replaced by
s. 149 of the Crimes Act 1961 (N.Z.), No. 43, which reads:
""Every one is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years
who, for gain or reward, procures or agrees or offers to procure any woman or
girl to have sexual intercourse with any male who is not her husband.""
This reflects, I think, what has been traditionally and generally understood by
the word ""unlawful"" or ""illicit"" in this context.

 

21.              For the foregoing reasons I am of the
respectful opinion that the Court of Appeal did not err in holding that the
sexual intercourse contemplated by the appellant would be ""illicit sexual
intercourse"" within s. 195(1)(a) of the Code.

 

                                                                    III

 

22.              I turn now to the question whether the
acts or statements of the appellant could, as a matter of law, constitute the actus
reus of an attempt to procure a person to have illicit sexual
intercourse with another person, contrary to s. 195(1)(a) of the Code.
The general provision of the Code defining the constituent elements of
an attempt to commit an offence is s. 24, which provides:

 

                   24. (1) Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or
omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of
an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under the
circumstances to commit the offence.

 

                   (2) The
question whether an act or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an
offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to
constitute an attempt to commit the offence, is a question of law.

 

23.              The issue is whether, if there was the
necessary intent, the acts of the appellant were mere preparation to commit the
offence of procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another
person or whether any of them was a step in the commission of the offence, and
the extent to which that distinction is to turn on the relative remoteness of the
act in question from what would have been the completion of the offence. This
issue, as s. 24 indicates, is a question of law. The appellant contends
that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that one of the acts of the appellant
could, if there was the necessary intent, constitute the actus reus
of an attempt to procure. 

 

24.              The trial judge found that the appellant
""intended that the women in question should have sexual relations with
prospective customers and clients"", but that the acts of the appellant,
consisting of the advertisements, the interviews and what was said during the
interviews concerning the requirements of the position and the money to be
earned, were mere preparation and too remote from the complete offence of procuring
to constitute the actus reus of an attempt to procure. He said:

 

                    I do
not agree with crown counsel that if the accused had offered employment to the
women that the full offence of procuring would be made out. While it is
unnecessary for me to decide the issue, it would seem to me that if an offer of
employment had been accepted by the women, then the full offence of procuring
would have been established. I am of the view that had there been an offer of
employment to the women in question, then an attempt to procure would have been
established by the crown.The placement of the advertisements in the paper
cannot, standing by itself, be considered as anything other than mere
preparation. It is too remote towards the commission of the offence. Likewise,
in my judgment, so is the interview considered solely in the light of the job
specifications. An explanation of what the applicant would be required to do
does not constitute an attempt to cause or induce a status or act prohibited by
Section 195. The professed rewards attendant upon such a status or act cannot
in my judgment constitute an act going beyond mere preparation, unless the
position was offered to the applicant. The allure of the rewards remains in the
area of preparation. Had the position been offered to the applicant, then there
would be an act immediately connected with the commission of the offence,
although it would not necessarily be the last act in the accused's attempt, but
absent such an offer, as a question of law, the interviews and the contents of
them remain, in my judgment, preparation only. I consider that the interview
and its content was an act remotely leading to the commission of the offence,
and was not an act immediately connected with it, nor sufficiently proximate to
it so as to constitute an attempt; the latter language being used by the
Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of Sorrell and Bondett which
was decided in 1978 and is reported in 41 C.C.C. (2d) at p. 9.

 

25.              The Court of Appeal held that the trial
judge had not made a finding as to whether the appellant had the requisite mens
rea or intent to commit the offence of procuring, but that the holding out
of large financial rewards in the course of the interviews could, as a matter
of law, constitute the actus reus of an attempt to procure. Martin J.A.
said at p. 50:

 

                    The
trial judge, as previously mentioned, found that the respondent intended that
""the women in question"" should have sexual intercourse with clients
or potential clients if necessary to obtain a contract. I interpret that
finding in its context as a finding that the respondent in the interviews with
the three young women who answered the advertisement and with Constable Barkey
did state and meant to state that the position required them to have sexual
intercourse with clients or potential clients, and further that he contemplated
that such sexual intercourse would take place as incidental to the employment.
The trial judge made no finding that the respondent endeavoured to persuade the
applicants to take the job and it is, I think, clear on the evidence that the
respondent did not expressly attempt to persuade them to take such employment
and indeed the trial judge found that the respondent had never offered the
position to any of them. The holding out of large financial rewards in the
context of the interviews was capable, however, not only of providing evidence
of an intention to induce the applicants to become so employed, but was also
capable of constituting the actus reus of an attempt to procure the
applicants to have illicit sexual intercourse contrary to s. 195.

 

Martin J.A. expressed his conclusions on this issue as follows at pp.
56‑57: 

 

                    Notwithstanding
the cases which hold that an invitation or an act of persuasion may constitute
an attempt to procure, I think it is possible to imagine cases where an act of
persuasion or the holding out of an inducement to a woman to have sexual
intercourse with another at some remote time in the future and subject to
contingencies which might never occur, would be too remote from the actual
procurement of illicit sexual intercourse to constitute an attempt to procure.
I think, however, that in this case there was evidence upon which it would be
open to a court to find that the respondent by holding out the lure of large
financial rewards intended to induce the women in question to accept employment
involving sexual intercourse with clients or potential clients if necessary to
further his business interests and that the respondent contemplated that such
sexual intercourse would be required and would occur as a normal incident of
the employment. If the trial judge made those findings it would be open to him
to find that the respondent had attempted to procure the women in question to
have illicit sexual intercourse with another person. On the other hand, if the
respondent never intended to offer the employment to the women in question,
that would, of course, negative an intention to induce them to have illicit
sexual intercourse with another person. These are issues of fact entirely
within the province of the trial judge. The respondent's liability for attempting
to procure the women for the proscribed purpose was not dependent, however, on
whether he had formally offered them the job. The holding out of the financial
rewards with the requisite intent to persuade the women to have illicit sexual
intercourse with clients or prospective clients was itself sufficient to
constitute the actus reus of an attempt to procure the women in question
to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person.

 

26.              Several different tests for determining whether
there is the actus reus of attempt, as distinct from mere preparation to
commit an offence, have been identified as reflected at one time or another in
judicial decisions and legislation. All of them have been pronounced by
academic commentators to be unsatisfactory in some degree. For a thorough
analysis of the various tests, with suggestions for an improved test, see
Meehan, The Law of Criminal Attempt‑‑A Treatise, 1984,
chapter 5, and Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law, 1982, pp. 529 ff. There is
a succinct appraisal of the various tests in the English Law Commission's
Report No. 102 of 1980 entitled, Criminal Law: Attempt, and Impossibility in
relation to Attempt, Conspiracy and Incitement. It has been frequently
observed that no satisfactory general criterion has been, or can be, formulated
for drawing the line between preparation and attempt, and that the application
of this distinction to the facts of a particular case must be left to common
sense judgment. See, for example, Kelley v. Hart (1934), 61 C.C.C. 364, per
McGillivray J.A. at p. 370; R. v. Brown, [1947] O.W.N. 419, per
Laidlaw J.A. at p. 421; R. v. Cline (1956), 115 C.C.C. 18, per
Laidlaw J.A. at p. 26; and Haughton v. Smith, [1975] A.C. 476, per
Lord Reid at p. 499. Despite academic appeals for greater clarity and certainty
in this area of the law I find myself in essential agreement with this
conclusion.

 

27.              In my opinion the distinction between
preparation and attempt is essentially a qualitative one, involving the
relationship between the nature and quality of the act in question and the
nature of the complete offence, although consideration must necessarily be
given, in making that qualitative distinction, to the relative proximity of the
act in question to what would have been the completed offence, in terms of
time, location and acts under the control of the accused remaining to be
accomplished. I find that view to be compatible with what has been said about
the actus reus of attempt in this Court and in other Canadian decisions
that should be treated as authoritative on this question.

 

28.              The most recent expression of opinion in
this Court on what constitutes an attempt to commit an offence is the judgment
in R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, where the issue was the intent
required for attempted murder. McIntyre J., in the course of a review of the
development of the law of attempt, said with reference to the mens rea
and the actus reus of attempt at p. 247:

 

As with any other crime,
the Crown must prove a mens rea, that is, the intent to commit the
offence in question and the actus reus, that is, some step towards the
commission of the offence attempted going beyond mere acts of preparation. Of
the two elements the more significant is the mens rea. 

 

McIntyre J. referred with approval to the judgment of Laidlaw J.A. in R.
v. Cline, supra, particularly for what it said concerning the
relative importance of mens rea in attempt, but that judgment has also
been treated as helpful for what it said concerning the application of the
distinction between preparation and attempt. With reference to this question
Laidlaw J.A. said at p. 28:

 

                    The
consummation of a crime usually comprises a series of acts which have their
genesis in an idea to do a criminal act; the idea develops to a decision to do
that act; a plan may be made for putting that decision into effect; the next
step may be preparation only for carrying out the intention and plan; but when
that preparation is in fact fully completed, the next step in the series of
acts done by the accused for the purpose and with the intention of committing
the crime as planned cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as remote in its
connection with that crime. The connection is in fact proximate.

 

Laidlaw J.A. offered six propositions by way of guidance for
determination of the requisite mens rea and actus reus of
attempt, the last two of which, with reference to the actus reus, are as
follows:

 

(5) The actus reus
must be more than mere preparation to commit a crime. But (6) when the
preparation to commit a crime is in fact fully complete and ended, the next
step done by the accused for the purpose and with the intention of committing a
specific crime constitutes an actus reus sufficient in law to establish
a criminal attempt to commit that crime.

 

29.              The extent to which some version of the
proximity test, which was formulated in R. v. Eagleton (1854), Dears.
C.C. 376 (C.C.R.), and applied in the much‑criticized case of R. v. Robinson,
[1915] 2 K.B. 342 (C.C.A.), as a ""last step"" or ""last
stage"" test (cf. English Law Commission, op. cit., pp. 335‑36),
is to be applied in drawing the distinction between preparation and attempt has
also been the subject of commentary in this Court. In Henderson v. The King,
[1948] S.C.R. 226, where one of the issues was whether there had been an
attempt to rob a bank, Estey J., who was one of the majority holding that there
had been an attempt, said at p. 244:

 

                    Counsel
for the accused referred to a number of cases in which the attempted crime was
either against the person or that of obtaining by false pretences. He contended
that any act not ""immediately connected with"" the completed crime
would be too remote to constitute an attempt. Even under the cases which he
cited the accused may still have one or more acts to do, and these may be
separated by an intervening period of time, in order to complete the offence
and yet may be guilty of an attempt.

 

Among the cases referred to by Estey J. in support of this statement
were R. v. Cheeseman (1862), Le. & Ca. 140, 169 E.R. 1337, where
Blackburn J. said at p. 1339, ""But, if the actual transaction has
commenced which would have ended in the crime if not interrupted, there is
clearly an attempt to commit the crime"", and R. v. White, [1910] 2
K.B. 124, where Bray J. said at p. 130: ""...the completion or attempted
completion of one of a series of acts intended by a man to result in killing is
an attempt to murder even although this completed act would not, unless
followed by other acts, result in killing. It might be the beginning of the
attempt, but would none the less be an attempt."" Taschereau J.,
dissenting, in Henderson, although he differed in the result, would not
appear to have applied a different concept of proximity. He said, after
referring to the authorities, including Eagleton and Robinson, at
pp. 234‑35:

 

Although it may be said
that no one could doubt the express purpose of the bandits, I do not believe
that it can be held that the mere fact of going to the place where the
contemplated crime is to be committed, constitutes an attempt. There must be a
closer relation between the victim and the author of the crime; there must be
an act done which displays not only a preparation for an attempt, but a
commencement of execution, a step in the commission of the actual crime itself.


 

30.              In Detering v. The Queen, [1982] 2
S.C.R. 583, which involved a conviction for attempted fraud, Laskin C.J. raised
a question, as I read his reasons, as to the weight to be given to the
proximity test in the essential task under s. 24 of the Code of
distinguishing between preparation and attempt. With reference to the
contention of counsel that ""proximity was an essential requirement in the
sense, to put it generally, that the actions of the accused must go beyond mere
preparation and close (a question of degree) to the realization of his
purpose"", Laskin C.J. said at p. 586:

 

                    This
leaves for consideration the so‑called proximity principle. It may well
be that this is envisaged by the reference to remoteness in s. 24(2), but I do
not see that it advances the essential issue in attempt which requires going
beyond mere preparation. Nor do I find cogency in the appellant's submission
that if there is impossibility this does not bring any act of the accused
closer to realization so as to establish proximity. I read s. 24(1) as making a
different distinction, one merely requiring proof of intent and of accused
going beyond mere preparation by making, as in this case, a false
representation even though not resulting in full realization of his objective.

 

31.              In my opinion, relative proximity may give
an act which might otherwise appear to be mere preparation the quality of
attempt. That is reflected, I think, in the conclusion of the majority in Henderson
and in the conclusion of the Ontario Court of Appeal with respect to actus
reus in R. v. Sorrell and Bondett (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 9. But an
act which on its face is an act of commission does not lose its quality as the actus
reus of attempt because further acts were required or because a significant
period of time may have elapsed before the completion of the offence.

 

32.              In the case at bar the Court of Appeal
agreed with the trial judge on the applicable meaning of ""procure"".
The meaning selected by the trial judge and approved by the Court of Appeal was
""to cause, or to induce, or to have a persuasive effect upon the conduct
that is alleged."" Martin J.A. expressed his agreement at p. 49 with the
following statement of the issue by the trial judge: ""The question for
decision is did Mr. Deutsch attempt to cause or attempt to induce or attempt to
have a persuasive effect upon the woman in question to have illicit sexual
intercourse with another person...."" I agree that the sources referred to
by the trial judge and Martin J.A. support the meaning given by them to the
word ""procure"".

 

33.              The Court of Appeal differed with the
trial judge as to what would have constituted the completed offence of
procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person. The
trial judge held that the offence of procuring would have been completed, in
the particular context of this case, by the acceptance of an offer of
employment. The Court of Appeal held, citing R. v. Johnson (1963), 48
Cr.App.R. 25, and R. v. Gruba, [1969] 2 C.C.C. 365, that the offence of
procuring a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person is
not committed unless sexual intercourse actually takes place. In the appeal to
this Court the respondent accepted this statement of the law as to what is
required for the complete offence of procuring a person to have illicit sexual
intercourse with another person. It was not challenged, and I accept it for
purposes of deciding whether the acts of the appellant could, as a matter of
law, constitute the actus reus of an attempt to procure.

 

34.              I agree with the Court of Appeal that if
the appellant had the necessary intent to induce or persuade the women to seek
employment that would require them to have sexual intercourse with prospective
clients then the holding out of the large financial rewards in the course of
the interviews, in which the necessity of having sexual intercourse with
prospective clients was disclosed, could constitute the actus reus of an
attempt to procure. It would clearly be a step, and an important step, in the
commission of the offence. Before an offer of employment could be made in such
circumstances an applicant would have to seek the position, despite its special
requirement. Thus such inducement or persuasion would be the decisive act in
the procuring. There would be little else that the appellant would be required
to do towards the completion of the offence other than to make the formal offer
of employment. I am further of the opinion that the holding out of the large
financial rewards in the course of the interviews would not lose its quality as
a step in the commission of the offence, and thus as an actus reus of
attempt, because a considerable period of time might elapse before a person
engaged for the position had sexual intercourse with prospective clients or
because of the otherwise contingent nature of such sexual intercourse.

 

35.              For these reasons I would dismiss the
appeal. I agree with the Court of Appeal that because the trial judge did not
make a finding as to whether or not there was the necessary intent to procure
there must be a new trial. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

36.              Lamer
J.‑‑I agree with the reasons of my brother Le Dain. In
concurring in his judgment, I should like to add a brief comment. While I agree
with the scope of his definition of the expression ""illicit sexual
intercourse"" I should like to underline the fact that this agreement is to
the extent those words are resorted to in the context of the procuring or
soliciting thereof in s. 195(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . While
under the facts of this case it is clear that Deutsch was acting for the
purpose of gain, and there is no need to address the question whether such a
purpose is an essential ingredient of the notion of procuring or soliciting, I
should say that my accepting such a wide definition of ""illicit sexual
intercourse"" is dependent upon being of the view (and if and as long as
that view prevails) that it is an essential ingredient of ""procuring""
or of ""soliciting"" under s. 195(1) (a) that what is being done
is done for lucre, gain, or some advantage to the accused.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Corporate liability ‑‑
Conspiracy to defraud ‑‑ Whether or not liability arises where
directing mind acting (1) in fraud of corporation, or (2) for his own benefit,
or (3) contrary to instructions not to act illegally ‑‑ Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 338(1), 423(1)(d).

 

                   Four corporate appellants appealed their convictions
under ss. 338(1)  and 423(1) (d) of the Criminal Code . The several
counts in the indictment related to contracts between certain public
authorities and the accused where the bids were alleged to have been tendered
on a collusive basis, with the low bidders including in their costs
compensation to be paid to the ""high bidders"" or ""non‑bidders"".
Each company had a manager who conducted the business of the company relating
to the submission of bids for tender. Corporate criminal liability was denied
by the appellants, notwithstanding the position of these managers because these
managers allegedly (1) were acting in fraud of the appellant‑employers,
(2) were acting throughout for their own benefit, or (3) were acting contrary
to instructions and hence outside of the scope of their employment with the
appellants. Several companies also challenged the existence of any theory of
corporate criminal liability for mens rea offences.








 

                   Held: The appeals
should be dismissed.

 

                   Appellants are criminally liable in the
circumstances by operation of the identification theory. The underlying premise
of this theory is that the identity of the directing mind and the identity of
the company coincide; the actor‑employee who physically committed the
offence is the ego of the corporation. Therefore, even in mens rea
offences, if the court finds the officer or managerial level employee to be a
vital organ of the company and virtually its directing mind in the sphere of
duty assigned him so that his actions and intent are the action and intent of
the company itself, the company can be held criminally liable. The wrongful
action of the primary representative, by attribution to the corporation,
creates primary rather than vicarious liability. The identity doctrine merges
the board of directors, the managing director, the superintendent, the manager
or anyone else to whom was delegated the governing executive authority of the
corporation, and the conduct of any of the merged entities is thereby attributed
to the corporation. A corporation may, by this means, have more than one
directing mind.

 

                   The directing mind, as a prerequiste to the theory's
operation, must act within the scope of his authority, that is, his actions
must be performed within the sector of the corporate operation assigned to him.
The sector may be functional, or geographic, or may embrace the entire
undertaking of the corporation. Terminological problems arise from the use of
the phrase ""scope of employment"".

 

                   It is no defence to the application of the
identification doctrine that a criminal act by a corporate employee cannot be
within the scope of his authority unless expressly ordered to do the act in
question. Such a condition would reduce the rule to virtually nothing. Liability
can arise whether or not there be formal delegation, awareness of the board or
directors, or express prohibition.

 

                   A corporation in reality has these elements: the
legal entity, the personal shareholder, and the employee. By reason of the
identification theory, the criminal penalty will extend, directly or
indirectly, to all three which is quite unlike the situation of a natural
proprietor where only two of these elements are present. Imposition of criminal
liability is tolerable for a community where reality dictates corporate
criminal accountability in certain circumstances.

 

                   Each company had a directing mind and the fact that
he may have defrauded the corporate employer, acted in part for his own
benefit, or acted in breach of instructions did not remove the company's
criminal liability in the circumstances. 

 

                   The presence of general or specific instructions
prohibiting the conduct in question was irrelevant in determining the
parameters of the identification theory. Since the corporation and the directing
mind became one, the prohibition directed by the corporation to others is of no
effect in law on the determination of criminal liability of either the
directing mind or the corporation itself by reason of the actions of the
directing mind.

 

                   The outer limit of the delegation doctrine is,
however, reached and exceeded when the directing mind ceases completely to act,
in fact or in substance, in the interests of the corporation. The
identification theory ceases to operate when the directing mind intentionally
defrauds the corporation and when his wrongful actions form the substantial
part of the regular activities of his office. In such a case, where his entire
energies are directed to the destruction of the undertaking of the corporation,
the manager cannot realistically be considered to be the directing mind of the
corporation. The same reasoning can be applied to the concept of benefits.
Unlike fraud, however, a benefit can be in whole or in part. Benefit, in the
sense that the directing mind intended that the corporation should not benefit
from any of its activities in the undertaking, is in reality quite different
from benefit to the directing mind in single transactions or in a minor part of
the activities of the directing mind.

 

                   Where the criminal act is totally in fraud of the
corporate employer and where the act is intended to and does result in benefit
exclusively to the employee‑manager, the employee‑directing mind,
from the outset of the design and execution of the criminal plan, ceases to be
a directing mind of the corporation and consequently his acts cannot be
attributed to the corporation under the identification doctrine. Thus, the
identification doctrine only operates where the Crown demonstrates that the
action taken by the directing mind (a) was within the field of operation
assigned to him; (b) was not totally in fraud of the corporation; and (c) was
by design or result partly for the benefit of the company.

 

                   The factual basis for these ""defences"" to
corporate criminal liability was not present here. The impugned activities
formed a ""share the wealth"" project for the benefit of all concerned
except the public authorities who awarded the contracts. In their activities
the directing minds were acting partly for the benefit of the employing
appellant and partly for their own benefit.

 

                   Although the directing minds of all four appellants
practised and benefited from specific instances of fraud, they did not act
wholly for their own benefit or wholly in fraud of their employer in the sense
that the scheme was designed to deprive the appellants from all benefit. There
was no evidence in the record of any plan amongst the directing minds or of a
plan held by a single directing mind which involved the destruction of the
undertaking of the appellant corporations or the undermining of their fiscal
health. The conspiratorial directing minds, to the contrary, aimed to ensure
their corporate employers an enhanced level of profits and in the process
bettered themselves.

1.                Estey
J.‑‑The complex of convictions and acquittals which led to
this appeal raises important issues fundamental to the liability of a
corporation in criminal law. The procedural history from trial through appeal
of some twenty accused on an indictment containing seven counts is not relevant
to the disposition of the four appeals now before this Court. These are appeals
by four corporate appellants from convictions under ss. 338(1) and 423(1)(d)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. Following a trial of
some fifteen months duration, including an eleven‑day charge to the jury
by the learned trial judge, Parker A.C.J.H.C., five accused were acquitted, the
jury was unable to reach a verdict concerning two accused, and convictions were
entered against the remaining thirteen accused on one or more of the seven
counts. The thirteen accused who were convicted appealed convictions and
sentences to the Court of Appeal. The Attorney General of Ontario appealed the
sentence imposed on three of the accused. The Court of Appeal dismissed eight
appeals completely and ordered new trials in the case of five appellants on
some or all of their respective counts. Four appellants now appeal as follows:

 

(a)               The appellant Canadian Dredge & Dock
Company, Limited (hereinafter referred to as CD"") appeals against the
convictions entered at trial and confirmed by the Court of Appeal on counts 1,
3, 4, 5 and 6 and asks that the conviction be quashed or in the alternative
that a new trial be ordered;

 

(b)               The appellant Marine Industries Limited
(hereinafter referred to as MIL"") appeals against conviction on count 2
and asks that the conviction be quashed and a new trial ordered;

 

(c)               The appellant The J.P. Porter Company Limited
(hereinafter referred to as Porter"") appeals against the convictions
entered at trial and confirmed by the Court of Appeal on counts 1, 4, 5, and 6
and asks that the convictions be quashed or in the alternative that there be an
order for a new trial;

 

(d)               The appellant Richelieu Dredging Corporation
Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Richelieu"") appeals against convictions
entered at trial and confirmed by the Court of Appeal on counts 1 and 3 and
asks that the convictions be quashed or in the alternative that a new trial be
ordered. 

 

There is no cross‑appeal by the Crown against the order of the
Court of Appeal for a new trial on count 7 in the case of the appellant MIL.

 

2.                Leave to appeal to this Court was
granted on the following questions of law:

 

 Re: Canadian Dredge & Dock Company Limited v. The Queen and
Marine Industries Limited v. The Queen:

 

                   Is the
criminal liability of a corporation, when it is based on the misconduct of a
directing mind of the corporation, affected because the person who is the
directing mind is at the same time acting, in whole or in part, in fraud of the
corporation, or wholly or partly for his own benefit or contrary to
instructions that he not engage in any illegal activities in the course of his
duties?

 

 Re: J.P. Porter Company Limited and Richelieu Dredging Corporation
Inc. v. The Queen

 

                   Was
there any evidence that a directing mind of the applicant corporation was
acting wholly or in part in fraud of the corporation during the period covered
by the indictments herein or acting wholly or in part for his own benefit
during that period or contrary to instructions that he not engage in illegal
activities in the course of his duties and, if so, is the criminal liability of
the corporation affected by any one or more of such circumstances?

 

3.                These questions raise squarely the issue
of corporate criminal liability in our law by reason of the so‑called
indentification theory or otherwise. CD, particularly, does not accept the
proposition that a corporation can be liable in criminal law for a mens rea
offence by reason of the identification doctrine. It is submitted on behalf of
CD and MIL that this is a doctrine originating in civil law and has not been
properly and authoritatively brought into Canadian criminal law. Alternatively,
the appellants CD and MIL submit that a corporation is not liable in criminal
law when the directing mind of the corporation is, at the material time:

 

1.                acting in fraud of the corporation; or,

 

2.                acting wholly or partly for his or her own
benefit; or,

 

3.                acting contrary to instructions that he not
engage in illegal action in the course of his duties.

 

4.                In the case of the appellants Porter and
Richelieu the submission is made that there is evidence to support a finding
that the directing minds of the corporation were, at the times in question,
acting in fraud of the corporation or wholly or partly for their own benefit or
contrary to instructions not to comit illegal activities in the course of
employment, or any one of these circumstances; and therefore the answer to the
second question, supra, is said by these appellants to be the same as
the answer to the first question.

 

5.                In none of these appeals does the Crown
concede that there is any evidence in respect of any of the appellants in
support of any of the three separate defences alleged by these appellants to
exist in law; or that these defences are known to the law. 

 

6.                The several counts in the indictment
relate to contracts between certain public authorities and the accused for
dredging in the St. Lawrence River and in some of the Great Lakes in the years
1967‑73 inclusive. Many issues were raised and disposed of at trial and
in the Court of Appeal which are not covered by the two questions now brought
before this Court. Only the issues raised in the two questions, supra,
as they relate to these four appellants remain to be settled. It is not
necessary in dealing with these remaining issues of law to restate the complex
corporate history of the appellants, their ownership from time to time, the
evidence concerning each appellant on each count, or the details of the
operation of the bidding system with reference to which these charges arose.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal examines all such matters in both a detailed
and comprehensive manner and may be found at [sub nom. R. v. McNamara (No.
1)] (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193. The essential facts as seen by the Crown
are summarized at pp. 249‑51.

 

7.                Each of the appellants had a manager who
conducted the business of the company relating to the submission of bids for
tender dredging work. These managers were:

 

(a)               for
MIL, Louis DeRome who was the General Manager of dredging operations and who
became Vice‑President of the company in 1967. He died in 1970 before
these proceedings commenced;

 

(b)               for
Porter, Horace Rindress who became Vice‑President of Porter in 1959 and
thereafter was made a Director in 1961 and President in 1969. Rindress
testified for the Crown;

 

(c)               for
Richelieu, Rindress who became President after the company was acquired by
Porter in 1972;

 

(d)               for
CD, Robert Schneider who was at various times a Director and Officer and the
person in charge of dredging for the appellant. He held similar positions with
the appellant's predecessor companies prior to that. Schneider testified for
the Crown.

 

The respondent Crown asserts that bids were submitted in response to
calls for tender by the Government of Canada or its agencies on a collusive
basis. ""Low bidders"" were said to have included in their bids
""costs"" which would cover compensating payments to be made to co‑operating
"" high bidders"" or in some cases, ""non‑bidders"".
Other forms of compensation were sometimes arrangements which included
subcontracts by successful bidders to the accommodation bidders or to other
members of the alleged conspiracy. 

 

                   It was
the theory of the Crown that the consideration given for these co‑operative
bids or withholding of competitive bids was included in the cost estimates of
the successful bidders so that the public agency was paying a higher price for
the work than it would have paid if the job had been bid competitively. When
money was offered as the form of consideration, the amount was recorded on
documents known as ""score sheets"" which were kept by Rindress,
Quinlan*1 and Schneider; they would meet periodically to reconcile
the commitments recorded on the ""score sheets"" and to settle
accounts. If there remained a balance owing by one corporation to another, on
some occasions a false invoice would be issued by the corporation to whom the
money was owing or by some other corporation designated by it, which would then
be paid by a cheque from the debtor company. In some cases, however, the
balance was merely recorded and carried forward. As previously mentioned, in
some cases Schneider and Quinlan devised schemes whereby they personally
obtained the benefit of the pay‑offs without the knowledge of the
corporation which they represented. From time to time the ""score
sheets"" were destroyed when the accounts were settled.

 

*1 Quinlan played the same role with reference to the
accused, McNamara Corporation Limited, as Messrs. Rindress and Schneider did
with reference to the other corporate accused. Quinlan was the General Manager
and Vice President of the Marine Division of McNamara Corporation Limited.

8.                The theory of the defence to these
charges, as advanced by the appellants, is simply that whatever may be the
position of the guiding managers of the four appellants personally at criminal
law, no criminal liability attaches to these appellants under any of the counts
because these managers were either acting in fraud on the appellant‑employers,
were acting throughout for their own benefit, or were acting contrary to
instructions and hence were acting outside the scope of their employment with
the appellants in question. As noted earlier, in this Court at least, several
of the appellants also challenged the existence of any theory of corporate
criminal liability for mens rea offences. 

 

9.                In his charge to the jury, the learned
Associate Chief Justice discussed the three defences put in issue by the
appellants and as set out in questions 1 and 2, supra, together with the
application of the identification theory in Canadian criminal law. The Court of
Appeal reviewed the law and concluded that none of these defences was known to
the law or, alternatively, none was, on the evidence, applicable, and consequently
the appellants CD and MIL were guilty as charged on counts now in issue. In the
case of the appellants Porter and Richelieu, the Court of Appeal found that
whether or not these defences existed in law, there was no evidence that the
directing mind of these appellants, Rindress, had conducted himself so as to
raise such defences.

 

10.              The position of the corporation in
criminal law must first be examined. Inasmuch as all criminal and quasi‑criminal
offences are creatures of statute the amenability of the corporation to
prosecution necessarily depends in part upon the terminology employed in the
statute. In recent years there has developed a system of classification which
segregates the offences according to the degree of intent, if any, required to
create culpability.

 

(a) Absolute Liability
Offences

 

11.              Where the legislature by the clearest
intendment establishes an offence where liability arises instantly upon the
breach of the statutory prohibition, no particular state of mind is a
prerequisite to guilt. Corporations and individual persons stand on the same
footing in the face of such a statutory offence. It is a case of automatic
primary responsibility. Accordingly, there is no need to establish a rule for
corporate liability nor a rationale therefor. The corporation is treated
as a natural person.

 

(b) Offences of Strict
Liability

 

12.              Where the terminology employed by the
legislature is such as to reveal an intent that guilt shall not be predicated
upon the automatic breach of the statute but rather upon the establishment of
the actus reus, subject to the defence of due diligence, an offence of
strict liability arises. See R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2
S.C.R. 1299. As in the case of an absolute liability offence, it matters not
whether the accused is corporate or unincorporate, because the liability is
primary and arises in the accused according to the terms of the statute in the
same way as in the case of absolute offences. It is not dependent upon the
attribution to the accused of the misconduct of others. This is so when the
statute, properly construed, shows a clear contemplation by the Legislature
that a breach of the statute itself leads to guilt, subject to the limited
defence above noted. In this category, the corporation and the natural
defendant are in the same position. In both cases liability is not vicarious
but primary. 

 

(c) Offences Requiring Mens
Rea

 

13.              These are the traditional criminal
offences for which an accused may be convicted only if the requisite mens
rea is demonstrated by the prosecution. At common law a corporate entity
could not generally be convicted of criminal offence. Corporate criminal
immunity stemmed from the abhorrence of the common law for vicarious liability
in criminal law, and from the doctrine of ultra vires, which regarded
criminal activities by corporate agents as beyond their authority and beyond
corporate capacity. At the other extreme in the spectrum of criminal offences
there are certain crimes which cannot in any real sense be committed by a
corporation as a principal, such as perjury and bigamy, whatever the doctrine
of corporate criminal liability may be. As a corporation may only act through
agents, there are basically only three approaches whereby criminal intent could
be said to reside or not reside in the corporate entity:

 

(i) a total vicarious
liability for the conduct of any of its agents whatever their level of
employment or responsibility so long as they are acting within the scope of
their employment;

 

(ii) no criminal
liability unless the criminal acts in question have been committed on the
direction or at the request, express or clearly implied, of the corporation as
expressed through its board of directors;

 

(iii) a median rule
whereby the criminal conduct, including the state of mind, of employees and
agents of the corporation is attributed to the corporation so as to render the
corporation criminally liable so long as the employee or agent in question is
of such a position in the organization and activity of the corporation that he
or she represents its de facto directing mind, will, centre, brain area
or ego so that the corporation is identified with the act of that
individual. There is said to be on this theory no responsibility through
vicarious liability or any other form of agency, but rather a liability arising
in criminal law by reason of the single identity wherein is combined the legal
entity and the natural person; in short, a primary liability. This rule stands
in the middle of the range or spectrum. It is but a legal fiction invented for
pragmatic reasons.

 

14.              The position of the corporation in
criminal law has been under examination by courts and lawmakers for centuries.
The questions which arise are manifold and complex. They are not likely to be
answered in a permanent or universal sense in this appeal, or indeed by the
courts acting alone. Proceeding through the history of these issues in the
criminal law adds perspective but no clear answer to the problem. The first
edition of Halsbury’s (1909) summarizes the position of the law up to
that point at vol. 8, p. 390, paragraph 858: 

 

                   858. By the general principles of the criminal law, if a matter is made a
criminal offence it is essential that there should be something in the nature
of mens rea, and therefore, in ordinary cases, a corporation aggregate
cannot be guilty of a criminal offence.

 

There were four exceptions in the early common law to corporate
immunity: (1) public nuisance, (2) criminal libel, (3) absolute liability
offences created by statute and (4) contempt of court. See also vol. 9, pp. 235‑36,
paragraph 503.

 

15.              The second edition of Halsbury’s,
published in 1933, is in precisely the same words as the earlier edition. By
the time of the publication of the third edition in 1954 the law had moved
along.

 

                   521.
Corporations. A corporation aggregate cannot be
guilty of any offences (such as bigamy or perjury) which by their very nature
can only be committed by natural persons; nor can a corporation aggregate be
found guilty of a crime where the only punishment is death or imprisonment.

 

                   Apart
from these exceptions, a corporation may be guilty both of statutory and of
common law offences, even though the latter involve mens rea; and in the
construction of any enactments relating to an offence punishable on indictment
or on summary conviction, the expression person"" includes a body corporate
unless the contrary intention appears. A corporation can only commit crimes by
or through its agents, some of whom must themselves be responsible for the
crime. It is a question of fact in each particular case whether the criminal
act of its agent is the act of the corporation, and whether the agent's state
of mind, intention, knowledge or belief can be imputed to the corporation. It
depends on the nature of the charge, the position of the officer or agent
relative to the corporation and the other relevant facts and circumstances of
the case.

 

(Vol. 10, pp. 281‑82, paragraph 521.)

 

See also Halsbury’s (3rd ed.), vol. 9, p. 90, paragaph 183. By
the time the fourth edition appeared in 1974 the law had changed a little more.
The learned authors of this edition had this to say (vol. 11, p. 30, paragraph
34):

 

                   34.
Corporations. In general, a corporation is in the
same position in relation to criminal liability as a natural person and may be
convicted of common law and statutory offences including those requiring mens
rea. There are, however, crimes which a corporation is incapable of
committing or of which a corporation cannot be found guilty as a principal....

 

                   Criminal
liability of a corporation arises where an offence is committed in the course
of the corporation's business by a person in control of its affairs to such a
degree that it may fairly be said to think and act through him so that his
actions and intent are the actions and intent of the corporation. It is not
enough that the person whose conduct it is sought to impute to the corporation
is a manager or responsible agent or high executive; whether persons are the
directing mind and will"" of a corporation, so that their conduct in its
affairs becomes the conduct of the corporation, must depend on all the
circumstances.

 

See also Halsbury’s (4th ed.), vol. 9, p. 804, paragraph 1379. 

 

16.              At common law there was no difficulty in
finding liability in a corporation in the law of torts, even though the state
of mind of the corporation was established by imputing to that corporation the
intentions and the conduct of its servants and agents. Thus, in the law of
torts, the courts from the earliest times found vicarious liability in the
corporation on the principles of agency. On the other hand, the common law of
England has shrunk back from the application of the doctrine of vicarious
liability for the determination of corporate liability in criminal law for the
acts of its agents (with the four exceptions already noted). This led to an
irrational result, namely: general corporate immunity from liability under the
criminal law at a time when the corporation, for a variety of reasons, had
become the principal vehicle of commerce in the community. The state itself,
through corporate and taxation legislation particularly, had actually promoted
or at least facilitated this result. Early in the century the courts began to
dismantle the principle of corporate immunity in the criminal law. Procedural
and other obstacles to the imposition of corporation criminal liability were
overcome. See Leigh, The Criminal Liability of Corporations and Other
Groups"" (1971), 9 U. Ott. L.R. 247, at pp. 248‑49. Perhaps
the last major procedural impediment, the impossibility, as seen by some
courts, of punishing a corporation when the only statutory sanction imposed was
imprisonment (for example, R. v. Great West Laundry Co. (1900), 3 C.C.C.
514 (Man. Q.B.)), was removed in 1909 by The Criminal Code  Amendment Act,
1909, 1909 (Can.), c. 9, s. 2  (the predecessor to the present s. 647  of the
Criminal Code ) which allowed the substitution of a fine in lieu of any
punishment where a corporation is convicted. Ironically, the destruction of the
most difficult barrier, the attribution of mens rea to a corporation,
began in earnest in a case in civil law: Lennard’s Carrying Co. v. Asiatic
Petroleum Co., [1915] A.C. 705. The House of Lords was concerned with a
corporation's civil liability for damages under a statute which afforded a
defence where such loss occurred without its fault in privity"". At issue
was whether the fault"" of a director who was active in the operations of
the corporation, was in law the fault of the corporation itself. The Lord
Chancellor, Viscount Haldane, laid down the general principle of corporate
liability which is still the guiding principle in United Kingdom law (at pp.
713‑14): 

 

... a corporation is an
abstraction. It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own;
its active and directing will must consequently be sought in the person of
somebody who for some purposes may be called an agent, but who is really the
directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the
personality of the corporation. That person may be under the direction of the
shareholders in general meeting; that person may be the board of directors
itself, or it may be, and in some companies it is so, that that person has an
authority co‑ordinate with the board of directors given to him under the
articles of association, and is appointed by the general meeting of the
company, and can only be removed by the general meeting of the company. ...
[W]hatever is not known about Mr. Lennard's position, this is known for
certain, Mr. Lennard took the active part in the management of this ship on
behalf of the owners, and Mr. Lennard, as I have said, was registered as the
person designated for this purpose in the ship's register. Mr. Lennard
therefore was the natural person to come on behalf of the owners and give full
evidence not only about the events of which I have spoken, and which related to
the seaworthiness of the ship, but about his own position and as to whether or
not he was the life and soul of the company. For if Mr. Lennard was the
directing mind of the company, then his action must, unless a corporation is
not to be liable at all, have been an action which was the action of the company
itself within the meaning of s. 502. It has not been contended at the Bar, and
it could not have been successfully contended, that s. 502 is so worded as to
exempt a corporation altogether which happens to be the owner of a ship, merely
because it happens to be a corporation. It must be upon the true construction
of that section in such a case as the present one that the fault or privity of
somebody who is not merely a servant or agent for whom the company is liable
upon the footing respondeat superior, but somebody for whom the company is
liable because his action is the very action of the company itself.

 

17.              Convictions were thereafter sustained
under a variety of statutes including those establishing offences requiring
proof of the element of mens rea, the courts applying the words of the
House of Lords in Lennard’s case, supra, in attributing to the
accused corporation the actions of the directing mind"". See Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors, Ltd., [1944] K.B. 146,
at pp. 155‑56, where Viscount Caldecote C.J. said:

 

The offences created by
the regulation are those of doing something with intent to deceive or of making
a statement known to be false in a material particular. There was ample
evidence, on the facts as stated in the special case, that the company, by the
only people who could act or speak or think for it had done both these
things,...

 

Macnaghten J., in a concurring opinion, expressed the principle in
broader terms (at p. 156): 

 

If the responsible agent
of a company, acting within the scope of his authority, puts forward on its
behalf a document which he knows to be false and by which he intends to
deceive, I apprehend that, according to the authorities that my Lord has cited,
his knowledge and intention must be imputed to the company.

 

See also R. v. I.C.R. Haulage, Ltd., [1944] K.B. 551 to the same
effect.

 

18.              These general principles found application
in the courts of this country in a series of cases. In R. v. Fane Robinson
Ltd., [1941] 3 D.L.R. 409, the Court of Appeal of Alberta set aside an
acquittal of two companies where two of its directors and officers conspired
with another to defraud an insurance company by inflating the charges made by
the defendant company to the insurance company for automobile repairs. Ford
J.A., for the Court, found, at p. 415, that the two officers were the:

 

. . . acting and directing
will of [the accused corporation] generally and in particular in respect of the
subject‑matter of the offences with which it is charged, that their
culpable intention (mens rea) and their illegal act (actus reus)
were the intention and the act of the company and that conspiracy to defraud
and obtaining money by false pretences are offences which a corporation is
capable of committing.

 

In so doing the Court followed the United Kingdom authorities,
including Lennard’s, supra, and found the company criminally
liable stating, at p. 410:

 

...if the act complained
of can be treated as that of the company, the corporation is criminally
responsible for all such acts as it is capable of committing and for which the
prescribed punishment is one which it can be made to endure.

 

The Court expressly avoided finding criminal liability through the
doctrine of respondeat superior. See also the later cases: R. v. Ash‑Temple
Co. (1949), 93 C.C.C. 267 (Ont. C.A.), per Robertson C.J.O., at pp.
279‑80; R. v. Electrical Contractors Association of Ontario and Dent,
[1961] O.R. 265 (C.A.), per Laidlaw J.A., at p. 280; R. v. H.J.
O’Connell Ltd., [1962] Que. Q.B. 666 (Q.C.A.), at p. 667; R. v. J.J.
Beamish Construction Co., [1966] 2 O.R. 867 (H.C.), at p. 891, per
Jessup J. as he then was; R. v. St. Lawrence Corp., [1969] 2 O.R. 305
(C.A.), per Schroeder J.A., at p. 320; R. v. Spot Supermarket Inc.
(1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 239 (Q.C.A.), per Lamer J.A., as he then was, at
p. 252; and R. v. P.G. Marketplace and McIntosh (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d)
185 (B.C.C.A.), per Nemetz C.J.B.C., at pp. 187‑88.

 

19.              The transition from virtual corporate
immunity from criminal liability to virtual equality with humans in like
circumstances under the criminal law is traced in greater detail by Jessup J.,
as he then was, in R. v. J.J. Beamish Construction Co., supra.
Three years later Schroeder J.A., of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, in R.
v. St. Lawrence Corp., supra, at pp. 315‑21, again reviewed
this transition. In the end Schroeder J.A., at p. 320, adopted the same
statement of the governing principle as Jessup J. had in Beamish, supra,
although the earlier case is not cited: 

 

                   While
in cases other than criminal libel, criminal contempt of Court, public nuisance
and statutory offences of strict liability criminal liability is not attached
to a corporation for the criminal acts of its servants or agents upon the
doctrine of respondeat superior, nevertheless, if the agent falls within
a category which entitles the Court to hold that he is a vital organ of the
body corporate and virtually its directing mind and will in the sphere of duty
and responsibility assigned to him so that his action and intent are the very
action and intent of the company itself, then his conduct is sufficient to
render the company indictable by reason thereof. It should be added that both
on principle and authority this proposition is subject to the proviso that in
performing the acts in question the agent was acting within the scope of his
authority either express or implied.

 

Counsel for MIL submitted that St. Lawrence, supra, does
not extend to the facts here before the Court; and counsel for CD submitted
that if it does so extend to the facts of this appeal, it was wrongly decided.

 

20.              This rule of law was seen as a result of
the removal of the officer or managerial level employee from the general class
of inferior servants or agents"" for whose acts the corporate employer
continued (as in the case of the human employer) to be immune from vicarious
liability in criminal law. This result is generally referred to as the
`identification' theory. It produces the element of mens rea in the
corporate entity, otherwise absent from the legal entity but present in the
natural person, the directing mind. This establishes the identity"" between
the directing mind and the corporation which results in the corporation being
found guilty for the act of the natural person, the employee. Such is the power
of legal reasoning. It is the direct descendant of Blackstone's famous theorem:
The husband and the wife in law are one and that one is the husband"". It
is a full brother of the dictum in corporate law that merging
corporations cease to exist but find a continuance in the amalgamated company.
In order to trigger its operation and through it corporate criminal liability
for the actions of the employee (who must generally be liable himself), the
actor‑employee who physically committed the offence must be the ego"",
the centre"" of the corporate personality, the vital organ"" of the
body corporate, the alter ego"" of the employer corporation or its
directing mind"". Schroeder J.A. in St. Lawrence, supra, for
example, refers to the officer or senior management employee as the
corporation's primary representative ... through whom the company acts, speaks
and thinks"" (p. 317). The terminology primary representative"" comes
from, or is coincidentally used in, C.R.N. Winn., The Criminal Responsibility
of Corporations"" (1929), 3 Camb. L.J. 398, where it is stated at p.
404:

 

... the conspiring minds
are in fact the minds of the directors, or other primary presentatives. It is
submitted that no mere conspiracy of inferior agents could affect the
corporation with criminal guilt. If the guilty intention in the minds of the
primary representatives is attributed to the corporation in this case where,
more than anywhere, it is the vital element of the offence, it seems that it
will always be proper to attribute to a corporation the guilty state of mind of
its primary representatives when they do criminal acts on its behalf in the
exercise of its powers. 

 

At page 407 the learned author continues:

 

It is clear, on the one
hand, that to seek to hold a corporation criminally liable for the acts of all
its servants within the scope of their employment would be an innovation. The
criminal law has never applied the maxim ‘respondeat superior’', and to seek to
ingraft from without what has not taken spontaneous growth might prove an
experiment foredoomed to failure.

 

It is the wrongful action of the ‘primary’ representative which by
attribution to the corporation creates ‘primary’ rather than ‘vicarious’
liability, according to the identification theory. This article is aptly
described by Jessup J. in Beamish, supra, as ""a prophetic
article"". Lord Reid in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd. v. Nattrass, [1972]
A.C. 153 (H.L.), challenged the accuracy of the expression alter ego""
and so joins Viscount Haldane in the use of the expression ‘ego’ of the
corporation. It follows that the management officer is not guilty additionally
of the offence of conspiring with the employer to commit the wrongful act in
question because in the identification theory there is only one entity, the
natural, and legal person having merged into one identity, and hence the basic
requirement of two persons in a conspiracy is not met. See R. v. Martin,
[1932] 3 W.W.R. 1 (Man. C.A.), per Dennistoun J.A., at p. 8; R. v.
McDonnell, [1966] 1 All E.R. 193, at p. 201; Leigh, The Criminal Liability
of Corporations and Other Groups"" supra, at p. 257; and Ewaschuk,
Corporate Criminal Liability and Related Matters"" (1975), 29 C.R.N.S.
44, at pp. 62‑64; but see also R. v. Electrical Contractors
Association of Ontario and Dent, supra, at p. 272. 

 

21.              The principle of attribution of criminal
actions of agents to the employing corporate principal in order to find
criminal liability in the corporation only operates where the directing mind is
acting within the scope of his authority (Beamish, supra,
at pp. 890 and 892, and St. Lawrence, supra, at p. 320), in the
sense of acting in the course of the corporations' business (Halsbury’s
(4th ed.), vol. 14, p. 30, paragraph 34, supra). Scattered throughout
the submissions on behalf of the four appellants, was a translation of the
directing mind rule to a requirement that for its application the directing
mind must, at all times, be acting in the scope of his employment.
Conversely, the argument went, if the directing mind was acting totally outside
the ‘scope of that employment’, the attribution of the acts of the directing
mind to the corporate employer would not occur. The terminological problems
arise from the fact that the concept of vicarious liability in the law of torts
has been traditionally fenced in by the concept of the employee acting within
`the scope of his employment' and not, in the classic words, on a frolic of his
own"". The identification theory, however, is not concerned with the scope
of employment in the tortious sense. Scope of employment"" in the St.
Lawrence judgment, supra, and the other discussions of that term in
Canadian law have reference to the field of operations delegated to the
directing mind. The charge by His Lordship to the jury makes this abundantly
clear, as does the Court of Appeal in its analysis of this defence. The Court
in St. Lawrence, supra, in describing the elements of the
delegation theory, concluded by adding that attribution to the corporation
occurred only so long as the directing will was acting in the scope of his
employment."" The expression comes from the law of tort and agency and from
master and servant law. It is not apt in relation to the identification theory.
It smacks of vicarious liability and it invites the defence that criminal
actions must prima facie be beyond the scope of an employee's duty and
authority. The learned trial judge, in directing the jury, expressed it more
accurately: ... so long as he was acting within the scope of the area of the
work assigned to him."" In Tesco, supra, at p. 171, Lord Reid
employed the phrase acting within the scope of delegation"" of the
corporation's business. The essence of the test is that the identity of the
directing mind and the company coincide so long as the actions of the former
are performed by the manager within the sector of corporation operation assigned
to him by the corporation. The sector may be functional, or geographic, or may
embrace the entire undertaking of the corporation. The requirement is better
stated when it is said that the act in question must be done by the directing
force of the company when carrying out his assigned function in the
corporation. It is no defense to the application of this doctrine that a
criminal act by a corporate employee cannot be within the scope of his
authority unless expressly ordered to do the act in question. Such a condition
would reduce the rule to virtually nothing. Acts of the ego of a
corporation taken within the assigned managerial area may give rise to
corporate criminal responsibility, whether or not there be formal delegation;
whether or not there be awareness of the activity in the board of directors or
the officers of the company; and, as discussed below, whether or not there be
express prohibition. 

 

22.              Generally the directing mind is also
guilty of the criminal offence in question. Glanville Williams, in Textbook
of Criminal Law (1978), states, at p. 947:

 

...the director or other
controlling officer will almost always be a co‑perpetrator of or
accessory in the offence....

 

In R. v. Fell (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 456, Martin J.A., for the
Ontario Court of Appeal, quoted the foregoing excerpt with approval but was
there concerned with determining whether the directing mind was also guilty of
the offence and not with the question as to whether or not this was a condition
precedent to corporate liability. It may well be inevitable that guilt of the
directing mind is a condition precedent to corporate guilt, but this has yet to
be stated judicially. This discussion is directed to the corporate
responsibility in criminal law where its directing mind has committed an
offence.

 

23.              The route which was taken in this country
and in the United Kingdom is not that which has been followed by the federal
courts of the United States. Criminal responsibility in the corporation has for
many years, in those courts, been placed upon the basis of the doctrine of respondeat
superior. The resultant vicarious liability seems to arise in the
corporation out of the criminal acts of any employee, supervisory, menial or
otherwise. The United States Supreme Court expounded this principle as far back
as New York Central and Hudson River Railway Co. v. United States, 212
U.S. 481 (1909). Although the statute there before the court specifically
imposed liability in the corporation for the acts of its employees (without
limitation), the courts have construed the case as establishing vicarious
criminal liability in a corporation for the wrongful acts of its employees of
all grades and classes. The rule was restated by the Court of Appeal of the 8th
Circuit in Egan v. United States, 137 F.2d 369 (1943), per Thomas
J., at p. 379:

 

                   The
test of corporate responsibility for the acts of its officers and agents,
whether such acts be criminal or tortious, is whether the agent or officer in
doing the thing complained of was engaged in employing the corporate powers
actually authorized"" for the benefit of the corporation while acting
within the scope of his employment in the business of the principal."" If
the act was so done it will be imputed to the corporation whether covered by
the agent or officer's instructions, whether contrary to his instructions, and
whether lawful or unlawful. Such acts under such circumstances are not ultra
vires even though unlawful. There is no longer any distinction in essence
between the civil and criminal liability of corporations, based upon the
element of intent or wrongful purpose. Malfeasance of their agents is not ultra
vires. 

 

These principles have been restated as recently as the judgment in United
States v. Basic Construction Co., 771 F.2d 570 (1983) (5th CCA).

 

24.              The state courts have not as consistently
pursued the course of vicarious liability of corporations in the criminal law.
In The People v. Canadian Fur Trappers Corp., 248 N.Y. 159 (1928), the
New York Court of Appeals, Crane J., speaking for a court that included Chief
Justice Cardozo, rejected vicarious liability as a basis for corporate criminal
responsibility and seemed to adopt, at pp. 163 and 169, something akin to the
identification theory. To the same effect is State of Idaho v. Adjustment
Department Credit Bureau, Inc., 483 P.2d 687 (1971), at p. 691, where
corporate liability was found only if:

 

...the commission of the
offence was authorized, requested, commanded or performed (i) by the board of
directors, or (ii) by an agent having responsibility for formation of corporate
policy or (iii) by a `high managerial agent' having supervisory responsibility
over the subject matter of the offense and acting within the scope of his
employment in behalf of the corporation.

 

State of Louisiana v. Chapman Dodge Center Inc., 428 S.2d 413 (1983), at pp. 419‑20, is to the same general
effect. For a position midway between the Canadian Fur Trappers, supra,
and these cases, see Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Beneficial Finance Co.,
275 N.E.2d 33 (1971).

 

25.              At the present time, therefore, the common
law in the United States seems to be based, in the federal courts on the
doctrine of vicarious liability, and in many of the state courts on something
akin to the identification doctrine. Court decisions are not a complete guide
to the state law on this matter, however, as some states have adopted the
American Law Institute Model Penal Code, which at para. 2.07 attributes
criminal liability to the corporation on much the same basis as did the Court
in State of Idaho v. Adjustment Department Credit Bureau, Inc., supra.
On the other hand, at least one state has by statute applied the doctrine of
vicarious liability without a limitation as to the level of responsibility of
the employee or agent. See Maine Criminal Code, 9 Maine Rev.
Stats.Anno., Title 17‑A, § 60.

 

26.              Australian jurisprudence on the subject of
corporate liability in criminal law offers little guidance in the settlement of
the issues these appeals throw up. In the Australian Commentary on
Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed.), vol. D, p. 31, paragraph C1379, it is
stated: With two exceptions, the law in Australia is the same as that in
England."" This would indicate that liability is imposed on the basis of
the identification theory. However, this work goes on to state:

 

                   In the
Code States (Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia)... corporations are
not liable for simple offences committed by their servants in the course of
their duties unless it can be shown that the servant was acting under
instructions from the company. 

 

It is at least clear that criminal responsibility does not arise on the
basis of vicarious liability. However, the concept that Australian courts are
following the United Kingdom identification doctrine is shattered by some of
the Australian law literature. The following is found in the text Howard, Criminal
Law (4th ed. 1982), at pp. 379‑80:

 

In Australia this problem
has been solved by borrowing from the civil law the notion of scope of
employment: E's actions are those of the corporation if they may reasonably be
regarded as within the scope of his employment. The scope of E's employment for
this purpose is not necessarily limited by what he has express authority to do,
for if it were, at least in the case of junior employees, it frequently would
be possible to exclude the operation of the criminal law by arguing that E had
no authority to commit an unlawful act. On the contrary, it has been held that
the knowledge of a junior employee may be the knowledge of the corporation even
though he has been forbidden by a senior employee to act in the manner to which
the knowledge relates.

 

                   The
scope of employment doctrine has enabled the courts in a number of cases to
convict corporations for the actions of quite junior employees.

 

Perhaps this conclusion simply illustrates the elasticity in each of
these two doctrines with the result that they tend to merge, overlap and blur
on application to specific sets of facts or under the wording of a particular
statute. The above text finds support in the judgment of the High Court of
Australia in R. v. Australian Films Ltd. (1921), 29 C.L.R. 195, where
the Court found the accused corporation vicariously liable, relying at p. 217
on Mousell Brothers, Ltd. v. London and North‑Western Railway Co.,
[1971] 2 K.B. 836. The statute there, however, required no mens rea and
the Court equated the corporation in that circumstance with a human employer‑defendant.
This uncertainty of doctrine to be applied is not cleared away by the decision
in Morgan v. Babcock and Wilcox Ltd. (1929), 43 C.L.R. 163 (H.C. of
Aus.) A passage in the judgment at pp. 173‑74 appears to apply without
limit the principle of vicarious liability. However, the offending agent in
that case was the managing director of the corporation and at p. 182 it would
appear that the Court in the end swung around to the application of the
identification theory as the basis of corporate guilt. The dissent of Starke J.
appears to apply both doctrines without favour in attributing the actions of
the employee to the corporation. Isaacs J. concurred with the majority in the
result but found a liability by reason of express authorization of the wrongful
acts by the board of directors of the company. At least one commentator takes
the view that these two cases leave open the issue in Australian law as to
whether corporate liability is determined in criminal law on the basis of
vicarious liability or as a primary liability through the identification
theory: W.B. Fisse, The Distinction Between Primary and Vicarious Corporate
Criminal Liability"" (1967), 41 A.L.J. 203, at p. 205. It would
appear that some of the lower court decisions favour vicarious liability as a
source of criminal responsibility in a corporation. See Australian
Stevedoring Industry Authority v. Oversea and General Stevedoring Co.
(1959), 1 F.L.R. 298. On the other hand, other judgments would appear to apply
the narrower rule of attributed acts under the identification theory. See Grain
Sorghum Marketing Board v. Supastok Pty. Ltd., [1964] Qd.R. 98; Lamb v.
Toledo‑Berkel Pty. Ltd., [1969] V.R. 343 at pp. 347‑48; Kehoe
v. Dacol Motors Pty. Ltd., [1972] Qd.R. 59; Universal Telecasters (QLD)
Ltd. v. Guthrie (1978), 32 F.L.R. 361; cf. Trade Practices Commission v.
Annand and Thompson Pty. Ltd. (1978), 19 A.L.R. 730. 

 

27.              It may be that Fisse, supra, is
correct when the learned author says, at p. 210, that the predominant overtone
in the judgments to date favours the identification or primary liability
doctrine over vicarious liability as the source of corporate criminal liability
under Australian law, but the margin is at best narrow. See also H.A.J. Ford, Principles
of Company Law (3rd ed. 1982), at pp. 133‑138.

 

28.              New Zealand has followed the same course
as the courts of the United Kingdom in adopting the principle of identification
to overcome problems of finding criminal liability in a corporation where the
older common law doctrines of rejection of respondeat superior in
criminal law, course of employment, and ultra vires combine to create a
substantial corporate immunity. The law of New Zealand is reviewed by J.C. Clad
in The Criminal Liability of Companies"", [1977] N.Z.L.J. 420,
particularly at p. 424. See also Nordik Industries Ltd. v. Regional
Controller of Inland Revenue, [1976] 1 NZLR 194. A commentary on Tesco
Supermarkets, supra, by I.A. Muir in (1973), 5 N.Z.U.L.R. 357, on
the contrary, concludes that in New Zealand law the source of corporate
criminal liability is shifting towards vicarious liability.

 

29.              In summary, therefore, the courts in this
country can be said to this date to have declined generally to apply the
principle of respondeat superior in the determination of corporate
criminal responsibility. Criminal responsibility in our courts thus far has
been achieved in the mens rea offences by the attribution to the
corporation of the acts of its employees and agents on the more limited basis
of the doctrine of the directing mind or identification. Corporate
responsibility in both strict and absolute liability offences has been found to
arise on the direct imposition of a primary duty in the corporation in the
statute in question, as construed by the court. By what appears to be the same
purely pragmatic reasoning, the courts of the United Kingdom find criminal
liability in a corporation only by the attribution to it of the conduct of its
employees and agents where those natural persons represent the core, mind and
spirit of the corporation. The United States federal courts are inclined, as we
have seen, to find criminal liability in the corporation by vicarious liability
where any employee‑agent commits, in the course of his employment, the
criminal act. 

 

30.              The criticisms of the United States
federal court doctrine are manifold. The net is flung too widely, it is said.
Corporations are punished in instances where there is neither moral turpitude
nor negligence. No public policy is served by punishing shareholders where the
corporate governing body has been guilty of no unlawful act. The disparity
between the treatment of the corporate employer and the natural employer is
wide and wholly without a basis in justice or political science. The test as
applied in the United States federal courts may be on the broad basis above indicated
because so many of the federal statutory crimes are regulatory in nature. See
Leigh, supra, p. 267, footnote 134.

 

31.              In the criminal law, a natural person is
responsible only for those crimes in which he is the primary actor either
actually or by express or implied authorization. There is no vicarious
liability in the pure sense in the case of the natural person. That is to say
that the doctrine of respondeat superior is unknown in the criminal law
where the defendant is an individual. Lord Diplock in Tesco, supra,
stated at p. 199:

 

Save in cases of strict
liability where a criminal statute, exceptionally, makes the doing of an act a
crime irrespective of the state of mind in which it is done, criminal law
regards a person as responsible for his own crimes only. It does not recognise
the liability of a principal for the criminal acts of his agent; because it
does not ascribe to him his agent's state of mind. Qui peccat per alium peccat
per se is not a maxim of criminal law.

 

On the other hand, the corporate vehicle now occupies such a large
portion of the industrial, commercial and sociological sectors that amenability
of the corporation to our criminal law is as essential in the case of the
corporation as in the case of the natural person. 

 

32.              Thus where the defendant is corporate the
common law has become pragmatic, as we have seen, and a modified and limited
`vicarious liability' through the identification doctrine has emerged. In this
context I use the word vicarious"" in the sense that it is defined in the
principal dictionaries, including the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary
(1959), where the term is defined: that takes or supplies the place of another
thing or person; substituted instead of the proper thing or person."" Lord
Reid in Tesco, supra, distinguishes vicarious liability from the
identity doctrine by wittingly or unwittingly sliding over into the merging
doctrine of corporate law. In common law and in some provincial corporate
legislation, two merging corporations find their continued existence in the
merged or amalgamated corporation. In common law this was deemed so by
operation of law or by a legal fiction. In this it is not alone. Consider the
invocation of the rule of distinction between crimes of specific and crimes of
general intent in order to limit and place on a rational basis acceptable to
the community the defence of drunkenness. Also to be considered is the
establishment of the doctrine of part performance in the interpretation of the Statute
of Frauds, which includes no reference whatever to any such doctrine but
which was created to prevent the Statute of Frauds itself being used to
practice a fraud. The corporation is but a creature of statute, general or
special, and none of the provincial corporation statutes and business
corporations statutes, or the federal equivalents, contain any discussion of
criminal liability or liability in the common law generally by reason of the
doctrine of identification. It is a court‑adopted principle put in place
for the purpose of including the corporation in the pattern of criminal law in
a rational relationship to that of the natural person. The identity doctrine
merges the board of directors, the managing director, the superintendent, the
manager or anyone else delegated by the board of directors to whom is delegated
the governig executive authority of the corporation, and the conduct of any of
the merged entities is thereby attributed to the corporation. In St.
Lawrence, supra, and other authorities, a corporation may, by this
means, have more than one directing mind. This must be particularly so in a
country such as Canada where corporate operations are frequently geographically
widespread. The transportation companies, for example, must of necessity
operate by the delegation and sub‑delegation of authority from the
corporate centre; by the division and subdivision of the corporate brain; and
by decentralizing by delegation the guiding forces in the corporate
undertaking. The application of the identification rule in Tesco, supra,
may not accord with the realities of life in our country, however appropriate
we may find to be the enunciation of the abstract principles of law there made.


 

33.              The corporation which set the directing
mind in position to do the wrong will suffer an economic penalty. While it is
true that this penalty will feed through to the stockholders, who may well be
totally innocent as in the case of a large public company, it may be seen as a
risk or cost associated with the privilege of operating through the corporate
vehicle. In the case of personal corporations, the imposition of a criminal
penalty on the corporation may be an additional penalty imposed upon the
‘personal’ corporate stockholder but such a result would be an acceptable part
of the sentencing process as it simply reflects the economic identification, as
well as the legal identification, present in such a corporation. In the case of
a public corporation, the economic identification factor is absent, and in a
theoretical sense there is an additional penalty for the same act which must be
justified in some way other than that suggested above. This is the inevitable
result of the pragmatic adoption of the attribution of the acts of its
delegates to the delegating corporation in order to bring that corporation
within the system of criminal justice. Whether the route taken be the doctrine
of respondeat superior or identification, the result is the same. The
corporation in reality has three elements: the legal entity, the personal
shareholder (a natural person directly or indirectly), and the employee. Once
the process is set in motion, the criminal penalty will extend directly or
indirectly to all three which is quite unlike the situation of a natural
proprietor where only two of these elements are present. All this, in my view,
while not entirely logical, is a tolerable result for a community where reality
dictates corporate criminal accountability in certain circumstances.

 

34.              There is one threshold problem which
arises before we come to the several defences advanced by the appellants. Was
there, on the facts here, a directing mind"" in the case of each appellant,
assuming for the purpose of answering this question only that the employee in
question had not defrauded the employer corporation, had not acted in his own
benefit, and had not acted in breach of instructions?

 

35.              The issue (aside from the applicability of
the above defences) was put to the jury by the learned trial judge in his
direction. Only CD in its submissions to this Court challenged the status of
its officer as a directing mind. CD argued that Schneider was not an officer or
in the employ of the appellant CD during part of the period in which the
alleged criminal acts took place.

 

36.              The issue arose because of the complex of
predecessors to the appellant CD. During the early 1960's a corporation now
called Foodex Systems Ltd. (then named Canadian Dredge and Dock Co., Limited)
owned all the shares of the appellant CD (then named T.C. Gorman (Nova Scotia)
Limited). At that time Schneider was in charge of the dredging operations of
Foodex Systems. In 1964 the shares of the appellant CD were sold by Foodex. In
1967 Foodex sold its dredging and marine assets to Bedford Construction Co.
Ltd., a company now known as Albemont Ltd., but which was known from 1967 to
1972 as Canadian Dredge & Dock Ltd. Schneider moved with the dredging
assets and became vice‑president and general manager of Albemont. In 1969
Albemont acquired all the issued shares of the capital stock of the appellant
when its name was T.C. Gorman (Nova Scotia) Limited. By a May 1971 agreement
Albemont agreed to sell its dredging and marine assets to the appellant CD. By
a second agreement dated October 1971 Albemont agreed to sell to the appellant
CD the remaining assets of its dredging and marine construction division.
Schneider later acquired a substantial block of shares in the appellant CD. 

 

37.              The question is whether Schneider was the
directing mind of the appellant CD during the periods covered by counts 1 and
6.

 

38.              A review of the trial judge's charge to
the jury reveals that he fairly put this issue to them. With respect to count 1
he charged, in part:

 

                   The
Crown alleges that the time period for Count 1 falls in the time period 3,
between May '71 and December '71. The Crown submits that Schneider was an
officer and director of both Canadian Dredge & Dock No. 2 [Albemont] and
T.C. Gorman [the appellant CD] at the time and that the Gorman Company, which
still carries on business, although it has changed its name, is still
responsible for the criminal acts of Schneider.

 

                   The
main issue for you is whether at that time Schneider was either expressly or
impliedly authorized to bid‑rig or whether he was a directing mind of
Gorman, now known as Canadian Dredge & Dock, the accused. If he was the
company would be responsible for his bid‑rigging; if he was not, the
company would not be responsible.

 

                                                                    ...

 

[T]he question then was,
was Schneider either authorized, expressly or impliedly, by Gorman or was he a
directing mind of Gorman.

 

                   If he
was, then the present Canadian Dredge and Dock would be responsible for the
actions of Schneider at that time.

 

                   Exhibits
filed by the Crown‑‑you may recall certain company returns‑‑showed
Schneider was a director of Gorman as of October 1st, 1963. For the years
ending April 30th, 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969 he is not shown as an officer or
director. Then the returns filed as of March 12th, 1971, and December 31st,
1971, show him as an officer and director of Gorman.

 

                   You may
recall this closing date for North Traverse was June 22nd, 1971.

 

                   Counsel
for the defence submits that this evidence alone does not prove that Schneider
was an officer and director of Gorman as of June 22nd, 1971, when he submitted
the tender on Ile d'Orleans.

 

                   Schneider
signed the tender as vice‑president and general manager, but the document
did not state of which company.

 

                   He
submitted that it is not clear whether Schneider was authorized to submit a
tender on behalf of Gorman and whether he was authorized to submit a false
tender.

 

                   Schneider's
evidence in chief was he was the vice‑president and general manager of
Canadian Dredge and Dock number 2 [Albemont] and was also an officer of Gorman.


 

                   On
cross‑examination he said he presumed he was vice‑president and
general manager of both companies, but he did not know for certain.

 

                   The
equipment had been sold to Gorman, but Canadian Dredge [Albemont] still
exercised control.

 

                   The
Crown submits the fact Schneider was a director and officer of Gorman on March
12th, 1971, signed the tender as of June 22nd, 1971, and was a director and
officer of Gorman on March 31st, 1971, is evidence from which they may
reasonably infer that he was an officer and director of Gorman on June 22nd,
1971.

 

                   Whether
he was or not is a question of fact for you. It is for you to decide whether or
not Schneider had authority, expressed or implied, or whether or not he was a
directing mind of Gorman.

 

The charge with respect to count 6 was given in like detail. The Court
of Appeal reviewed this evidence and the judge's charge to the jury and
concluded at p. 446:

 

                   It is
clear from these extracts that the learned trial Judge fairly put to the jury
the defences to counts 1 and 6, namely, that Canadian Dredge No. 3 did not
participate in bid‑rigging at North Traverse or Hamilton Harbour, and
that Schneider was neither authorized to bid‑rig nor was he the company's
directing mind.

 

39.              I am in respectful agreement with the
Court of Appeal that the jury must have found in the case of CD that Schneider
was the directing mind of the company and that there was evidence introduced at
trial in support of such a finding.

 

40.              DeRome was said to be the directing mind
of MIL. He died in August 1970. The contract in count 2, the only count in
issue in this Court, was entered into in 1969. The Court of Appeal found that
there was evidence to support the conclusion which the jury must necessarily
have reached that DeRome was the directing mind of MIL. This is not challenged
on appeal.

 

41.              In the case of the appellants Porter and
Richelieu, Rindress was found by the Court of Appeal to be the directing mind
of each of these appellants. This was not challenged in this Court.

 

42.              I turn to the submission by the appellants
that the identification theory cannot import into the criminal law a brand of
vicarious liability under any of the authorities where the wrongful acts of the
directing mind were done in fraud on the employer, for the benefit of the
employee, or contrary to the instructions issued by the employer. Whether there
be evidence to support a finding that the employee of each of these appellants
acted in fraud on the employer, for his own benefit, or contrary to
instructions, I set aside until after the applicability of these defences in
Canadian criminal law is examined. .

 

43.              The third defence, acts carried out in the
face of express instructions to the contrary, is susceptible to easy
disposition. Neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal dealt squarely
with this issue, although it came up obliquely on the issue of authorization.
This treatment of this matter could not have affected the result. The argument
that actions taken by an employee contrary to express instructions cannot be
attributed to the corporate employer in order to found criminal liability, was
advanced most forceably by the late Mr. Laidlaw on behalf of CD with reference
to counts 3, 4 and 5 only. Martin, the President of CD, testified that he
warned Schneider that bid‑rigging activities were not to be undertaken on
pain of dismissal. These discussions were put to the jury but only in relation
to the issue of CD's criminal responsibility through the authorization of
Schneider to bid‑rig. Martin was acquitted, CD was convicted. It follows
inexorably that the jury did not find that Schneider was authorized expressly
or implicitly to rig bids. It follows in turn that the jury of necessity
concluded that Schneider was the directing mind of CD. Accepting that the
acquittal of Martin raises a possibility that an express prohibition was
issued, the failure to charge the jury with respect to the relationship between
express instructions not to engage in illegal activity and the attraction of
corporate criminal liability via the identification theory would only be of
consequence if such instructions in law can affect corporate criminal
liability. If the law recognized such a defence, a corporation might absolve
itself from criminal consequence by the simple device of adopting and
communicating to its staff a general instruction prohibiting illegal conduct
and directing conformity at all times with the law. That is not to say that
such an element is without relevance when considering corporate liability with
reference to offences of strict liability, supra. Where, however, the
court is concerned with those mens rea offences which can in law be
committed by a corporation, the presence of general or specific instructions
prohibiting the conduct in question is irrelevant. The corporation and its
directing mind became one and the prohibition directed by the corporation to others
is of no effect in law on the determination of criminal liability of either the
directing mind or the corporation itself by reason of the actions of the
directing mind. This accords with the result reached in other courts. 

 

44.              In the Australian case, Grain Sorghum
Marketing Board v. Supastok Pty. Ltd., supra, at p. 105, Jeffriess
J. held the company criminally liable despite the employee's breach of company
instructions because the employee:

 

...represented the mind
and will of the company.... The position would be otherwise had the purchase
been made by a storeman, or some servant in a similar capacity contrary to his
instructions.

 

45.              The United States federal courts,
operating under the vicarious liability concept, have taken the same view. In United
States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d 1000 (1972) (9th CCA), at pp. 1006‑07,
the Court balanced the general instructions given to a manager to maximize
profits against directions to the manager to obey the anti‑trust
provisions of the Sherman Act and concluded that the former would in
reality prevail. The view was expressed that the profits from such a violation
would be realized by the corporation; the isolation of the employee directly
responsible for the breach is difficult in these cases; and punishment of the
business entity is both appropriate and effective. Accordingly, conviction was
confirmed so long as the test in vicarious liability, that the employee was
acting in the scope of his employment, was met even though the employee at the
time was acting contrary to general corporate policy and express instructions.
The Court added a rider that seems to leave the door open to such a defence
when it said, at p. 1007:

 

Appellant could not gain
exculpation by issuing general instructions without undertaking to enforce
those instructions by means commensurate with the obvious risks.

 

This hints of a shade of the strict liability defence. The defence was
rejected in two Canadian courts: Upholsterers International Union of North
America, Local 1 v. Hankin & Struck Furniture Ltd. (1964), 49 W.W.R. 33
(B.C.C.A.), and R. v. Waterloo Mercury Sales Ltd., [1974] 4 W.W.R. 516
(Alta. D.C.)

 

46.              The argument of express prohibition was
not made by MIL and there is no evidence to support such a submission.
Reference was made to such a defence in the abstract by counsel for Porter and
Richelieu but no evidence was identified in support and I can find none in the
record. The last part of both questions put to this Court should accordingly be
answered in the negative. 

 

47.              The two remaining issues as to the effect,
if any, of the directing mind of the corporation acting in whole or in part in
fraud on the corporation"" or wholly or partly for his own benefit""
raise problems both of terminology and substance. The two questions in
substance raise the same legal issues. The immediate question which arises is
whether or not there is, in fact and in law, any controlling difference between
a directing mind acting in fraud of the corporation and a directing mind acting
on behalf of the corporation as its managerial arm but doing so for his own
benefit. As will be mentioned below, there are fine factual distinctions which
one can make between the two concepts. In substance, however, these appeals can
be more usefully analysed if the practical view is taken that the situation as
between the corporation and its directing mind is the same whether the
directing mind is acting in fraud of the corporation or whether he is acting
against the interests of the corporation for his own benefit.

 

48.              The identification theory was inspired in
the common law in order to find some pragmatic, acceptable middle ground which
would see a corporation under the umbrella of the criminal law of the community
but which would not saddle the corporation with the criminal wrongs of all of
its employees and agents. If there were to be no outer limit on the reach of
the doctrine, the common law would have established criminal corporate
liability by the doctrine of respondeat superior. What then is the
appropriate outer limit of the attribution of criminal conduct of a directing
mind when he undertakes activities in fraud of the corporation or for his own
benefit?

 

49.              Parker A.C.J.H.C. dealt with these issues
in a single formula in his charge to the jury. He then adapted that formula to
the circumstances as revealed in the evidence of each of the many accused
including these four appellants. The general proposition of law relating to
corporate criminal liability was expressed by the Associate Chief Justice, in
his directions to the jury, in this way:

 

A company may be
responsible for the criminal acts of its servant in two situations; (1) if the
servant has authority, express or implied, to do the act, or (2) if the servant
is virtually its directing mind in the sphere of duty assigned to him so that
his actions and intent are the very actions and intent of the company itself...

 

It should be noted that the appeal of each of the appellants in this
Court proceeded on the basis that liability was not attracted on the first
ground but on the basis of the identification theory. The Associate Chief
Justice continued:

 

It is a question of fact
for you whether or not a person was a directing mind of the company. A director
may say that the company did not give authority to a particular employee to do
a certain act. This may then negative express authority but leave untouched the
scope of an agent's implied authority. If an agent is virtually the directing
mind of the company, the failure of the directors to confer express authority
on him to do the particular act is irrelevant. 

 

50.              The learned Associate Chief Justice
applied this law to count 6, which relates to CD, as follows:

 

                   Counsel
raised two more points for your consideration. He asked, If Schneider acted
without the knowledge and consent of the directors for his own benefit, not
that of the company, then how can the company be responsible?""

 

                   There
is no doubt Schneider was acting in his own self interest when he made a deal
to take 20,000 [sic 200,000] in cash for 300,000 on the score
sheet, but, nevertheless, he did agree to submit a fictitious high tender on
behalf of Canadian Dredge and Dock. The company's tender went in and it
accomplished the purpose it was intended to accomplish. J.P. Porter got the
bid.

 

                   The law
is that if a corporation puts an employee in a position where he is in control
of a particular sphere of its operations so that he is virtually a company mind
and will in the sphere of duty assigned to him, the company is responsible for
his actions within that sphere. It doesn't matter that he was acting for his
own benefit.

 

                   Counsel
submitted that he called three directors who said that they had no knowledge;
that they gave no authority to Schneider and that the by‑laws required
Schneider to take the direction of the board. The same law applies. If
Schneider was a directing mind of the company, express or implied authority
wouldn't matter.

 

                   The
issue is, at the time of the Hamilton bid was Schneider a directing mind.
Remember that the new directors had not yet been appointed. The take‑over
didn't occur until December the 17th. Whether or not the directors subsequently
appointed knew of the bid‑rigging may go to their own guilt. We are not
concerned with that at this time, only the guilt or innocence of the company.

 

                   If you
find that Schneider submitted a fictitious bid at Hamilton and if you find that
at that time he was a directing mind of T.C. Gorman, now known as Canadian
Dredge and Dock Company Limited, then that accused would be responsible even if
Schneider was acting in his own self interest and without express or implied
authority from the company. 

 

On the same count the jury was charged as follows with respect to the
liability of the accused Porter:

 

... if the company places
an employee in a certain position and gives him the authority to act legally
within a particular sphere so that his acts are virtually the acts of the
company and he is a directing mind of the company within that sphere of
operations, then the company is responsible for his criminal acts regardless of
whether or not he is acting in fraud of the company.

 

The learned Associate Chief Justice consistently charged the jury on
the same basis.

 

51.              The Court of Appeal, on the general
principle of corporate liability in Canadian criminal law, agreed with the
learned trial judge (p. 312, supra). On the effect on the criminal
liability of a corporate master where the employee, the directing mind, acts in
fraud upon the corporation, the Court of Appeal rejected the appellants' submissions
(at p. 315):

 

                   Where
superior officers of the company who are its directing minds act dishonestly in
the functions delegated to them, it seems consistent with public policy to hold
the corporation criminally liable. The imposition of criminal liability on the
corporation in these circumstances stimulates shareholders to exercise stricter
supervision and control in the selection of its directors and compels directors
to be alert to the corporate practices of its senior personnel.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   We
would therefore not give effect to the argument that a finding of fraud
perpetrated by these officers against their companies precluded a finding of
criminal liability against those companies.

 

52.              It has been said by many authors that no
social purpose is served by convicting a corporation whose directing mind has
acted throughout in fraud of that corporation and its undertaking. Similarly,
where the wrongful act is conceived and designed to benefit only the directing
mind and without any benefit to the corporate employer, it has been said that
no social purpose is served by convicting a corporation in such a circumstance.


 

53.              The leading case is Moore v. I.
Bresler, Ltd., [1944] 2 All E.R. 515. This case was decided about the same
time as the judgments came down in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent
and Sussex Contractors, Ltd., supra, and R. v. I.C.R. Haulage,
Ltd., supra, and brought into prominence in the criminal law the rationale
for the identification theory established thirty years earlier in Lennard’s
case, supra. Moore v. Bresler, citing Kent, supra,
dealt with the defence raised by the corporate accused that its agents, its
officers and employees, the co‑accused who actually committed the acts in
question, had done so in fraud on their employer, the corporate accused. The
individual accused were the corporate secretary, who was also a general manager
of the company's branch in question, and the sales manager of the same branch.
Acting in collusion, they sold some of the company's stock in trade and kept
the proceeds without making any entry of the transaction in the corporate
accounts. These sales were clearly made in fraud on the corporation and without
knowledge in the board of directors or officials of the company. The two
employees then filed false tax returns, no doubt reflecting only recorded sales
and omitting any reference to the fraudulent sales made by the co‑defendants.
From the facts revealed in the judgments, it would appear that the purchasers
from the individual defendants received good title to the merchandise
wrongfully sold to them. The King's Bench Division found that the employees
were the directing minds, and because they were acting in the scope of their
authority in making the sales which were carried out in the performance of
their responsibilities and duties to the company, the company was accordingly
liable for their acts.

 

54.              On appeal, Viscount Caldecote C.J. applied
the ‘guiding mind of the company’ theory and imputed the acts of the employee‑defendants
to the corporate‑defendant (pp. 516‑17):

 

These two men were
important officials of the company, and when they made statements and rendered
returns which were proved in this case, they were clearly making those
statements and giving those returns as the officers of the company, the proper
officers to make the returns. Their acts, therefore, as, indeed, the Recorder
seems to have been prepared to agree, were the acts of the company.

 

The Lord Chief Justice did not mention the defence of fraud on the
company by its co‑defendants, the directing minds. Birkett J., the third
member of the Court, adopted the reasons of Humphreys J. who rejected this
defence. Humphreys J. in his judgment stated at p. 517: 

 

...and the sale is not
less made with the authority of the master because the employee means to put
into his own pocket the proceeds of the sale when he receives them. That is
what the Recorder goes on to say, that those sales were made‑‑not
that the returns were made‑‑in fraud of the respondents. That is
perfectly true, but there is no authority that I am aware of, and there is a
very great deal of authority to the contrary, for the proposition that because
a servant does something in fraud of his master, although it is something which
he is actually paid to do, such as a sales manager making a sale, that,
therefore, the master is not responsible for the sale.

 

Thus all members of the Court found the criminal actions of the co‑defendant
directing minds were in law imputed to the company and two members expressly
rejected the defence that the corporate defendant, wholly unaware of these
acts, could not be criminally responsible therefor because they were done by
its employees wholly in fraud on the company. The Lord Chief Justice, by
implication, also rejected this defence but apparently on the ground that the
fraudulent conduct above would not take the co‑defendants out of the
scope of their employment and hence the corporate defendant would be criminally
responsible. That result seems to be a blend of the vicarious liability and the
directing mind theories. As has been seen, the term course of employment""
has a different meaning with reference to the directing mind concept than in
the tracing of tortious liability in a corporation or any other master.

 

55.              This is the case upon which the Court of
Appeal below relied, as did the respondent in this Court, for the denial of the
defence advanced by all four appellants of fraud on the company and the related
defence that the actions in question were taken entirely for the benefit of the
individual employees, the directing minds of the appellants. This case has been
mentioned in a few subsequent judgments of the courts of the United Kingdom and
this country but has never been applied in the Court of Appeal or the House of
Lords in England or in this Court. The judgment has been decried by several
authors: S.M. Waddams, ""Alter Ego and the Criminal Liability of
Corporations"" (1966), 24 U.T. Fac. L.R. 145, at pp. 148‑149;
R.S. Welsh, The Criminal Liability of Corporations"" (1946), 62 L.Q.R.

Yarosky,  The Criminal Liability of Corporations"" (1964), 10 McGill
L.J. 142, at p. 148. 

 

56.              Critical comments have been founded
largely on the basis that acts of employees taken wholly in fraud of the
corporation, done in circumstances wherein no awareness arose in the
corporation of the planning and perpetration of the wrongful acts, and not
occurring by reason of any failure on the part of the corporation to supervise
its operations in accordance with accepted management standards of the day,
should not be imputed to the corporation for the purpose of investing criminal
liability. No purpose, it is said, could be served by so doing and the
community would be no better protected by such a principle. See M.W. Caroline,
""Corporate Criminality and the Courts: Where are they Going?"" (1985),
27 C.L.Q. 237, at pp. 245‑46.

 

57.              The question arises as to whether on the
facts and charge of Moore v. Bresler there is a defence in respect of
either a fraud charge or the Tax Act charge in the corporation by reason
of the fact that the dishonest act was committed by the directing mind but in
fraud on the company or wholly or partly for the benefit of the dishonest
employee. Were the charge in question a charge of fraud, there would clearly be
no benefit to the corporation, and indeed the design of the dishonest employee
was aimed squarely at reducing the financial stature of the employer. It can
hardly be said with any reality that a person designing and executing such a
scheme could be, while doing so, the directing mind and the ego of the
company itself. That being so, no longer would we be faced with the logical
conundrum that a person however dishonest cannot defraud himself. Once the ego
is split into its original two parts that problem disappears. The employee
would be guilty of fraud and the victim of that fraud would be the company. The
victim would, in all logic, have a defence against a charge that it too had
committed fraud in its own right. Were the criminal law otherwise, it would not
provide protection of any interest in the community. Punishment of the
corporation for such acts of its employee would not advantage society by
advancing law and order. It is otherwise, however, where there is benefit to
the corporation, in whole or in part, from the unlawful acts of its directing
mind. The charge with reference to the tax returns raises different
considerations. 

 

58.              The Court in Moore v. Bresler was
dealing with a charge under the taxing statute, not fraud charges relating to
the wrongful sales. If the Court had been dealing with a fraud charge, the
effect of some of the dicta would be much clearer. In this transaction, the
employees were doing two things. Firstly, they filed the tax return in order to
comply with a statutory requirement for annual filing and by so doing they also
sought to cover their tracks so that they would not be prosecuted for theft,
fraud, embezzlement, etc. at the behest of their employer. At the same time as
they were furthering their dishonest scheme, they were also filing a tax return
which entitled the corporation to a lower tax payment than would be the case if
the total revenue, real and constructive, of the company were revealed to the
revenue collector. The sales were a fraud on the company but the false tax
returns were not. They were a fraud on the community through the government
department administering the Tax Act. The dishonest directing minds
continued to act in the course of their assigned managerial duties when filing
the tax returns. Thus, in a perverse way, it may be said that the company
enjoyed a benefit in that the risk not only of suffering loss of revenue
through embezzlement but also that the company would be taxed on the lost
revenue, was somewhat reduced by the dishonest tax return. As it turned out,
the company was exposed by the revenue collector to the actuality of the higher
taxation. Once the dishonest employees are found to have been the directing
minds of the company and once it is found that they were at the time of the
commission of the dishonest acts acting in the course of their employment, in
the sense that they were carrying out the enterprise and policies of the
corporate employer, then their dishonest actions are attributed to the company
whose liability in criminal law follows. The rule in Moore v. Bresler,
if it is as broad as some have stated, may not be one which has its factual and
theoretical roots in a transaction where a defence arises by reason of a total
lack of benefit in the victim.

 

59.              In R. v. Parker Car Wash Systems Ltd.
(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 37. Hughes J., sitting in the High Court of Justice,
while not citing Moore v. Bresler, supra, (except indirectly
through a reference to Tesco, supra) reluctantly"" applied
the identification theory to attribute to the accused employer corporation the
wrongful activities of its directing mind. In the Parker case, the
company received no benefit by reason of the wrongful conduct of the directing
mind and, in fact, was deprived of moneys it otherwise would have received. In
the result, the corporation was convicted under the Tax Act and
apparently assessed under that Act as well with reference to moneys wrongfully
paid out by it through the illegal actions of its directing mind. The
corporation was found criminally liable notwithstanding the resultant position
of loss not only of the moneys taken from its treasury by its employee, but
also the taxes payable by the corporation in excess of that which would
otherwise have been payable. For a comment on this case see A Feature of
Corporate Criminal Liability or Why the Brains of a Corporation Are Not
Necessarily Its `Intimate Friends' "" (1977‑78), 2 Can. Bus.
L.J. 474, by Dean Peter Burns. 

 

60.              Bresler, supra, finds a
parallel in U.S. law in Old Monastery Co. v. United States 147 F.2d 905
(1945) (4th CCA). The defence of the corporate accused was that the acts of
conspiracy in price fixing committed by its directing officers were not of
benefit to the corporation, nor were they intended to benefit the corporation.
Consequently it was argued that criminal liability could not result from the
attribution of such acts to the corporation. The Court found criminal liability
in the corporate defendant on the basis of the doctrine of vicarious liability
and specifically rejected the defence of no benefit"".

 

We do not accept benefit
as a touchstone of corporate criminal liability; benefit, at best, is an
evidential, not an operative, fact.

 

(Per Dobie J., at p. 908.)

 

The result is simple and direct vicarious liability of an otherwise
innocent employer corporation.

 

61.              In United States v. Empire Packing Co.,
174 F.2d 16 (1949) (7th CCA), at p. 20 corporate liability was attracted
despite the fact that the corporation employer received no benefit from the actions
of its agent. However, the Court did not need to decide whether an intention on
the part of the wrongdoing employee to benefit the employer corporation by his
unlawful activities was required in order to infect the corporation with
criminal liability.

 

62.              These two cases were followed by Standard
Oil Co. of Texas v. United States, 307 F.2d 120 (1962) (5th CCA). In that
case, the Court found the corporate employer innocent because the rule of
vicarious liability did not attribute to the employer the dishonest actions of
its employees where those employees intended that the corporation would receive
no benefit from their dishonest activities. This result was achieved by simply
concluding that such acts by an employee took him outside of the scope of his
employment:

 

                   Of
course the defendants do not contend, nor could they, that criminal
accountability and actual benefit are equated. There have been many cases, and
there may well be others in the future, in which the corporation is criminally
liable even though no benefit has been received in fact. But while benefit is
not essential in terms of result, the purpose to benefit the corporation is
decisive in terms of equating the agent's action with that of the corporation.
For it is an elementary principle of agency that an act of a servant is not
within the scope of employment if it is done with no intention to perform it as
a part of or incident to a service on account of which he is employed.""

 

(Per Brown J., at p. 128.) 

 

Although the Court cited Old Monastery, supra, and did
not say that it was being reversed, the clear and undeniable result is that it
was reversed. There have been many similar decisions in the United States
federal courts:

 

United States v. Carter, 311 F.2d 934
(1963) (6th CCA), at p. 942;

 

United States v. Ridglea State Bank,
357 F.2d 495 (1966) (5th CCA);

 

United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., supra,
at p. 1006n;

 

United States v. Basic Construction Co., supra,
at p. 573;

 

United States v. Beusch, 596 F.2d 871
(1979) (9th CCA), at pp. 877‑78;

 

United States v. Cincotta, 689 F.2d 238
(1982) (1st CCA), at pp. 241‑42;

 

United States v. Richmond, 700 F.2d 1183
(1983) (8th CCA), at p. 1195n.

 

In all these United States Federal Court decisions the courts were determining
the issue on the basis of the doctrine of vicarious liability and not on the
identification theory and this is fundamental to an understanding of the
treatment accorded the defences of fraud on the company for employee benefit.

 

63.              The courts of New Zealand in Nordik,
supra, were called upon to deal with almost the same factual situation
as in Bresler, supra. The Court attributed to the corporation the
fraudulent acts of its managing director who was virtually the sole
shareholder. The tax returns in question were made properly by the company
accountant from company records but because of the managing director's
fraudulent conduct the company accounts did not reflect the cash receipts which
had been diverted to the managing director upon his fraudulent sale of company
assets. The Court appears to apply the identity doctrine attributing this
conduct to the corporation to establish its guilt, but does not purport to
follow Bresler because the learned justices interpreted that case (in
the light of Tesco, supra) as apparently being decided upon the
basis of vicarious liability. Despite a reluctance to impose the rather clumsy
sanction of criminal liability on corporations where no blame could fairly be
imputed to those truly responsible for the affairs of the corporation"",
the Court found corporate liability. At the conclusion of his judgment Cooke J.
foreclosed any defence of fraud on the company (at p. 202):

 

...once identification has
been made out, it must follow, I think, that for the purposes of the criminal
law in a case of the present kind the question of fraud on the company becomes
irrelevant and indeed meaningless. A person cannot defraud himself. The essence
of the doctrine of identification is that the individual is treated as the
company's self. They are one and the same. 

 

64.              This case, in the result, follows the
popular interpretation of Bresler on the issue of the defence of fraud
on the company by the directing mind by denying such a defence at least in the
circumstances of that case. It must be noted that because Nordik is a
case where the directing mind owned over eighty per cent of the shares, it is
less than a telling comment when the Court said that a person cannot defraud
himself for the purposes of the identification doctrine. Where there are
several directing minds, and there is no economic identity between the
directing minds and the shareholders, it is less realistic to extend the
fiction of identity. The dishonest directing mind is in fact cheating the
company and thereby its shareholders and not himself.

 

65.              In my view, the outer limit of the
delegation doctrine is reached and exceeded when the directing mind ceases
completely to act, in fact or in substance, in the interests of the
corporation. Where this entails fraudulent action, nothing is gained from
speaking of fraud in whole or in part because fraud is fraud. What I take to be
the distinction raised by the question is where all of the activities of the
directing mind are directed against the interests of the corporation with a
view to damaging that corporation, whether or not the result is beneficial economically
to the directing mind, that may be said to be fraud on the corporation.
Similarly, but not so importantly, a benefit to the directing mind in single
transactions or in a minor part of the activities of the directing mind is in
reality quite different from benefit in the sense that the directing mind
intended that the corporation should not benefit from any of its activities in
its undertaking. A benefit of course can, unlike fraud, be in whole or in part,
but the better standard in my view is established when benefit is associated
with fraud. The same test then applies. Where the directing mind conceives and
designs a plan and then executes it whereby the corporation is intentionally
defrauded, and when this is the substantial part of the regular activities of
the directing mind in his office, then it is unrealistic in the extreme to
consider that the manager is the directing mind of the corporation. His entire
energies are, in such a case, directed to the destruction of the undertaking of
the corporation. When he crosses that line he ceases to be the directing mind
and the doctrine of identification ceases to operate. The same reasoning and
terminology can be applied to the concept of benefits. 

 

66.              Where the criminal act is totally in fraud
of the corporate employer and where the act is intended to and does result in
benefit exclusively to the employee‑manager, the employee‑directing
mind, from the outset of the design and execution of the criminal plan, ceases
to be a directing mind of the corporation and consequently his acts could not
be attributed to the corporation under the identification doctrine. This might
be true as well on the American approach through respondeat superior.
Whether this is so or not, in my view the identification doctrine only operates
where the Crown demonstrates that the action taken by the directing mind (a)
was within the field of operation assigned to him; (b) was not totally in fraud
of the corporation; and (c) was by design or result partly for the benefit of
the company.

 

67.              The factual basis for these ‘defences’ to
corporate criminal liability raised by the appellants must now be examined. The
second question in this appeal explicitly raises the issue of evidentiary support
for these three defences. CD advanced the submission that the issue was also
raised, at least by inference, in the first question. MIL takes the approach
that the issue as to whether the directing mind of MIL acted wholly or partly
in fraud of MIL or wholly or partly for his own benefit should have been left
to the jury, but it was not. In essence, therefore, the submission is that
there was evidence to support the position that DeRome, the directing mind of
MIL, acted wholly in fraud of MIL and wholly for his own benefit, and
consequently there should not be any attribution of his acts to MIL so as to
raise liability in MIL for the criminal acts of its directing mind. Under the
second question with reference to the appellants Porter and Richelieu, the issue
as to whether there is any evidence that Rindress, their directing mind, was
acting wholly or partly in fraud of these appellants or wholly or partly for
his own benefit, is squarely raised. 

 

68.              It is possible, and indeed convenient, to
discuss the defences of fraud and benefit in connection with all four
appellants at the same time. It is evident from the record that as a result of
the illegal machinations of their respective directing minds, all four
appellants received contracts, subcontracts, or other benefits. In the case of
CD, for example, the corporation received a subcontract under the Toronto
Harbour contract, which was the subject of count 4. This was received by CD in
return for its submission of an accommodation bid. In the case of MIL, it was
awarded the contract at Beauport Banks, the subject of count 2, as the low
bidder as the result of arrangements made by the directing mind of MIL for two
accommodation bids. The price"" paid for these accommodation bids was a thirty
per cent subcontract to one high bidder and a royalty"" on quantities
excavated, to the other high bidder. The law does not require that the courts
conduct a detailed inquiry into the minutiae of inter‑conspirators'
accounts in order to ascertain whether the contracts and subcontracts were
profitable to the member of the conspiracy in question. Similarly, Richelieu
participated in the performance of the contract which is the subject of count 1
and secured the contract in count 3. These contracts were awarded as the result
of tenders made by the directing minds of the respective corporate
participants. The evidence is overwhelming that as a result of the system
developed by their respective directing minds, the appellants received benefits
in the form of contracts and subcontracts, direct payouts and other benefits.
It is also evident that the directing minds who committed this wrongful conduct
benefited themselves in a variety of ways including cash receipts, share
positions in participating companies, and other arrangements. It was in fact a
`share the wealth' project for the benefit of all concerned except the public
authorities who awarded the dredging contracts. It is, therefore, impossible to
come to any conclusion other than that reached by the trial judge and the Court
of Appeal that in these activities the directing minds were acting partly for
the benefit of the employing appellant and partly for their own benefit.
Accordingly the factual basis for a corporate defence of lack of intended and
received corporate benefit is not present in these appeals.

 

69.              Evidence of the same nature leading to the
same result is found in connection with the defence of fraud by the directing
minds of the appellants. There was an elaborate array of evidence which
revealed that some of the directing minds had acquired, or otherwise put in
place, corporate entities to act as fronts for them in receiving benefits from
the price‑rigging schemes. 

 

70.              The appellants, Porter and Richelieu in
particular, pressed the argument that Rindress acted in fraud on these
appellants when he diverted score sheet credits of Richelieu and Porter to the
account or credit of other conspirators. This falls short of forming the base
for a defence of fraud on the employer by its directing mind. Fundamental to
the big‑rigging schemes was the agreement amongst participants in the
conspiracy to enhance the lowest bid, which was designed to be the successful
bid, by an amount at least equal to the cost of compensation to be paid by the
successful bidder to the accommodation bidders, and sometimes to other
conspirators who did not participate in the bidding then in question. The score
sheet"" was the inter‑conspirator accounting document on which was
recorded the entitlement in these moneys to be wrongfully recovered from the
contracting party, usually a public authority. In short, the moneys
fraudulently recovered from the property owner were divided up amongst the
conspirators as their share of the ill‑gotten gains. Whatever property
there is in a thief in the product of his theft, or whatever his ability to
maintain his title against the world, a corporation cannot be said to have been
defrauded in the sense herein employed when the only thing of which it is
deprived in part, or indeed all, of the product of the crime of which it is
charged. In the transactions now before the Court, one conspirator could not
successfully recover from another conspirator the claimant's share in the
proceeds of the fraud. Remarkably this was attempted indirectly by two of the
conspirators, as the evidence revealed, but the matter was settled out of court
and the only real result of that litigation was the use of the pleadings by the
Crown as evidence of guilt here. The appellant Porter, for example, could not
sue CD for funds diverted from the score sheet credit of Porter to CD.
Consequently, the directing mind Rindress could not act in fraud of Porter by
depriving Porter of its share of the overpricing in a dredging contract. The
same applies as between Rindress and Richelieu and as between any of the
directing minds and the other appellants, their respective employers. 

 

71.              Accordingly, I answer both questions in
this way: all four appellants were the victims of specific instances of fraud
practised by the respective directing minds who, in the course of their
criminal activities, derived personal benefits therefrom. There is no evidence,
however, that the directing minds in these affairs acted wholly for their own
benefit, nor did any of them act wholly in fraud of their employer in the sense
of designing and executing a scheme to deprive their respective employer
corporations of any and all dredging business or benefit therefrom. Here the
voluminous evidence paints a clear picture of a design conceived by a group of
conspiratorial directing minds which was not aimed at the destruction of the
respective corporate employers but rather was calculated to ensure their
existence at a level of profits sustained by fraudulently enhanced prices for
the work and services of the corporations. The bid‑rigging scheme was
indeed essentially a plan to ensure the survival of the weakest, and probably
to ensure their continuance in business in much the same relative size. There
is no evidence in these records of any plan amongst the directing minds or of a
plan held by a single directing mind which involved the destruction of the
undertaking of the appellants, or indeed which involves the undermining of the
fiscal health of the appellants. That is not to say that the record does not
reveal any plan amongst the conspiring directing minds to enhance their own
financial and economic positions. The facts are quite to the contrary. However,
the twin goals were accommodated in the plan because the bid‑riggers
rewarded both the appellant corporations and themselves at the expense of the
contracting public agencies.

 

72.              I therefore would answer both questions as
they relate to the defences of acting wholly or partly in fraud of the
corporation"", and in whole or in part for the benefit of the directing
mind"", as follows:

 

1.                On the evidence in these records, the respective
directing minds of the appellants did not act wholly in fraud of their
respective corporate employers;

 

2.                Neither did the four directing minds act wholly
for their own benefit in the sense that no benefit from their actions would
accrue to the appellants; and in any event the record clearly reveals an
intention on their part to benefit their respective corporations; 

 

3.                Express or implied instructions prohibiting the
unlawful acts specifically, or unlawful conduct generally, is not a defence
whether the corporate liability springs from authorization of the acts of an
agent or the unlawful acts of a directing mind. In any case, only in the record
relating to CD is there any evidence of any such prohibition.

 

73.              There can be no complete rationalization
of corporate criminal liability in the criminal law whether the attempt be made
under the banner of vicarious liability or the identification theory or
otherwise. The corporation does not have, in the human sense of the term, a
mind capable of reaching the state identified in criminal law as mens rea.
The criminal law does not recognize in mens rea offences criminal
liability in the proprietor employer for the unlawful actions of the proprietor's
employees save in the case of authorization, express or implied. A corporation,
however, is found liable in some countries, as we have seen, on vicarious
liability, and in other jurisdictions on the basis of the identification
theory. Both doctrines are the product of judicial necessity brought on by the
realities of the modern community. Our law, which in this field commenced, as
we have seen, in Fane Robinson Ltd., supra, and evolved through St.
Lawrence, supra, has not yet been required to settle the outer limit
of the identification theory. The identification theory, however, loses its
basis in rationality when it is applied to condemn a corporation under the
criminal law for the conduct of its manager when that manager is acting not in
any real sense as its directing mind but rather as its arch enemy. On the facts
before the jury in this case in these proceedings, as the Court of Appeal has
pointed out, the directing minds were acting partly for their own benefit and
partly for the benefit of the corporation, and not wholly in fraud of the
employer corporation. Consequently, it is unnecessary, technically, for this
Court to define the limits in our law of the so‑called Moore v.
Bresler rule. The case was, however, argued extensively at all levels on
the basis that this rule either did not apply, or if it did it had no
application where the employee in question was acting wholly in fraud of the
company and wholly for his own benefit. This problem, as we have seen, has of
course reared its head in the United States where the vicarious liability
doctrine has been limited on occasion when the employee has acted in this
extreme way. That is but another illustration of the courts adapting the common
law rules of law to the changing realities of the community. In my view, the
very pragmatic origins of the identification rule militate against its
extension to the situation which would have existed here had one or more of the
directing minds acted entirely for his own benefit and directed his principal
efforts to defrauding the company. Where the corporation benefited or was
intended to be benefited from the fraudulent and criminal activities of the
directing mind, the rationale of the identification rule holds. Where
the delegate of the corporation has turned against his principal, the rationale
fades away.

 

74.              I would therefore dismiss all four
appeals.

                   Respondent lost control of his motor vehicle and it
collided with a tree. A police officer demanded respondent provide samples of
his breath for analysis pursuant to s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code .
Respondent accompanied the officer to the police station, complied with the
demand, and was subsequently charged with driving a motor vehicle while having
an excessive blood alcohol level contrary to s. 236(1) of the Code. At
trial, respondent's counsel objected to the admission of the certificate of
analysis and applied, pursuant to s. 24  of the Charter , for its
exclusion on the ground that he had been denied the right, guaranteed by s. 10 (b)
of the Charter , to be informed, upon arrest or detention, of his right
to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The trial judge allowed the
application and dismissed the charge for lack of other evidence of the
respondent's blood alcohol level. The judge held that the respondent had been
detained within the meaning of s. 10  of the Charter , that the court was
empowered by s. 24(1)  thereof to exclude the certificate if it considered such
exclusion to be appropriate and just in the circumstances, and that it was not
confined to the test laid down in s. 24(2) . The majority of the Court of Appeal
upheld the decision.

 

                   Held (McIntyre and Le
Dain JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

1)                Detention and violation of respondent’s right
to counsel

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
McIntyre, Lamer and Le Dain JJ.: Respondent's rights under s. 10 (b) of
the Charter  were violated. A person who complied with a demand, pursuant
to s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code , to accompany a police officer to a
police station and to submit to a breathalyser test is ""detained""
within the meaning of s. 10  of the Charter  and that person is therefore
entitled to be informed of his right to retain and instruct counsel without
delay.

 

                   The word ""detention"" in s. 10  is directed
to a restraint of liberty of varying duration other than arrest in which a
person may reasonably require the assistance of counsel and might be prevented
or impeded from retaining and instructing counsel without delay but for the
constitutional guarantee. In addition to the case of deprivation of liberty by
physical constraint, there is also a ""detention"" within s. 10  when a
police officer assumes control over the movement of a person by a demand or
direction which may have significant legal consequence and which prevents or
impedes access to counsel. There must, however, be some form of compulsion or
coercion. Any criminal liability for failure to comply with a demand or
direction of a police officer is sufficient to make compliance involuntary.
Under s. 235(2), a refusal to comply with a s. 235(1)  demand without reasonable
excuse is a criminal offence. 

 

                   Notwithstanding any similarity to s. 10  of the Charter ,
the meaning of the word ""detained"" in s. 2(c) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights as adopted by this Court in Chromiak was not
determinative of the issue. The premise that the framers of the Charter 
must be presumed to have intended that the words used by it should be given the
meaning which had been given to them by judicial decisions at the time the Charter 
was enacted is not a reliable guide to its interpretation and application. By
its very nature, a constitutional charter of rights and freedoms must use general
language which is capable of development and adaptation by the court. It is the
purpose of the section that must be considered in determining the meaning of
the word ""detention"" in s. 10 .

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey,
Chouinard and Wilson JJ.: When the police officers administered the
breathalyzer test under s. 235(1) of the Code, respondent was detained
within the meaning of s. 10  of the Charter  and his rights under that
section were violated. The peace officers did not accord him the right
""without delay"" to retain and instruct counsel, nor did they inform
him of that right.

 

2)                Whether respondent’s right to counsel
subject, by virtue of s. 235(1) of the Code, to a limit prescribed by law

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey,
Chouinard and Wilson JJ.: The Court is not concerned with s. 1  of the Charter 
because Parliament, in s. 235(1) of the Code, has not purported to limit
respondent's right under s. 10 (b) of the Charter . Section 1 
subjects all Charter  rights, including s. 10 , ""only to such
reasonable limits prescribed by law...."" Here the limit on the
respondent's right to consult counsel was imposed by the conduct of the police
officers and not by Parliament.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ.: Section 235(1) of the Code does not purport to
place a limitation on the right to counsel. A s. 235(1)  demand must be made
""forthwith or as soon as practicable"" and the person to whom the
demand is made must provide a breath sample ""then or as soon thereafter as
is practicable"". The two‑hour operating requirement imposed by s.
237(1)(b)(ii) does not preclude any contact at all with counsel prior to
the breathalyser test. When detained because of a s. 235(1)  demand, the right
to be informed of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay is
not, therefore, subject to a limit prescribed by law within the meaning of s. 1 
of the Charter . 

 

                   Per Lamer J.: The
violation of the respondent's rights is not the result of the operation of the
law but of the police action. Therefore, there is no need to consider in this
case whether, under s. 1  of the Charter , the ""breathalyzer
scheme"" set up through s. 235(1)  and s. 237  of the Criminal Code  is
a reasonable limit to one's rights under the Charter .

 

3)                Whether the breathalyzer evidence should be
excluded

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey, Chouinard
and Wilson JJ.: The question of the admissibility of the evidence provided by
the breathalyzer test must be determined by s. 24(2)  of the Charter  and
not by s. 24(1) . Subsection (2)  alone empowers a court to exclude evidence
where such evidence ""was obtained in a manner that
infringed...rights...guaranteed by [the] Charter ,...if it is established
that...the admission of it...would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute"". Here, the evidence must undoubtedly be excluded. The police
have flagrantly violated a Charter  right without statutory authority. To
admit this evidence under these circumstances would clearly ""bring the
administration of justice into disrepute"".

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Lamer J.: The breathalyzer evidence tendered in this case was obtained in a
manner which infringed and denied the respondent's rights under s. 10 (b)
of the Charter . The simple fact, however, that the infringement of the
right preceded the obtaining of the evidence is not sufficient to meet that
requirement. Indeed, if there is no relationship other than a temporal one, the
evidence was not ""obtained in a manner that infringed"" the Charter .
Where a detainee is required to provide evidence which may be incriminating and
where refusal to comply is punishable as a criminal offence, as is the case
under s. 235 of the Code, s. 10(b) imposes a duty not to call
upon the detainee to provide that evidence without first informing him of his
s. 10 (b) rights and providing him with a reasonable opportunity and time
to retain and instruct counsel. Failure to abide by that duty will lead to the
obtainment of evidence in a manner which infringes or denies the detainee's s.
10 (b) rights. To admit the breathalyzer evidence in these circumstances
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Therefore, since the
evidence may be properly excluded by the operation of s. 24(2)  of the Charter ,
there is no need to express any view on the availability of the exclusion of
evidence as an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1) . 

 

                   Per McIntyre and Le
Dain JJ., dissenting: Although respondent's right under s. 10  of the Charter 
was infringed, the evidence provided by the breathalyser test should not have
been excluded. The Court of Appeal erred in affirming the exclusion of the
evidence on the ground that it was appropriate and just in the circumstances,
within the meaning of s. 24(1)  of the Charter . It is clear that in
making explicit provision for the remedy of exclusion of evidence in s. 24(2) ,
following the general terms of s. 24(1) , the framers of the Charter 
intended that this particular remedy should be governed entirely by the terms
of s. 24(2) . The evidence represented by the certificate of analysis was
obtained in a manner infringing respondent's right to counsel and met the first
requirement of that subsection, but its admission in the circumstances of this
case would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The right to
counsel is of fundamental importance and its denial in a criminal law context
must prima facie discredit the administration of justice. However, in
view of the judgment of this Court in Chromiak, the police officer was
entitled to assume in good faith that the respondent did not have such a right
on a demand under s. 235  of the Criminal Code . Because of this reliance
in good faith, the admission of the evidence of the breathalyzer test here
would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

                   Per McIntyre J., dissenting:
The exclusion of the breathalyzer evidence solely on a finding that a Charter 
right was breached in obtaining it would be to disregard the provisions of s.
24(2)  of the Charter . The exclusion of such evidence is not automatic.
It must be excluded only where it is established that its admission, having
regard to all the circumstances, would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. That was not established here.

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑I agree with Le Dain J., for the reasons he
has given in his judgment, that the respondent was detained within the meaning
of s. 10  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and that his
rights under para. (b) were violated. I also agree with Le Dain J.
that s. 235(1)  does not create a limit, prescribed by law, under s. 1  of the Charter ,
on a detained person's right to be informed of the right to retain and instruct
counsel. Subsection 235(1)  does not expressly or by necessary implication
compel the police to deny a detained person's right to be informed of his s.
10 (b) rights.

 

2.                I agree with Lamer J., for the reasons
he has given, that the breathalyzer evidence tendered in this case was obtained
in a manner which infringed and denied the respondent's rights under s. 10 (b)
and that it has been established that, having regard to all the circumstances,
the admission of this evidence in the proceedings would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. Accordingly, the certificate of
analysis prepared pursuant to s. 237  of the Criminal Code  should be
excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

3.                Since this evidence may properly be
excluded by the operation of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , I do not wish to
be taken as expressing any view on the availability of the exclusion of
evidence as an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

 

4.                I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.


 

                   The reasons of Beetz, Estey, Chouinard and Wilson
JJ. were delivered by

 

5.                Estey
J.‑‑I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of my
colleague Le Dain J. in this appeal and while I am in agreement, as shall be
seen below, with much of what has been there written, I am in respectful
disagreement as to the disposition. I would dismiss the appeal for these
reasons.

 

6.                I am in agreement that the respondent‑defendant
was ""detained"" within the meaning of s. 10  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms  when the police officers administered the
breathalyzer test under s. 235  of the Criminal Code . That section of the
Criminal Code  clearly anticipates a delay in some circumstances for the
administration of this test. This is in contrast to s. 234.1(1) of the Code.
In the former section the Code provides that the peace officer may
""by demand made ... forthwith or as soon as practicable"" require such
person to provide samples ""then or as soon thereafter as is
practicable"". Section 234.1(1)  requires that the person driving the motor
vehicle ""provide forthwith such a sample of his breath"".

 

7.                Section 10 (b) of the Charter 
provides:

 

                   10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) to retain and
instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; ...

 

Neither of the two rights assured in s. 10 (b) of the Charter 
were honoured by the police authority. The peace officers did not accord to the
respondent the right ""without delay"" to retain and instruct counsel,
nor did they inform the respondent of that right. There is nothing in this
record to suggest that the officers would have been unable to afford the
respondent a reasonable time to contact his counsel.

 

8.                The provisions of s. 235  cannot
constitute a cause for failure to assure these rights. As noted above, action
under s. 235  by the respondent need only be taken ""as soon as
practicable"". We are not here faced with a proceeding under s. 234.1 which
may raise different issues. Neither are we here, on this record, required to
determine the more difficult question of what the peace officer may do pursuant
to s. 235 of the Code after s. 10 (b) of the Charter  has
been accommodated. Furthermore, because s. 24(2)  of the Charter , as we
shall see, operates to exclude the evidence thereby obtained, s. 24(1)  of the Charter 
need not be invoked. 

 

9.                I am therefore in respectful agreement
with my colleague that the rights of the respondent under s. 10 (b) have
been violated.

 

10.              Because Parliament has not purported to
place a limitation on the right of the respondent under s. 10 (b) of the Charter 
in s. 235(1) , the Court is not here concerned with s. 1  of the Charter .
That section subjects all Charter  rights, including s. 10 , ""only to
such reasonable limits prescribed by law ...."" Here Parliament has not
purported to prescribe any such limit and hence s. 1  of the Charter  does
not come into play. The limit on the respondent's right to consult counsel was
imposed by the conduct of the police officers and not by Parliament.

 

11.              This brings one to the core issue in this
appeal, namely the admissibility of the evidence as to the alcohol content in
the respondent's blood as determined by the test taken under s. 235(1) of the Code.
The admissibility of this evidence in my view, and again I am in respectful
agreement with my colleague Le Dain J., falls to be determined by s. 24(2)  of
the Charter  and not by reason of subs. (1) of that section, as was the
view of the Court of Appeal below. Subsection (2) alone in the Charter 
empowers a court to exclude evidence where ""that evidence was obtained in
a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this
Charter  ...."" Subsection (2) goes on to direct, in mandatory terms:

 

... the evidence shall
be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances,
the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Here the police authority has flagrantly violated a Charter 
right without any statutory authority for so doing. Such an overt violation as
occurred here must, in my view, result in the rejection of the evidence thereby
obtained. We are here dealing only with direct evidence or evidence thereby
obtained directly and I leave to another day any consideration of evidence
thereby indirectly obtained. To do otherwise than reject this evidence on the
facts and circumstances in this appeal would be to invite police officers to
disregard Charter  rights of the citizens and to do so with an assurance
of impunity. If s. 10(b) of the Charter  can be offended without
any statutory authority for the police conduct here in question and without the
loss of admissibility of evidence obtained by such a breach then s. 10 (b)
would be stripped of any meaning and would have no place in the catalogue of
""legal rights"" found in the Charter . 

 

12.              The violation by the police authority of a
fundamental Charter  right, which transpired here, will render this
evidence inadmissible. Admitting this evidence under these circumstances would
clearly ""bring the administration of justice into disrepute"". I am
strongly of the view that it would be most improvident for this Court to
expatiate, in these early days of life with the Charter , upon the
meaning of the expression `administration of justice' and particularly its
outer limits. There will no doubt be, over the years to come, a gradual build‑up
in delineation and definition of the words used in the Charter  in s.
24(2) .

 

13.              For these reasons, I would therefore
dismiss this appeal.

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

14.              McIntyre
J. (dissenting)‑‑I am in full agreement with the
reasons for judgment of Le Dain J. I would add that to exclude the questioned
evidence in this case solely on a finding that a Charter  right was
breached in obtaining it would be to disregard the provisions of s. 24(2)  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . In my view, this section
must have its effect. The exclusion of such evidence is not automatic. It must
be excluded only where it is established that its admission, having regard to
all the circumstances, would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. In my view, that is not established here. The exclusion of the
evidence in the circumstances of this case would itself go far to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

15.              Lamer
J.‑‑The issues that require determination in this case are
the following: was the respondent detained, within the meaning of s. 10 (b)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; was there a violation of
his rights under s. 10 (b); if so, is the violation in this case a
reasonable limit prescribed by law; if not, what is the proper remedy and
disposition of this case.

 

16.              I have had the advantage of reading the
judgments of my colleagues Estey and Le Dain JJ.

 

17.              I agree with my brother Le Dain for the
reasons set out in his judgment that the respondent was detained. I also agree
with Le Dain J. that there was here a violation of the respondent's rights
under s. 10 (b). Clearly he was not, as a detainee, in any way informed
of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. As set out in the
reasons of Estey J., the violation of the respondent's rights is not the result
of the operation of law but of the police action and there is no need, in my
view, to consider in this case whether under s. 1  of the Charter  the
""breathalyzer scheme"" set up through s. 235(1)  and s. 237  of the Criminal
Code  is a reasonable limit to one's rights under the Charter . That
issue will certainly arise in some other case given the content which I think
must be given to s. 10 (b).

 

18.              At first blush, there would appear not to
be any need to expand upon the content of s. 10 (b) given that the facts
of this case indicate a clear violation of the section whatever be that
content. However, in order to meet the requirements for exclusion of evidence
under s. 24(2)  there must not only exist a violation of a Charter  right,
but there must also be, as was said by Le Dain J., ""some connection or
relationship between the infringement or denial of the right or freedom in
question and the obtaining of the evidence the exclusion of which is sought by
the application"". 

 

19.              With respect, however, I cannot subscribe
to the proposition later advanced by Le Dain J. that this requirement is met by
the simple fact that the infringement or denial of the right has preceded the
obtaining of the evidence. Indeed, if there is no relationship other than a
temporal one, the evidence was not ""obtained in a manner that
infringed"" the Charter .

 

20.              Thus, when one addresses the consequences
that should flow under s. 24  as a result of the violation in this case, one has
to go back and give some content to s. 10 (b) if one is to consider
whether, under s. 24(2) , the ""breathalyzer evidence"" was obtained in
a manner that infringed or denied that right. Indeed, if a literal construction
is given to s. 10 (b), there is then no nexus whatsoever between the
requirement of the taking of breath samples on the one hand and, on the other
hand, informing the detainee of his rights and not preventing him from exercising
them.

 

21.              I do not want to be taken here as giving
an exhaustive definition of the s. 10(b) rights and will limit my
comments in that respect to what is strictly required for the disposition of
this case. In my view, s. 10(b) requires at least that the authorities
inform the detainee of his rights, not prevent him in any way from exercising
them and, where a detainee is required to provide evidence which may be
incriminating and refusal to comply is punishable as a criminal offence, as is
the case under s. 235 of the Code, s. 10(b) also imposes a duty
not to call upon the detainee to provide that evidence without first informing
him of his s. 10(b) rights and providing him with a reasonable
opportunity and time to retain and instruct counsel. Failure to abide by that
duty will lead to the obtainment of evidence in a manner which infringes or
denies the detainee's s. 10(b) rights. Short of that, s. 10(b)
would be a near empty right, as remedies could seldom affect the admissibility
of evidence obtained through the accused.

 

22.              Whether s. 10(b) extends any
further, so as to encompass, for example, the principle of Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and apply to matters such as interrogation
and police line‑ups, need not be decided in this case and I shall refrain
from so doing.

 

23.              Whether s. 235(1) of the Code in
general, and its two hour limitation in particular, are in conflict with s. 10(b),
especially that aspect of being given a reasonable time to speak to counsel,
does not arise in this case and I would choose not to address that question for
the following reason. Were we to find that s. 235(1)  does impose a limit on the
amount of time the peace officer can give a detainee to exercise his rights
under s. 10(b) before requiring a breath sample, we would in my view be
faced with a very incomplete file when called upon to determine whether the
limitation is one that is reasonable under the test set out in s. 1  of the Charter .
I think that question, if to be addressed, will be more properly considered in
a case where there will have been adduced evidence in support of the
demonstration the authorities have the burden to make under s. 1 . As an
example, why is there a two hour limit? Is it for scientific reasons related to
reliability? I suspect so but do not find any evidence in the record. 

 

24.              In this case, the test was required by the
peace officer and then given to the detainee prior to his being informed of his
right to counsel. By so doing, the police officer violated the accused's rights
under s. 10(b) and obtained the ""breathalyzer evidence"" in a
manner which infringed and denied those rights.

 

25.              I would decide the disposition of this
case as does Estey J., and for the reasons he sets out in his judgment. Indeed,
I am of the view that admitting the breathalyzer evidence in this case would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Having so concluded, I need
not express any views as regards the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(1) .

 

26.              I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

27.              Le
Dain J. (dissenting)‑‑This appeal raises the
following questions on which there have been differing opinions in provincial
courts of appeal:

 

1.                Does a person upon whom a demand is made pursuant
to s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code  to accompany a police officer to a
police station and to submit to a breathalyzer test have the right to counsel
guaranteed by s. 10  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ? 

 

2. If there has been
an infringement or denial of the right to counsel, can the evidence obtained by
the breathalyzer test be excluded pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter  on
the ground that its exclusion is considered by the court to be appropriate and
just in the circumstances or may it be excluded pursuant only to s. 24(2)  on
the ground that it was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied the right
to counsel and that, having regard to all the circumstances, its admission
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute?

 

3. If the evidence
was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied the right to counsel, and its
exclusion is to be governed exclusively by the test in s. 24(2)  of the Charter ,
what is the meaning and application to be given to that test in the
circumstances of the present case?

 

28.              Section 235(1)  of the Criminal Code 
and ss. 10  and 24  of the Charter  are as follows:

 

                   235. (1) Where a peace officer on reasonable and probable grounds believes
that a person is committing, or at any time within the preceding two hours has
committed, an offence under section 234 or 236, he may, by demand made to that
person forthwith or as soon as practicable, require him to provide then or as
soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion
of a qualified technician referred to in subsection 237(6) are necessary to
enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the proportion, if
any, of alcohol in his blood, and to accompany the peace officer for the
purpose of enabling such samples to be taken.

 

                   10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention

 

(a) to be informed
promptly of the reasons therefor;

 

(b) to retain and
instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; and

 

(c) to have the
validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be
released if the detention is not lawful.

 

                   24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter ,
have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to
obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the
circumstances.

 

                   (2)
Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed
by this Charter , the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that,
having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 

 

                                                                     I

 

29.              The appeal is by leave of this Court from
the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal on April 15, 1983, 5 C.C.C.
(3d) 409, dismissing an appeal by way of stated case from a judgment of Judge
Alastair J. Muir of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan on July 30, 1982, 70
C.C.C. (2d) 468, which dismissed a charge that the respondent ""on or about
the 25th of April A.D. 1982 at the City of Moose Jaw, in the Province of Saskatchewan,
did unlawfully drive a motor vehicle while having consumed alcohol in such
quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of
alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to Section 236(1)  of the Criminal
Code "".

 

30.              The facts found by Muir J. at the
trial of the respondent are set out in the stated case as follows:

 

(a)  On April 24th,
1982, at approximately 10:30 P.M., the accused was operating a motor vehicle in
a street in the City of Moose Jaw at which time he lost control of the vehicle
and it collided with a tree at the side of the street.

 

(b)  Very shortly
thereafter, Constable Measner of the Moose Jaw City Police Department arrived
at the scene and conducted an investigation. Constable Measner, having
reasonable and probable grounds for doing so, made a demand on the accused
under the provisions of Section 235(1)  of the Criminal Code  requiring the
accused to accompany him for the purpose of obtaining samples of the accused's
breath for analysis. The accused accompanied the officer and supplied samples
of his breath in compliance with the demand.

 

(c)  The accused was
at no time informed of any rights to retain and instruct counsel.

 

(d)  The accused was
co‑operative throughout the investigation and was at no time placed under
arrest.

 

31.              In the reasons which he delivered on
behalf of the majority for the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, Tallis J.A said at
p. 420: ""It is common ground between counsel that after a demand was made
under s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code , the respondent accompanied the
officer in a patrol car to the City Police Station in Moose Jaw, where the
breathalyzer tests were subsequently conducted."" There was no evidence
that the accused, of his own knowledge, was aware of his right to retain and
instruct counsel.

 

32.              At the trial of the respondent the Crown
sought to tender in evidence the certificate of analysis prepared, pursuant to
s. 237  of the Criminal Code , by the technician who conducted the
breathalyzer test. Counsel for the respondent objected to the admission of the
certificate and applied, pursuant to s. 24  of the Charter , for its
exclusion on the ground that the respondent has been denied the right,
guaranteed by s. 10  of the Charter , to be informed, upon arrest or
detention, of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The trial
judge allowed the application, ordered the exclusion of the certificate, and
for lack of other evidence of the respondent's blood alcohol level dismissed
the charge. He held that the respondent had been detained within the meaning of
s. 10  of the Charter  and that the court was empowered by s. 24(1) 
thereof to exclude the certificate if it considered such exclusion to be
appropriate and just in the circumstances, and that it was not confined to the
test laid down in s. 24(2) ‑‑that the admission of the evidence
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 

 

33.              The questions put to the Court of Appeal
in the stated case were as follows:

 

(1) Did the Court err in
law in holding that the accused person, Paul Mathew Therens, had been detained
within the meaning of Section 10  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

(2) Did the court err in
law in holding that it had a power to exclude evidence under subsection (1)  of
Section 24  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  whether or not
admitting the evidence in question would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute?

 

(3) Did the court err in
law in holding that it was just and appropriate in the circumstances of this
case to exclude from evidence the Certificate of Analyses tendered by the
prosecution?

 

34.              At the hearing of the appeal the third
question was abandoned by counsel for the Crown on the ground that it did not
involve a question of law alone. A majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
answered the first two questions in the negative and dismissed the appeal.
Tallis J.A., with whom Bayda C.J.S. and Hall and Cameron JJ.A. concurred, held
that the restraint of the respondent's liberty effected by the demand pursuant
to s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code  amounted to a detention within the
meaning of s. 10  of the Charter  and that accordingly there had been an
infringement or a denial of the respondent's right to be informed of his right
to retain and instruct counsel without delay; and further, that the certificate
of analysis could be excluded from the evidence pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter ,
notwithstanding the terms of s. 24(2) , which refer expressly to the exclusion of
evidence obtained in a manner that infringes or denies any right or freedom
guaranteed by the Charter . Bayda C.J.S. wrote a separate concurring
opinion with reference to the power to exclude evidence under s. 24(2) .
Brownridge J.A., dissenting, held that there had not been a detention within
the meaning of s. 10  of the Charter , but that in any event the exclusion
of evidence as a remedy under s. 24  was governed exclusively by the terms of
subs. (2) thereof. 

 

                                                                    II

 

35.              In both the trial court and the Court of
Appeal the issue as to whether there had been a detention turned essentially,
as it has in the judgments of other courts of appeal, on the effect to be given
to the decision of this Court in Chromiak v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
471, which dealt with a demand under s. 234.1(1)  of the Criminal Code  to
provide a sample of breath into a roadside screening device and with the right
to counsel guaranteed by s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights,
R.S.C. 1970, App. III. These provisions are as follows:

 

                   234.1 (1) Where a peace officer reasonably suspects that a person who is
driving a motor vehicle or who has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, has alcohol in his body, he may, by demand made
to that person, require him to provide forthwith such a sample of his breath as
in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis of
his breath to be made by means of an approved road‑side screening device
and, where necessary, to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of
enabling such a sample of his breath to be taken.

 

                   2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act
of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian
Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of
the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no
law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 

(c) deprive a
person who has been arrested or detained

 

(i) of the right to be
informed promptly of the reason for his arrest or detention,

 

(ii) of the right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay, or

 

(iii) of the remedy by way
of habeas corpus for the determination of the validity of his detention
and for his release if the detention is now lawful;

 

36.              In Chromiak this Court unanimously
held that a person who complied with a demand pursuant to s. 234.1(1)  to
accompany a police officer and submit to a roadside breath test was not
detained within the meaning of s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.
The meaning of ""detained"" and ""detention"" adopted by
Ritchie J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, is to be found in the
following passages of his judgment at pp. 478‑79: 

 

It appears to me to be
obvious that the word ""detention"" does not necessarily include
arrest, but the words ""detain"" and ""detention"" as they are
used in s. 2(c) of the Bill of Rights, in my opinion, connote
some form of compulsory restraint and I think that the language of s. 2(c)(iii)
which guarantees to a person ""the remedy of habeas corpus for the
determination of the validity of his detention and for his release if the
detention is not lawful"", clearly contemplates that any person
""detained"" within the meaning of the section is one who has been
detained by due process of law. This construction is supported by reference to
ss. 28(2) (b), 30 , 136 (a), 248  and 250  of the Criminal Code 
where the words ""to detain"" are consistently used in association with
actual physical restraint.

 

                   I agree
with the Court of Appeal that the following observations made by Pigeon J. in
the Brownridge case are pertinent to s. 234.1(1)  and to the facts
disclosed in this case. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Justice Pigeon spoke
in the course of a dissenting opinion, I do not think that this statement is in
any way in variance to the principle to which I have just referred. Mr. Justice
Pigeon said, at pp. 943 and 944:

 

                   The
legal situation of a person who, on request, accompanies a peace officer for
the purpose of having a breath test taken is not different from that of a
driver who is required to allow his brakes to be inspected or to proceed to a
weighing machine under s. 39(6) or s. 78(3) of the Highway Traffic Act,
R.S.O. 1970, c. 202. Such a person is under a duty to submit to the test. If he
goes away, or attempts to go away, to avoid the test, he may be arrested and
charged but this does not mean that he is under arrest until this happens. He
is merely obeying directions that police officers are entitled to issue.
Motorists cannot reasonably expect to be allowed to seek legal advice before
complying with such orders. Police officers are fully justified in treating as
a definitive refusal a refusal to comply until legal advice is obtained.

 

                   Does s.
2(c)(ii) of the Bill of Rights alter the common law situation
with respect to motorists requested to submit to a test required by the Criminal
Code  as opposed to tests required by provincial legislation? I do not think
so. The provision under consideration applies to ""a person who has been
arrested or detained"". Such is not, it appears to me, the legal situation
of one who has been required to ""accompany"" a peace officer for the
purpose of having a breath test taken. The test may well be negative and, in
such a case, it would be quite wrong to say that this person was arrested or
detained and then released. Detained means held in custody as is apparent from
such provision as s. 15 of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑2.

 

37.              In this appeal the appellant contends that
the decision of this Court in Chromiak determined, in effect, that a
person upon whom a demand is made pursuant to s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code 
is not detained within the meaning of s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights and that the same conclusion should be applied to s. 10  of the Charter 
because of the similar wording of the two provisions guaranteeing the right to
counsel. In support of this submission the appellant adopts the reasoning on
this issue to be found in the judgments of other courts of appeal, to which
reference will be made shortly. It is first necessary to consider the reasons
of Muir J. and of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in the present case. 

 

38.              Muir J. distinguished Chromiak
on the basis that it was concerned with a s. 234.1(1)  demand rather than a s.
235(1)  demand. In the Court of Appeal, Tallis J.A. also stressed the difference
between these two provisions, particularly the more serious consequences of a
s. 235(1)  demand and the greater need of legal counsel because of such
consequences. He also emphasized the constitutional difference between the Canadian
Bill of Rights and the Charter , which he said was ""not a mere
canon of construction for the interpretation of federal legislation"" (p.
423). After quoting from what was said by Lord Wilberforce in Minister of
Home Affairs v. Fisher, [1980] A.C. 319 at p. 328, concerning the
""generous interpretation"" that should be given to the Bermuda
Constitution, Tallis J.A. said at pp. 423‑24:

 

                   Our
nation's constitutional ideals have been enshrined in the Charter  and it will
not be a ""living"" charter unless it is interpreted in a meaningful
way from the standpoint of an average citizen who seldom has a brush with the
law. The fundamental rights accorded to a citizen under Section 10 (b)
should be approached on the basis of giving the word ""detention"" its
popular interpretation, in other words its natural or ordinary meaning. The
implementation and application of the Charter  should not be blunted or thwarted
by technical or legalistic interpretations of ordinary words of the English
language. Using this approach, our citizens will not be placed in a position of
feeling that the statements in the Charter  are only rights in theory. If these
rights are to survive and be available on a day‑to‑day basis we
must resist the temptation to opt in favour of a restrictive approach. If a
restrictive approach is adopted in defining the word ""detain"" then
this will be tantamount to saying that the law does not recognize rights under
s. 10 (b) as applying to an accused before arrest.

 

39.              On the question whether a s. 235(1)  demand
effected a detention within the meaning of s. 10  of the Charter , Tallis
J.A. reasoned and concluded as follows at pp. 424‑25: 

 

It was clearly open to the
learned trial judge to find that there was a temporary restraint falling short
of formal arrest which amounted to a ""detention"" in the ordinary
sense of the word. In the circumstances of this case, the law authorizes a peace
officer, who has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused
has committed an offence under s. 234 or s. 236 within the preceding two hours,
to exercise a temporary restraint on the liberty of the accused for the purpose
of carrying out procedures authorized by law. This temporary restraint may be
imposed without the necessity of a formal arrest but there is no reason why s.
10 (b) of the Charter  should not apply. An obstreperous or knowledgeable
citizen might trigger his arrest and consequently the application of the
Charter  by attempting to run from the peace officer or alternatively by
refusing to accompany him to the location of the breathalyzer machine‑‑in
this case at the police station. From the standpoint of the law and social
policy, this would not be a desirable situation. On the other hand, the average
citizen would acquiesce in the demand made by a peace officer rather than
suffer the potential embarrassment of further proceedings that could arise.
Surely the rights under s. 10 (b) of the Charter  are to be extended to
the rank and file members of society who may have little contact with the
justice system. When you consider the circumstances of this case and in
particular the contents of the demand that was made to him, it cannot be said
that the respondent accused was free to depart as he pleased. To say that he
was not detained is simply a fiction which overlooks the plain meaning of words
from the viewpoint of an average citizen. An officious bystander would have no
difficulty in concluding that the respondent was detained and would probably
feel, at the very least, that the peace officer had taken the respondent into
temporary custody. While they do not deal directly with the interpretation of
the word ""detention"" as set forth in s. 10 (b) of the Charter ,
many of the decided cases dealing with false arrest or false imprisonment have
captured the average citizen's concept of detention in a very realistic way:
vide Conn v. David Spencer Ltd., [1930] 1 D.L.R. 805, [1930] 1 W.W.R.
26, 42 B.C.R. 128, in which the plaintiff in a false imprisonment case was in a
self‑service store when tapped on the shoulder by a security guard and
accused of stealing a bar of soap. He was asked to go upstairs to one of the
rooms. He had committed no theft but thought it well that, in view of the
crowded state of the store, he should go without force. In dealing with whether
the act of going to the questioning room proceeded originally from the
plaintiff's own willingness, or from the guard's accusing him of theft, the
court concluded the plaintiff would not be deprived of his action by going
willingly to meet the charge. In dealing with the matter, the court posed the
question ""how is a person to know whether or not force will be used if he
does not comply with the order given ... there can be a restraint of freedom
without touching the person."" Reference might also be made to Chaytor
et al. v. London, New York & Paris Ass’n of Fashion Ltd. and Price
(1961), 30 D.L.R. (2d) 527, 46 M.P.R. 151 and Lebrun v. High‑Low Foods
Ltd. et al. (1968), 69 D.L.R. (2d) 433, 65 W.W.R. 353.

 

 

40.              Brownridge J.A., dissenting, held that
this Court, in Chromiak, had adopted a meaning of the word
""detained"" in s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
that clearly excluded a compliance with a demand pursuant to s. 235(1)  and that
there was no reason not to apply that meaning to the word ""detention""
in s. 10  of the Charter . He said at p. 417: ""I do not subscribe to
the view that the Parliament of Canada, in drafting the Charter  intended to
depart completely from the law as it existed the day before the Charter  became
effective. In my opinion, the word `detained' as used in the Bill of Rights
and as interpreted under that Act should be given the same meaning and the same
interpretation under the Charter "".

 

41.              Other courts of appeal have decided that
the meaning given to the word ""detained"" in Chromiak should be
applied to the word ""detention"" in s. 10  of the Charter , and
applying this meaning, have concluded that compliance with a s. 235(1)  demand
does not result in a detention within s. 10 . See R. v. Currie (1983), 4
C.C.C. (3d) 217 (N.S.S.C.A.D.); R. v. Trask (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 132
(Nfld. C.A.); Rahn v. The Queen (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 152 (Alta. C.A.)
(Appeals to this Court in Trask1 and Rahn2
were heard at the same time as the present appeal.) There is also commentary on
Chromiak by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Simmons (1984),
11 C.C.C. (3d) 193, a case which considered whether there is a right to counsel
on being subjected to a strip search pursuant to the provisions of the Customs
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑40. The reasons given in these decisions in
support of the opposite conclusion on the question of detention from that
reached by the majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in the present case
are adopted in the appellant's submissions and may be summarized as follows:

 

1 See [1985] 1 S.C.R. 655.

 

2 See [1985] 1 S.C.R. 659.

 

42.              (1) Chromiak cannot be
distinguished on the basis of a supposed difference between a s. 234.1(1) 
demand and a s. 235(1)  demand because (a) there is no significant difference
between the two provisions, in so far as the power conferred by them to interfere
with liberty or freedom of action is concerned, and (b) Ritchie J., in adopting
the reasons of Pigeon J. in Brownridge v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 926,
and in holding that decisions with respect to s. 235(1)  were relevant to the
issue before him, clearly indicated that in his opinion compliance with a s.
235(1)  demand did not amount to a detention within s. 2(c) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights.

 

43.              (2) There is no basis in the different
constitutional nature or status of the Charter , as compared with that of
the Canadian Bill of Rights, for distinguishing Chromiak because
in using the word ""detention"" in s. 10  of the Charter , which
is in essentially the same terms as s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights, the framers of the Charter  must be presumed to have intended
to use this word in the sense given to it in Chromiak. 

 

44.              (3) The guarantee in s. 10 (c) of
the Charter , as in s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights,
of the right to habeas corpus to challenge the validity of a detention
indicates that the restraint upon liberty effected by a s. 235(1)  demand is not
one of the character or duration contemplated by these provisions.

 

45.              (4) The word ""detention"", as
indicated in Chromiak, connotes a compulsory restraint, whereas
compliance with a s. 235(1)  demand is purely voluntary.

 

46.              I agree with the contention that Chromiak
is not distinguishable on the basis of a significant difference between the power
conferred by s. 234.1(1)  and that conferred by s. 235(1) , in so far as the
interference with liberty or freedom of action is concerned. Both provisions
empower a police officer to require a person to accompany him or her and to
provide a breath sample. It has been suggested that the difference in practice
in the nature and duration of the interference with liberty effected by a s.
235(1)  demand and that effected by a s. 234.1(1)  demand constitutes a
sufficient basis for distinguishing the two provisions in respect of the
question of detention. Such a distinction was suggested by Tarnopolsky J.A., in
Simmons, supra, at p. 224, where, in limiting the effect of Chromiak
to a 234.1(1) demand, he said, ""Chromiak deals with roadside breath
tests: it does not determine whether a person is `detained' when required to
submit to some form of examination on the premises of a government agency like
a police station"". The fact that a roadside screening test under a s.
234.1(1)  demand is generally administered in the back of a police car, whereas
the breathalyzer test under a s. 235(1)  demand is generally administered in a
police station, amounts to a mere difference of degree in so far as the
question of detention is concerned. This difference does not in my opinion afford
a principled basis for holding that a s. 235(1)  demand amounts to a detention
if a s. 234.1(1)  demand does not.

 

47.              Other courts of appeal, which have come to
a conclusion contrary to that of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in the
present case on the issue of detention, have held that, notwithstanding the
difference in the constitutional nature or status of the Charter  and the
Canadian Bill of Rights, the word ""detention"" in s. 10  of the Charter 
should be given the same meaning as it was given by this Court in Chromiak
because of the essential similarity in the wording of the two provisions
guaranteeing the right to counsel. They have reasoned that had the framers of
the Charter  found the meaning and effect given to the word ""detention""
in Chromiak unacceptable they could easily have adopted different
language as a criterion of the right to counsel. See Currie, supra,
per Macdonald J.A. at p. 222; Trask, supra, per
Gushue J.A. at p. 137; Rahn, supra, per Laycraft J.A. at
p. 161; Simmons, supra, per Howland C.J.O. at p. 211. 

 

48.              In my opinion the premise that the framers
of the Charter  must be presumed to have intended that the words used by
it should be given the meaning which had been given to them by judicial
decisions at the time the Charter  was enacted is not a reliable guide to
its interpretation and application. By its very nature a constitutional charter
of rights and freedoms must use general language which is capable of
development and adaptation by the courts. As Dickson J. (as he then was) said
in Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 155: ""The
task of expounding a constitution is crucially different from that of
construing a statute"". Even if the framers of the Charter  had reservations
about the meaning given by this Court in Chromiak to the word
""detained"" in s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights,
assuming they have consideration to it at all, it would be quite inappropriate,
and indeed impracticable, in a constitutional document of this kind, to make
detailed qualifications to provide for issues such as that which arises in the
present appeal. Cf. the distinction between ""concepts"" and
""conceptions"" in Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (1977), pp.
132‑37. That process of reconsideration must of necessity be left to the
courts. Although it is clear that in several instances, as in the case of s.
10 , the framers of the Charter  adopted the wording of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, it is also clear that the Charter  must be regarded,
because of its constitutional character, as a new affirmation of rights and
freedoms and of judicial power and responsibility in relation to their
protection. This results from s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 , which
removes any possible doubt or uncertainty as to the general effect which the Charter 
is to have by providing that it is part of the supreme law of Canada and that
any law that is inconsistent with its provisions is to the extent of such
inconsistency of no force and effect, and from s. 24  of the Charter ,
which provides that anyone whose guaranteed rights or freedoms have been
infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain
such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.
In considering the relationship of a decision under the Canadian Bill of
Rights to an issue arising under the Charter , a court cannot, in my
respectful opinion, avoid bearing in mind an evident fact of Canadian judicial
history, which must be squarely and frankly faced: that on the whole, with some
notable exceptions, the courts have felt some uncertainty or ambivalence in the
application of the Canadian Bill of Rights because it did not reflect a
clear constitutional mandate to make judicial decisions having the effect of
limiting or qualifying the traditional sovereignty of Parliament. The
significance of the new constitutional mandate for judicial review provided by
the Charter  was emphasized by this Court in its recent decisions in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, and Hunter v.
Southam Inc., supra. 

 

49.              Moreover, despite the similarity in the
wording of s. 2(c) of the Canadian Bill of Rights and s. 10  of
the Charter , there is a difference under the Charter  in the scope
or content of the right to counsel and in the approach to the qualification or
limitation of the right that must, I think, have an influence on the
interpretation and application given to it. Section 10 (b) of the Charter 
guarantees not only the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, as
under s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, but also the
right to be informed of that right. This, in my opinion, shows the additional
importance which the Charter  attaches to the right to counsel. A
significant difference in the contexts of the right to counsel under the Canadian
Bill of Rights and the Charter  is that under the Charter  the
right is made expressly subject by s. 1  to such reasonable limits as are
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Thus the right is
expressly qualified in a way that permits more flexible treatment of it. See R.
v. Talbourdet (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 173, per Cameron J.A. at p.
180, where it was suggested that had there been a similar provision in the Canadian
Bill of Rights this Court might well have been able to adopt a different
approach to the issue in the Chromiak case. The meaning and application
given to the word ""detained"" in Chromiak was the only means by
which reasonable limits could be placed on the right to counsel. For these
additional reasons I am of the opinion, with the greatest respect for the
contrary view, that the framers of the Charter , in adopting the language
of s. 10 , cannot be presumed to have intended that the word
""detention"" would necessarily be given the meaning and application,
in relation to a s. 234.1(1)  or a s. 235(1)  demand, which this Court gave to
the word ""detained"" in Chromiak. 

 

50.              Those who have come to a different
conclusion on the question of detention from that of the majority of the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in the present case have also attached particular
importance to what they have perceived to be the implication of the provision
for habeas corpus in s. 2(c)(iii) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights and s. 10 (c) of the Charter , as indicating the kind of
interference with liberty or freedom of action that is necessarily contemplated
by the word ""detention"" in these provisions. In Chromiak,
Ritchie J. saw the provision for habeas corpus as meaning that what was
contemplated was a detention ""by due process of law"". That was
presumably intended to refer to a detention in the purported exercise of lawful
authority. Other judges who have stressed the significance of the provision for
habeas corpus have spoken rather of the duration of the detention that
was necessarily contemplated. See Macdonald J.A. in Currie, supra,
at p. 230; Laycraft J.A. in Rahn, supra, at p. 161; and Howland
C.J.O. in Simmons, supra, at p. 212. They have concluded that
what must have been contemplated was a restraint upon liberty of sufficient
duration to permit its validity to be challenged by habeas corpus. With
respect, on this question I share the view of Tarnopolsky J.A., in Simmons,
supra, at p. 222, where he said: ""I read s. 10  as prescribing
rights that are to be provided if any particular right is pertinent. Not all
are needed under all circumstances. Therefore, the fact that habeas corpus
might not be practically available because of the short duration of a
particular detention does not detract from the fact of there being a
detention."" In my view, s. 10  of the Charter  must necessarily refer
to a great variety of detentions of varying duration, in many of which it will
not be possible to make effective use of habeas corpus because the
detention will have ceased before the application can be made and determined. Habeas
corpus is to lie to determine the validity of a detention where that is
possible. The fact that it may not be possible in some cases, because of the
limited duration of the detention, is not, in my respectful opinion, a reason
for limiting the meaning of the word ""detention"" to detentions of a
certain duration.

 

51.              In determining the meaning that should be
given to the word ""detention"" in s. 10  of the Charter  it is
necessary to consider the purpose of the section. This is the approach to the
interpretation and application of the Charter  that was affirmed by this
Court in Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra, in which Dickson J. said
at p. 157: ""Since the proper approach to the interpretation of the Charter
of Rights and Freedoms is a purposive one, before it is possible to assess
the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the impact of a search or of a
statute authorizing the search, it is first necessary to specify the purpose
underlying s. 8: in other words, to delineate the nature of the interests it is
meant to protect"". 

 

52.              The purpose of s. 10  of the Charter 
is to ensure that in certain situations a person is made aware of the right to
counsel and is permitted to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The
situations specified by s. 10 ‑‑arrest and detention‑‑are
obviously not the only ones in which a person may reasonably require the
assistance of counsel, but they are situations in which the restraint of
liberty might otherwise effectively prevent access to counsel or induce a
person to assume that he or she is unable to retain and instruct counsel. In
its use of the word ""detention"", s. 10  of the Charter  is
directed to a restraint of liberty other than arrest in which a person may
reasonably require the assistance of counsel but might be prevented or impeded
from retaining and instructing counsel without delay but for the constitutional
guarantee.

 

53.              In addition to the case of deprivation of
liberty by physical constraint, there is in my opinion a detention within s. 10 
of the Charter  when a police officer or other agent of the state assumes
control over the movement of a person by a demand or direction which may have
significant legal consequence and which prevents or impedes access to counsel.

 

54.              In Chromiak this Court held that
detention connotes ""some form of compulsory constraint"". There can be
no doubt that there must be some form of compulsion or coercion to constitute
an interference with liberty or freedom of action that amounts to a detention
within the meaning of s. 10  of the Charter . The issue, as I see it, is
whether that compulsion need be of a physical character, or whether it may also
be a compulsion of a psychological or mental nature which inhibits the will as
effectively as the application, or threat of application, of physical force.
The issue is whether a person who is the subject of a demand or direction by a
police officer or other agent of the state may reasonably regard himself or
herself as free to refuse to comply. 

 

55.              The two points of view on this issue are
contrasted in the statement by Clement J.A. of the Alberta Court of Appeal in Chromiak,
which was quoted with approval by Macdonald J.A. in Currie, and the
statement by Tallis J.A. in the present case, which has been quoted above. In Chromiak
(1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 310 at p. 318, Clement J.A. said: ""Chromiak made
the choice voluntarily, without any compulsion of de facto or threatened
detainment, whether lawful or otherwise"". In Currie, Macdonald J.A.
said at p. 231: ""There is here no element of involuntary restraint. His
freedom of choice was not restricted‑‑he was given the option of
accompanying the police or not. He chose to go with the officer without
indicating any reluctance to do so and without being threatened with detainment
if he refused."" In the passage quoted above, Tallis J.A. expressed the
contrary view, where he said: ""On the other hand, the average citizen
would acquiesce in the demand made by a peace officer rather than suffer the
potential embarrassment of further proceedings that could arise... When you
consider the circumstances of this case and in particular the contents of the
demand that was made to him, it cannot be said that the respondent accused was
free to depart as he pleased.""

 

56.              A refusal to comply with a s. 235(1) 
demand without reasonable excuse is, under s. 235(2), a criminal offence. It is
not realistic to speak of a person who is liable to arrest and prosecution for
refusal to comply with a demand which a peace officer is empowered by statute
to make as being free to refuse to comply. The criminal liability for refusal
to comply constitutes effective compulsion. This psychological compulsion or
coercion effected by the consequence of a refusal to comply with a s. 235(1) 
demand appears to be what Laskin J. (as he then was) had in mind in Hogan v.
The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 574 at p. 587, where he said: ""There is no
doubt, therefore, that the accused was `detained' within the meaning of s. 2(c)(ii)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights; he risked prosecution under s. 235(2)
if, without reasonable excuse, he refused the demand which involved
accompanying the peace officer to fulfil it"". Any criminal liability for
failure to comply with a demand or direction of a police officer must be
sufficient to make compliance involuntary. This would be true, for example, of
compliance where refusal to comply would amount to a wilful obstruction of a
police officer in the execution of his or her duty, contrary to s. 118  of the Criminal
Code . 

 

57.              Although it is not strictly necessary for
purposes of this case, I would go further. In my opinion, it is not realistic,
as a general rule, to regard compliance with a demand or direction by a police
officer as truly voluntary, in the sense that the citizen feels that he or she
has the choice to obey or not, even where there is in fact a lack of statutory
or common law authority for the demand or direction and therefore an absence of
criminal liability for failure to comply with it. Most citizens are not aware
of the precise legal limits of police authority. Rather than risk the
application of physical force or prosecution for wilful obstruction, the
reasonable person is likely to err on the side of caution, assume lawful
authority and comply with the demand. The element of psychological compulsion,
in the form of a reasonable perception of suspension of freedom of choice, is
enough to make the restraint of liberty involuntary. Detention may be effected
without the application or threat of application of physical restraint if the
person concerned submits or acquiesces in the deprivation of liberty and
reasonably believes that the choice to do otherwise does not exist.

 

58.              For these reasons I am of the opinion that
the s. 235(1)  demand to accompany the police officer to a police station and to
submit to a breathalyzer test resulted in the detention of the respondent
within the meaning of s. 10  of the Charter .

 

59.              The respondent was accordingly entitled at
the time of his detention to be informed of his right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay, and there was an infringement or denial of this right,
unless it can be shown that the right to retain and instruct counsel (and
consequently the right to be informed of such right) does not exist in the
context of a s. 235(1)  demand by reason of a limit which meets the requirements
of s. 1  of the Charter :

 

1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society.

 

 

60.              Section 1  requires that the limit be prescribed
by law, that it be reasonable, and that it be demonstrably justified in a free
and democratic society. The requirement that the limit be prescribed by law is
chiefly concerned with the distinction between a limit imposed by law and one
that is arbitrary. The limit will be prescribed by law within the meaning of s.
1  if it is expressly provided for by statute or regulation, or results by
necessary implication from the terms of a statute or regulation or from its
operating requirements. The limit may also result from the application of a
common law rule. Section 235(1)  and the related breathalyzer provisions of the Criminal
Code  do not expressly purport to limit the right to counsel. Such a limit,
if it exists, must result by implication from their terms or operating
requirements. For example, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Talbourdet,
supra, found that such a limit resulted from the requirement under s.
234.1(1)  of the Criminal Code  that a sample of breath be provided
""forthwith"" into a roadside screening device. The Court held that
this requirement precluded contact with counsel prior to compliance with a s.
234.1(1)  demand. In the case of a s. 235(1)  demand, the implications from the
terms and operating requirements are somewhat different. A section 235(1) 
demand must be made ""forthwith or as soon as practicable"" and the
person upon whom the demand is made is required to provide a sample of breath
""then or as soon thereafter as is practicable"". Such samples can be
used in evidence as proof of an offence under s. 234  or s. 236  of the Criminal
Code  only if ""each sample was taken as soon as practicable after the
time when the offence was alleged to have been committed and in any event not
later than two hours after that time, with an interval of at least fifteen
minutes between the times when the samples were taken"" (s. 237(1) (c)(ii)).
This two‑hour operating requirement does not, as in the case of the
""forthwith"" requirement of a s. 234.1(1)  demand, preclude any contact
at all with counsel prior to the breathalyzer test. The right, at the time of
the detention effected by a s. 235(1)  demand, to be informed of the right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay is not, therefore, subject to a limit
prescribed by law within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter . Whether the
two‑hour operating requirement of s. 237(1)  imposes a justified limit on
the nature or extent of the access to counsel that may be afforded in
particular circumstances is something that need not be considered in this case.


 

                                                                   III

 

61.              It is necessary now to consider whether
the evidence provided by the breathalyzer test should have been excluded,
pursuant to s. 24  of the Charter , because of this infrigement or denial
of the right to counsel. For convenience I set out s. 24  again as follows:

 

                   24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter ,
have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to
obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.

 

                   (2)
Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed
by this Charter , the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having
regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

62.              As indicated earlier in these reasons, the
first issue under s. 24  is whether, as was held by the majority of the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, evidence may be excluded pursuant to s. 24(1)  on
the ground that it is appropriate and just in the circumstances to do so, or
whether it may be excluded pursuant only to s. 24(2)  on the ground that, having
regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Tallis J.A., with whom Hall
and Cameron JJ.A. concurred, said that the view which would limit the exclusion
of evidence to the terms of s. 24(2)  would in many cases leave an individual
whose rights or freedoms had been infringed or denied without any suitable or
effective remedy. In his separate concurring reasons on this issue, Bayda
C.J.S. said that had Parliament intended that s. 24(2)  should be the exclusive
basis for the exclusion of evidence because of an infringement or denial of a
right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter  it would have used the word
""only"" after the word ""excluded"" in the subsection.
Although it was not necessary for him to express an opinion on this issue, in
view of his conclusion on the question of detention, Brownridge J.A. briefly
indicated that in his opinion evidence could be excluded under s. 24  of the Charter 
only if its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
He said, ""It appears anomalous to me that the very power which is so
circumscribed in s. 24(2)  should be available to a court under s. 24(1)  without
any such restriction"".

 

63.              The trial judge and the majority of the
Court of Appeal held that while s. 24(2)  imposed a duty to exclude
evidence if its admission would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute, s. 24(1)  conferred a discretion to exclude it if such
exclusion appeared to the court to be appropriate and just in the
circumstances. It would appear that this distinction between duty and
discretion was the principal rationale for the majority view that the framers
of the Charter  intended to provide two different bases for the exclusion
of evidence where there has been an infringement or a denial of a guaranteed
right or freedom. 

 

64.              I do not find it necessary to consider
whether we should look, as was suggested by counsel for the appellant, at the
legislative history of s. 24  as an aid to the determination of this issue. I am
satisfied from the words of s. 24  that s. 24(2)  was intended to be the sole
basis for the exclusion of evidence because of an infringement or a denial of a
right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter . It is clear, in my opinion,
that in making explicit provision for the remedy of exclusion of evidence in s.
24(2) , following the general terms of s. 24(1) , the framers of the Charter ,
intended that this particular remedy should be governed entirely by the terms
of s. 24(2) . It is not reasonable to ascribe to the framers of the Charter 
an intention that the courts should address two tests or standards on an
application for the exclusion of evidence‑‑first, whether the
admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute,
and if not, secondly, whether its exclusion would nevertheless be appropriate
and just in the circumstances. The inevitable result of this alternative test
or remedy would be that s. 24(2)  would become a dead letter. The framers of the
Charter  could not have intended that the explicit and deliberately
adopted limitation in s. 24(2)  on the power to exclude evidence because of an
infringement or a denial of a guaranteed right or freedom should be undermined
or circumvented in such a manner. The opening words of s. 24(2)  ""Where, in
proceedings under subsection (1)"" simply refer, in my view, to an
application for relief under s. 24(1) . They reinforce the conclusion that the
test set out in s. 24(2)  is to be the exhaustive one for the remedy of
exclusion of evidence. I conclude, therefore, that the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal erred in law in affirming the exclusion of the evidence provided by the
breathalyzer test on the ground that it was appropriate and just in the
circumstances, within the meaning of s. 24(1)  of the Charter . 

 

                                                                   IV

 

65.              It is necessary, then, to consider the
meaning of the test or standard prescribed by s. 24(2)  and its application to
the facts as established by the record in this case. There are two requirements
for the exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) : (a) that the evidence has
been obtained in a manner that infringed or denied a right or freedom
guaranteed by the Charter ; and (b) that, having regard to all the
circumstances, the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute. The first requirement suggests that there must be some
connection or relationship between the infringement or denial of the right or
freedom in question and the obtaining of the evidence the exclusion of which is
sought by the application. Some courts have held, or appear to have assumed,
that the relationship must be one of causation, similar to the ""but
for"" causation requirement of tort law. (See Fleming, The Law of Torts,
(6th ed. 1983) p. 171.) This was essentially the view applied by Gushue J.A. on
behalf of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal in R. v. Trask, supra,
where he said at p. 137:

 

                   The
evidence was not obtained in contravention of the Charter . It was
properly obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code .
There is no evidence that the accused had any reasonable excuse to refuse to
provide samples of his breath. If he had been informed of his right to retain
and instruct counsel and had indeed consulted counsel, counsel would have
undoubtedly advised him of his obligation to provide the samples demanded.

 

66.              In my opinion the words ""obtained in
a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this
Charter "", particularly when they are read with the French version, obtenus
dans des conditions qui portent atteinte aux droits et libertés garantis par la
présente charte, do not connote or require a relationship of causation. It
is sufficient if the infringement or denial of the right or freedom has
preceded, or occurred in the course of, the obtaining of the evidence. It is
not necessary to establish that the evidence would not have been obtained out
for the violation of the Charter . Such a view gives adequate recognition
to the intrinsic harm that is caused by a violation of a Charter  right
or freedom, apart from its bearing on the obtaining of evidence. I recognize,
however, that in the case of derivative evidence, which is not what is in issue
here, some consideration may have to be given in particular cases to the
question of relative remoteness. 

 

67.              In the result, I am of the opinion that
the evidence represented by the certificate of analysis in this case was
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied the respondent's right to be
informed of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay and thus
meets the first requirement under s. 24(2) .

 

68.              The meaning and application of the words
in s. 24(2) , ""if it is established that, having regard to all the
circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute"", has been the subject of
considerable judicial and academic commentary, which has looked for guidance
not only to the words of s. 24(2)  but to a variety of sources, including the
common law respecting the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence in Canada,
England and other jurisdictions of the Commonwealth, experience with the
American ""absolute"" exclusionary rule, various recommendations for
change in the law prior to the Charter , the judgments of Estey J. and
Lamer J. in Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, and the
legislative history of s. 24(2) .

 

69.              On the whole, courts of appeal have
adopted, in some cases with certain reservations, what has come to be known as
the ""community shock"" test suggested by Lamer J. in Rothman.
See R. v. Collins (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 141 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Cohen
(1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 156 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Stevens (1983), 7 C.C.C.
(3d) 260 (N.S.S.C.A.D.); R. v. Chapin (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 538 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. Manninen (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.); and R.
v. Simmons, supra.

 

70.              The issue in Rothman was the
admissibility of a statement made by the accused while he was in his cell, and
after he had indicated to the police that he did not wish to make a statement
to a police officer posing as a truck driver detained for a traffic violation.
The majority of this Court held that the statement by the accused was voluntary
and therefore admissible. Lamer J., while agreeing in the result, held that a
statement, although elicited under circumstances which would not render it
inadmissible, should nevertheless be excluded if its use in the proceedings
would, as a result of what was said or done by any person in authority in
eliciting the statement, bring the administration of justice into disrepute. He
held that what would bring the administration of justice into disrepute would
be police conduct that shocked the community. 

 

71.              Estey J., dissenting, with whom Laskin
C.J.C. concurred, held that the statement should be ruled inadmissible because
it was given in circumstances which would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute. The test of what would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute, in his view, was what would be prejudicial to the public interest in
the integrity of the judicial process.

 

72.              The test suggested by Estey J. has been
perceived as a less restrictive one than that suggested by Lamer J., partly, it
would seem, because it led to a different conclusion, on the facts of the case,
as to whether the police conduct would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

73.              In Cohen, supra, Anderson
J.A., dissenting, said that he favoured the test suggested by Estey J. Several
academic commentaries have expressed or implied agreement with this view.

 

74.              In Manninen, Chapin, and Simmons,
supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal, while acknowledging that what would
shock the community would clearly bring the administration of justice into
disrepute, indicated that it did not think the application of the words in s.
24(2)  should be limited to this test. In Simmons, Howland C.J.O. said at
p. 218:

 

                   If the
evidence is obtained in such a manner as to shock the Canadian community as a
whole, it would no doubt be inadmissible as bringing the administration of
justice into disrepute. There may, however, be instances where the
administration of justice is brought into disrepute within s. 24(2)  without
necessarily shocking the Canadian community as a whole. In my opinion, it is
preferable to consider every case on its merits as to whether it satisfies the
requirements of s. 24(2)  of the Charter  and not to substitute a ""community
shock"" or any other test for the plain words of the statute.

 

75.              I agree, with respect, that we should not
substitute for the words of s. 24(2)  another expression of the standard, drawn
from a different jurisprudential context. The values which must be balanced in
making the determination required by s. 24(2)  have been placed in a new
relationship of relative importance by the constitutional status given to
guaranteed rights and freedoms by the Charter . The central concern of s.
24(2)  would appear to be the maintenance of respect for and confidence in the
administration of justice, as that may be affected by the violation of
constitutional rights and freedoms. There is clearly, of course, by
implication, the other value which must be taken into consideration in the
application of s. 24(2) ‑‑that is, the availability of otherwise
admissible evidence for the ascertainment of truth in the judicial process,
particularly in the administration of the criminal law. The issue under s.
24(2)  is the circumstances in which that value must yield to the protection and
enforcement of constitutional rights and freedoms by what may be in a
particular case the only remedy. 

 

76.              The factors or circumstances to be taken
into consideration in determining whether the admission of evidence would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute have also been the subject of
considerable commentary by courts and scholars. It would not be wise to attempt
an exhaustive identification of the relevant factors in this case. However,
certain of them have, in my opinion, been properly affirmed in the cases as
being of particular relevance and weight, especially in the context of the
right under s. 8  of the Charter  to be secure against unreasonable search
and seizure. In this context the two principal considerations in the balancing
which must be undertaken are the relative seriousness of the constitutional
violation and the relative seriousness of the criminal charge. The relative
seriousness of the constitutional violation has been assessed in the light of
whether it was committed in good faith, or was inadvertent or of a merely
technical nature, or whether it was deliberate, wilful or flagrant. Another
relevant consideration is whether the action which constituted the
constitutional violation was motivated by urgency or necessity to prevent the
loss or destruction of the evidence.

 

77.              The application of these factors to a
denial of the right to counsel involves, in my view, a different balance
because of the importance of that right in the administration of criminal
justice. In my opinion, the right to counsel is of such fundamental importance
that its denial in a criminal law context must prima facie discredit the
administration of justice. That effect is not diminished but, if anything,
increased by the relative seriousness of the possible criminal law liability.
In view, however, of the judgment of this Court in Chromiak, the police
officer in this case was in my opinion entitled to assume in good faith that
the respondent did not have a right to counsel on a demand under s. 235(1)  of
the Criminal Code . Because of this good faith reliance, I am unable to
conclude, having regard to all the circumstances, as required by s. 24(2)  of
the Charter , that the admission of the evidence of the breathalyzer test
in this particular case would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. See Tarnopolsky J.A. in Simmons, supra, at pp. 228‑29.
The evidence cannot, therefore, be excluded. 

 

78.              As this conclusion indicates, I am also of
the opinion that the question whether evidence must be excluded because, having
regard to all the circumstances, its admission would bring the administration
of justice into disrepute is a question of law which may be determined by a
court without evidence of the actual or likely effect of such admission on
public opinion. Obviously the application of the relevant factors or
considerations will turn in some cases on matters of fact which must be
established by evidence, but the meaning and application of the standard in s.
24(2)  is, like other questions of admissibility of evidence, a question of law.
A court is the best judge of what would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute. There is no reliable evidentiary basis for determining what the
actual effect on public opinion would be of the admission of evidence in the
circumstances of a particular case. The suggestion of opinion polls (see D.
Gibson, ""Determining Disrepute: Opinion Polls and the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms "" (1983), 61 Can. Bar Rev. 377) encounters, in
my opinion, two fatal objections. The first is the requirement which Professor
Gibson refers to as ""specificity"". How could ""all the
circumstances"" of a case and the necessary balancing exercise be conveyed
in an opinion poll or survey? The second objection is the cost of requiring
such evidence, which, since it would have to be borne by the person whose
constitutional right or freedom had been violated, would surely be a further
factor reducing availability of the remedy provided by s. 24(2) . The exclusion
of evidence under s. 24(2)  does not, as has been suggested by some, involve the
exercise of a discretion. Section 24(2)  involves the application of a broad
test or standard, which necessarily gives a court some latitude, but that is
not, strictly speaking, a discretion. A discretion exists where there is a
choice to do one thing or another, not merely because what is involved is the
application of a flexible standard. Under the terms of s. 24(2) , where a judge
concludes that the admission of evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute, he or she has a duty, not a discretion, to exclude the
evidence. This distinction is of some importance, of course, with reference to
the scope of review of a determination under s. 24(2) .

 

79.              I would accordingly allow the appeal, set
aside the judgments of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and Muir J., and
order a new trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Rape ‑‑
Consent ‑‑ Defence of mistake of fact not available ‑‑
Wilful blindness ‑‑ Knowledge of the nature of the consent presumed
‑‑ Criminal Code , s. 143 (b)(i).

 

                   The appellant was charged with several offences,
including rape with the complainant's consent extorted by threats or fear of
bodily harm under s. 143 (b)(i) of the Criminal Code . The
complainant, after living with the appellant for a year ended their turbulent
affair. Subsequently, the appellant broke into her house twice. On both
occasions, complainant feared for her safety because of his threats and violent
behaviour. To calm him down and to protect herself from further violence, she
held out some hope of reconciliation and consented to intercourse. Although she
reported both incidents to the police and complained of being raped, no
proceedings were taken after the first time because appellant's probation
officer asked her not to press the matter. Appellant was arrested and charged
following the second incident. At trial, the judge found not only that the
complainant consented to intercourse solely because of fear engendered by appellant's
threats but also that the appellant honestly believed that the consent to
intercourse was freely and genuinely given. Applying the Pappajohn case,
the trial judge acquitted the appellant. On appeal, the Court of Appeal set
aside the acquittal and entered a conviction for rape.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed. 

 

                   The defence of mistake of fact rests on the
proposition that the mistaken belief, honestly held, deprives the accused of
the requisite mens rea for the offence. The mens rea for rape
under s. 143 (b)(i) of the Criminal Code  must involve a knowledge
that the woman is consenting because of threats or fear of bodily harm, or
recklessness as to its nature. An honest belief on the part of the accused ‑‑
even though unreasonably held ‑‑ that the woman was consenting to
intercourse freely and voluntarily and not because of threats would negate the mens
rea and entitle the accused to an acquittal. In the present circumstances,
the defence of mistake of fact was not available to the accused. The trial
judge found that the complainant consented out of fear and that the appellant
blinded himself to the obvious and made no inquiry as to the nature of the
consent which was given. The evidence revealed that he knew of the complaint of
rape caused by the first incident and therefore was aware of the likelihood of
the complainant's reaction to his threats. To proceed with intercourse in such
circumstances without further inquiry constitutes self‑deception to the
point of wilful blindness. Where the accused is deliberately ignorant as a
result of blinding himself to reality the law presumes knowledge‑‑in
this case knowledge of the forced nature of the consent. There was therefore no
room for the application of the defence.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                McIntyre
J.‑‑This appeal raises once more the issue of the
application of the defence of mistake of fact in a rape case. On this occasion
its relevance on a charge laid under s. 143 (b)(i) of the Criminal
Code , now repealed but in force when this case arose, is questioned. In
view of the significant changes made in this branch of the law by the
amendments in 1980‑81‑82‑83 (Can.), c. 125, it may be thought
that this question has become of minor importance, but it would appear that
similar cases involving similar defence claims may well arise under the new Code
provisions and the applicable principles will still require consideration.

 

2.                The appellant, a man in his early
twenties, and the complainant, a woman of thirty‑one years, had lived
together in the complainant's house for about a year before the events of
October 15, 1982. Their relationship had been one of contention and discord
with violence on the part of the appellant; ""slapping"" or
""roughing up"" in his description, ""blows"" in hers. The
appellant had left the house for short periods and in September of 1982 the
complainant decided to end the affair. She told the appellant to leave and he
did.

 

3.                On September 23, 1982, some days after
his dismissal, the appellant broke into the house at about 4:30 a.m. He was
""raging"" at her and furious because of his expulsion. He terrorized
her with a file‑like instrument with which he was armed. She was fearful of
what might occur, and in order to calm him down she held out some hope of a
reconciliation and they had intercourse. A report was made to the police of
this incident, the complainant asserting she had been raped, but no proceedings
were taken. The appellant's probation officer became involved and there was
evidence that he had asked the complainant not to press the matter, presumably
because it would interfere with the appellant's probation. 

 

4.                On October 15, 1982, again at about 4:30
a.m., the appellant broke into the complainant's house through a basement
window. She was alone, and awakened by the entry she seized the bedroom
telephone in an effort to call the police. The appellant picked up a butcher
knife in the kitchen and came into the bedroom. He was furious and violent. He
accused her of having another boyfriend; pulled the cord of the telephone out
of the jack and threw it into the living room; threatened her with the knife
and ordered her to take off her nightdress and made her stand in the kitchen
doorway, naked save for a jacket over her shoulders, so he could be sure where
she was while he repaired the window to conceal his entry from the police,
should they arrive. He struck her on the mouth with sufficient force to draw
blood, and on three occasions rammed the knife blade into the wall with great
force, once very close to her. He told her that if the police came he would put
the knife through her, and added that if he had found her with a boyfriend he
would have killed them both. At one point he tied her hands behind her back
with a scarf. The complainant said she was in fear for her life and sanity.

 

5.                By about 5:30 a.m., after an hour of
such behaviour by the appellant, she tried to calm him down. She pretended
again that there was some hope of a reconciliation if the appellant would
settle down and get a job. This had the desired effect. He calmed down and
after some conversation he joined her on the bed and they had intercourse. The
complainant swore that her consent to the intercourse was solely for the
purpose of calming him down, to protect herself from further violence. This,
she said, was something she had learned from earlier experience with him. In
her evidence she said:

 

I didn't consent at any
time.

 

I was very afraid. My
whole body was trembling. I was sure I would have a nervous breakdown. I came
very, very close to losing my mind. All I knew was I had to keep this man calm
or he would kill me.

 

6.                At about 6:45 a.m. after further
conversation with the appellant she got dressed and prepared to leave for work.
She had a business appointment at 8:00 a.m. She drove the appellant to a
location which he chose, and in the course of the journey he returned her keys
and some money that he had taken from her purse upon his arrival in the early
morning. Upon dropping him off she drove immediately to her mother's home where
she made a complaint of rape. The police were called and the appellant was
arrested that evening. 

 

7.                The appellant was charged with rape,
unlawful confinement, robbery, breaking and entering with intent to commit an
indictable offence, and possession of a weapon. At trial, before her Honour
Judge Krindle in the County Court of Winnipeg without a jury, he was acquitted
on the charge of rape but was convicted of breaking and entering and unlawful
confinement. The Court of Appeal (Matas, Huband and Philp JJ.A.‑‑Philp
J.A. dissenting) allowed the Crown's appeal on the charge of rape and entered a
conviction as well as imposing a sentence of five years' imprisonment. The
unlawful confinement count was held to be subsumed in the rape. The appellant
appealed to this Court asserting that the defence of mistake of fact, in this
case a belief by the appellant that the complainant consented to intercourse,
is open to an accused under s. 143 (b)(i) of the Criminal Code  as
well as under para. (a), and that it is the honesty of such belief that
is determinative in considering the defence, not its reasonableness. Reliance
was placed on Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120.

 

8.                The indictment set out the rape count in
these terms:

 

1. THAT he, the said John
Henry Sansregret, a male person, on or about the fifteenth day of October, in
the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty‑two, at the
City of Winnipeg in the Eastern Judicial District in the Province of Manitoba,
did unlawfully have sexual intercourse with Terry Wood, a female person who was
not his wife, with her consent, which consent was extorted by threats or fear
of bodily harm.

 

It clearly falls within s. 143 (b)(i) of the Criminal Code .
On the facts of this case, briefly summarized above, at first glance it may
appear strange indeed that defence of mistake of fact could be suggested, let
alone made out. To appreciate how the issue arises, reference must be made to
the findings of fact made at trial (1983), 34 C.R. (3d) 162, and to the
judgments given in the Court of Appeal (1983), 37 C.R. (3d) 45.

 

9.                The trial judge described the
complainant as a bright, sophisticated woman, articulate, capable, and well
employed. She considered that the appellant was neither particularly
intelligent nor ""verbal"" and expressed surprise that any intimate
relationship had ever arisen between them. She described the events of
September 23, 1982, a month before the events in question, and she considered
there was no evidence that the appellant knew she had complained of rape as a
result of that incident. Comment will be made on this question later. She then
referred to the defence of mistake of fact, and said (at p. 164):

 

If there were any evidence
before me that the accused was aware on 15th October that the complainant had
considered the sexual relations of 23rd September 1982 to have been non‑consensual,
I would have rejected this defence out of hand. There is no such evidence. I
can speculate, but that is not proof.

 

She described in detail the events of October 15 and said that she
accepted the complainant's version in so far as it differed from the
appellant's, but she observed that in many respects his evidence confirmed
hers. She continued (at p. 166): 

 

                   I am
satisfied beyond any doubt, that the accused broke and entered the
complainant's residence of 15 October motivated primarily by jealously and I do
not doubt for a moment that, had the complainant had a man there, the knife
would have been used aggressively. Having not found another man, he was bound
and determined to make the complainant hear what he had to say to her by
confining her unlawfully. He certainly broke and entered the dwelling‑house
with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, and he certainly took
possession of the butcher knife for purposes dangerous to the public peace.

 

                   Having
entered the house and discovering that the complainant was on the telephone,
being unsure about whether or not she had called the police, two things became
paramount. One was to cover up the evidence of his break‑in so that it
would not be visible from the street, and to cover up his presence in the house
by reducing it to darkness. The second was to prevent the escape of the
complainant, or her use of the telephone, particularly probable events while he
was outside putting the basement window back on the house. What better way to
confine her than to take her car keys, her house keys, her money, to strip her
naked, to bind her hands and to force her to stand by the back door and whistle
so he could hear where she was.

 

                   I find
that the accused forced the complainant to strip and tied her hands, not by way
of preliminaries to an intended rape, but by way of confining the complainant.
I similarly find the forced taking of her keys and money, to be part of the
unlawful confinement.

 

She said that once the appellant became satisfied that the police would
not come, he set out to convince the complainant to reconcile. She accepted the
evidence of the complainant that she was absolutely terrified, and that her
consent was given solely to protect herself from further violence or death. She
told him the things he wanted to hear regarding reconciliation, and she assured
him that no other man was of interest to her. Then the trial judge continued
(at pp. 167‑68):

 

                   As I
said, no rational person could have been under any honest mistake of fact.
However, people have an uncanny ability to blind themselves to much that they
do not want to see, and to believe in the existence of facts as they would wish
them to be. The accused says that, notwithstanding the reign of terror which
preceded their chat, notwithstanding that he held a knife while they talked,
notwithstanding that he did most of the talking and that the complainant's
answers were clearly equivocal, he presumed and believed that everything
between them was peachy, this notwithstanding that three weeks earlier, on a
replay of the same sort of evening, his probation officer became involved and
the complainant moved out of the house. Very honestly, despite my confidence in
the ability of people to blind themselves to reality, and even if the accused
had not lied about other parts of his testimony, I would have been hard‑pressed
to credit the honesty of his belief.

 

                   However,
his honest belief finds support in the testimony of the complainant. She knows
him, and in her opinion, notwithstanding all the objective facts to the
contrary, he did believe that everything was back to normal between them by the
time of the sexual encounter. His subsequent behaviour as well attests to that
fact.

 

                   I do
not like the conclusion which this leads me to. There was no real consent.
There was submission as a result of a very real and justifiable fear. No one in
his right mind could have believed that the complainant's dramatic about‑face
stemmed from anything other than fear. But the accused did. He saw what he
wanted to see, heard what he wanted to hear, believed what he wanted to
believe. 

 

                   The
facts in Pappajohn v. R., [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120,...are quite dissimilar to
those in this case. The dictum of the Supreme Court of Canada, however, is
clear and broad and in no way seems to limit itself to the peculiar
circumstances of that case. Perhaps the Crown will appeal this decision to
obtain some direction from the Supreme Court on whether it was that court's intention
to cover situations where an accused who demonstrates the clarity and
shrewdness this accused showed in securing his own safety at the outset can
turn around and, because it does not suit his wishes, can go wilfully blind to
the obvious shortly thereafter. In any event, the ratio of Pappajohn is
clear and it leaves me no alternative but to acquit.

 

10.              To summarize, the trial judge found that
the appellant did not enter the house with intent to make a sexual assault on
the complainant; that the complainant consented to intercourse only be­cause of
the fear engendered by the threats of the appellant and to save herself; and
that the appellant honestly believed that the complainant was giving a free and
genuine consent to intercourse. She found as well that the complainant, who
knew the appellant, also believed in the honesty of his belief.

 

11.              In the Court of Appeal three judgments
were delivered. Matas J.A., after reviewing the facts and conclusions of the
trial judge, concluded his judgment with these words (at p. 53):

 

                   In the
case at bar, it was Mr. Sansregret's conduct which terrorized the complainant
and brought about her conciliatory response. It would be the ultimate in irony
if the complainant's successful pretense that she consented, out of a
legitimate fear for her life, could be relied on by the accused as a basis for
a defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. To paraphrase the words of
McIntyre J., in Pappajohn, the notion of the availability of the defence
in these circumstances has an air of unreality. In my respectful opinion, it is
not open to Mr. Sansregret to terrorize his victim, to follow up the terror
with sexual intercourse, and to end up by innocently claiming he had an honest
belief in his victim's consent. I have concluded that the defence of mistake of
fact does not arise in this case.

 

Huband J.A., agreeing in the result, reached his conclusion on a
different basis. He considered that the mens rea required for rape is
the intent to have intercourse with the complainant without consent or while
being reckless as to whether she consented or not. He found support for this
proposition in Pappajohn, in the words of Dickson J. (as he then was),
and in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan, [1976] A.C. 182, where
Lord Hailsham said, at p. 209:

 

...if the intention of the
accused is to have intercourse nolens volens, that is recklessly and not caring
whether the victim be a consenting party or not, that is equivalent on ordinary
principles to an intent to do the prohibited act without the consent of the
victim.

 

and he referred to the words of Lord Simon regarding the proof of rape
which must be made by the Crown when he said, at p. 216: 

 

...an intention to have
sexual intercourse with a woman with knowledge that she is not consenting to it
(or reckless as to whether or not she is consenting).

 

It was his view that although the defence of mistake of fact could
apply to a charge of rape under s. 143 (b)(i) of the Criminal Code 
where consent had been given, its elements required reshaping. He said (at p.
55):

 

But with a case involving
consent extorted by threat the honest belief of the accused, to constitute a
defence, must relate not to the consent, but to the impact of the threat.

 

He then drew attention to the findings of the trial judge regarding the
nature of the complainant's consent, and said (at p. 56):

 

                   It
avails the accused nothing to now say ""But she consented"", when the
charge is one of consent extorted by threat. Everyone is agreed that the
complainant gave every indication of consent.

 

Upon this basis he reached his conclusion, saying that to proceed with
sexual intercourse at all‑‑immediately after an extended period
designed to render the complainant submissive‑‑constitutes
recklessness sufficient to sustain a charge of rape with consent extorted by
threats. He agreed with Matas J.A. that the Crown's appeal should be allowed
and a conviction of rape entered.

 

12.              Philp J.A. dissented. He accepted the
findings of fact of the trial judge, to the effect that the belief in consent
on the part of the appellant was honestly held, and referred to the evidence of
the complainant herself which, in his view, lent support to the trial judge's finding.
Relying on Pappajohn for the proposition that an honest belief in
consent need not be reasonably based to support a defence on a charge of rape,
he would have dismissed the Crown's appeal and confirmed the acquittal on the
rape count.

 

13.              Before this Court the appellant contended
that he never suspected, and never had cause to suspect, that the consent had
been given because of his threats. He argued that all the facts and all
findings of the trial judge supported this proposition. He denied wilful
blindness and recklessness and contended that the Pappajohn case was
decisive in his favour.

 

14.              Rape, as defined in s. 143 (a) of
the Criminal Code , is of course the act of having sexual intercourse
without consent. The issue with which we are concerned arises directly in a
charge under para. (a). The question will be: Did the accused have an
honest belief that the woman gave her consent? It is in this form that the
issue arose in Pappajohn, Morgan, and in R. v. Plummer and Brown
(1975), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 497 (Ont. C.A.) While those cases provide authority for
the existence of the defence and for its application where the consent is in
issue, in my view they do not cover a charge under s. 143 (b)(i) where consent
is assumed from the outset. In other words, the existence of the consent is
established and only its nature, that is, whether it was freely given or
procured by threats, is in issue. Where the accused in a case arising under s.
143 (b)(i) asserts an honest belief in consent, the honest belief must
encompass more than the fact of consent. It must include a belief that it has
been freely given and not procured by threats. I agree in this respect with Huband
J.A. The defence would apply then, subject to what is said later about wilful
blindness, in favour of an accused who had an honest belief that the consent
was not the result of threats but one freely given. 

 

15.              The defence of mistake of fact has been
said to rest on the proposition that the mistaken belief, honestly held,
deprives the accused of the requisite mens rea for the offence. The
question of the mens rea required for a conviction of rape was
considered by Dickson J. in this Court in Pappajohn. He reviewed the
authorities which have dealt with this question in the English, Australian, and
Canadian courts. It is not necessary here to refer again to the many
authorities considered, but their effect and the conclusions drawn from them by
Dickson J. may be summarized. He observed, at p. 140, that: ""The actus
reus of rape is complete upon (a) an act of sexual intercourse; (b) without
consent"". Under s. 143(b)(i) I would substitute: ""(b) with
consent if it is extorted by threats of fear of bodily harm"". He then
raised the consideration of whether at common law and under s. 143  of the Criminal
Code  the guilty intention for rape extends to the element of consent. He
concluded that it did, and he said, at p. 145:

 

                   It will
thus be seen that the great weight of authority is in support of the view that
the accused's perception of the woman's consent is an important aspect of any
prosecution for the crime of rape.

 

And concluding upon this point, at p. 146, he said:

 

                   In
summary, intention or recklessness must be proved in relation to all elements
of the offence, including absence of consent. This simply extends to rape the
same general order of intention as in other crimes.

 

I would conclude then that the mens rea for rape under s. 143(a)
of the Code must involve knowledge that the woman is not consenting, or
recklessness as to whether she is consenting or not, and for s. 143 (b)(i),
knowledge that the consent was given because of threats or fear of bodily harm,
or recklessness as to its nature. It would follow, as has been held by the
majority of this Court in Pappajohn, that an honest belief on the part
of the accused, even though unreasonably held, that the woman was consenting to
intercourse freely and voluntarily and not because of threats, would negate the
mens rea under s. 143(b)(i) of the Code and entitle the
accused to an acquittal. 

 

16.              The concept of recklessness as a basis for
criminal liability has been the subject of much discussion. Negligence, the
failure to take reasonable care, is a creature of the civil law and is not
generally a concept having a place in determining criminal liability.
Nevertheless, it is frequently confused with recklessness in the criminal sense
and care should be taken to separate the two concepts. Negligence is tested by
the objective standard of the reasonable man. A departure from his accustomed
sober behaviour by an act or omission which reveals less than reasonable care
will involve liability at civil law but forms no basis for the imposition of
criminal penalties. In accordance with well‑established principles for
the determination of criminal liability, recklessness, to form a part of the
criminal mens rea, must have an element of the subjective. It is found
in the attitude of one who, aware that there is danger that his conduct could
bring about the result prohibited by the criminal law, nevertheless persists,
despite the risk. It is, in other words, the conduct of one who sees the risk
and who takes the chance. It is in this sense that the term `recklessness' is
used in the criminal law and it is clearly distinct from the concept of civil
negligence.

 

17.              On the face of it, one would have thought
that a man who intimidates and threatens a woman and thereafter obtains her
consent to intercourse would know that the consent was obtained as a result of
the threats. If specific knowledge of the nature of the consent was not
attributable to him in such circumstances, then one would think that at the
very least recklessness would be. It might be said then that this case could
have been disposed of on the basis of recklessness. The trial judge, however,
did not do so because of her application of the `mistake of fact' defence. 

 

18.              There was indeed an abundance of evidence
before the trial judge upon which a finding of recklessness could have been
made. After a stormy period of cohabitation, the complainant dismissed the
appellant from her house in September, 1982 thus demonstrating her rejection of
him. He broke into the house on September 23 and there went through a
performance which led to an act of intercourse with a consent given by the
complainant out of fear for her life. This incident led to a report to the police
and the involvement of the appellant's probation officer. In the early morning
hours of October 15 he again broke into the house and repeated his earlier
performance, which provided the basis for the present charges.

 

19.              There was also evidence from which the
clear inference can be drawn that the appellant knew a complaint of rape had
been made in respect of the first incident. Though the complainant complained
to the police about that incident, no charges were laid. She was persuaded not
to pursue the matter by the appellant's probation officer, who had approached
her and told her that he would find a job for Sansregret if she did not press
the charges. A police officer testified as to a conversation which occurred
between himself and Sansregret after the latter's arrest. In response to a
question as to why he ran from the police when they approached him on the
evening of October 16, the appellant replied: ""From before, that time she
`phoned the police on me before."" This reply was confirmed by Sansregret
on direct examination but then denied on cross‑examination. Sansregret
admitted that he knew his probation officer had called the complainant with
respect to the September incident and that he knew that he was not welcome in
her house. There was then evidence that the appellant knew of her attitude
towards him; knew that she had complained to the police with respect to the
September 23 incident; and knew that it was only the intervention of his parole
officer which prevented charges from being laid after that incident. I
therefore disagree with the trial judge who, in my opinion, was in error in not
drawing the inference that the appellant knew that the complainant had
complained of rape as a result of the incident on September 23.

 

20.              It is evident that the trial judge would
have convicted the appellant of rape had it not been for the defence of mistake
of fact. She considered that the belief in the consent expressed by the
appellant was an honest one and therefore on the basis of Pappajohn,
even if it were unreasonably held, as it is clear she thought it was, he was
entitled to his acquittal. This application of the defence of mistake of fact
would be supportable were it not for the fact that the trial judge found in
addition that the appellant had been wilfully blind to reality in his behaviour
on October 15. Such a finding would preclude the application of the defence and
lead to a different result. It is my opinion then that the trial judge erred in
this matter in that though she made the requisite findings of fact that the
appellant was wilfully blind to the consequences of his acts she did not apply
them according to law. 

 

21.              The idea of wilful blindness in
circumstances such as this has been said to be an aspect of recklessness. While
this may well be true, it is wise to keep the two concepts separate because
they result from different mental attitudes and lead to different legal
results. A finding of recklessness in this case could not override the defence
of mistake of fact. The appellant asserts an honest belief that the consent of
the complainant was not caused by fear and threats. The trial judge found that
such an honest belief existed. In the facts of this case, because of the reckless
conduct of the appellant, it could not be said that such a belief was
reasonable but, as held in Pappajohn, the mere honesty of the belief
will support the `mistake of fact' defence, even where it is unreasonable. On
the other hand, a finding of wilful blindness as to the very facts about which
the honest belief is now asserted would leave no room for the application of
the defence because, where wilful blindness is shown, the law presumes
knowledge on the part of the accused, in this case knowledge that the consent
had been induced by threats.

 

22.              Wilful blindness is distinct from
recklessness because, while recklessness involves knowledge of a danger or risk
and persistence in a course of conduct which creates a risk that the prohibited
result will occur, wilful blindness arises where a person who has become aware
of the need for some inquiry declines to make the inquiry because he does not
wish to know the truth. He would prefer to remain ignorant. The culpability in
recklessness is justified by consciousness of the risk and by proceeding in the
face of it, while in wilful blindness it is justified by the accused's fault in
deliberately failing to inquire when he knows there is reason for inquiry.
Cases such as R. v. Wretham (1971), 16 C.R.N.S. 124 (Ont. C.A.); R.
v. Blondin (1970), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 118 (B.C.C.A.), appeal dismissed in this
Court at (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 566 (see: [1971] S.C.R. v, unreported); R. v.
Currie (1975), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 292 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. McFall (1975),
26 C.C.C. (2d) 181 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Aiello (1978), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 485
(Ont. C.A.); Roper v. Taylor's Central Garages (Exeter), Ltd., [1951] 2
T.L.R. 284, among others illustrate these principles. The textwriters have also
dealt with the subject, particularly Glanville Williams (Criminal Law: The
General Part, 2nd ed., 1961, at pp. 157‑160). He says, at p. 157: 

 

                   Knowledge,
then, means either personal knowledge or (in the licence cases) imputed
knowledge. In either event there is someone with actual knowledge. To the
requirement of actual knowledge there is one strictly limited exception. Men
readily regard their suspicions as unworthy of them when it is to their
advantage to do so. To meet this, the rule is that if a party has his suspicion
aroused but then deliberately omits to make further enquiries, because he
wishes to remain in ignorance, he is deemed to have knowledge.

 

He then referred to the words of Lord Sumner in The Zamora No. 2,
[1921] 1 A.C. 801, at pp. 811‑12, which was a case wherein a ship and
cargo were condemned in the Prize Court as contraband. The managing director of
the shipping company denied knowledge of the contraband carried by the ship,
and on this subject Lord Sumner said at pp. 811‑12:

 

                   Lord
Sterndale [the president of the Prize Court] thus expressed his final
conclusion: ""I think the true inference is that, if Mr. Banck did not know
this was a transaction in contraband, it was because he did not want to know,
and that he has not rebutted the presumption arising from the fact of the whole
cargo being contraband.""

 

                   Their
Lordships have been invited to read this as saying that Mr. Banck is not proved
to have known the contraband character of the adventure; that if he did not
know, because he did not want to know, he was within his rights and owed no
duty to the belligerents to inform himself; and that the Zamora is
condemned contrary to the passage above cited from The Hakan, [1918]
A.C. 148, upon a legal presumption arising solely and arbitrarily from the fact
that the whole cargo was contraband. It may be that in his anxiety not to state
more than he found against Mr. Banck, the learned President appeared to state
something less, but there are two senses in which a man is said not to know
something because he does not want to know it. A thing may be troublesome to
learn, and the knowledge of it, when acquired, may be uninteresting or distasteful.
To refuse to know any more about the subject or anything at all is then a
wilful but a real ignorance. On the other hand, a man is said not to know
because he does not want to know, where the substance of the thing is borne in
upon his mind with a conviction that full details or precise proofs may be
dangerous, because they may embarrass his denials or compromise his protests.
In such a case he flatters himself that where ignorance is safe, `tis folly to
be wise, but there he is wrong, for he has been put upon notice and his further
ignorance, even though actual and complete, is a mere affectation and disguise.

 

Glanville Williams, however, warns that the rule of deliberate
blindness has its dangers and is of narrow application. He says, at p. 159:

 

                   The
rule that wilful blindness is equivalent to knowledge is essential, and is
found throughout the criminal law. It is, at the same time, an unstable rule,
because judges are apt to forget its very limited scope. A court can properly
find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said that the defendant
actually knew. He suspected the fact; he realized its probability; but he
refrained from obtaining the final confirmation because he wanted in the event
to be able to deny knowledge. This, and this alone, is wilful blindness. It
requires in effect a finding that the defendant entended to cheat the
administration of justice. Any wider definition would make the doctrine of
wilful blindness indistinguishable from the civil doctrine of negligence in not
obtaining knowledge. 

 

This subject is also dealt with by Professor Stuart in Canadian
Criminal Law, 1982, at pp. 130 et seq., where its relationship to
recklessness is discussed.

 

23.              This case reveals, in my view, an
appropriate set of circumstances for the application of the `wilful blindness'
rule. I have outlined the circumstances which form the background. I have
referred to the findings of the trial judge that the appellant blinded himself
to the obvious and made no inquiry as to the nature of the consent which was
given. If the evidence before the Court was limited to the events of October
15, it would be difficult indeed to infer wilful blindness. To attribute
criminal liability on the basis of this one incident would come close to
applying a constructive test to the effect that he should have known she was
consenting out of fear. The position, however, is changed when the evidence
reveals the earlier episode and the complaint of rape which it caused,
knowledge of which, as I have said, had clearly reached the accused.
Considering the whole of the evidence then, no constructive test of knowledge
is required. The appellant was aware of the likelihood of the complainant's
reaction to his threats. To proceed with intercourse in such circumstances
constitutes, in my view, self‑deception to the point of wilful blindness.

 

24.              In my view, it was error on the part of
the trial judge to give effect to the `mistake of fact' defence in these
circumstances where she had found that the complainant consented out of fear
and the appellant was wilfully blind to the existing circumstances, seeing only
what he wished to see. Where the accused is deliberately ignorant as a result
of blinding himself to reality the law presumes knowledge, in this case
knowledge of the nature of the consent. There was therefore no room for the
operation of this defence.

 

25.              This is not to be taken as a retreat from
the position taken in Pappajohn that the honest belief need not be
reasonable. It is not to be thought that any time an accused forms an honest
though unreasonable belief he will be deprived of the defence of mistake of
fact. This case rests on a different proposition. Having wilfully blinded
himself to the facts before him, the fact that an accused may be enabled to
preserve what could be called an honest belief, in the sense that he has no
specific knowledge to the contrary, will not afford a defence because, where
the accused becomes deliberately blind to the existing facts, he is fixed by
law with actual knowledge and his belief in another state of facts is
irrelevant.

 

26.              I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Defences ‑‑
Issue estoppel ‑‑ Circumstances in which doctrine applicable ‑‑
Acquittal on charges of impaired driving and of excessive blood alcohol level ‑‑
Whether issue estoppel available on subsequent charge of perjury.

 

                   Appellant, after giving alibi evidence, was
acquitted on charges of impaired driving and of driving with alcohol in his
blood exceeding the legal limit. Subsequently charged with perjury with respect
to his testimony at the earlier trial, appellant was acquitted on the basis of
issue estoppel. The trial judge found that the issue before him on the perjury
trial‑‑the truthfulness of appellant's alibi‑‑had been
determined at the impaired driving trial and that the evidence called on the
perjury trial was available to the Crown at the earlier trial. On appeal, the
Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in allowing issue estoppel as a
defence to the charge of perjury, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new
trial.








 

                   Held (Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.


 

                   Per Estey, McIntyre,
Lamer, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: The defence of issue estoppel was
available to the appellant. On a charge of perjury, the Crown is estopped from
re‑litigating an issue decided in favour of the appellant‑‑in
this case, the truthfulness of appellant's alibi‑‑unless it is
tendering, in addition to or in lieu of the evidence previously adduced,
evidence that was not available by the exercise of reasonable diligence at the
time of the first trial. Here, the new evidence relevant to the falsity of the
alibi was available at the time of the original trial but was not called.
Although the Crown was taken by surprise by the appellant's alibi it could have
introduced the evidence necessary to disprove that alibi on rebuttal.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson JJ., dissenting: The availability of
issue estoppel, although applicable in principle to criminal proceedings where
the Crown brings a second charge tangentially concerning the same facts as the
charge on which the accused was acquitted, depends on there being explicit
findings of fact on which the initial verdict logically depended. These facts
must be affirmatively found by the original court and cannot be inferred from
an initial verdict reflecting only a reasonable doubt. A judgment fraudulently
obtained cannot form the basis of an estoppel. Therefore, if perjury can be
established any estoppel which might otherwise exist will necessarily be lost.
In such cases, the record of the initial trial must be put in evidence since
the falsity of the accused's testimony is central to the charge. The Crown,
however, cannot use the perjury charge as a guise to re‑litigate the
original charge on evidence it failed to adduce at the original trial, but
there is no logical reason to estop a prosecution from introducing fresh
evidence which, although available all along, is probative of the essential
elements of the perjury charge. In the case at bar, the defence of issue
estoppel was not available to the accused because the factual determination
underlying the defence would have had to be inferred from the earlier judgment.
Indeed, at the first trial, the judge, not only made no finding that the
accused was not the person driving the car at the time alleged by the police,
but he gave a strong indication that he did not accept the accused's version of
the facts. However, because he also had a reasonable doubt as to the Crown's
version of the facts, he felt obliged to acquit.

for the respondent. 

 

                   The reasons of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Chouinard and
Wilson JJ. were delivered by

 

1.                Wilson
J. (dissenting)‑‑I have had the benefit of the
reasons for judgment of my colleague, Mr. Justice Lamer, but must respectfully
disagree with his conclusion that the defence of issue estoppel per rem judicatam
is available to the applicant Grdic in this case.

 

2.                Grdic was charged with driving while
impaired on June 23, 1979 with a blood alcohol level over .08. The arresting
officer testified at his trial on November 1, 1979 that he had stopped Grdic at
6:30 p.m. on the day in question. A breathalizer certificate was introduced
showing that Grdic had provided breath samples at 7:30 p.m. and again at 7:50
p.m. that same day and both samples indicated a blood alcohol level of .17.
Grdic's defence was mistaken identity. He acknowledged that he was stopped on
the day in question but denied that it was at the time alleged. He testified
that he was stopped around noon and was home by 5:30 p.m. His daughter
corroborated his testimony. His case therefore was that the police must have confused
his breathalizer certificates with someone else's.

 

3.                The trial judge acquitted Grdic of the
driving charges, stating:

 

                   It is
quite apparent that perjury has been committed in this Court room. I think it
is not up to me to resolve that problem. I think it is up to somebody else and
I dismiss both counts.

 

4.                At the perjury trial the Crown called
the same police constable who had given evidence at the impaired driving trial
but in addition the Crown called a guard from the Police Station to say that he
received a radio call from that police constable and noted the time to be 6:50
p.m. on June 23, 1979. The Crown also called the breathalizer technician as a
witness. His testimony was essentially the same as the information contained in
his certificate of analysis which was made an exhibit at the trial in November
1979. The trial judge, relying on this Court's judgment in Gushue v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798, acquitted the appellant on the basis of issue
estoppel before he was required to elect whether or not to call evidence. He
found that the issue before him on the perjury trial had been determined at the
impaired driving trial. He also found that the evidence called on the perjury
trial was available to the Crown at the earlier trial. 

 

5.                The Crown appealed to the British
Columbia Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal. McFarlane J.A., writing for
the Court, found that the trial judge misapprehended and misapplied Gushue
in the same way as Gushue had been misapprehended and misapplied by the
Alberta Court of Queen's Bench in R. v. Gordon, [1980] 3 W.W.R. 655, and
by the Saskatchewan District Court in R. v. Linnen (1981), 61 C.C.C.
(2d) 13. The Court of Appeal did not, however, make clear whether it believed
that Chief Justice Laskin's decision in Gushue stands for the
proposition that issue estoppel is never available on a perjury charge
or whether it is available only where the Crown is attempting to re‑try
the accused.

 

6.                In both Gordon and Linnen,
supra, Gushue was interpreted as holding that the defence of
issue estoppel is available to a person accused of perjury whenever the effect
of the perjury charge would be to re‑try the accused on issues considered
during the first trial in which the impugned testimony was given. As
articulated by Kerans J. in Gordon at p. 657, issue estoppel would
apply any time a common issue can be made out between the initial trial and the
subsequent perjury charge. This view is premised on Chief Justice Laskin's
statement that the initial ""jury finding ... must be regarded as
conclusively true"" (Gushue at p. 805). This statement, in turn, was
construed by the courts in Gordon and Linnen as grounding issue
estoppel in a policy that the integrity of jury verdicts must be protected. By contrast,
the Court of Appeal in the case at bar suggests that the alternative
interpretation of Gushue, namely that issue estoppel is available only
where the accused is placed in double jeopardy, is the more plausible one. The
problem confronting the Court in the present appeal, therefore, is to determine
the scope of issue estoppel as enunciated in Gushue and particularly its
applicability to criminal verdicts and subsequent perjury prosecutions. 

 

7.                The appellant appealed as of right to
this Court pursuant to s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code . Three
distinct issues of law are raised on the appeal, namely (a) issue estoppel; (b)
the relationship between issue estoppel and fraud; and (c) the kind of evidence
the Crown must produce in the perjury trial. I propose to deal with those in
turn.

 

(a) Issue estoppel

 

8.                The doctrine of res judicata
reflects the fundamental premise that there must at some point be an end to
litigation. Accordingly, the doctrine is generally treated as part of the law
of estoppel. In its broadest sense a plea of res judicata is an
allegation that the entire legal rights and obligations flowing between the
parties, including questions of both law and fact, have been conclusively
disposed of by an earlier judgment: see Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin,
[1909] A.C. 615 (P.C.) An estoppel, however, can apply also to a single issue
which may arise between two parties who, although litigating for the second
time regarding issues related factually to their first case, face each other in
an altogether new cause of action: see Hoystead v. Commissioner of Taxation,
[1926] A.C. 155 (P.C.)

 

9.                In Carl‑Zeiss‑Stiftung v.
Rayner and Keeler Ltd., [1966] 2 All E.R. 536, Lord Guest indicated that
the criteria required for the operation of issue estoppel are threefold: (a)
the identical question must have been decided in both cases; (b) the judgment
creating the estoppel must be a final judgment; and (c) the parties must be the
same in both actions. For purposes of this appeal, however, the most
significant criterion is that the issue alleged to trigger the estoppel must
have clearly confronted the court in the previous proceeding and must have been
determined with certainty in the course of that court's findings: see Re
Koenigsberg, Public Trustee v. Koenigsberg, [1949] 1 All E.R. 804 (C.A.); Sterling
Engineering Co. v. Patchett, [1955] 1 All E.R. 369 (H.L.) As Dickson J. (as
he then was) stated in Angle v. Minister of National Revenue, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 248, at pp. 254‑55: 

 

Is the question to be
decided in these proceedings ... the same as was contested in the earlier
proceedings? If it is not, there is no estoppel. It will not suffice if the
question arose collaterally or incidentally in the earlier proceedings or is
one which must be inferred by argument from the judgment.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

10.              It was held by Laskin C.J. in Gushue
that issue estoppel can in theory apply so as to prevent re‑litigation of
an issue between the Crown and the accused in criminal proceedings although as
Lord Morris of Borth‑y‑Gest pointed out in Connelly v. Director
of Public Prosecutions, [1964] A.C. 1254 at pp. 1321‑22, it is only
in extremely rare circumstances that the relevant issue whose re‑litigation
is sought to be estopped can be with sufficient precision identified in the
judgment on the earlier proceedings. Indeed, Lord Devlin in Connelly
highlighted the central concern in indicating that a criminal verdict typically
entails no determination of separate issues by the trier of fact so that its
conclusion on any given issue must, in the words of Dickson J. in Angle,
supra, be inferred by argument from the judgment. Accordingly Laskin
C.J. in Gushue expressed extreme hesitancy in ever permitting an
estoppel of a particular question of fact to be premised on a previous criminal
verdict in which no specific findings of fact were articulated. Otherwise, he
queried, at p. 803:

 

How can it be ascertained
on what issue or issues the finding rested for the purpose of foreclosing a
relitigation of that issue or those issues in a subsequent criminal
prosecution? 

 

11.              The difficulty in identifying with
certainty the factual basis upon which a criminal judgment rests has generally
led to a much more limited application of issue estoppel in criminal law than
in civil litigation. In the absence of specific findings by the previous court,
issue estoppel has been held to ""only estop[s] the Crown from questioning
in later legal proceedings that which was in substance fundamental to
the decision in earlier proceedings"": R. v. Carlson, [1970] 3 O.R.
213 (Ont. H.C.) at p. 218. (Emphasis added). The restrictive application of the
doctrine may be illustrated by the decision of the House of Lords in Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys, [1977] A.C. 1, a case which entailed
facts identical to those in the present appeal. The accused, having first been
acquitted of a motor vehicle offence on the strength of his defence of mistaken
identity, was charged with having perjured himself during the course of the
testimony he gave on his own behalf. Viscount Dilhorne, while expressing doubts
as to the very availability of the doctrine in criminal law, noted that even if
issue estoppel could operate as a bar to re‑opening a conclusively
determined fact, that fact would have to be so crucial to the verdict of the
first court as to preclude its relevance to any other charge (p. 22). As Lord
Widgery C.J. pointed out in the Court of Appeal, R. v. Humphrys, [1975]
2 All E.R. 1023, at p. 1026:

 

... it is only in quite
exceptional cases that an argument based on issue estoppel is likely to succeed
because it is only in the clearest cases, where it is obvious that the court
before which the earlier proceedings were held must have applied its mind and
decided the issue on which estoppel is claimed, that the matter can be
recognised as having any virtue or effect on the subsequent proceedings. 

 

12.              I must respectfully differ from my learned
colleague in his view that a finding was made by the trial judge trying Grdic
on the impaired driving charges that he was not the person driving the car at
6:30 p.m. On the contrary, the trial judge, it seems to me, expressly refrained
from making any finding on that issue. In stating his suspicion that perjury
had been committed he gave a strong indication that, although he had a
reasonable doubt as to the Crown's version of the events, he was not prepared
to accept the facts as presented by the accused. Having regard to that
reasonable doubt he had no alternative but to acquit. Accordingly, in the present
case the factual determination on which the estoppel is based is one that would
have to be inferred from the earlier judgment since it was not the subject of
an express finding as required by Dickson J. in Angle, supra.
Since it cannot conclusively be inferred from that judgment, I do not believe
that issue estoppel constitutes a bar to the Crown's pursuit of the perjury
charge. 

 

(b) Issue estoppel and fraud

 

13.              Having concluded that issue estoppel is
not available to Grdic it is not, strictly speaking, necessary for me to
address the issue of the effect of fraud on the application of the doctrine.
However, since much of the argument was devoted to this issue and since my
colleague has dealt with it at some length in his reasons, I am addressing it
briefly.

 

14.              Assuming that I am wrong in concluding
that a finding of fact in the accused's favour was not implicit in his
acquittal on the impaired driving charges and that the doctrine of issue
estoppel may be raised by Grdic as a defence to the perjury charge, Grdic faces
the hurdle that fraud represents an extrinsic act which can serve to vitiate
the initial proceedings: see The Duchess of Kingston's Case (1776), 2
Smith L.C. (13th ed.) 644. Perjury may be said to be a species of deceitful
conduct which, although not itself actionable, partakes of all of the elements
of fraud: see Hargreaves v. Bretherton, [1958] 3 All E.R. 122 (Q.B.); Watson
v. M'Ewan, [1905] A.C. 480 (H.L.) Accordingly, it is evident that if
perjury or other fraudulent conduct can be established any estoppel which might
otherwise exist will necessarily be lost.

 

15.              The offence of perjury requires for its
proof an examination of the record of the initial proceedings since regardless
of whether the court was actually misled, the actus reus of the offence
is the giving of false evidence and the mens rea of knowingly
doing so can be inferred from such an act: see Wolf v. The Queen, [1975]
2 S.C.R. 107. The record of the prior testimony must be compared with some
other objective evidence establishing the falsity of such testimony (R. v.
Threlfall (1914), 10 Cr. App. R. 112, at p. 114) so that to a certain
extent the record of the prior proceedings always constitutes part of the
evidence in the subsequent one. Accordingly, although Lord Widgery correctly
points out in Humphrys, supra, that there is no exception per
se to the doctrine of issue estoppel in relation to a charge of perjury,
and the perjury charge cannot be a guise for re‑trying the initial case
against the accused, the doctrine does not operate so as to make inadmissible
evidence going to the act of making a false statement under oath. Proof of such
an act, of course, then amounts to the fraud required in order to undermine the
very basis on which the estoppel is founded. 

 

(c) The need for new evidence

 

16.              There are two accepted limitations to the
rule that issue estoppel cannot be set up by a party who obtained the initial
judgment by fraud, the first being the requirement that any subsequent case
against such an accused be made by the Crown on the basis of fresh evidence.
This limitation was accepted by Laskin C.J. in Gushue and is eminently
sensible in view of the need to prohibit the Crown from re‑litigating an
issue determined adversely to it by the initial court. The fresh evidence rule,
however, is not an issue in the present case as the Crown did in fact introduce
evidence in the perjury case that had not previously formed part of its case
against the accused.

 

17.              The second limitation to the rule that
fraud undermines issue estoppel, however, is very much in issue if one accepts
for the moment that issue estoppel is available to the accused in the present
situation. As it is traditionally stated, this limitation reflects the idea
that a prior finding of fact can only be undermined through the introduction of
new evidence which was not and could not by reasonable diligence have
previously been obtained: see Phosphate Sewage Co. v. Molleson (1879), 4
App. Cas. 801 at p. 814 (H.L.) Lord Hailsham articulated the policy grounds
underlying this rule in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys, supra,
at p. 40 where he stated that the fact that the accused was in jeopardy of
answering the full case had the Crown been diligent in its conduct of the
initial trial leads to a demand that it be barred from compensating for its
lack of diligence in a second attempt to convict the accused. Accordingly, the
rule reflects the fundamental premise of the entire doctrine of res judicata
namely, that it is necessary at some point to put an end to any given piece of
litigation. 

 

18.              As expressed by Lord Hailsham, the rule
that any fresh evidence brought forward by the Crown must have been unavailable
at the initial trial is based on the principle that the Crown must be estopped
from increasing the prejudice faced by the accused resulting from the Crown's
own lack of diligence. This rule, therefore, makes sense when applied to the
ordinary plea of res judicata since the non‑diligent prosecution
of the accused for the offence charged cannot give way to a subsequent more
thorough prosecution for the same offence. It is in this respect that Friedland
in his book Double Jeopardy (1969), makes the assertion (p. 129)
referred to by my colleague that an acquittal must be perceived as equivalent
to a finding of innocence. However, an acquittal for the offence of impaired
driving cannot be said to be equivalent to a finding of innocence in a separate
charge for perjury any more than it can apply to an altogether factually
distinct offence. Where the question is one of issue estoppel rather than res
judicata, and the second offence is different from the one with which
the accused was initially charged, the prejudice imposed upon the accused is
not increased by a lack of diligence on the part of the Crown. Indeed, the only
result of the Crown's failure to bring forward all the evidence going to rebut
the accused's allegedly perjured testimony in the first instance is the failure
of the prosecution to win a conviction on the initial charge. Accordingly,
rather than facing the possibility of two convictions, the accused is in
jeopardy of conviction for only one offence. The policy ground of increased
prejudice upon which Lord Hailsham's insistence on the requirement of
previously unavailable evidence is based has no application here. So long as
the Crown introduces some evidence that was not introduced on the initial trial
there is no basis in principle for excluding fresh evidence probative of the
alleged falsity of the accused's testimony.

 

Summary of Conclusions

 

19.              Although the doctrine of issue estoppel is
in principle applicable to criminal proceedings where the Crown brings a second
charge tangentially concerning the same facts as a charge on which the accused
was acquitted, availability of the doctrine depends on there being explicit findings
of fact on which the initial verdict can be seen to have logically depended.
Such facts must be perceived as having been affirmatively found by the original
court and cannot be such as must be gathered only inferentially from the
initial verdict or as to the finding of which the initial verdict reflects only
a reasonable doubt. 

 

20.              Even if the necessary finding of fact can
be discerned in the initial judgment, a party raising issue estoppel as a
defence to a perjury charge must overcome the hurdle posed by the rule that a
judgment fraudulently obtained cannot form the basis of an estoppel.
Accordingly, at a minimum the record of the initial trial must be put in
evidence since the falsity of the accused's testimony is the central issue in
the perjury charge. Although the Crown may be barred from using the perjury
charge as a guise in which to simply re‑litigate the original charge on
evidence it failed to adduce on the original charge, there appears to be no
logical reason to estop a prosecution from introducing fresh evidence which,
although available all along, is probative of the essential elements of the
perjury charge. Such evidence, despite its having been available, may have been
perceived as of only minimal relevance to the initial charge and its subsequent
introduction in the case to which it is highly relevant cannot be said to
prejudice the accused in any way.

 

21.              For these reasons I would dismiss the
appeal. 

 

                   The judgment of Estey, McIntyre, Lamer,
Le Dain and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

22.              Lamer
J.‑‑This appeal addresses the question of the availability
of the defence of issue estoppel per rem judicatam on a charge of
perjury. It also affords an opportunity to examine the application of the
doctrine of double jeopardy and see to what extent its effect with respect to a
perjury prosecution is to introduce an exception to the general rule that
""issue estoppel"" cannot be founded on fraud.

 

The Facts

 

23.              In November 1979, the appellant Grdic was
tried on charges that, on June 23, 1979, he drove while impaired and with a
blood alcohol level over .08. A police constable testified that he had stopped
Grdic at approximately 6:30 p.m. when he observed him driving erratically. A
certificate of analysis was introduced to prove that Grdic had provided breath
samples at 7:30 p.m. and 7:50 p.m. on June 23 and that the samples indicated a
blood alcohol level of .17.

 

24.              Grdic testified that he had been stopped
for impaired driving on June 23 but denied that he was driving and was stopped
at the time given by the constable. His testimony was that he was stopped at
approximately noon, gave samples of his breath at that time, and that he was
definitely home as of 5:00 p.m. Grdic's daughter gave evidence corroborating
his testimony. The Crown did not attempt to call anyone in rebuttal.

 

25.              The trial judge dismissed the charges.

 

26.              In June 1980, the appellant was tried on a
charge that he had perjured himself during the course of his trial in November
1979. At the perjury trial the Crown called the same police constable who had
testified at the original trial and called other witnesses, who had not, in
order to corroborate the constable's version of the time at which Grdic had
been stopped. The trial judge acquitted Grdic before he was required to elect
whether to call evidence, on the basis of the application of issue estoppel. 

 

Judgments

 

1)                Provincial Court of British Columbia: Overend
Prov. Ct. J.

 

27.              He was of the view that the point at issue
in the perjury case, the truth of the appellant's alibi, was determined by
Behncke Prov. Ct. J. when he dismissed the original charges; that the Crown was
not allowed, in effect, to re‑try an accused through the mechanism of a
trial on perjury charges, except if there was fresh evidence which was not
available at the time of the original trial. Finding that the evidence to rebut
Grdic's alibi was available to the Crown at the time of the original trial and
that it did not seek to apply for an adjournment to call rebuttal evidence, he
applied the principle of issue estoppel and, as a result, acquitted the
accused.

 

2)                Court of Appeal of British Columbia:
McFarlane J.A., Carrothers and Hinkson JJ.A. concurring.

 

28.              McFarlane J.A. felt it significant that
the trial judge who acquitted Grdic on the original charges indicated that it
was apparent that perjury had been committed and that it was not up to him to
solve that problem.

 

29.              He thought that the trial judge in the
present case had misinterpreted dicta by Laskin C.J. in his judgment in Gushue
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798. The case of R. v. Gordon, [1980]
3 W.W.R. 655, upon which the trial judge relied for his interpretation of Gushue,
and R. v. Linnen (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 13, were, in the opinion of the
Court of Appeal, incorrectly decided.

 

30.              In Gushue the Chief Justice said,
at pp. 805‑06:

 

                   Logical
as this submission may appear to be, what we have to resolve here is a question
of policy based on the premise that issue estoppel cannot be founded on false
evidence where the falsity is disclosed by subsequent evidence not available at
the trial from which issue estoppel is alleged to arise. In my view, unless it
can be said that the subsequent prosecution is an attempt by the Crown to re‑try
the accused‑‑and that is not the case here‑‑the preferable
policy is to exclude issue estoppel, especially when the contradictory
statements on which the charge under s. 124 is founded consist of admissions of
the accused himself.

 

A reading of these remarks in context shows, said he, that they do not
support the proposition that issue estoppel applies on a perjury charge except
where the falsity of the accused's evidence can be established by evidence not
available at his first trial. 

 

31.              The Crown's appeal was accordingly allowed
and a new trial was ordered.

 

Issue

 

32.              Did the British Columbia Court of Appeal
err in holding that issue estoppel was not available on the charge of perjury
in this case?

 

33.              In a contemporaneous case, Duhamel v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 555, I have summarized the generalities on the
law of res judicata and need only add here those comments particular to
the case at bar.

 

The Meaning of an Acquittal

 

34.              In the case at bar the trial judge alluded
to the commission of perjury. Respondent has not sought support from this but I
feel I should nevertheless address the matter briefly as the Court of Appeal made
some reference to the matter as follows:

 

                   At that
trial the respondent in due course gave evidence to support a defence of alibi.
I think it is by no means conclusive, of course, but it is not without
significance that in giving his reasons for judgment the trial judge who
acquitted the respondent on those charges said:

 

`It is quite apparent that
perjury has been committed in this Court room. I think it is not up to me to
solve that problem. I think that it is up to somebody else and I dismiss both counts.'

 

35.              There are not different kinds of
acquittals and, on that point, I share the view that ""as a matter of
fundamental policy in the administration of the criminal law it must be
accepted by the Crown in a subsequent criminal proceeding that an acquittal is
the equivalent to a finding of innocence"" (see Friedland, Double
Jeopardy (1969), at p. 129; also Chitty i, 648; R. v. Plummer,
[1902] 2 K.B. 339 at p. 349. To reach behind the acquittal, to qualify it, is
in effect to introduce the verdict of ""not proven"", which is not, has
never been, and should not be part of our law.

 

36.              If the trial judge did not believe the
accused, as he was entitled to, and his remarks might be construed as
suggesting that he in fact did not believe the accused, he should have entered
a conviction. Not having done so, Grdic is entitled to the full benefit of his
acquittal.

 

37.              However, this does not mean that, for the
purpose of the application of the doctrine of res judicata, the Crown is
estopped from re‑litigating all or any of the issues raised in the first
trial. But it does mean that any issue, the resolution of which had to be in
favour of the accused as a prerequisite to the acquittal, is irrevocably deemed
to have been found conclusively in favour of the accused (see R. v. Carlson,
[1970] 3 O.R. 213; contra, Villemaire v. The Queen (1962), 39
C.R. 297 at p. 300). This is so even though the judgment might well be the
result of a reasonable doubt on that issue, and even when the judge has said so
or expressed views that indicate clearly that his finding, though inuring to
the benefit of the accused, had been arrived at with reluctance and the judge
has suggested that it is not conclusively in favour of the accused. 

 

The Favourable Finding

 

38.              The accused, by his defence, is saying:
the breathalyzer test taken that evening cannot be mine because I could not be
there since I was at home.

 

39.              The only avenue of acquittal open to the
trial court, therefore, given that defence and the nature of the case, was a
finding by the trial judge that there was reasonable doubt that the appellant
was the person investigated at 6:30 p.m. That issue, subject to certain
exceptions, cannot be re‑litigated, because, as a matter of law for
the purpose of the application of the doctrine of res judicata, there has
been made in his favour a finding that he was not driving his car at 6:30 p.m.

 

Issue Estoppel and Fraud

 

40.              Issue estoppel cannot inure to a defendant
if it be proven that the issue was determined in his favour as a result of
fraud, subject to two limitations, one related to the principle of res
judicata, the other the result of a policy consideration related to
fairness to the accused and to the judicial process. De Grey C.J. speaking for
the Court in The Duchess of Kingston's Case (1776), 2 Smith L.C. (13th
ed.) 644, stated clearly the rule as it had already developed at the time, at
p. 651:

 

...if it was a direct and
decisive sentence upon the point, and, as it stands, to be admitted as
conclusive evidence upon the Court, and not to be impeached from within; yet,
like all other acts of the highest judicial authority, it is impeachable from
without: although it is not permitted to show that the Court was mistaken, it
may be shown that they were misled.

 

                   Fraud
is an extrinsic, collateral act; which vitiates the most solemn proceedings of
Courts of Justice. Lord Coke says, it avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical
or temporal.

 

41.              Fraud may be set up against an accused so
as to deny him the benefit of issue estoppel.

 

42.              There are many forms of fraud that may be
invoked, one of which, and I imagine the most common, is the allegation by the
Crown of perjury committed by the defendant. Such an allegation is to the
effect that the judge not only erred but erred because he was misled by the
fraud, in this case, the perjury. If the allegation is successfully
established, then the accused cannot estop the Crown from inviting the judge to
re‑litigate the issue. 

 

The First Limitation

 

43.              If to prove the allegation the Crown is
merely tendering the same evidence as that tendered previously, then issue
estoppel will survive the attack because the Crown's allegation is, in
disguise, but a re‑litigation of the issue as litigated previously,
or, to use the words of De Grey C.J., an attempt ""to impeach from
within"".

 

44.              Indeed another judge, or conceivably the
same judge, hearing the subsequent perjury charge is invited to reconsider the
same evidence and conclude differently. This can only be done through the
appeal process finding reversible error resulting in the ordering of a new
trial before a different judge. Therefore perjury may defeat issue
estoppel but, as said De Grey C.J., only ""from without"", that is,
only if there is additional evidence (I use here the expression
""additional evidence"" as including any evidence that was not put
before the trier of fact in the previous proceeding, whether available or not
at the time); it may defeat the estoppel, but not necessarily, and this leads
into the second limitation.

 

Second Limitation

 

45.              If the additional evidence was available
to the Crown under the laws of evidence, using reasonable diligence at the time
of the first trial (I am paraphrasing Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone in Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys, [1977] A.C. 1, at p. 40), and the Crown
failed to tender it, then it is estopped from so doing later on, not per rem
judicatam, but for reasons of fairness to the accused who was in jeopardy
of answering the full case had the Crown been diligent.

 

46.              Lord Hailsham dealt with the matter under
the doctrine of double jeopardy in Humphrys, supra, where at p.
40, he said:

 

In an indictment for
perjury like the present I would think that it is the duty of the court to
apply the double jeopardy rule against the Crown not as a matter of discretion
but as a matter of law where it is satisfied in substance that all the
prosecution is doing is trying to get behind the original verdict by re‑trying
the same evidence. But where the prosecution by calling additional evidence
which it could not have had available using reasonable diligence at the time of
the first trial is in substance as well as in form putting the accused in
jeopardy not for the original alleged misdemeanour of which he has been
acquitted (or convicted) but for his crime against justice committed by
perjuring himself at the first trial, there is no double jeopardy and the
prosecution is entitled to adduce the evidence and make the assertions
necessary to achieve its purpose whether or not the effect is to give rise to
the inference that the previous verdict of acquittal was insupportable, or the
previous conviction and punishment right. 

 

47.              In Gushue, supra, this
Court's reference to ""subsequent evidence not available"" must be
viewed in the light of the fact that that was the factual situation addressed
by the judgment, and that should not be construed as setting a narrower rule
than that which I have expressed and which was that suggested by Lord Hailsham.

 

48.              I would adopt the words of Kerans J. in R.
v. Gordon, supra, where, addressing the same issue as in this case,
he said, at p. 661:

 

...I don't think it is a
matter only whether the evidence was actually before the court in the first
trial or, on the other hand, whether it was evidence that simply didn't exist
at the time of the first trial. I think rather the test is whether or not it
was available.

 

                   It
seems to me much the same policy is involved in the fresh evidence rule. And I
am inclined to think the same rule should be applied: ""available""
means ""available by the exercise of reasonable diligence"". (Perhaps
it should involve also a question of materiality. Fresh evidence operates as a
justifying factor. If there is fresh evidence, then a case may be tried and the
fresh evidence as well as all other relevant evidence may be advanced,
including some that may have been available but not called at the first
hearing. The fresh evidence is the Crown's ticket for a new trial. It should
therefore be of some significance.)

 

49.              The practical result of the interaction of
these various policy considerations can be enunciated as follows:

 

On a charge of perjury
arising in these circumstances, the Crown is estopped from re‑litigating
an issue decided in favour of the accused unless it is tendering, in addition
to or in lieu of the evidence previously adduced, evidence that was not at the
time of the first trial available by the exercise of reasonable diligence.

 

Now to deal with the facts of this case. 

 

50.              It is conceded by the Crown that the new
evidence was available at the time of the original trial. It is argued that
""it was not called because it could not have been anticipated that it was
necessary"". I agree that it could not have been anticipated during the
Crown's case prior to the defence; indeed Grdic did not give any indication,
either prior to trial or through his cross‑examination of witnesses that
his defence would be one of mistaken identity through proof of his being
present elsewhere at the time of the taking of the sample. That the Crown was
taken by surprise by this defence is beyond doubt, as is beyond doubt the fact
that the Crown could not, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, foresee
the defence. The Crown was therefore entitled to call rebuttal evidence which,
under the law, had it chosen to do so, should have been allowed. Indeed, a
trial judge should exercise his discretion in favour of allowing rebuttal
evidence when the issue raised by the defence arose ex improviso, could
not have been foreseen by the Crown, and that the Crown is not in effect
attempting to split its case. (See for example R. v. Parkin (No. 2) (1922),
37 C.C.C. 35; R. v. Therien and Sanseverino (1943), 80 C.C.C. 87; R.
v. Coombs (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 85; R. v. Campbell (1978), 1 C.R.
(3d) 309 and R. v. Kerr (1983), 18 Man. R. (2d) 230). Admissible through
rebuttal, the evidence was available to the Crown and the Crown, having heard
the defence, was no longer in a position to argue that ""it could not have
been anticipated that it was necessary"" to call that evidence.

 

51.              I would therefore allow this appeal, quash
the order for a new trial entered by the Court of Appeal, and restore the
acquittal entered by the trial judge.

                   The following is the judgment delivered by 

 

1.                The
Court‑‑The appellant accused appeals a decision of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in which that court entered verdicts of guilty,
pursuant to its power under s. 613(4)  of the Criminal Code , with respect
to charges relating to a bank robbery.

 

2.                The trial judge found that, though the
accused appreciated the nature and quality of his acts, and understood that his
acts were unlawful, his conduct was caused by a loss of self‑control or
an irresistible impulse, which was, in turn, caused by delusions resulting from
voluntary drug induced intoxication. The accused was acquitted on the ground
that his state of intoxication raised a reasonable doubt whether he had the
necessary specific intent for the offences of which he was charged.

 

3.                We agree with the Court of Appeal that
the trial judge erred in acquitting the accused. Loss of self‑control or
irresistible impulse caused by voluntarily induced intoxication is not a
defence to a criminal charge in Canada. The Court of Appeal was correct in
entering verdicts of guilty on the charges.

 

4.                This appeal is dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 








                   Criminal law ‑‑ Appeal ‑‑
Accused acquitted of conspiring and of obstructing justice ‑‑
Crown’s appeal limited to questions of law ‑‑ No mistake of law ‑‑
Logical conclusion by the trial judge ‑‑ Criminal Code , s.
605(1) (a).

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Extortion ‑‑
Money requested without violence or menaces does not amount to extortion.

 

                   Appellant Rousseau was charged (1) with conspiring
with a police officer to attempt to obstruct justice, (2) with attempted
obstruction of justice, and (3) with extortion. The accused, a lawyer,
represented three persons suspected of stealing and of receiving stolen goods;
two of these persons worked for the security company responsible for protecting
the businesses where the thefts occurred. The attempted obstruction of justice
and the conspiracy arose from the fact that the accused allegedly agreed with
the police officer responsible for the investigation that fewer charges be laid
in return for money obtained from his clients. The accused allegedly committed
the extortion through a request for $10,000, made to the lawyer of the security
company, to avoid bad publicity for the company. The accused undertook to have
the charges against the company's employees quietly dropped. The judge of the
Court of Sessions of the Peace acquitted the accused on the three charges. He
considered that the accused's guilt was not established beyond all reasonable
doubt. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal on the first count only
and found the accused guilty of conspiracy. Rousseau appealed the judgment of
the Court of Appeal on the first count, and the Crown on the second and third
counts. 

 

                   Held: The appeal by
Rousseau should be allowed. The appeal by the Crown should be dismissed.

 

                   The Court of Appeal erred in quashing the acquittal
and in finding the accused guilty of conspiracy. The Crown's appeal, which was
governed by s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , was limited to
grounds ""that involved a question of law alone"". The doubt
entertained by the trial judge concerning the existence of a conspiracy had to
be purely a matter of conjecture and have no basis whatever in the evidence for
it to amount to an error of law. In the case at bar, the actions and statements
of both the accused and the police officer supported the notion that such a
conspiracy existed, but this was not the only logical possibility and one
cannot say, as did the Court of Appeal, that ""to consider any possibility
other than the existence of a conspiracy between the accused and the police
officer was purely conjectural"". The trial judge was not convinced beyond
all reasonable doubt of the existence of such a conspiracy. In view of the
evidence adduced at trial, one cannot say that such a doubt amounts to an error
of law.

 

                   The trial judge, moreover, did not err in finding
that the accused's guilt was not established beyond all reasonable doubt on the
count of attempted obstruction of justice. The doubt entertained by the judge
is not purely a matter of conjecture and has basis in the evidence.

 

                   Finally, the fact that someone asks another person
for a sum of money for committing an unlawful act which might be helpful to
that other person does not constitute extortion within the meaning of s. 305  of
the Criminal Code . The accused did not attempt to induce the
security company to give him money by threats, accusations, menaces or
violence.

                   English version of the judgment of the Court
delivered by 

 

1.                Lamer
J.‑‑Appellant Rousseau was acquitted by a judge of the Court
of Sessions of the Peace on a charge consisting of three counts, namely,
conspiring with a police officer in an attempt to obstruct justice, attempted
obstruction of justice and extortion. The Crown appealed the judgment and the
Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the counts of attempted
obstruction of justice and extortion; however, it allowed the appeal on the
first count and found Rousseau guilty of conspiracy. Rousseau appealed to this Court
on the first count, and the Crown did likewise on the second and third counts.

 

2.                In my view, Rousseau's appeal should
succeed and that of the Crown should be dismissed.

 

Facts

 

3.                Both the trial judge and the Court of
Appeal related and analysed the facts in great detail in their judgments. I do
not think it is necessary for me to do so in this judgment. I need only say the
following. Rousseau is a lawyer. Three of his clients were involved in theft
and receiving. Two of them worked for the security company which had the
contract to protect the businesses where the thefts occurred.

 

4.                The attempted obstruction of justice and
conspiracy for that purpose arose from the fact that Rousseau allegedly agreed
with the police officer responsible for the investigation of these crimes, a
man named Asselin, to lay charges only for a part of them and to conceal the
identities of the perpetrators from the authorities as to the remainder, in
return for money obtained from his clients, money which Rousseau claimed was to
be shared with the police officer.

 

5.                The extortion was allegedly committed by
a request made by the lawyer Rousseau to the lawyer of the security company for
the sum of $10,000 to avoid publicity which, in connection with events
involving employees, would have been bad for the company. The lawyer Rousseau
allegedly said that he would be able to have the charges quietly dropped. The evidence
of this request for money rested simply on the testimony of the company's
lawyer. 

 

6.                The evidence relating to the other two
counts is more complicated. Essentially, it consisted of conversations which
Rousseau had with his clients, related at the trial by two of them, a
discussion between Rousseau and the police officer, and finally statements made
by the police officer to Rousseau's clients.

 

7.                The trial judge disposed of the second
and third counts quite briefly, saying simply that [TRANSLATION]  ""The
evidence does not support a guilty verdict on counts 2 and 3."" However, he
undertook a meticulous and exhaustive analysis of the evidence on the charge of
conspiracy. The following passage summarizes his analysis:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
The evidence did not establish any agreement between Rousseau and Asselin in
the presence of any other person. The content of the conversations which
Rousseau may have had with Michel Hébert, Laurent Cyr, Boucher or Mr. Delisle,
and which Asselin may have had with Cyr and Hébert, is so vague as to the
intent of Rousseau and Asselin that the Court cannot definitely conclude that
there was an agreement between Rousseau and Asselin to attempt to obstruct the
course of justice by ensuring that Hébert and Cyr would only be charged with
the theft of cigarettes.

 

Count 3: Extortion

 

8.                The Court of Appeal disposed of the
third count by saying

 

[TRANSLATION]  The fact
that someone asks another person for a sum of money for committing an unlawful
act which might be helpful to that other person does not constitute extortion
within the meaning of section 305(1)  Cr.C .

 

and that

 

[TRANSLATION]  . . . however
the approach made by respondent to A.D.T. Security System Inc. is described,
respondent did not attempt to induce this company to give him the sum of
$10,000 by threats, accusations, or violence.

 

9.                I concur with the Court of Appeal and
would dismiss the appeal of the Crown on this count without further comment. 

 

Count 2: Attempt to Obstruct Justice

 

10.              The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown's
appeal on the following ground:

 

[TRANSLATION]  . . . by
""ensuring in return for the sum of $6,000 that Michel Hébert and Laurent
Cyr would only be charged with the theft of cigarettes"", respondent did
not commit the offence specified in section 127(2)  Cr.C ., since respondent was
not responsible for deciding on the nature of the charges to be laid against
his clients. Respondent also could not be found guilty of the charge of
obstructing justice under sections 21  and 22  Cr.C ., as Asselin's accomplice,
since the evidence did not establish that Asselin in fact committed the
indictable offence of obstruction.

 

11.              I concur with the Court of Appeal that, in
order for Rousseau to commit the crime specified in s. 127(2) , it was not
sufficient for him to give an undertaking to his clients that they ""would
only be charged with the theft of cigarettes"". He had to perform some act
which would have amounted ""to attempting in any manner"" to obtain
this result for them. However, it was not necessary that Asselin in fact
attempted to obstruct justice. It sufficed that the suggestion be made to him
by Rousseau.

 

12.              The trial judge considered that the
accused's guilt was not established beyond a reasonable doubt. I have read the
evidence and I believe that he did not, in so concluding, commit an error of
law. Indeed, this is an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, covered by s.
605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , which limits the appeal to
grounds ""that involve [...] a question of law alone"". For the doubt
entertained by the judge to amount to an error of law it must be the result of
conjecture and have no basis whatever in the evidence. I have read the
evidence, and such is not the case. For reasons which I will expand upon when
considering the first count hereinafter, the trial judge had a reasonable doubt
as to Asselin's participation in the matter. Moreover, this is the only
possible explanation, in view of Rousseau's acquittal on the count of
conspiracy. For this reason, therefore, I would dismiss the appeal of the Crown
on count 2. 

 

Count 1: Conspiracy

 

13.              The Crown worded the indictment as
follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Between
October 1, 1979 and January 30, 1980, at Ste‑Foy and at Québec, district
of Québec, did conspire with Mr. Raymond Asselin to commit an indictable
offence not provided for in section 423 (a), (b) and (c) of the Criminal
Code , to wit: wilfully attempting to obstruct the course of justice, thereby
committing an indictable offence specified in section 423 (d) of the Criminal
Code .

 

14.              It should be noted that the accused's
clients are not mentioned as parties to the conspiracy. The Crown therefore had
to establish that Rousseau and the police officer Asselin had conspired
together.

 

15.              The trial judge said he had a reasonable
doubt as to the existence of such a conspiracy between Rousseau and Asselin. He
did not appear to be satisfied by the evidence of statements made by the lawyer
to his clients, asking them for $6,000 for himself and the police to ensure
that charges would not be laid for some of the thefts and that the sentence
would be light for the remainder. In view of police officer Asselin's
statements and actions, the trial judge also seems not to have been persuaded
beyond all reasonable doubt of the latter's participation in the conspiracy
between the lawyer and his clients, if one existed.

 

16.              The Court of Appeal was well aware, in
view of s. 605(1) (a), of the limits beyond which it could not substitute
its opinion for that of the trial judge and override the doubt entertained by
the Court as to the accused's guilt, quash his acquittal and find him guilty.
Writing for the Court, Beauregard J.A. felt that to consider any possibility
other than the existence of a conspiracy between the accused and Asselin was
purely conjectural. If he was right, there would have been an error of law and
the Court of Appeal would have been fully justified in reversing the trial
judgment. 

 

17.              With respect, I do not think he was
correct in this regard.

 

18.              It is clear, and there was no reason for
the trial judge to doubt this (and his observations tend to support this
interpretation, though one cannot be absolutely sure), that the lawyer Rousseau
suggested to his clients, as he did to the security company's lawyer, that he
could ""fix"" the matter. It is clear that Rousseau suggested to his
clients that he was conspiring with officer Asselin. I share the view of
Beauregard J.A. that only conjecture could support a doubt in that regard. The
question remains, however, whether there was a conspiracy between Rousseau and
the police officer Asselin; indeed, one must not loose sight of the fact that
Rousseau is not charged with conspiracy with his clients but with police
officer Asselin. Asselin's actions and statements tend to support the existence
of such a conspiracy, but I do not think it is possible to go beyond this
assertion and say that this was, beyond all reasonable doubt, the only logical
conclusion.

 

19.              The evidence could easily support
certainty as to the existence of a conspiracy between Rousseau and the police
officer, but its weight was not such that any doubt in this regard would
constitute an error of law. First, there was no direct evidence as to the
nature of the statements allegedly made by the lawyer to the police officer. At
best, it can only be inferred from the observations made by the officer to the
lawyer's clients and from his conduct in the matter. Furthermore, at the
conclusion of his judgment, Bilodeau J., who has considerable experience in the
practice of the criminal law and police operations, reveals his true thoughts
in the following observations:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
The Court has no doubt that Mr. Rousseau wished to take advantage of the
situation and of the circumstances to obtain money.

 

                    The
Crown is bound by the wording of the indictment.

 

                    The
circumstances are consistent with guilt, but I am not persuaded beyond all
doubt that they are inconsistent with any other logical solution. 

 

20.              In reading the evidence, one finds certain
references to the possible existence of a network of receivers, and others
suggesting that the police were to some extent ready to deal with the
""small fry"" in order to get to the ""big guys"". This is a
possibility which undoubtedly had some effect on Bilodeau J.'s belief as to the
criminality of the police officer's participation in the lawyer's scheme; it
explains his reference to the fact that the lawyer wished to ""obtain
money"" by defrauding his clients and to the constraints imposed on the
Crown by its choice of the charge. It is possible, and this is the possibility
which created a doubt in the mind of Bilodeau J., that Rousseau converted into
money for his own benefit and at the expense of his clients advantages which
the police were willing to offer in exchange, not for money, but for
information regarding the leaders of the network in the interests of the
administration of justice. This possibility may not be one which would have
created in the minds of all a doubt as to Asselin's illegal participation in a
conspiracy, but in view of the evidence as a whole I cannot say that to
entertain such a doubt constitutes an error of law.

 

21.              I would therefore allow the appeal of
Rousseau, quash the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the acquittal
entered by the trial judge; I would dismiss the appeal by the Crown.

 

                   Appeal by Rousseau allowed. Appeal by the Crown dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

program‑‑Vehicles randomly stopped in spot check program to detect
impaired drivers and deter impaired driving‑‑Exercise of police
power must be authorized by statute or at common law‑‑No statutory
authority for random stop‑‑Random stop for purpose of R.I.D.E.

                   Criminal law‑‑Roadside breathalyser

stopped in spot check program to detect impaired drivers‑‑Random
stop of motor vehicle authorized at common law‑‑No reasonable excuse
for non‑compliance with the demand for a breath sample‑‑Criminal
Code , s. 234.1(1) , (2) .

 

                   Appellant voluntarily complied with a police
officer's request to stop his vehicle. There was nothing improper about his
driving or the condition of his car. The stop was ordered as part of a spot
check program, known as R.I.D.E., whose principal aim is to detect, deter and
reduce impaired driving. The police go to a location where they believe there
has been a high incidence of impaired driving and, on a random basis, request
motorists to pull over and stop. They then ask for a valid driver's licence and
proof of insurance to initiate conversation with the goal of detecting the
otherwise undetectable drinking driver.

 

                   The officer, while checking appellant's licence,
smelled a strong odour of alcohol on his breath and made a demand pursuant to
s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  that he supply breath samples for analysis
in a roadside screening device. Appellant, despite repeated attempts, failed to
provide a sample of his breath sufficient to give a proper reading on the
device. He was charged with failing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with
a demand to supply a breath sample, pursuant to s.  234.1(2) of the Code.
Appellant's acquittal before the Provincial Court judge was confirmed by the
Ontario Supreme Court but set aside by the Court of Appeal. This appeal is to
determine whether, in the circumstances, the police officer possessed
authority, either statutory or at common law, to require the appellant to stop
his motor vehicle; and if not, whether appellant could be convicted of failing
or refusing, without lawful excuse, to provide a breath sample.

 

                   Held (Dickson C.J. and
Beetz and Chouinard JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per McIntyre, Lamer,
Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: The random stop by police of appellant's vehicle was
lawful at common law and the appellant accordingly had no reasonable excuse for
his non‑compliance with the demand for a breath sample.

 

                   Police officers, when acting or purporting to act in
their official capacity as agents of the state, only act lawfully if they act
in the exercise of authority either conferred by statute or derived from their
duties at common law. The ambit of police authority, as distinct from police
liability, is not to be determined by the limits of a police officer's criminal
or civil responsibility.

 

                   The appellant's compliance with the signal to stop
cannot alter the legal basis which must exist to justify the random stop.
Having regard to the coercive nature of police action and uncertainty over the
extent of police powers, compliance with a request to stop at a roadside check
point cannot be regarded as voluntary in any meaningful sense.

 

                   No statutory authority for the signal to stop may be
found in either the Criminal Code  or the relevant provisions of the
Ontario Highway Traffic Act.

 

                   Common law authority for the random vehicle stops,
for the purpose contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program, may be derived from the
general duties of police officers on the basis of the test laid down in R.
v. Waterfield, [1963] 3 All E.R. 659. The right to circulate in a motor
vehicle on the public highway may be described as a liberty; however, when
assessing the interference caused by a random vehicle stop, it cannot be
regarded as a fundamental liberty like an individual's right of movement, since
it is a licensed activity subject to regulation and control for the protection
of life and property.

 

                   Applying the Waterfield test, the random
vehicle stop was a prima facie unlawful interference with liberty since
it was not authorized by statute. The random stop does fall within the general
scope of police duties to prevent crime and to protect life and property by the
control of traffic as these are the very objects of the R.I.D.E. program, a
measure intended to improve the deterrence and detection of impaired driving.

 

                   The random vehicle stop was not an unjustifiable use
of police power because it was both necessary to the execution of police duty
and reasonable, having regard to the nature of the liberty interfered with and
the importance of the public purpose served by the interference. Random stops
for the R.I.D.E. program do not unreasonably interfere with the right to
circulate on the highway because of the importance of deterring impaired
driving, the necessity of random stops to effective detection, the fact that
driving is already subject to regulation and control in the interests of safety
and the minor inconvenience experienced by innocent motorists.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Beetz and Chouinard JJ., dissenting: The police only act lawfully when
they exercise authority conferred upon them by statute or at common law. Having
regard to the authoritative and coercive character of police requests,
submission to a police officer's exercise of apparent authority, such as a
demand to stop at a roadblock, cannot be characterized as voluntary, unless it
was clear to the person at the time that he or she was free to refuse to
comply.

 

                   It has always been a fundamental tenet of the rule
of law that the police, in carrying out their general duties as law enforcement
officers have limited powers and are only entitled to interfere with the
liberty or property of the citizen to the extent authorized by law. It is
necessary to distinguish the duties of police officers from the power, or
lawful authority, they possess to execute those duties. The fact that a police
officer has a general duty to prevent crime and protect life and property does
not mean that he or she can use any or all means for achieving these ends.

 

                   In the criminal law, the rules and principles
relating to arrest establish justifiable limits upon a citizen's liberty. Short
of arrest, the police have never possessed legal authority at common law to
detain any one against his or her will for questioning or to pursue an
investigation. Under the R.I.D.E. program, the police are stopping and
detaining motorists arbitrarily to investigate whether or not they might be
committing a criminal offence. These random stops by the police under the
R.I.D.E. program are indistinguishable from detention for questioning or
investigation and, without validly enacted legislation to support them, are
unlawful. It would be contrary to the long standing protection accorded
individual liberty by the common law and detrimental to the individual's
fundamental right to be free from arbitrary interference to conclude that this
action of the police was authorized and lawful. It is the function of the
legislature, not of the courts, to authorize arbitrary police action that would
otherwise be unlawful as a violation of rights traditionally protected at
common law.

 

                   Since the police officer randomly stopped the
appellant and arbitrarily detained him, he was not acting lawfully at the time
of the demand under s. 234.1(1)  and it was not lawfully made. Accordingly, the
s.  234.1(1)  demand was invalid and the appellant cannot be convicted of
failing or refusing without reasonable excuse to comply with a demand for a
breath sample contrary to s. 234.1(2) .

JJ. were delivered by

 

1.                The
Chief Justice (dissenting)‑‑This appeal arises out of
a random stop of a motorist by the police as part of the program in Ontario to
reduce impaired driving known as R.I.D.E. (Reduce Impaired Driving Everywhere).
It raises important questions concerning police powers and the appropriate
balance between the interest of the community in law enforcement and the
interest of the individual in being free from arbitrary interference with his
or her liberty.

 

I. Facts and Procedural History

 

2.                The aim of the R.I.D.E. program in
Ontario is to reduce impaired driving by detecting the impaired motorist and
deterring others from driving after drinking. The police go to a location where
they believe there has been a high incidence of impaired driving or alcohol
related accidents. Motorists passing through this location are requested, on a
random basis, to pull over and stop. Police officers ask the driver for a valid
driver's licence and proof of insurance and they note the condition of the
vehicle and the driver. The demand for a licence and proof of insurance is made
for the purpose of initiating conversation with the ultimate goal of allowing
the police to detect the drinking driver whom they might otherwise be unable to
detect. R.I.D.E. officers are equipped with approved road‑side screening
devices to permit them to make demands for breath samples, pursuant to s. 234.1 
of the Criminal Code , if they form the requisite grounds during their
conversation with the driver.

 

3.                The appellant was signalled to stop by a
police officer participating in the R.I.D.E. program on February 4, 1980. The
only reason he was requested by the police to stop was the R.I.D.E. program.
There was nothing improper about his driving or the condition of his car. The
police did not have reasonable and probable grounds for believing he had
committed or was committing a criminal offence under any statute, either
provincial or federal. The officer did not, at the time of the stop, have any
reasonable suspicion that the appellant had alcohol in his body.

 

4.                The appellant complied with the request
to stop his vehicle. During conversation, the police officer formed a
reasonable suspicion that the appellant was driving with alcohol in his body
and demanded that he provide a sample of his breath. The appellant, following
instruction and despite repeated attempts, failed to furnish a sample of his
breath sufficient to give a proper reading on the A.L.E.R.T. (Alcohol Level
Evaluation Roadside Tester) device. An appearance notice was issued on a charge
of failing or refusing to comply with a road‑side demand contrary to s.
234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code  and the appellant departed.

 

5.                The appellant was acquitted at trial
before Provincial Court Judge Charles: (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 98, 118 D.L.R.
(3d) 427, 30 O.R. (2d) 557, 15 C.R. (3d) 261, 6 M.V.R. 233. An appeal by stated
case was dismissed by Maloney J. of the Ontario Supreme Court: (1980), 55
C.C.C. (2d) 97, 118 D.L.R. (3d) 425, 30 O.R. (2d) 555, 23 C.R. (3d) 203, 8
M.V.R. 142. A Crown appeal to a five‑member panel of the Ontario Court of
Appeal was unanimously allowed: (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 97, 122 D.L.R. (3d) 655,
32 O.R. (2d) 641, 23 C.R. (3d) 228, 10 M.V.R. 59. The Court ordered that the
case be remitted to the trial judge for consideration of the question whether
the appellant's seeming attempts to comply with the demand were genuine or
feigned.

 

6.                The appellant was granted leave to
appeal to this Court.

 

II. Issues

 

7.                This appeal raises two issues:

 

1) whether, in the
circumstances, the police officer possessed statutory or common law authority
to require the appellant to stop his motor vehicle;

 

2) if not, whether the
appellant may be convicted of failing or refusing, without lawful excuse, to
provide a sample of his breath.

 

8.                I have had the opportunity of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared by Le Dain J. and I agree with him, for the
reasons he has given, that police officers only act lawfully when they exercise
authority conferred upon them by statute or at common law. The apparent
voluntary compliance by a citizen with a police request to stop a motor vehicle
cannot alter the legal basis which must justify such police action when it is
challenged in later proceedings.

 

9.                Having regard to the authoritative and
coercive character of police requests, submission to a police officer's
exercise of apparent authority, such as a demand to stop at a roadblock, cannot
be characterized as voluntary or consensual unless it was clear to the person
at the time that he was free to refuse to comply.

 

III. Lawfulness of Random Vehicle Stops

 

A. Statutory Authority

 

10.              The R.I.D.E. program was not, at the time
the appellant was stopped, expressly authorized by statute, either federal or
provincial. I agree with Le Dain J. that none of the provincial statutory
provisions relied upon can be interpreted to grant police officers authority to
request a motorist stop for the purposes of the R.I.D.E. program. In
particular, s. 14 of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 202, as
amended by 1979 (Ont.), c. 57, s. 2 (now R.S.O. 1980, c. 198), does
not provide statutory authority for the signal to stop. It is unnecessary to
express any opinion as to the constitutional validity of s. 14. Section 14 is
not being applied to confer authority to make a random vehicle stop for the
purpose contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program. The constitutional question set
in this case need not therefore be answered.

 

B. Common Law Authority


 

11.              With respect, I am unable to agree with Le
Dain J. that the general duties of police officers provide the foundation for
common law authority to stop a motor vehicle for the purpose and in the manner
contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program.

 

12.              It has always been a fundamental tenet of
the rule of law in this country that the police, in carrying out their general
duties as law enforcement officers of the state, have limited powers and are
only entitled to interfere with the liberty or property of the citizen to the
extent authorized by law. Laskin C.J. dissenting, in R. v. Biron, [1976]
2 S.C.R. 56, made the point at pp. 64‑65:

 

Far more important,
however, is the social and legal, and indeed, political, principle upon which
our criminal law is based, namely, the right of an individual to be left alone,
to be free of private or public restraint, save as the law provides otherwise.
Only to the extent to which it so provides can a person be detained or his
freedom of movement arrested.

 

Absent explicit or implied statutory authority, the police must be able
to find authority for their actions at common law. Otherwise they act
unlawfully.

 

13.              Martin J.A., in the case at bar,
accurately summarized the rights of the citizen and the power of the police as
follows:

 

                   In
carrying out their general duties, the police have limited powers, and they are
entitled to interfere with the liberty and property of the citizen only where
such interference is authorized by law. It is, of course, a constitutional
principle that the citizen has a right not to be subjected to imprisonment,
arrest, or physical restraint that is not justified by law, and every invasion
of the property of the citizen is a trespass unless legally justified.... On
the other hand, when a police officer is trying to discover whether, or by
whom, an offence has been committed, he is entitled to question any person,
whether suspected or not, from whom he thinks useful information may be
obtained. Although a police officer is entitled to question any person in order
to obtain information with respect to a suspected offence, he has no lawful
power to compel the person questioned to answer. Moreover, a police officer has
no right to detain a person for questioning or for further investigation. No
one is entitled to impose any physical restraint upon the citizen except as
authorized by law, and this principle applies as much to police officers as to
anyone else. Although a police officer may approach a person on the street and
ask him questions, if the person refuses to answer the police officer must
allow him to proceed on his way, unless, of course, the officer arrests him on
a specific charge or arrests him pursuant to s. 450 of the Code where
the officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that he is about to
commit an indictable offence. [Authorities omitted.]

 

14.              The common law duties of police have been
described as the preservation of the peace, the prevention of crime and the
protection of life and property; from this latter duty flows the duty to
control traffic on the public roads. A statutory statement of the traditional
common law duties of the police may be found in s. 57 of the Police Act,
R.S.O. 1980, c. 381.

 

15.              I do not think it is open to question that
action to detect and prevent people from driving while impaired by alcohol, an
offence under the Criminal Code , falls within the general duties of the
police described above. It is, however, necessary to distinguish the duties of
police officers from the power, or lawful authority, they possess to execute
those duties. The fact that a police officer has a general duty to prevent
crime and protect life and property does not mean that he or she can use any or
all means for achieving these ends. The question raised by this appeal is
whether the police have the power at common law, in other words the lawful
authority, to execute their general duties by means of random stops of
motorists when they have no reason to believe, prior to the stop, that the
motorist has committed, is committing or will commit a criminal offence. In my
opinion, they possess no such authority.

 

16.              The distinction between the scope of a
police officer's duties and the ambit of his or her power is well stated by L.
H. Leigh, Police Powers in England and Wales (1975), at p. 29:

 

                   The
police have long functioned under a regime of wide duties but limited powers.
That is to say, that while they are under general duties to prevent crime, and
breaches of the peace and to detect criminals, they do not have all those
powers which, it might be thought, would be reasonably necessary for them to do
so. Historically, there is no warrant for an ancillary powers doctrine of this
sort. Police interferences with individual liberty must, if they are to be
valid, be founded upon some rule of positive law.

 

17.              In the criminal law, the rules and
principles relating to arrest establish justifiable limits upon a citizen's
liberty. The basic powers of a private citizen or a police officer to arrest
without warrant are found in ss. 449  and 450  of the Criminal Code .
Additional powers of arrest without warrant also exist under various federal
and provincial statutes in relation to specific offences. See, R. E. Salhany, Canadian
Criminal Procedure (3rd ed. 1978), at p. 31.

 

18.              At common law, police possessed authority
to arrest without warrant (a) where they reasonably suspected (i) a felony had
been committed and (ii) the party to be arrested was guilty of the felony or
(b) to prevent the commission of a felony. Samuel v. Payne (1780), 1
Doug K.B. 359, 99 E.R. 230; Christie v. Leachinsky, [1947] A.C. 573
(H.L.); Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law (1965), at pp. 278‑79;
Butler and Garsia, Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice
(36th ed. 1966), at paragraph 2808.

 

19.              Short of arrest, the police have never
possessed legal authority at common law to detain anyone against his or her
will for questioning, or to pursue an investigation. Moore v. The Queen,
[1979] 1 S.C.R. 195, at p. 203; Albert v. Lavin, [1981] 3 All E.R. 878
(H.L.); Rice v. Connolly, [1966] 2 Q.B. 414 (C.A.), at p. 419; Leigh, supra,
at p. 29; Devlin, The Criminal Prosecution in England (1958), at p. 82;
Honsberger, ""The Power of Arrest and the Duties and Rights of Citizens and
the Police,"" [1963] L.S.U.C. Special Lectures: Arrest and Interrogation
1; Cohen, ""The Investigation of Offences and Police Powers"" (1981),
13 Ottawa L. Rev. 549; Lanham, ""Arrest, Detention and
Compulsion,"" [1974] Crim. L.R. 288, at p. 289; Bailey and
Birch, ""Recent Developments in the Law of Police Powers,"" [1982] Crim.
L.R. 475, at p. 481.

 

20.              R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3 All E.R.
659 (C.C.A.), is often relied upon as enunciating the test for the common law
basis of police power. The English Court of Appeal stated at p. 661:

 

                   In the
judgment of this court it would be difficult, and in the present case it is
unnecessary, to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the
duties of police constables have been expressed. In most cases it is probably
more convenient to consider what the police constable was actually doing and in
particular whether such conduct was prima facie an unlawful interference with a
person's liberty or property. If so, it is then relevant to consider whether
(a) such conduct falls within the general scope of any duty imposed by statute
or recognised at common law and (b) whether such conduct, albeit within the
general scope of such a duty, involved an unjustifiable use of powers
associated with the duty. Thus, while it is no doubt right to say in general
terms that police constables have a duty to prevent crime and a duty, when
crime is committed, to bring the offender to justice, it is also clear from the
decided cases that when the execution of these general duties involves
interference with the person or property of a private person, the powers of
constables are not unlimited.

 

21.              Waterfield has been applied by this
Court in R. v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631, and Knowlton v. The Queen,
[1974] S.C.R. 443, and in two English cases of note, Hoffman v. Thomas,
[1974] 2 All E.R. 233 (Q.B.D.), and Johnson v. Phillips, [1975] 3 All
E.R. 682 (Q.B.D.) 

 

22.              I had occasion to review the Waterfield,
Stenning and Knowlton cases recently in my dissenting reasons in
the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697. As I noted, at p. 717, these
cases all involved charges of assaulting or obstructing a police officer in the
execution of his duty. Charges were laid as a result of altercations with the
police and the defence was raised that the police were not acting in the
execution of their duty at the time.

 

23.              In the Wiretap Reference it was
argued, in reliance upon Waterfield, that the common law recognizes
certain powers inherent in the execution of a police officer's duty and that
these powers would, in the circumstances, permit the police to engage in acts
necessary to the fulfilment of their duty even though they involved an
otherwise unlawful interference with a person's liberty or property. After
noting that the police have never been entitled to exercise a general right of
entry as part of the powers accorded them at common law, I stated, in
dissenting reasons, that Waterfield does not stand for the proposition
that the power of entry to private property for the purpose of installing a
listening device can arise simply by virtue of a police officer's general duty
to detect crime and enforce the law.

 

24.              I concluded that the Waterfield
test provides no support for police conduct, where the conduct is unlawful at
common law (at pp. 718‑19):

 

I cannot accept that
conduct of itself unlawful and initiated with full knowledge of its potential
illegality could ever fall within the general scope of a policeman's duty.

 

                                                                    ...


 

                   The
fact that police officers could be described as acting within the general scope
of their duties to investigate crime cannot empower them to violate the law
whenever such conduct could be justified by the public interest in law
enforcement. Any such principle would be nothing short of a fiat for
illegality on the part of the police whenever the benefit of police action
appeared to outweigh the infringement of an individual's rights. For the Waterfield
principle to apply, the police must be engaged in the lawful execution of their
duty at the time of the conduct in question.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

25.              A police officer is not empowered to
execute his or her duty by unlawful means. The public interest in law
enforcement cannot be allowed to override the fundamental principle that all
public officials, including the police, are subject to the rule of law. To find
that arbitrary police action is justified simply because it is directed at the
fulfilment of police duties would be to sanction a dangerous exception to the
supremacy of law. It is the function of the legislature, not the courts, to
authorize arbitrary police action that would otherwise be unlawful as a
violation of rights traditionally protected at common law.

 

26.              Since police lack legal authority to
detain a person for questioning or for purposes of investigation at common law,
even on suspicion, short of arrest, I am unable to find any basis for the power
to stop and detain a motorist asserted in the circumstances of this case.

 

27.              It is vital to characterize correctly the
powers the police have exercised here and not allow them to be obscured by the
desirable objective the R.I.D.E. program is designed to attain. The police are
stopping motorists on an entirely arbitrary basis to question them and
determine if they have been drinking. As Professor Cohen notes in ""The
Investigation of Offences and Police Powers"", supra, at p. 562,
note 47: ""The exercise is no less random because it requires the procedure
to be carried out in specific locations noted for alcohol‑related
accidents or frequent impaired driving. It is random insofar as it relates to
each stopped motorist.""

 

28.              As stated above, the police had no grounds
to reasonably suspect that the appellant had committed, was committing or was
about to commit a criminal offence before he was requested to stop. Indeed, the
police did not observe anything suspicious or improper about the appellant's
driving or the condition of his car. The only reason for the random stop of the
appellant was the fact that he happened to be passing through a location where
the police believed there was a high incidence of drinking and driving. It is
inescapable that, in essence, the police stopped and detained the appellant
arbitrarily to investigate whether he might be committing a criminal offence.

 

29.              In my opinion, the police were not
authorized to stop the appellant at random for the purposes of the R.I.D.E.
program. A random stop of a motorist is indistinguishable from detention for
questioning or investigation against a person's will, something the courts have
long recognized that police lack the power to do at common law. The vice is
increased and the invasion of individual autonomy magnified when the individual
is detained, not under any suspicion directed at the driver personally, but on
the simple chance of where he or she happens to be driving. To conclude that
this action of the police was authorized would run contrary to the long‑standing
protection accorded individual liberty by the common law and erode the
individual's fundamental right to be free from arbitrary interference.

 

30.              With respect, the majority of the Court
departs firm ground for a slippery slope when they authorize an otherwise
unlawful interference with individual liberty by the police, solely on the
basis that it is reasonably necessary to carry out general police duties. The
objection to a random stop made without any grounds for suspicion or belief
that the particular driver has committed or is committing an offence goes far
beyond the unpleasant psychological effects produced for the innocent driver.
Even if these would tend to be minimized by the well‑publicized nature of
the R.I.D.E. program, the erosion of individual liberty with its ultimately
detrimental effect on the freedom of all members of society would remain.

 

31.              Furthermore, the fact that driving a motor
vehicle is a licensed activity subject to regulation and control in the
interests of safety is irrelevant to police power if the conditions for
licensing have been met and are adhered to; the curtailment of liberty by the
police in no way flows from the fact of licensing or any other regulation. The
right to circulate on the highway is not limited to freedom from unreasonable
interference by the police; it exists unfettered except in so far as it is
curtailed by law.

 

32.              The conclusion that random stops by police
under the R.I.D.E. program are illegal at common law is supported by academic
comment on the point. Professor Cohen in ""The Investigation of Offences
and Police Powers"", supra, has stated at p. 562:

 

                   In
theory, then, the police have no general power which permits them to stop and
detain individuals at random, whether such action be for the purpose of
conducting a search, proceeding with an interrogation, or compelling citizens
to identify themselves. The exercise of the power must pertain to a specific
investigation and be based upon reasonable grounds, or it must be expressly and
specifically authorized by legislation. These constraints are the mechanism
whereby the state ensures that official action will not be arbitrary.

 

                   Viewed
in this fashion, an administrative scheme to validate random discretionary
intrusions upon individual liberty such as those ""authorized"" under
Ontario's R.I.D.E. programme cannot be characterized as other than arbitrary.
No legislation expressly conferred a power upon police officers to stop motor
vehicles at random in order to search out intoxicated motorists. A laudable
social purpose is not enough to clothe the exercise with legality.

 

See also Humphrey, ""Abuse of Their Powers by the Police,""
[1979] L.S.U.C. Special Lectures: Abuse of Power 557; Honsberger,
""The Power of Arrest and the Duties and Rights of Citizens and the
Police,"" supra, at p. 25.

 

33.              It follows from what I have said that the
appellant, when requested to stop his motor vehicle by a signal from the police
officer, was under no duty to stop and submit to investigation: see Moore v.
The Queen, supra, Rice v. Connolly, supra, and Hoffman
v. Thomas, supra. The absence of a duty to stop turns upon the fact
that, in the circumstances of this case, the police lacked lawful authority,
either statutory or common law, for the request to stop.

 

34.              It would be a mistake, however, to interpret
this opinion as suggesting that motorists or other members of the public are
free to disregard the directions of police officers. As Maloney J. noted, there
are innumerable valid reasons, perhaps unapparent at the time, for which the
police may quite properly stop a motor vehicle or a person, both under statute
and at common law. Even where a member of the public questions the authority of
the police, it will generally be in the interests of public order and all
concerned that he or she obey the police command. Any doubt which remains may
be resolved in later proceedings, if necessary. Society as a whole bears
responsibility for the maintenance of law and order; co‑operation between
the public and the police is essential to the effective fulfilment of the
already difficult tasks performed by the police.

 

35.              I conclude that, without validly enacted
legislation to support them, the random stops by the police under the R.I.D.E.
program are unlawful. In striving to achieve one desirable objective, the
reduction of the death and injury that occurs each year from impaired driving,
we must ensure that other, equally important, social values are not sacrificed.
Individual freedom from interference by the state, no matter how laudable the motive
of the police, must be guarded zealously against intrusion. Ultimately, this
freedom is the measure of everyone's liberty and one of the corner‑stones
of the quality of life in our democratic society.

 

IV. The Charge Under Section 234.1(2)

 

36.              Since, in my view, the random vehicle stop
was unlawful for lack of statutory or common law authority, it is necessary to
consider whether the appellant may nonetheless be convicted of the offence
under s. 234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code  with which he was charged.
Subsections 234.1(1)  and (2)  read:

 

                   234.1 (1) Where a peace officer reasonably suspects that a person who is
driving a motor vehicle or who has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, has alcohol in his body, he may, by demand made
to that person, require him to provide forthwith such a sample of his breath as
in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis of
his breath to be made by means of an approved roadside screening device and,
where necessary, to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling
such a sample of his breath to be taken.

 

                   (2)
Every one who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a
demand made to him by a peace officer under subsection (1) is guilty of an
indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

 

(a) for a first
offence, to a fine of not more than two thousand dollars and not less than
fifty dollars or to imprisonment for six months or to both;

 

(b) for a second
offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than fourteen days;
and

 

(c) for each
subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than two years and not less
than three months.

 

37.              On appeal to the Ontario Supreme Court,
Maloney J. held that the random stop was unlawful. In his opinion, this gave
the appellant a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the
s. 234.1(2)  demand. His conclusion, reached after reviewing the relevant
authorities, including Brownridge v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 926, Rilling
v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.R.C. 183, and Taraschuk v. The Queen,
[1977] 1 S.R.C. 385, is best expressed in his own words:

 

                   After
anxious consideration I hold that in the circumstances of this case, in which
the police officer made a wholly arbitrary and random stop as part of the
R.I.D.E. programme, there exists a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with
the demand made under s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code . The best of
intentions on the part of the police cannot authorize an act which is not
otherwise permitted in law. I have found that the stop involved an unjustified
interference with the personal liberty of the accused. The police officer was
acting in excess of his powers and was not acting in the execution of his duty
when he required the accused to stop his motor vehicle. A refusal to conclude
that such circumstances afford a reasonable excuse within the meaning of s.
234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code  would rob these findings of any legal
significance and would result in mere lip service being paid to the right of a
law abiding citizen who is above reproach to peacefully go about his own
affairs free from being stopped, questioned and interfered with by the police
for no apparent reason.

 

38.              In the Ontario Court of Appeal, Martin
J.A. dealt briefly with the charge under s. 234.1(2) . He held that the demand
to provide a breath sample was validly made and therefore the appellant had no
reasonable excuse for failure to comply. This conclusion followed from his
earlier conclusion that the police officer, in enforcing the R.I.D.E. program,
was lawfully carrying out his general duties because the appellant had stopped
voluntarily.

 

39.              The appellant argues that, absent
statutory and common law authority to stop motor vehicles at random, a motorist
who has been stopped at a random spot check has, in law, a reasonable excuse
for failing or refusing to supply a sample of his breath within the meaning of
s. 234.1(2) . The appellant's submission is that the police officer lacked
reasonable and probable cause to make a demand for a sample of breath and this
constituted a reasonable excuse.

 

40.              The respondent replies that, even absent
statutory or common law authority for the random stop, the appellant may still
be found guilty for failing or refusing to comply with the s. 234.1(2)  demand.
In particular, the Crown submits that the appellant had no reasonable excuse
for failing or refusing to comply with the demand. While the stop may have been
random, the demand was not. Section 234.1(1)  speaks of a reasonable suspicion
of alcohol in the body, not reasonable and probable cause for the demand. The relevant
facts are that as a result of smelling alcohol on the accused's breath, the
officer formed a reasonable suspicion that the accused, who was then driving or
in care or control of his motor vehicle, had alcohol in his body. Furthermore,
the respondent urges, there is no requirement, as there is in the English road
traffic legislation, that the suspicion of alcohol in the body exist prior to
the vehicle being stopped, bearing in mind the wording of s. 234.1(1) :
""whether it [the motor vehicle] is in motion or not"".

 

41.              In my opinion, this case is
indistinguishable in principle from the cogent and persuasive decision of the
House of Lords in Morris v. Beardmore, [1980] 2 All E.R. 753, and should
be resolved in the same manner. The Law Lords concluded that the police officer
was not acting lawfully when he required Beardmore to undergo the breath test,
since the Road Traffic Act 1972 (U.K.), which empowered the police
officer to request the sample, did not expressly empower him to trespass to
make the demand. Thus, the requirement to provide a sample of breath had not
been lawfully made and was invalid. As a result, Beardmore could not be
convicted of refusal. See page 756 per Lord Diplock; pp. 759‑60 per
Lord Edmund‑Davies.

 

42.              In the case at bar, the random stop was
not authorized by statute, either federal or provincial. I have already given
my reasons for concluding it was equally unauthorized at common law and that
the police officer could not have been acting in the lawful execution of his
duty. While I have not considered whether the conduct of a police officer who
detains a motorist under the R.I.D.E. could be characterized as tortious, as
the conduct of the police was considered to be in Morris v. Beardmore,
it was nonetheless unlawful, due to the absence of legal authority.

 

43.              In my opinion, applying the reasoning of
the House of Lords in Morris v. Beardmore, the demand for a sample of
breath was not lawfully made because the police officer, having randomly
stopped the appellant and arbitrarily detained him, was not acting lawfully at
the time of the demand. Accordingly, the demand under s. 234.1(1)  was invalid
and the appellant cannot be convicted of failing or refusing, without
reasonable excuse, to comply with a demand for a sample of breath contrary to
s. 234.1(2) .

 

44.              It is not necessary to examine the
question of reasonable excuse under s. 234.1(2)  or the authorities on the point
in this Court: see Brownridge v. The Queen, supra; Rilling v.
The Queen, supra; and Taraschuk v. The Queen, supra.
The demand in the present case was unlawful and invalid. The most fundamental
condition for the section's operation, namely, that the police officer be
acting lawfully in the execution of his duty at the time of the demand, is
absent and the appellant need not adduce any excuse for failing to comply. See Morris
v. Beardmore, supra, at p. 764 per Lord Scarman; also Lord
Edmund‑Davies at p. 761 and Lord Roskill at pp. 766‑67.

 

45.              The charge under s. 234.1(2)  should be
dismissed.

 

V. Conclusion

 

46.              I would allow the appeal and restore the
appellant's acquittal. The appellant should have his costs in the Ontario
Supreme Court, as ordered by Maloney J., on a solicitor and client basis. He
should also have his costs in the Ontario Court of Appeal and in this Court on
both the application for leave to appeal and on the appeal.

 

                   The judgment of McIntyre, Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain
JJ. was delivered by 

 

47.              Le
Dain J.‑‑This appeal raises the following questions:

 

1.                Whether the random stop by a police officer of
the appellant's motor vehicle, as part of a program to reduce impaired driving,
was unlawful as having been made without statutory or common law authority,
despite the appellant's compliance with the signal to stop, and

 

2.                If so, whether the unlawful character of the
stop required the dismissal of the charge that the appellant failed or refused,
without reasonable excuse, to comply with the demand, made after he stopped and
was engaged in conversation by the police officer, that he provide a sample of
breath into a roadside screening device, pursuant to s. 234.1(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

48.              The appeal is by leave of this Court from
the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal on May 19, 1981, 59 C.C.C. (2d) 97,
122 D.L.R. (3d) 655, 32 O.R. (2d) 641, 23 C.R. (3d) 228, 10 M.V.R. 59, allowing
an appeal from the judgment of Maloney J. on December 19, 1980, 55 C.C.C. (2d)
97, 118 D.L.R. (3d) 425, 30 O.R. (2d) 555, 23 C.R. (3d) 203, 8 M.V.R. 142,
which dismissed an appeal by way of stated case from the judgment of Provincial
Court Judge Charles on May 15, 1980, 55 C.C.C. (2d) 98, 118 D.L.R. (3d) 427, 30
O.R. (2d) 557, 15 C.R. (3d) 261, 6 M.V.R. 233, acquitting the appellant of the
charge of failing or refusing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a
demand to supply a sample of breath, contrary to s. 234.1(2)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

49.              Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 234.1  of the
Criminal Code  provide:

 

                   234.1 (1) Where a peace officer reasonably suspects that a person who is
driving a motor vehicle or who has the care or control of a motor vehicle,
whether it is in motion or not, has alcohol in his body, he may, by demand made
to that person, require him to provide forthwith such a sample of his breath as
in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis of
his breath to be made by means of an approved road‑side screening device
and, where necessary, to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of
enabling such a sample of his breath to be taken.

 

                   (2)
Every one who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a
demand made to him by a peace officer under subsection (1) is guilty of an
indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

 

(a) for a first
offence, to a fine of not more than two thousand dollars and not less than
fifty dollars or to imprisonment for six months or to both;

 

(b) for a second
offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than fourteen
days; and

 

(c) for each
subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than two years and not less
than three months.

 

                                                                     I

 

50.              On February 4, 1980 the appellant was
signalled by a police officer to stop his vehicle. The stop was ordered, not
because of the manner in which the appellant was driving or because of
reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body or reasonable and probable
grounds for believing that he had committed or was committing a criminal
offence, but as part of a random vehicle stop program referred to as
""R.I.D.E."" and described in the stated case as follows:

 

                   The
R.I.D.E. programme involves police officers going to a location where they
believe there has been a high incidence of impaired driving or alcohol‑related
accidents. Vehicles are requested to pull over on a random basis. Drivers are
asked to produce valid driver's licences. Police officers are also told to ask
for proof of insurance, note the condition of the vehicle and the driver.

 

                   R.I.D.E.
officers are equipped with approved road‑side screening devices to permit
them to make demands for breath pursuant to s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  if
they form the requisite grounds for a demand under that section. The device
used here was an A.L.E.R.T. device.

 

                   The
R.I.D.E. programme was started a few years ago in Etobicoke. R.I.D.E.
originally stood for Reduce Impaired Driving in Etobicoke. In the last year it
has been expanded across the Province of Ontario.

 

                   The
R.I.D.E. programme's principal aim is to detect, deter and reduce impaired
driving. Although police officers ask for valid driver's licences, they only do
so to initiate conversation or contact to detect the drinking driver that they
may not otherwise be able to detect.

 

                   On the
4th day of February, 1980, at 9:01 p.m., P.C. Feeney signalled the accused to
stop his vehicle. There was nothing improper about the accused's driving or his
vehicle. The only reason he was stopped was as part of the R.I.D.E. programme.

 

51.              What took place after the appellant was
signalled to stop his vehicle is indicated in the following findings of fact by
the Provincial Court judge, as set out in the stated case:

 

                   The
accused voluntarily complied with the request to stop his vehicle.

 

                   The
officer asked the accused for his driver's licence. While the two were
speaking, the officer smelled a strong odour of alcohol on the accused's
breath.

 

                   As the
result of smelling the alcohol on the accused's breath, the officer then formed
a reasonable suspicion that the accused, who was then driving or in care or
control of his motor vehicle, had alcohol in his body.

 

                   Prior
to smelling the alcohol on the breath while checking the licence, the officer
had no reason to suspect that the accused had alcohol in his body.

 

                   The
officer then made a properly worded demand for a sample of breath to be
provided for testing on the A.L.E.R.T. device.

 

                   The
officer, after having satisfied himself that the device was operating properly,
instructed the accused how he should blow air into the device.

 

                   The
accused made four attempts to blow into the device, all of which were
insufficient to give a proper reading of fail, pass or warn.

 

                   The
accused was then issued an appearance notice at the scene in regards to a
charge of failing or refusing to comply with a roadside demand pursuant to s.
234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code . The accused left the scene at 9:25 p.m.

 

                   Up
until the time of the alleged failure or refusal to comply with the roadside
demand, the officer had no reason to believe on reasonable and probable grounds
that the accused had committed, or was committing, an offence under any
statute, provincial or federal.

 

                   At no
time was the accused under arrest.

 

52.              The Provincial Court judge held that the
police officer had neither statutory nor common law authority to signal the
appellant to stop; that at the time he made the s. 234.1(1)  demand he did not
have the reasonable suspicion required by that provision since he had acquired
the suspicion as a result of an unauthorized act; and that since the appellant
was not a person upon whom a s. 234.1(1)  demand could be made, the appellant's
failure to comply with the demand was not an offence.

 

53.              In the Supreme Court of Ontario, Maloney
J. also held that there was neither statutory nor common law authority for the
signal to stop, but the effect of this lack of authority, in his view, was to
give the appellant reasonable excuse for the failure or refusal to comply with
the demand for a sample of breath.

 

54.              In allowing the appeal from the judgment
of Maloney J. and setting aside the acquittal of the appellant, the Ontario
Court of Appeal, in a unanimous judgment delivered by Martin J.A., held that
the voluntary compliance of the appellant with the signal to stop made it
immaterial whether the officer was exercising a police power for which there
was statutory or common law authority, or was merely exercising a legal liberty‑‑that
is, doing something which he might do without any breach of law. The Court
concluded that in signalling the appellant to stop the police officer was not
committing a crime or a tort, and that since the officer had reasonable
suspicion at the time the s. 234.1(1)  demand was made that the appellant had
alcohol in his blood and had not placed himself in a position to make the
demand by the commission of a crime or a tort, the demand was valid.

 

                                                                    II

 

55.              The appeal therefore involves consideration
of the legal foundation of police action, where the issue is the effect of an
allegedly unlawful act on the validity of subsequent action and where there has
been compliance with the allegedly unlawful act.

 

56.              Martin J.A. appears to have taken the view
that it was unnecessary in this case to decide whether there was statutory or
common law authority for the signal to stop because that would only be relevant
if there was an issue as to whether a refusal to comply with the signal to stop
would have constituted the offence of wilful obstruction of a police officer in
the execution of his duty, contrary to s. 118  of the Criminal Code . He
did consider the submissions as to whether there was statutory or common law
authority for the signal to stop and did make certain observations on the
nature and legal foundation of police powers, but he relied in the end, as I
have indicated, on the view that because of the voluntary compliance of the
appellant with the signal to stop it was sufficient that the police officer was
exercising a legal liberty involving no breach of law in the sense that it was
neither criminal nor tortious.

 

57.              With respect to the distinction between a
police power and a legal liberty Martin J.A. said, with particular reference to
the leading case of R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.C.A.):

 

                   It is
important to correctly characterize what occurred here. The respondent was
signalled or requested to stop and he complied with the request. A distinction
must be made between a legal liberty, that is, something that a person may do
without breach of the law, and a legal right, which the law will enforce, to do
something or not to be prevented from doing something. In everyday speech the
word ""right"" is sometimes used to connote rights in the strict sense
as well as legal liberties: see Thorne v. Motor Trade Ass'n, [1937] A.C.
797 (H.L.) per Lord Wright at pp. 821‑3. The action of the police
officer here on the facts found by the stated case was neither criminal nor
tortious. Professor P.J. Fitzgerald, the distinguished editor of the 12th
edition of Salmond on Jurisprudence (1966), argues that it is not clear
that the actions of the police officers in R. v. Waterfield, supra,
were either criminal or tortious: (see ""The Arrest of a Motor‑Car""
by P.J. Fitzgerald, [1965] Crim.L.Rev. 23). He suggests that the police
officer had a legal liberty to stand in front of the appellant's car and signal
him to stop. The driver, Lynn, however, had a legal liberty to move forward. He
further suggests that the accused in R. v. Waterfield, supra, may
have been guilty of an assault in using excessive force in maintaining his
liberty to drive the car away. Whatever the true view may be, on the facts of
that case, manifestly it could not be said that if the police officers had
requested Waterfield to leave his car in order to permit them to examine it,
and Waterfield had complied with the request, that there had been an
unjustifiable exercise of police power. 

 

58.              With great respect, I do not think that
the issue of the lawfulness of the signal to stop in this case can be properly
disposed of by reliance on the notion of legal liberties which a police officer
as an individual enjoys in company with other citizens. For reasons which I
shall indicate, I do not think that the appellant's compliance with the signal
to stop altered the legal basis on which it must be justified. In my opinion,
police officers, when acting or purporting to act in their official capacity as
agents of the state, only act lawfully if they act in the exercise of authority
which is either conferred by statute or derived as a matter of common law from
their duties. The reason for this is the authoritative and coercive character
of police action. An individual knows that he or she may ignore with impunity
the signal to stop of another private individual. That is not true of a
direction or demand by a police officer. It is for this reason, in my opinion,
that the actions of police officers must find legal justification in statutory
or common law authority. The ambit of their authority, as distinct from their
liability, is not to be determined by the limits of criminal or civil
responsibility. Police action may be unlawful for lack of statutory or common
law authority although neither criminal nor tortious. The issue in the present
case may be likened to one of vires. The contention is that the
allegedly unauthorized and hence unlawful nature of the signal to stop affected
the validity of the subsequent demand for a sample of breath.

 

59.              This issue cannot be affected, in my
opinion, by the appellant's compliance with the signal to stop. A person should
not be prevented from invoking a lack of statutory or common law authority for
a police demand or direction by reason of compliance with it in the absence of
a clear indication from the police officer that the person is free to refuse to
comply. Because of the intimidating nature of police action and uncertainty as
to the extent of police powers, compliance in such circumstances cannot be
regarded as voluntary in any meaningful sense. The possible criminal liability
for failure to comply constitutes effective compulsion or coercion. It is,
moreover, in the interest of public order that a person should comply with the
signal to stop of a police officer. In some cases such a signal may be for the
protection of the individual, as, for example, to give a warning of some
danger. A person should not be penalized for compliance with a signal to stop
by having it treated as a waiver or renunciation of rights, or as supplying a
want of authority for the stop.

 

                                                                   III

 

60.              The statutory provision that was relied on
as a basis of authority for the signal to stop in this case is s. 14 of The
Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 202, which, as amended by 1979 (Ont.),
c. 57, s. 2, provides:

 

                   14. (1) Every operator of a motor vehicle shall carry his licence with him
at all times while he is in charge of a motor vehicle and shall surrender the
licence for reasonable inspection upon the demand of a constable or officer
appointed for carrying out the provisions of this Act.

 

                   (2)
Every person who is unable or refuses to surrender his licence in accordance
with subsection 1 shall, when requested by a constable, give reasonable
identification of himself and, for the purposes of this subsection, the correct
name and address of such person shall be deemed to be reasonable
identification.

 

61.              It should perhaps be noted that counsel
for the respondent conceded in this Court, as he apparently did in the Court of
Appeal, that he no longer relied, as a statutory basis for an implied power to
stop a motor vehicle for the purpose contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program, on
s. 86(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, which confers a power on a police
officer to direct traffic ""according to his discretion"" and imposes a
duty to obey such directions.

 

62.              Section 14 of the Ontario Highway
Traffic Act imposes a duty upon the driver of a motor vehicle to surrender
his or her licence for inspection upon demand. It was argued that there arises
by implication from the driver's duty a power in a police officer to stop a
motor vehicle for the purpose of inspecting a licence. I question whether such
a power can be derived as a matter of statutory construction from the duty of
the motorist. Implied powers are derived by implication from the powers
expressly conferred by statute on an authority. Section 27(b) of The
Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 225, provides: ""In every Act,
unless the contrary intention appears . . . where power is given to a person,
officer or functionary to do or to enforce the doing of an act or thing, all
such powers shall be understood to be also given as are necessary to enable the
person, officer or functionary to do or enforce the doing of the act or
thing"". This is a statutory embodiment of the rule stated in Halsbury’s
Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 36, para. 657: ""The powers conferred by
an enabling statute include not only such as are expressly granted but also, by
implication, all powers which are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment
of the object intended to be secured"". Section 14 of The Highway
Traffic Act does not purport to confer a power on a police officer but
rather imposes a duty on the individual driver. It may well be that such a duty
necessarily implies a power to demand surrender of a licence for inspection,
but whether such a power should extend by further implication to a power to
stop a motor vehicle for such purpose is in my opinion doubtful. It would
appear to involve an unusual extension of the rule of implied powers, as a
matter of statutory construction. Such a power might exist as a matter of
implication from the general nature of police duties, but that is a different
basis. That is what I understand by common law authority for the exercise of
police power. It may seem to come down to much the same thing in the end but
the rule of statutory construction must not be distorted because of its
application in a great variety of other statutory contexts. In any event, even
assuming for the purposes of analysis that a power to stop a motor vehicle in
order to demand surrender of a licence for inspection arises by implication
from the terms of s. 14 of The Highway Traffic Act, and need not be
grounded as a matter of common law on the general duties of police officers, it
is a power that must be exercised for the purpose indicated in s. 14. It cannot
be validly exercised for another purpose, using the purpose indicated in s. 14
as a subterfuge or pretext. In this case, it is clear from the findings of fact
as set out in the stated case that while the police officer asked the appellant
for his licence, the true purpose of the signal to stop was not to demand
surrender of the licence for inspection but rather to determine whether there
were grounds for a reasonable suspicion that the appellant had alcohol in his
blood. That is clear from the following findings of fact: ""Although police
officers ask for valid driver's licences, they only do so to initiate
conversation or contact to detect the drinking driver that they may not
otherwise be able to detect"" and ""The only reason he was stopped was
a part of the R.I.D.E. programme"". I am, therefore, of the opinion that s.
14 of The Highway Traffic Act did not provide statutory authority for
the signal to stop in the present case.

 

63.              In view of this conclusion, it is
unnecessary to express an opinion as to the constitutional validity of s. 14,
which counsel for the appellant contended would be put in issue if the section
were construed to confer authority to make a random vehicle stop for the
purpose contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program. It may be noted that s. 189a.‑‑(1)
of the Highway Traffic Act, as added by 1981 (Ont.), c. 72, s. 2,
confers express authority on a police officer to stop a motor vehicle in the
following terms: ""A police officer, in the lawful execution of his duties
and responsibilities, may require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop and the
driver of a motor vehicle, when signalled or requested to stop by a police
officer who is readily identifiable as such, shall immediately come to a safe
stop"".

 

                                                                   IV

 

64.              Reliance was also placed on the general
duties of police officers as the foundation for a common law authority to stop
a motor vehicle for the purpose contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program. A
statutory statement of these duties is found in s. 55 of The Police Act,
R.S.O. 1970, c. 351, which provides:

 

                   55. The members of police forces appointed under Part II, except
assistants and civilian employees, are charged with the duty of preserving the
peace, preventing robberies and other crimes and offences, including offences
against the by‑laws of the municipality, and apprehending offenders, and
laying informations before the proper tribunal, and prosecuting and aiding in
the prosecuting of offenders, and have generally all the powers and privileges
and are liable to all the duties and responsibilities that belong to
constables.

 

65.              It has been held that at common law the
principal duties of police officers are the preservation of the peace, the
prevention of crime, and the protection of life and property, from which is
derived the duty to control traffic on the public roads. See Rice v.
Connolly, [1966] 2 Q.B. 414, at p. 419; Johnson v. Phillips, [1975]
3 All E.R. 682, at p. 685; Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 30,
para. 206, p. 129.

 

66.              The common law basis of police power has
been derived from the nature and scope of police duty. Referring to the
""powers associated with the duty"", Ashworth J. in R. v. Waterfield,
supra, at pp. 661‑62, laid down the test for the existence of
police powers at common law, as a reflection of police duties, as follows:

 

                   In the
judgment of this court it would be difficult, and in the present case it is
unnecessary, to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the
duties of police constables have been expressed. In most cases it is probably
more convenient to consider what the police constable was actually doing and in
particular whether such conduct was prima facie an unlawful interference with a
person's liberty or property. If so, it is then relevant to consider whether
(a) such conduct falls within the general scope of any duty imposed by statute
or recognized at common law and (b) whether such conduct, albeit within the
general scope of such a duty, involved an unjustifiable use of powers
associated with the duty. Thus, while it is no doubt right to say in general
terms that police constables have a duty to prevent crime and a duty, when
crime is committed, to bring the offender to justice, it is also clear from the
decided cases that when the execution of these general duties involves
interference with the person or property of a private person, the powers of
constables are not unlimited. To cite only one example, in Davis v. Lisle
[1936] 2 All E.R. 213; [1936] 2 K.B. 434, it was held that even if a police
officer had a right to enter a garage to make inquiries, he became a trespasser
after the appellant had told him to leave the premises, and that he was not,
therefore, acting thenceforward in the execution of his duty, with the result
that the appellant could not be convicted of assaulting or obstructing him in
the execution of his duty.

 

67.              The test laid down in Waterfield,
while generally invoked in cases in which the issue is whether a police officer
was acting in the execution of his duties, has been recognized as being a test
for whether the officer had common law authority for what he did. In Hoffman
v. Thomas, [1974] 2 All E.R. 233, the issue was whether a police constable
had the power to direct a motorist to stop for the purpose of submitting to a
traffic census. The appellant was charged with refusal to comply with a
direction to stop given by a police constable in the execution of his duty.
Applying the Waterfield test, which he referred to as being of ""the
greatest assistance"", Lord Widgery C.J. affirmed that the power to control
traffic was a power to be exercised for the protection of life and property and
held that the traffic census could not be related to this purpose. The
direction did not therefore fall within the general scope of a police
constable's duties under the first branch of the Waterfield test.
Speaking in terms of police powers, Lord Widgery C.J. said at p. 238,
""Accordingly it seems to me that neither at common law, nor by any
statutory provisions to which we have been referred, had this police officer
any right to direct the appellant to leave the motorway and go into the census
area"", and he spoke of the direction as a ""signal which he had no
power to make either at common law or by virtue of statute"". The test laid
down in Waterfield was treated as authoritative and applied by this
Court in R. v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631, and in Knowlton v. The
Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 443, both cases in which the issue was whether a
police officer was in the execution of his duty. In Knowlton, Fauteux
C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court, said at p. 446, ""Police duty
and the use of powers associated with such duty are the sole matters in issue
in this appeal"", and he concluded at p. 448, ""I cannot find in the
record any evidence showing that Sergeant Grandish or other police officers
resorted, on the occasion, to any unjustifiable use of the powers associated
with the duty imposed upon them"". Leigh, Police Powers in England and
Wales (1975), p. 33, refers to the decision in Knowlton as
reflecting a movement towards ""an ancillary powers doctrine which would
enable the police to perform such reasonable acts as are necessary for the due
execution of their duties."" In the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 697, Dickson J. (as he then was), dissenting, considered the Waterfield
test under the heading ""The Common Law Powers of the Police"", which
he referred to as ""powers inherent in the execution of a police officer's
duty"".

 

68.              In applying the Waterfield test to
the random stop of a motor vehicle for the purpose contemplated by the R.I.D.E.
program, it is convenient to refer to the right to circulate in a motor vehicle
on the public highway as a ""liberty"". That is the way it was referred
to in Hoffman v. Thomas, supra, and in Johnson v. Phillips,
supra. In assessing the interference with this right by a random vehicle
stop, one must bear in mind, however, that the right is not a fundamental
liberty like the ordinary right of movement of the individual, but a licensed
activity that is subject to regulation and control for the protection of life
and property. Applying the Waterfield test, then, and using the word
""liberty"" in this qualified and special sense, it may be said that
the random vehicle stop in this case was prima facie an unlawful
interference with liberty since it was not authorized by statute. The first
question, then, under the Waterfield test is whether the random stop
fell within the general scope of the duties of a police officer under statute
or common law. I do not think there can be any doubt that it fell within the
general scope of the duties of a police officer to prevent crime and to protect
life and property by the control of traffic. These are the very objects of the
R.I.D.E. program, which is a measure to improve the deterrence and detection of
impaired driving, a notorious cause of injury and death.

 

69.              Turning to the second branch of the Waterfield
test, it must be said respectfully that neither Waterfield itself nor
most of the cases which have applied it throw much light on the criteria for
determining whether a particular interference with liberty is an unjustifiable
use of a power associated with a police duty. There is a suggestion of the
correct test, I think, in the use of the words ""reasonably necessary""
in Johnson v. Phillips, supra. The interference with liberty must
be necessary for the carrying out of the particular police duty and it must be
reasonable, having regard to the nature of the liberty interfered with and the
importance of the public purpose served by the interference. Because of the
seriousness of the problem of impaired driving, there can be no doubt about the
importance and necessity of a program to improve the deterrence of it. The
right to circulate on the highway free from unreasonable interference is an
important one, but it is, as I have said, a licensed activity subject to
regulation and control in the interest of safety. The objectionable nature of a
random stop is chiefly that it is made on a purely arbitrary basis, without any
grounds for suspicion or belief that the particular driver has committed or is
committing an offence. It is this aspect of the random stop that makes it
capable of producing unpleasant psychological effects for the innocent driver.
These effects, however, would tend to be minimized by the well‑publicized nature
of the program, which is a necessary feature of its deterrent purpose.
Moreover, the stop would be of relatively short duration and of slight
inconvenience. Weighing these factors, I am of the opinion that having regard
to the importance of the public purpose served, the random stop, as a police
action necessary to the carrying out of that purpose, was not an unreasonable
interference with the right to circulate on the public highway. It was not, therefore,
an unjustifiable use of a power associated with the police duty, within the Waterfield
test. I would accordingly hold that there was common law authority for the
random vehicle stop for the purpose contemplated by the R.I.D.E. program.

 

70.              In view of this conclusion it is
unnecessary for me to express an opinion as to whether, if the random vehicle
stop were unlawful for lack of statutory or common law authority, its unlawful
character would constitute a reasonable excuse, on the authority of the
decision of the majority of this Court in Brownridge v. The Queen,
[1972] S.C.R. 926, for the failure to comply with the s. 234.1(1)  demand for a
sample of breath, or would render such demand invalid, on the reasoning of the
House of Lords in Morris v. Beardmore, [1980] 2 All E.R. 753.

 

71.              I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.
The appellant should have his costs in this Court on both the application for
leave to appeal and on the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Care and control of
vehicle while impaired ‑‑ Accused sleeping in sleeping bag on front
seat ‑‑ Ignition on but motor not running ‑‑ Whether or
not accused in care and control of vehicle ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, ss. 234(1), 237(1).

 

                   The police found respondent asleep in a sleeping bag
on the front seat of a truck with his head by the passenger door. The truck was
parked on private property. The ignition key was on and the stereo blaring but
the truck was not running and the lights were off. There was no evidence as to
who had put the key in the ignition but the truck had been last driven by a
friend of the accused. The police noticed signs of alcoholic impairment when
they woke the accused and blood alcohol readings were above the legal limit.
Respondent was convicted in provincial court of having care and control of a
motor vehicle while legally impaired. The County Court upheld the conviction
but the Court of Appeal overturned it.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The offence of having care or control of a motor
vehicle while impaired is a separate offence from driving while impaired and
may be committed whether or not the vehicle is in motion. The mens rea
is the intent to assume care or control after voluntarily consuming alcohol or
a drug and the actus reus is the act of assuming care or control.
An absence of intent to drive does not of itself afford a defence. The Crown,
given the facts, could not rely on the presumption of control arising out of
the accused's occupying the driver's seat and had to rely on evidence showing
control. 

 

                   Acts of care or control, short of driving, involve
some use of the car or its fittings and equipment, or some course of conduct
associated with the vehicle which would involve a risk of putting the vehicle
in motion. Respondent was unconscious and clearly not in de facto
control, and his use of the sleeping bag supported the contention that the
truck was merely a place to sleep. He was not occupying the driver's seat and
no adverse inference would be drawn from the ignition key evidence. Since
respondent was not shown to have performed any acts of care or control, he did
not perform the actus reus.

for the appellant.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                McIntyre
J.‑‑The Crown has appealed against the unanimous judgment of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Nemetz C.J.B.C., Carrothers and Hutcheon
JJ.A.), which reverses the conviction of the respondent, Toews, upon a charge,
under s. 234(1)  of the Criminal Code , alleging that he had had care or
control of an automobile while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was
impaired by alcohol or a drug. In reasons for judgment, written by Hutcheon
J.A., he referred to the conviction as being under s. 236(1) of the Code,
that of having care or control of a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in
such quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams
of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. There is no significance for the
purpose of this judgment in the difference.

 

2.                The respondent was found by the police
sleeping in the front seat of his truck at about 5:15 a.m. on July 20, 1980.
The vehicle was on private property some eight to ten feet away from the road.
The respondent was lying on the front seat, his head by the passenger side
door, his lower body encased in a sleeping bag extending under the steering
wheel with his feet resting on, or hanging towards, the floor. The ignition key
was in the ignition, the stereo was playing loudly, the engine of the truck was
not running, and the lights were not on. The police aroused the respondent and
noted signs of alcoholic impairment. It was conceded that the respondent's
blood alcohol readings were .16 and .17 and that his ability to drive was
impaired. The evidence further revealed, and it was unquestioned, that the
respondent had been driven by a friend from his home in the town of Endako to
the house in Fraser Lake where his truck was parked and where the party was
being held. The respondent left the party about 1:30 a.m. because he was tired
and got into his truck to lie down and await his friend who remained at the
party. The police arrived at about 5:15 a.m. in response to a call on another
matter and found the respondent sleeping soundly in the truck. The respondent
swore that he had no intent to drive the truck when he entered it and this
seems to have been accepted in the courts below. 

 

3.                The respondent was convicted in the
provincial court. The trial judge expressed the opinion that while the accused
may not have entered the truck with the intent to drive it, and he may not have
formed the intention while in the truck, he could, nevertheless, have changed
his mind and driven it. The conviction was entered.

 

4.                On the summary conviction appeal to the
County Court (Perry Co. Ct. J.) the appeal was dismissed. Perry Co. Ct. J. was
of the view that he was bound by the case of R. v. Donald (1970), 3
C.C.C. (2d) 146, in the British Columbia Court of Appeal. He concluded on the
basis of that case that: ""... the matter of the man's intention cannot
really be a factor in this appeal"", and he dismissed the appeal.

 

5.                In the British Columbia Court of Appeal
two grounds of appeal were considered. On the primary ground, that is, that the
respondent had no intention of setting the truck in motion on his entry into
the vehicle, Hutcheon J.A., for the Court, said:

 

                   The
appeal to this Court was filed some time before the majority of the Supreme
Court of Canada in Ford v. The Queen (1982) 65 C.C.C. (2d) 392 (S.C.C.)
[[1982] 1 S.C.R. 231] held that an intention to drive was not an essential
element of the offence created by s. 236. The effect of Ford v. The Queen
is to conclude this appeal against Toews on the primary issue raised in the
Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal.

 

The second issue raised was stated by Hutcheon J.A. in these words:

 

Can a person have care or
control of a motor vehicle if his intention is to sleep in the vehicle rather
than drive it?

 

He considered the decision of the majority of this Court in the Ford
case, and said:

 

                   Ritchie,
J., speaking for the majority, found that an absence of intention to drive did
not constitute a valid defence. He did not go on to define the mental element
required.

 

                   In my
opinion, at the very least, the Crown must establish by inference or otherwise
that the accused had the intention to use the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle ‑
that is, to have the care or control of the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle.
In the present case, the Crown has failed to establish that mental element.

 

6.                Section 234(1)  of the Criminal Code 
provides:

 

                   234. (1) Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is
impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or
control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an
indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

 

(a) for a first
offence, to a fine of not more than two thousand dollars and not less than
fifty dollars or to imprisonment for six months or to both;

 

(b) for a second
offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than fourteen
days; and 

 

(c) for each
subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than two years and not less
than three months.

 

While in my view the section is not applicable in this case, s. 237(1)(a)
provides:

 

                   237. (1) In any proceedings under section 234 or 236,

 

(a) where it is
proved that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of
a motor vehicle, he shall be deemed to have had the care or control of the
vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the vehicle for
the purpose of setting it in motion;

 

7.                At the outset it must be observed that
the Criminal Code  in s. 234(1)  creates two separate offences. The first
is driving a motor vehicle while the ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or
a drug, and the second is having care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it
is in motion or not, while the ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or a
drug. It follows then that when s. 234(1)  provides for this second offence‑‑that
of having care or control‑‑its words must refer to an element of
care or control other than that of driving. For this reason it is clear, as has
been held in this Court in Ford, that proof of an intent to drive‑‑that
is, to set the vehicle in motion‑‑is not an essential element of
proof in a charge of having care or control. On this question of intention on
the part of the accused Hutcheon J.A. added:

 

                   I agree
with Miss Ryan, counsel for the Crown, that the mens rea of the offence is not
an intention to put the vehicle in motion; Ford v. The Queen. There is
no such authority for the proposition that the means rea [sic] of the
offence is not an intention to have care or control of the vehicle as a
vehicle. If the evidence demonstrates that the accused intends to use the
vehicle as his bedroom, why should that intention be irrelevant to this
offence?

 

I am of the view that the intention of an accused charged under s.
234(1)  is relevant in so far as it may contribute to the presence of the
required mens rea for the offence or tend to exclude it. The mens rea
for driving while impaired is the intent to drive a motor vehicle after the
voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug. The actus reus is the act of
driving where the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a drug has impaired the
ability to drive. Similarly, the mens rea for having care or control of
a motor vehicle is the intent to assume care or control after the voluntary
consumption of alcohol or a drug. The actus reus is the act of
assumption of care or control when the voluntary consumption of alcohol or a
drug has impaired the ability to drive. In proving its case, the Crown must
establish the presence of impairment by evidence in the usual way and the
element of care or control may be established either by reliance upon the
presumption in s. 237(1), where it is applicable, or by showing actual care or
control without reliance upon the presumption: see R. v. Donald, supra, per
Tysoe J.A., at p. 149. 

 

8.                To turn to the case at bar, as I have
indicated above, I am in agreement with Hutcheon J.A. that the absence of an
intent to drive the truck on the part of the respondent does not by itself
afford him any defence. I am also of the view that the Crown cannot rely, in
the facts of this case, on the presumption in s. 237(1). I would agree that to
occupy the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver within the meaning of s.
237(1), one need not be sitting up straight with hands on the steering wheel
and in all respects be ready to drive. The fact that some movement or
adjustment of position might be required to enable a person to take the
steering wheel and drive the car will not necessarily be such a departure from
the occupation of the driver's seat that it will deprive the Crown of the right
to rely on the presumption. However, in my view, by no extension or liberal
interpretation of the words `occupying the driver's seat' can the section apply
here. The respondent was lying across the front seat, his head on the passenger
side, his legs encased in a sleeping bag under the steering wheel. The Crown
can take no comfort from the presumption in this case. The Crown is left then
to rely on the evidence to show acts of care or control.

 

9.                As I have noted earlier, the offence of
having care or control of a motor vehicle while the ability to drive is
impaired by alcohol or a drug is a separate offence from driving while the
ability is impaired. It may be committed whether the vehicle is in motion or
not. This leaves the Court with the question: What will constitute having care
or control short of driving the vehicle? It is, I suggest, impossible to set
down an exhaustive list of acts which could qualify as acts of care or control,
but courts have provided illustrations which are of assistance. In R. v.
Thomson (1940), 75 C.C.C. 141 (N.S.C.A.), Baxter C.J. said, at pp. 143‑44:

 

I have had some difficulty
in construing this expression but have come to the conclusion that
""care"" is intended to cover such a case as an intoxicated driver
placing his vehicle, without applying the brakes, in such a situation that it
may run away and occasion danger to the public. It is probably intended to
cover the possible omission, because of intoxication, of such acts of care as
would or might occasion harm, such acts, in short, as would render any person
liable in damages for negligence. ""Control"" does not need definition.
The man who is in a car and has within his reach the means of operating it is
in control of it.

 

In the Nova Scotia County Court His Honour Judge Pottier said in R.
v. Henley, [1963] 3 C.C.C. 360, at p. 366, in a case similar to this one: 

 

                   It
appears from the above cases that the word ""care"" implies at least
physical possession of the motor vehicle with an element of control. A person in
the motor vehicle may have the care thereof. The word care is generally used in
jurisprudence in the sense of attention, heed, vigilance as opposed to
carelessness, negligence, heedlessness. These uses are involved in the cases of
duties and liabilities of motor vehicle operators, carriers, bailees,
professional persons, etc., and turn largely on the question of negligence.

 

                   The
word ""care"" may also mean custody, charge, safe keeping,
preservation, oversight or attention. Where it is used in this sense it becomes
a relative term and is of broad comprehension. One has to look at the provision
of its use and determine its physical sense from that standpoint....

 

In R. v. Price (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 378 (N.B.C.A.), Limerick
J.A., speaking for the Court, at pp. 383‑84, said:

 

                   The
word ""care"" is defined in The Oxford English Dictionary as
""having in charge or protection"". ""Control"" on the other
hand is defined as ""the fact of controlling or of checking and directing
action"" also as ""the function or power of directing and regulating;
domination, command, sway"".... The mischief sought to be prohibited by the
section as expressed by the wording is that an intoxicated person who is in the
immediate presence of a motor vehicle with the means of controlling it or
setting it in motion is or may be a danger to the public. Even if he has no
immediate intention of setting it in motion he can at any instant determine to
do so, because his judgment may be so impaired that he cannot foresee the
possible consequences of his actions.

 

This Court has recently considered the question in Ford v. The Queen,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 231. Ritchie J., speaking for the majority, said, at p. 249: 

 

Care or control may be
exercised without such intent where an accused performs some act or series of
acts involving the use of the car, its fittings or equipment, such as occurred
in this case, whereby the vehicle may unintentionally be set in motion creating
the danger the section is designed to prevent.

 

10.              There are, of course, other authorities
dealing with the question. The cases cited, however, illustrate the point and
lead to the conclusion that acts of care or control, short of driving, are acts
which involve some use of the car or its fittings and equipment, or some course
of conduct associated with the vehicle which would involve a risk of putting
the vehicle in motion so that it could become dangerous. Each case will depend
on its own facts and the circumstances in which acts of care or control may be
found will vary widely. In Ford, the appellant's vehicle and others were
in a field open to the public. A drinking party was in progress in the car, and
the appellant had occupied the driver's seat and had turned on the ignition on
various occasions to operate the heater as the party progressed. These facts
were considered sufficient to establish care or control. In the case at bar the
vehicle was on private property and the respondent was not in occupation of the
driver's seat. He was unconscious and clearly not in de facto control.
The fact of his use of a sleeping bag would support his statement that he was
merely using the vehicle as a place to sleep. There remains the fact that the
key was in the ignition and that the stereo was playing. Strangely enough,
however, there is no direct evidence that the respondent put the key in the
ignition or turned on the stereo, and the evidence is that the last driver of
the vehicle was his friend, who drove him to the party and who was to drive him
home. I consider that in view of all the circumstances described above no
adverse inference should be drawn in this case on the basis of the ignition key
evidence alone. It has not been shown then that the respondent performed any
acts of care or control and he has therefore not performed the actus reus.

 

11.              I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Possession of stolen
goods ‑‑ Automobile ‑‑ Contradiction between statements
and testimony of accused as to whether she knew car was stolen ‑‑
Duty to acquit if explanation given under oath may be true.

 

                   Respondent was arrested by the police while at the
wheel of a recently stolen car and charged with unlawful possession of a motor
vehicle under ss. 312  and 313  of the Criminal Code . In two written
statements to the police which were admitted in evidence, she stated that the
friend who was with her when she was arrested, and who had invited her to go
for a ride so he could teach her to drive, had told her the car had been
stolen. Later, at the trial, respondent contradicted her statements. The judge
of the Court of Sessions of the Peace found respondent guilty. The Court of
Appeal reversed the conviction and acquitted respondent on the ground that in
law she did not have ""possession"" of the car.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   One of the components of the offence stated in s.
312  of the Criminal Code  is knowledge by the person having possession of
the thing that it was obtained by the commission of an indictable offence.
Thus, even assuming that respondent had possession of the car within the
meaning of s. 312 , the trial judge in order to find her guilty had to be
convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that she knew that the car had been
stolen. As the possession was recent, the presumption that she knew this was
created. In her testimony, however, respondent contradicted her statements and
denied that she knew that the car had been stolen. Confronted with these
contradictions, the trial judge should still have acquitted the accused if he
was of the view that her explanation under oath could be true, even though he
was not convinced that it was. The trial judge said it was impossible for him
to determine whether respondent was telling the truth in her statements or in
her testimony. Accordingly he could not conclude, as he did, that her
explanation under oath could not be true, hence she must be acquitted.

granted pursuant to s. 621(1)(b) of the Code.

 

2.                Respondent, who was eighteen years old,
was arrested by the police while at the wheel of a recently stolen car and
accompanied by an adolescent. In two written statements to the police which
were admitted in evidence, she stated that she accepted the adolescent's invitation
to go for a drive with him in a car which he revealed had been stolen. The
adolescent was teaching her to drive; along the way, she took the wheel and was
driving when they were stopped by the police. In her testimony at the trial,
she denied knowing that the car had been stolen. The trial judge rendered
judgment orally as follows:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
Regarding the other two charges of possession, I am really very sorry: first,
there is the question of recent possession; second, the accused gave her testimony
in such a way and so contradicted the statements she made to the police ‑
but not only her testimony is contradictory. One reaches a point where one no
longer knows whether she is telling the truth in her testimony or in the
statements she made, to such a degree that her testimony can no longer be
regarded as reasonably true.

 

                   For
these reasons, I find her guilty in both cases: in case 2531 for 1980,
regarding the car; and 2765 for 1980 regarding the coats, jeans and so on.

 

3.                She was acquitted by the Court of
Appeal. The decisive ground was stated in the conclusion of Montgomery J.A.'s
judgment:

 

                   I find
nothing in the evidence inconsistent with the theory that Appellant was merely
a foolish girl, only 18 at the time, whom boredom led to lack [of]
discrimination in her choice of companions. I cannot accept that she became a
criminal simply because she chose to exhibit her somewhat limited driving
skills on this stolen vehicle. I do not regard her as having had any real control
over the stolen property. I would therefore hold that she was not in possession
and would accordingly maintain the appeals, set aside the convictions and
acquit her.

 

4.                

                   This conclusion was based on application of the
criterion stated by Montgomery J.A. as follows:

 

It may be that the fact
that the accused was at the wheel created a presumption of possession, but any
such presumption would, in my opinion, be rebuttable. The evidence most
favourable to the Crown is in Appellant's declarations, and from these it
appears that she had gone with her companion for social purposes only and that
she had requested his permission to drive the automobile solely for her own
pleasure and not with any thought of concealing the stolen property or
assisting in its disposition.

 

5.                In other words, in the opinion of Montgomery
J.A. the fact that someone uses a recently stolen car to learn to drive, and
knew it was stolen, is not sufficient for that person to have ""real
control"" and, accordingly, unlawful possession of the car.

 

6.                In view of Montgomery J.A.'s
observations, this appeal raises interesting questions regarding the concepts
of ""possession"" and ""control"". Is the concept of possession
mentioned in s. 312 of the Code the same as that required to initiate
the presumption that someone who is in possession of a recently stolen thing is
presumed to know that it was stolen (or even in certain circumstances to be the
thief)? Must there be more control over the car for the presumption that one
knew it to be stolen to apply? Specifically, in terms of the facts of the case
at bar and of Montgomery J.A.'s observations, the questions are: does taking a
drive as a passenger in a car which one knows to be stolen constitute an act of
possession within the meaning of s. 312 ? What if one takes the wheel for the
pleasure of driving?

 

7.                In short, is the purpose of possession
relevant to its illegality within the context of s. 312  of the Criminal Code ?
If yes, is possession only illegal when its purpose is to deprive the victim of
the theft of his property by hiding it or by participating in its disposal?

 

8.                These are the aspects of the case at bar
which justified intervention by this Court. Unfortunately, these points were
not adequately dealt with by the parties, so that it is preferable for the
Court to await, if possible, a more favourable opportunity for deciding them.

 

9.                One of the components of the offence
stated in s. 312  of the Criminal Code  is knowledge by the person having
possession of the thing that it was obtained by the commission of an indictable
offence.

 

10.              Even assuming (without deciding the point,
for the reasons just stated) that Diane L'Heureux had possession of the car
within the meaning of s. 312  of the Criminal Code , the Crown's appeal
must still fail since, in my humble opinion, the trial judge erred in law in
not acquitting the accused. In order to find her guilty, the judge had to be
convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that she knew the car in her possession
had been stolen. As the possession was recent, the presumption that she knew
this was created. In addition, the Crown adduced in evidence the accused's
statement that she knew the car to be stolen. While under oath at the trial,
the accused contradicted her statement to the police. The question which the
Court had to ask itself is well‑known and was stated by this Court as
follows in Tremblay v. La Reine, [1969] S.C.R. 431, by Fauteux J. (as he
then was), at pp. 436‑37:

 

[TRANSLATION]  The judge
must invite the jury to consider whether, in the light of all the circumstances
of the case, the explanation given by the accused could be true, and the
directions which he must then give them must make clear to them (1) the
obligation they have to acquit the accused, if they are of the view that the
explanation given by him could be true, even though they are not convinced that
it is, and (2) the right but not the obligation, which they have, when
relying upon the presumption arising out of recent possession, to convict the
accused if they do not believe the explanation given by him, or find it
unreasonable to believe.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

11.              The trial judge appeared to conclude that
it would be unreasonable to believe the explanation given by Miss L'Heureux.
This conclusion concerns me, however, since it is based on the fact that,
because of contradictions between her statements to the police and her
testimony in Court, he ""no longer [knew] whether she [was] telling the
truth in her testimony or in the statements she made"". I agree, but with
respect one cannot then simply conclude, as the trial judge did, that her
explanation under oath could not be true.

 

12.              For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

                   Respondent was charged with unlawfully trafficking
in a narcotic. At trial, he admitted selling marijuana to an undercover police
officer but only because he was persuaded to do so by a fellow employee who was
a police informer. The jury found there had been unlawful entrapment and the
court therefore directed ""a stay of proceedings"". On appeal, a
majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the Attorney General's appeal for
want of jurisdiction. This appeal is to determine (1) whether a discretionary
power exists at common law to stay proceedings in a criminal case for abuse of
process, and if so, (2) whether a judicially entered stay of proceedings is a
""judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court"", from which the
Crown may appeal to the Court of Appeal under s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code .








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   In a criminal case, a trial court judge has a
residual discretion to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand
trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the
community's sense of fair play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a
court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings. Such power,
however, can be exercised only in the clearest of cases. In the case at bar,
the stay of proceedings was tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal
and subject to appeal by the Crown pursuant to s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . The decision to stay was not based on procedural considerations, but
rather on questions of law, and such decision was final. The accused was in
jeopardy and the action taken by the trial judge was in the nature of an
acquittal. If the accused were subsequently charged with the offence spelled
out in the indictment, a plea of autrefois acquit would lie.

                   APPEAL from a judgment of the British Columbia Court
of Appeal (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 234, 34 C.R. (3d) 193, [1983] 4 W.W.R. 481,
dismissing the Crown's appeal from a stay of proceedings relating to a charge
of trafficking in narcotics. Appeal allowed.

 

                   S. David Frankel,
for the appellant.

 

                   J. M. Brian Coleman,
for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑The principal issue in this appeal is whether
a judicially entered stay of proceedings is ""a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court"" from which the Crown may appeal to the Court
of Appeal under s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The point,
though narrow, is important and contentious. It has given rise to conflicting
opinions in Courts of Appeal of this country.

 

2.                The respondent, Damon Fidel Garfield
Jewitt, was charged with unlawfully trafficking in a narcotic, cannabis
(marijuana), contrary to the provisions of the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. He was tried at
Vancouver before Wong Co. Ct. J. sitting with a jury. He admitted selling one
pound of marijuana but said he was persuaded to sell to the undercover police
officer by a fellow employee who was a police informer. The jury found there
had been unlawful entrapment and the Court thereupon directed the Clerk of the
Court to make an entry on the record staying the proceedings on the indictment.

 

3.                The Attorney General of Canada appealed
the ""acquittal"" to the British Columbia Court of Appeal upon the
following grounds:

 

1. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law in holding that the defence of entrapment was
available to the Respondent.

 

2. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law in instructing the Jury as to what constitutes
entrapment.

 

3. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law in instructing the Jury that the onus lay on the Crown
to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that there had been no ""unlawful
entrapment"".

 

4. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law in taking from the Jury a special verdict of
""unlawful entrapment"". 

 

5. THAT the learned
trial Judge erred in law and exceeded his jurisdiction in directing a stay of
proceedings with respect to the indictment.

 

4.                A majority of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia (Seaton and Lambert JJ.A.) dismissed the appeal for want of
jurisdiction: see (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 234. Anderson J.A. concluded the matter
fell within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, but he would have
dismissed the appeal nonetheless.

 

5.                The Crown filed a notice of appeal, as
of right, pursuant to the provisions of s. 621(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  on the basis of Anderson J.A.'s dissent on the jurisdictional issue.
Leave to appeal was granted on application brought ex abundante cautela.

Abuse of Process

 

6.                Before considering whether a stay of
proceedings is a judgment or verdict of acquittal or tantamount thereto, it is
necessary to determine whether, at common law, a discretionary power to stay
proceedings in a criminal case for abuse of process exists, in the words of
Laskin C.J. in Rourke v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1021, as
a means of ""controlling prosecution behaviour which operates
prejudicially to accused persons"" (p. 1034).

 

7.                The inherent jurisdiction of a superior
court to stay proceedings which are an abuse of its process was recognized in
Canada as early as 1886, in the case of In re Sproule (1886), 12 S.C.R.
140. In recent years, however, uncertainty has clouded the question whether
Canadian courts, apart from powers given to the Attorney General under s. 508 
of the Criminal Code , have a discretion to stay proceedings for abuse of
process. This may, in some measure, stem from several decisions of this Court,
in particular, R. v. Osborn, [1971] S.C.R. 184; Rourke v. The Queen,
supra; and Amato v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418.

 

8.                This Court's decision in Rourke, supra,
was seen by some as a death blow to the doctrine of abuse of process. As
Stanley A. Cohen stated in ""Observations on the Re‑emergence of the
Doctrine of Abuse of Process"" (1981), 19 C.R. (3d) 310, ""The strong
statements of Pigeon J. in disposing of that appeal led many to believe that
any future use of the doctrine had been foreclosed"" (p. 310).

 

9.                In Rourke, the abuse alleged
stemmed from lengthy delay on the part of the police in arresting the accused.
Pigeon J., speaking for the majority of the Court, concluded at p. 1043: 

 

For the reasons I gave in The
Queen v. Osborn, [1971] S.C.R. 184, I cannot admit of any general
discretionary power in courts of criminal jurisdiction to stay proceedings
regularly instituted because the prosecution is considered oppressive.

 

and on the same page:

 

                   I
cannot find any rule in our criminal law that prosecutions must be instituted
promptly and ought not to be permitted to be proceeded with if a delay in
instituting them may have caused prejudice to the accused.

 

10.              The apparent finality with which Pigeon J.
appeared to deny discretionary power to stay proceedings was tempered by his
adoption, as the ""correct view"", of what was said by Viscount
Dilhorne in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys, [1976] 2 All
E.R. 497 (H.L.) at pp. 510‑11. The passage quoted by Pigeon J. at p. 1044
concluded with these words:

 

                   If
there is the power which my noble and learned friends think there is to stop a
prosecution on indictment in limine, it is in my view a power that should only
be exercised in the most exceptional circumstances.

 

11.              The breadth of the decision in Rourke
has been the subject of differing views in various provincial appellate courts.

 

12.              The British Columbia Court of Appeal in R.
v. Lebrun (1978), 7 C.R. (3d) 93, interpreted Rourke widely and
declared simpliciter that the doctrine of abuse of process was not
available in criminal proceedings. A similar result was reached by the Manitoba
Court of Appeal in R. v. Catagas (1977), 2 C.R. (3d) 328.

 

13.              On the other hand, the Ontario and Alberta
Courts of Appeal began almost immediately to construe the decision in Rourke
restrictively and assert the potential for application of the doctrine in
exceptional circumstances. See, for example, Re Ball and The Queen
(1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 532 (Ont. C.A.); Re Abarca and The Queen (1980),
57 C.C.C. (2d) 410 (Ont. C.A.); Re Abitibi Paper Company Limited and The
Queen (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 487 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Crneck, Bradley and
Shelley (1980), 30 O.R. (2d) 1 (Ont. H.C.); Re Orysiuk and The Queen
(1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 445 (Alta. S.C., A.D.) 

 

14.              Several decisions of this Court also
contained obiter dicta suggesting the doctrine was not entirely
moribund.

 

15.              Pratte J., in Erven v. The Queen,
[1979] 1 S.C.R. 926, referred obliquely to the doctrine of abuse of process,
remarking on p. 957:

 

                   The
normal procedure for determining the voluntariness of a statement of the
accused is through a voir dire and, the onus being on the Crown to prove
voluntariness, a request for a voir dire should not be denied save in
rare circumstances, where, for instance, the request would be clearly frivolous
or would constitute a demonstrable abuse of process.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

16.              The matter was raised again in R. v.
Krannenburg, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1053, where, in reasons in which Pigeon J.
concurred, I commented on p. 1061:

 

Indeed, the laying of
another information may amount to nothing less than an abuse of process.

 

17.              Abuse of process was most recently
reviewed by this Court in the case of Amato, supra. The pivotal
issue in Amato was the defence of entrapment. Estey J., with Laskin
C.J., McIntyre and Lamer JJ. concurring, reviewed the power of the court to
stay a prosecution where an abuse of process was found to have occurred. On
this matter, Estey J. concluded, on pp. 453‑54:

 

                   I come
therefore to the conclusion that the decisions of Osborn and Rourke
must be taken as standing on their own facts and limited precisely to the ratio
of the judgments disposing of the issues arising on those facts. It follows
therefore that the observations of Jessup J.A. in Osborn with reference
to the origins and breadth of the trial court discretion to protect the
processes of the courts from abuse remain substantially unimpaired by
succeeding decisons in this Court. Viewed from another perspective the majority
in Rourke affirms an exceptional jurisdiction to stay proceedings
whereas Laskin C.J.C. for the minority takes the view of Lord Devlin in Connelly
and finds the doctrine of abuse of process a wide‑ranging technique for
the control by the criminal court of criminal procedure in the protection of
the processes of that court; a technique illustrated but not limited by the
special pleas of autrefois acquit and convict, res judicata
and issue estoppel (p. 287). In my respectful view, much of what was said by
both divisions of this Court in Rourke is obiter dicta, bearing
in mind the precise issue of abuse of process in the form of delay by the
prosecution which was then the only issue before the Court. There is a
distinction to be drawn where the initiating process is valid and the only
issue is delay prejudicial to the accused, as in Rourke; and the case
where the executive action leading to the charge and its prosecution is
offensive to the principles on which the administration of justice is conducted
by the courts. It is for this further reason that the judgment in Rourke,
in my view, is not here applicable. 

 

18.              Four members of the Court, of whom I was
one, held that the defence of entrapment, assuming it to be available under
Canadian law, did not arise on the facts of the case. Ritchie J. was of the
view that if Amato had been subjected to a threat of violence against himself
if he failed to cooperate with the police plan for procuring the drug, this
might well have supported a defence of entrapment. Ritchie J. concluded,
however, that the evidence did not disclose any such threat.

 

19.              Although the existence of the power to
stay proceedings for abuse of process remained an open question following this
Court's decision in Amato, a number of courts assumed authority to enter
a stay in exceptional circumstances. See for example R. v. Miller
(1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 54 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Boross (1984), 12 C.C.C.
(3d) 480 (Alta. C.A.); and R. v. Hamm (1984), 34 Sask. R. 241 (C.A.),
(leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada denied, Oct. 1, 1984, [1984] 2
S.C.R. vii).

 

20.              The Ontario Court of Appeal recently
reviewed the authorities in R. v. Young (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289, per
Dubin J.A., (Howland C.J.O. and Martin J.A. concurring) and concluded on p.
329:

 

                   I am
satisfied on the basis of the authorities that I have set forth above that
there is a residual discretion in a trial court judge to stay proceedings where
compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles
of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency and to
prevent the abuse of a court's process through oppressive or vexatious
proceedings. It is a power, however, of special application which can be
exercised only in the clearest of cases. 

 

21.              That the controversy continues, however,
can be seen from R. v. Belton (1982), 31 C.R. (3d) 223, (leave to appeal
to this court refused, [1983] 1 S.C.R. v). Monnin J.A., speaking for the Court,
held that the Manitoba Court of Appeal was bound by the majority decision in Rourke
to hold that there was no power to stay for an abuse of process. He also stated
that the Supreme Court of Canada would have ""to give clear indication
whether a judicial stay is available or not in the matter of abuse of
process"" (p. 231). In a subsequent decision, Re Balderstone and The
Queen (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 532 (Man. C.A.), (leave to appeal to this Court
refused, [1983] 2 S.C.R. v), Monnin C.J.M., again speaking for the Court,
acknowledged that the abuse of process question was ""not free from doubt""
and sought further direction from this Court (p. 535).

 

22.              The New Brunswick Court of Appeal, in R.
v. Perry (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 5, also concluded that a trial court judge
is without jurisdiction to stay proceedings for an abuse of process.

 

23.              It seems to me desirable and timely to end
the uncertainty which surrounds the availability of a stay of proceedings to
remedy abuse of process. Clearly, there is a need for this Court to clarify its
position on such a fundamental and wide‑reaching doctrine.

 

24.              Lord Devlin has expressed the rationale
supporting the existence of a judicial discretion to enter a stay of
proceedings to control prosecutorial behaviour prejudicial to accused persons
in Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1964] A.C. 1254 (H.L.)
at p. 1354: 

 

Are the courts to rely on
the Executive to protect their process from abuse? Have they not themselves an
inescapable duty to secure fair treatment for those who come or who are brought
before them? To questions of this sort there is only one possible answer. The
courts cannot contemplate for a moment the transference to the Executive of the
responsibility for seeing that the process of law is not abused.

 

25.              I would adopt the conclusion of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Young, supra, and affirm that
""there is a residual discretion in a trial court judge to stay proceedings
where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental
principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and
decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process through oppressive or
vexatious proceedings"". I would also adopt the caveat added by the Court
in Young that this is a power which can be exercised only in the
""clearest of cases"".

Judgment or Verdict of Acquittal

 

26.              I turn now to the question of whether a
judicially‑entered ""stay of proceedings"" is a ""judgment or
verdict of acquittal"" as those words are used in s. 605(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

 

27.              A stay of proceedings is a stopping or
arresting of a judicial proceedings by the direction or order of a court. As
defined in Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), it is a kind of
injunction with which a court freezes its proceedings at a particular point,
stopping the prosecution of the action altogether, or holding up some phase of
it. A stay may imply that the proceedings are suspended to await some action
required to be taken by one of the parties as, for example, when a non‑resident
has been ordered to give security for costs. In certain circumstances, however,
a stay may mean the total discontinuance or permanent suspension of the
proceedings.

 

28.              Any right of appeal by the Crown is purely
statutory and must be found in s. 605  of the Criminal Code : 

 

                   605. (1) The Attorney‑General or counsel instructed by him for the
purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

 

(a) against a
judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment
on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone, or

 

(b) with leave of
the court of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial
court in proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

 

                   (2) For
the purposes of this section a judgment or verdict of acquittal includes an
acquittal in respect of an offence specifically charged where the accused has
on the trial thereof been convicted of an included or other offence.

 

                   (3) The
Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the
court of appeal against a verdict that an accused is unfit, on account of
insanity, to stand his trial, on any ground of appeal that involves a question
of law alone.

 

                   (4) The
Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the
court of appeal in respect of a conviction for second degree murder, against
the number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole, being less
than twenty‑five, that has been imposed as a result of that conviction.

 

29.              There is a line of authority in this Court
to the effect that quashing an indictment under certain circumstances
may be tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal and thereby subject to
appeal, notwithstanding the absence of an express statutory right of appeal. A
review of these cases may be of assistance in determining whether an appeal is
available under s. 605  from a stay of proceedings entered for abuse of process.

 

A) Quashing an Indictment

 

30.              In Lattoni and Corbo v. The Queen,
[1958] S.C.R. 603, a judgment quashing an indictment on the ground that the
counts were nullities, since the offences were prescribed, was considered an
acquittal. 

 

31.              Kerwin C.J. stated on p. 607:

 

... I agree with the Court
of Appeal that the judgment of Judge Proulx was a final judgment quashing the
indictment because he considered that all criminal proceedings as a result of
the alleged acts of the accused were prescribed. I also agree that it was not a
judgment on procedural grounds owing to a defect in the indictment and
therefore if the accused were charged subsequently with the same offences as
those embodied in the indictment, they could plead autrefois acquit. It
was a decision on a question of law alone and being a judgment or verdict of
acquittal was appealable under s. 584 [now s. 605 ] of the Code.

 

32.              The decision in Lattoni and Corbo
was subsequently applied by this Court in R. v. Sheets, [1971] S.C.R.
614. In Sheets, a municipal officer was charged with a breach of trust
under s. 103 of the Code of 1953‑54 (now R.S.C. 1970 c. C‑34,
s. 111). Prior to taking the plea, the judge ruled that the accused did not
come within the definition of ""official"" under s. 103. This Court
held that since the judge had ruled, as a matter of law, that the accused could
not be properly charged with the offence alleged against him, the adjudication
was tantamount to an acquittal from which the Crown was entitled to appeal.

 

33.              Fauteux C.J. stated on p. 619:

 

                   In my
view, the judgment of Riley J., is, in essence, tantamount to a judgment
rendered in a case tried on the merits and I am clearly of opinion that, were
respondent charged subsequently for the same offence as the one embodied in the
indictment, a plea of autrefois acquit would lie. Being thus a final
judgment or verdict of acquittal resting on a question of law alone, the
Attorney General could, as he did, appeal to the Appellate Division and,
consequential to the dismissal of his appeal, further appeal to this Court.

 

                   I would
add that the difficulty on this point appears to have arisen because of a loose
use of language. On the view taken by Riley J., the accused should have been
acquitted or the charge against him should have been dismissed. 

 

34.              In Kipp v. Attorney‑General of
Ontario, [1965] S.C.R. 57, however, it was held that the Crown had no right
of appeal from an erroneous quashing of the indictment. In Kipp, an
accused had been charged with a breach of certain regulations under the Food
and Drugs Act , 1952‑53 (Can.), c. 38 (now R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑27).
At trial, after the indictment was read and before a plea was entered,
appellant objected to the form of the indictment as being duplicitous. He then
moved to have the indictment quashed. The County Court judge accepted this
objection and quashed the indictment. The Crown sought mandamus to compel the
judge to proceed with the trial on the indictment as framed. The order was
granted and subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal. A further appeal to
this Court was dismissed. Judson J. stated at p. 60:

 

It is common ground that
the Crown has no right of appeal from this erroneous quashing of the
indictment.

 

See also R. v. Tonner (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 132 (Ont. C.A.), and
R. v. G. & P. International News Ltd. and Judd (1973), 12 C.C.C.
(2d) 169 (B.C.C.A.)

 

35.              The most recent decision of this Court to
address the issue is Cheyenne Realty Ltd. v. Thompson, [1975] 1 S.C.R.
87. A judgment quashing an information on the basis of the nullity of the
regulations underlying the complaint was held to amount to a verdict of
acquittal. Spence J., speaking for the Court, reviewed, inter alia, all
the decisions discussed above and held, at p. 96:

 

                   In the
present appeal, the accused pleaded not guilty. His counsel then moved to quash
the information. Unlike the situation in Kipp, in Tonner and in G.
& P. International News, counsel did not object to the form of the
information but his objection was an objection that the offence was not known
to the law because the by‑law upon which it was based was invalid. 

 

                   I am
therefore of the opinion that unlike the situation in Kipp, in Tonner
and in G. & P. International News, the disposition by the learned
provincial court judge was what amounted to a verdict of acquittal and that an
appeal did lie and, therefore, proceedings by way of mandamus were not proper.
In order to arrive at what I have said amounted to a verdict of acquittal, it
was quite unnecessary that the learned provincial court judge should hear
evidence. All that was needed was to consider the provisions of the by‑law
which was before him and apply thereto what the learned provincial court judge
thought was the proper decision in law as to the power of a municipality to
delegate discretionary function.

 

36.              See also R. v. Holmes (1983), 4
C.C.C. (3d) 440 (Ont. C.A.), where the trial judge had quashed the indictment
on the basis that s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code  violated the
presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Court of Appeal held that the order
appealed from was tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal and could
thus be appealed by the Attorney General. A similar case is R. v. Erickson,
[1984] 5 W.W.R. 577 (B.C.C.A.) The judge quashed an indictment on the basis
that it was an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .
The Court held that an appeal did lie because such an order made after plea is
an acquittal. See also R. v. Dennis, Kubin and Frank (1984), 14 D.L.R.
(4th) 205 (N.W.T.C.A.)

 

37.              Other cases cited by the Crown appellant
in support of its position that s. 605(1) (a) encompasses more than a
formal finding of ""not guilty"" are: Re Regina and Kripps Pharmacy
Ltd. and Kripps (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 332 (B.C.C.A.), (leave to appeal
refused R. v. Wetmore, [1981] 1 S.C.R. xiii); R. v. Gee (1973),
14 C.C.C. (2d) 538 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Sanver (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 105
(N.B.S.C., A.D.)

 

38.              From this review, it can be concluded that
quashing an indictment is tantamount to an acquittal where (a) the decision to
quash is not based on defects in the indictment or technical procedural
irregularities, and (b) the decision is a final decision resting on a question
of law alone, such that if the accused were charged subsequently with the same
offence he or she could plead autrefois acquit. 

 

B) Stay of Proceedings

 

39.              As I have earlier indicated, the question
whether a stay of proceedings is tantamount to a verdict of acquittal has
generated considerable controversy in provincial appellate courts. To date,
five such courts have considered the point, three finding in the affirmative
and two in the negative. See R. v. Vermette (No. 5) (1982), 3 C.C.C.
(3d) 36 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Belton, supra; Re Regina and Beason
(1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 20 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Young, supra. See contra,
R. v. Perry, supra, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia in the case at bar.

 

40.              In the Court of Appeal, Seaton J.A. held
that a stay of proceedings was not an acquittal within the meaning of s. 605 
and accordingly the Crown had no right of appeal. A judicial stay of
proceedings, in his view, was different from an acquittal and was, in fact,
entered in circumstances where an acquittal would not be justified. In his
opinion, a stay of proceedings could not be tantamount to an acquittal for the
effect of a stay is that proceedings are only suspended, albeit permanently.

 

41.              Seaton J.A. based his reasoning on the
decision of Estey J. in Amato, supra, where the difference between
an acquittal and a judicial stay is discussed at p. 445:

 

While it is frequently
referred to in legal writings and sometimes in the courts as the ""defence
of entrapment"" it is not a defence in the traditional sense of that term.
A successful defence leads to an acquittal on the charge, a determination that
the offence has not been committed by the accused. Here, axiomatically, the
crime from a physical point of view at least has been committed. Indeed, it may
be that the necessary intent and act have combined to form a complete crime.
The successful application of the doctrine of entrapment, if it be a defence in
the ordinary sense, would support an acquittal. The Criminal Code 
authorizes acquittals in somewhat similar circumstances as in the case of the defence
of duress. However, as will be seen later, the successful application of the
concept of entrapment leads to a stay of prosecution, the court withholding its
processes from the prosecution on the basis that such would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. 

 

and at pp. 456‑57:

 

There are of course but
three available dispositions on a successful application of the defence of
entrapment:

 

(a) a dismissal of the
accused on the charge;

 

(b) an order quashing the
charge;

 

(c) a stay of prosecution.

 

                   Alternative
(a) is inappropriate in that both essential elements of the charge, the
wrongful act and the criminal intent, are present in the proof before the
court. As to (b) there is no authority in the Criminal Code  for a court
in this circumstance to quash a charge that is complete in form and properly
issued under the Code. The last alternative (c) has a technical
infirmity in that the charge remains extant and in the records of the court.
The case before the Court in this appeal was founded on an information about
which there is no suggestion of irregularity. However, the defect in course (c)
is wholly technical. While the charge may be said to hang over the head of the
accused, this is a wholly theoretical observation because there is no forum for
its further processing. The courts in both the United States and the United
Kingdom have in such circumstances, as shown in the authorities already
reviewed, followed all three routes without apparent concern for technical
considerations. I would prefer alternative (c) and would apply a stay of
prosecution where the defence of entrapment is operative.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

42.              Lambert J.A. agreed with the reasoning of
Seaton J.A. He added at p. 240:

 

I do not think that a
purposive approach [to statutory construction] can be used in favour of the
Crown and against the accused to fill a perceived gap in the appeal provisions
in the Criminal Code . If there is a gap then it must be filled by
Parliament.

 

He further remarked on p. 241:

 

... I think it is
significant that the phrase is ‘judgment or verdict of acquittal’
and not merely the single word ‘acquittal’. I presume that ‘judgment’ is used
to describe the decision of a judge and ‘verdict’ the decision of a jury. But
both words indicate a final disposition, and when coupled with the words ‘of
acquittal’ they indicate what the final disposition must be. I do not think an
order or direction that lacks the element of finality, either in form or
substance, would meet the words of the section.

 

43.              Lambert J.A. did not consider that the
decision in R. v. Sheets, supra, supported the reasoning in R.
v. Belton, supra, or R. v. Vermette (No. 5), supra. On
Lambert J.A.'s reading of the case, Fauteux C.J. did not say in Sheets
that the decision was tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal, but
rather, that it is tantamount to a decision on the merits and as such, it was a
final judgment or verdict of acquittal. 

 

44.              Anderson J.A., dissenting, found that the
stay of proceedings was tantamount to an acquittal since the difference between
the two was merely technical.

 

45.              The appellate courts which have held a
stay of proceedings tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal, would
appear to have based this conclusion on three considerations:

 

1. Although the charge remains extant following a stay of proceedings,
there is no forum for its further processing and hence a stay is, in reality, a
final decision.

 

2. Abuse of process is an issue which goes to the merits of the case. A
stay of proceedings releases the accused from all further proceedings. It is
therefore a substantive, rather than a merely procedural, decision.

 

3. The reasoning expressed in the cases on quashing an indictment. As
Martin J.A. stated in Beason, supra, at pp. 31‑32:

 

                   The law
has been settled by a series of decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada that
where an indictment has been quashed, not on the basis of the defects in the
indictment or technical procedural irregularities, but on grounds going to the
substance or merits of the charge so as to give rise to the plea of autrefois
acquit if the accused were subsequently charged, the order quashing the indictment
is tantamount to an acquittal and an appeal lies from the order quashing the
indictment: see R. v. Sheets, [1971] S.C.R. 614, 1 C.C.C. (2d) 508, 16
D.L.R. (3d) 221; Lattoni and Corbo v. The Queen, [1958] S.C.R. 603, 121
C.C.C. 317. The principle enunciated in these cases has been applied, correctly
I think, to cases where proceedings have been stayed or indictments quashed
because of contraventions of rights secured by the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and in which the disposition made by the trial judge
constitutes a final disposition of the prosecution which precludes its
subsequent revival:...

 

46.              Appellate courts opposing this conclusion
based their decisions on the following considerations:

 

1. A judicial stay is entered in circumstances where an acquittal is
not justified.

 

2. Although proceedings are suspended permanently, technically the
charge remains.

 

3. Any gap in the appeal procedure created under s. 605 of the Code
must be filled by Parliament, not the courts. 

 

47.              In my opinion, the criteria considered in
the line of cases, Lattoni and Corbo, Sheets and Cheyenne
Realty Ltd., which hold that the quashing of an indictment is tantamount to
a judgment or verdict of acquittal, may usefully be applied to this case. Can
it be said that (a) the decision to stay was not based on procedural
considerations, but rather on questions of law; and (b) the decision was a
final decision, that is to say, a judgment rendered on a question of law after
the accused was placed in jeopardy, such that if the accused were charged
subsequently with the same offence he could plead autrefois acquit?

 

48.              Staying proceedings on the basis of abuse
of process, and in particular, on the basis of the defence of entrapment, in my
view, amounts to a decision on a complex question of law and fact. Entrapment
has been defined as the conception and planning of an offence by a law
enforcement officer and his procurement of its commission by one who would not
have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the
officer: see Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435 (1932) at p. 454.
This is more than a mere procedural defect.

 

49.              Furthermore, Petersen v. The Queen,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 493, is authority for the proposition that a formal
""acquittal"" is not required in order for the accused to plead autrefois
acquit. In that case McIntyre J. said, at p. 501:

 

                   I am
also of the opinion that the appellant was placed in jeopardy and that his
trial commenced upon the informations. He had pleaded not guilty and he stood
prepared to meet the Crown's case. In Riddle, the Crown's case was
dismissed because the Crown, despite the refusal of an adjournment and the
Court's direction that the trial proceed, declined to call evidence. There was
accordingly no case for the accused to meet and the acquittal resulted. In
that case Dickson J., said at p. 398: 

 

In my view, a criminal
trial commences and an accused is normally in jeopardy from the moment issue is
joined before a judge having jurisdiction and the prosecution is called upon to
present its case in court. The person accused continues in jeopardy until final
determination of the matter by rendering of the verdict.

 

I do not consider that
Dickson J., imposed by those words a requirement that some direct invitation
must be issued to the Crown to call evidence before it could be said that the
issue had been joined and the accused placed in jeopardy. The authorities he
relied upon in his reasons support the proposition that once a plea is entered
before a court of competent jurisdiction the accused is in jeopardy. Where the
court proceeds to a determination, in the nature of an acquittal or dismissal,
proceedings on new informations raising the same allegations will be barred:
Haynes v. Davis, [1915] 1 K.B. 332; R. v. Hatherley (1971), 4
C.C.C. (2d) 242; R. v. Blair and Karashowsky (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 47; R.
v. Day (1980), 37 N.S.R. (2d) 193, and other authorities referred to in Riddle,
supra.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

50.              At the respondent's trial, the following
occurred: (i) the respondent was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to
the indictment; (ii) a jury was empanelled and the accused placed ""in
charge""; (iii) the Crown presented its case; (iv) the respondent testified
on his own behalf; (v) counsel addressed the jury; (vi) Wong Co. Ct. J. charged
the jury; (vii) the jury returned a verdict of ""unlawful entrapment"";
and (viii) Wong Co. Ct. J. gave effect to that verdict by directing a
""stay of proceedings"". Given this sequence of events, in my opinion,
the respondent was in jeopardy and the action taken by the judge was in the
nature of an acquittal. If the respondent were subsequently charged with the
offence spelled out in the indictment, a plea of autrefois acquit would
lie. 

 

51.              I see no logical reason why a decision to
quash an indictment on a question of law should be considered a judgment or
verdict of acquittal whereas a decision to enter a stay on a question of law
should not. Anderson J.A. pointed out it would be an anomolous and absurd
result if dismissal of the charges on the basis that the proceedings
constituted an abuse of process would permit an appeal but a stay of the
proceedings on the basis that they constituted an abuse of process would not.
Hence, I would conclude that the administration of criminal justice would be
better served by a determination that a stay of proceedings is
tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal and subject to appeal by
the Crown pursuant to s. 605(1) (a).

 

52.              There are further policy considerations
that should also be taken into account. In Re Regina and Beason, supra,
Martin J.A. concluded, on p. 34, that in the circumstances of that case, ""mandamus
is available to the Crown, although I consider that in the future an appeal is
the preferable remedy to be followed in like circumstances"". I am in
respectful agreement with this conclusion.

 

53.              A failure to acknowledge a right of appeal
in circumstances where the order finally terminates the proceedings, in
particular a stay, would seriously impede a rational and consistent development
of Charter  remedies through the appeal process and this, at a very
critical time in their development. This is particularly true in the case of a
stay of proceedings, which is being used increasingly as a Charter 
remedy.

 

54.              I do not believe it would further the
judicial process to permit appeals from a decision to stay proceedings because
of a Charter  violation, and not permit an appeal from a decision to stay
reached because of an abuse of process such as entrapment. Such a course of
action would lead to strained and artificial distinctions.

 

55.              On a true reading of s. 605(1)(a)
of the Code, to determine whether a stay of proceedings is a judgment or
verdict of acquittal, we must look to the substance of the action of the trial
judge and not the label he used in disposing of the case. Substance and not
form should govern. Whatever the words used, the judge intended to make a final
order disposing of the charge against the respondent. If the order of the Court
effectively brings the proceedings to a final conclusion in favour of an
accused then I am of opinion that, irrespective of the terminology used, it is
tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal and therefore appealable by
the Crown. 

 

56.              We are concerned here with a stay of
proceedings because of an abuse of process by the Crown. While a stay of
proceedings of this nature will have the same result as an acquittal and will
be such a final determination of the issue that it will sustain a plea of autrefois
acquit, its assimilation to an acquittal should only be for purposes of
enabling an appeal by the Crown. Otherwise, the two concepts are not equated.
The stay of proceedings for abuse of process is given as a substitute for an
acquittal because, while on the merits the accused may not deserve an
acquittal, the Crown by its abuse of process is disentitled to a conviction. No
consideration of the merits‑‑that is whether the accused is guilty
independently of a consideration of the conduct of the Crown‑‑is
required to justify a stay. In the case at bar the accused admitted that he had
sold a pound of marijuana to an undercover officer. A consideration of the
merits would necessarily have led to his conviction. The stay in this case
intervenes to prevent consideration of the merits lest a conviction occur in
circumstances which would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

57.              The respondent requested this Court to
decide the following issues which were raised in the British Columbia
Court of Appeal:

 

Did the learned trial
Judge err in law in holding that the defence of entrapment was available to the
Respondent?

 

Did the learned trial
Judge err in law in instructing the Jury as to what constitutes entrapment?

 

Did the learned trial
Judge err in law in instructing the Jury that the onus lay on the Crown to
establish beyond a reasonable doubt that there had been no ""unlawful
entrapment""?

 

Did the learned trial
Judge err in law in taking from the Jury a special verdict of ""unlawful
entrapment""?

 

Did the learned trial
Judge err in law and exceed his jurisdiction in directing a stay of proceedings
with respect to the Indictment?

 

58.              I would refer all of the above questions
to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia for hearing and determination.

 

59.              The appeal should be allowed, the judgment
below set aside and an order go directing the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia to hear and determine the Crown's appeal on the merits.

on appeal from the court of appeal of ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Jurisdiction ‑‑
Territoriality ‑‑ Charges of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud ‑‑
Toronto‑based telephone sales scheme involving Central American mining
shares ‑‑ Calls directed at U.S. residents ‑‑ Follow up
from and monies sent to Central America ‑‑ Portion of proceeds
brought back to Canada ‑‑ Whether or not jurisdiction to try in
Canada ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 5(2),
423(1)(d).

 

                   Appellant was committed for trial on seven counts of
fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud arising out of the conduct of
his Toronto telephone sales solicitation room. Pursuant to appellant's
directions, telephone sales personnel telephoned U.S. residents and attempted
to induce them to buy shares in two Central American mining companies.
Promotional material was mailed from Central America. The sales personnel were
directed to make material misrepresentations with respect to their identity, to
where they were telephoning from, and to the quality and value of the shares
they were selling. As a result of these misrepresentations, a large number of
U.S. residents were induced to buy virtually valueless shares in the two mining
companies. Their money was sent to Central America, where appellant received
his share to take back to Toronto. The accused, by motion, sought to have the
committal for trial quashed on the ground that the alleged offences occurred
outside Canada, but the motion was refused. An appeal to the Ontario Court of
Appeal was dismissed. 








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The counts of fraud on which appellant stood charged
could be properly prosecuted in Canada and nothing in the requirements of
international comity dictated that Canada not exercise jurisdiction. The
conspiracy count could be proceeded with as the fraudulent activities occurred
in Canada.

 

                   In considering whether a criminal transaction falls
outside territorial jurisdiction, account must be taken of all the relevant
facts that took place in Canada giving this country an interest in prosecuting
the offence and of whether or not anything in those facts offended against
international comity. All that is necessary to make an offence subject to the
jurisdiction of our courts is that a significant portion of the activities
constituting that offence took place in Canada. It is sufficient that there be
a ""real and substantial link"" between an offence and Canada.
Sufficient activities preparatory to this fraudulent scheme occurred in Canada
to warrant a court's holding that the offence took place in Canada: the scheme
was devised here and the whole operation that made it function, including the
directing minds and the telephone solicitation, was situated here. The fact
that cases where the victims would be harmed outside the country would be
caught made no difference. If an accused were prosecuted for the same offence in
more than one country, any injustice could be obviated by the pleas of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict. No issue of comity was involved. The
interests of other countries are not served by allowing criminals based in this
country to prey on their citizens.

                   APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal (1984), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 351n, dismissing an appeal from a judgment
of Osler J. (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 284, dismissing an application to quash the
committal order for trial made by Kerr P.C.J. Appeal dismissed.

 

                   Symon Zucker,
for the appellant.

 

                   John Pearson,
for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                La
Forest J.‑‑The appellant, Murray A. Libman, was committed
for trial on seven counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud.
Some of the activities on which these charges are based occurred outside
Canada, and the accused sought, by motion, to have the committal quashed on the
ground that the alleged offences occurred outside Canada, but the motion was
refused. An appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed. Mr. Libman
then sought and was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

 

Facts

 

2.                The parties agreed to the following
facts for the purposes of this appeal.

 

3.                During the period covered by the
informations, Mr. Libman operated a telephone sales solicitation room (or
""boiler room"") at 43 Menin Road in Toronto, where a number of
individuals were employed as telephone sales personnel. Pursuant to Mr.
Libman's directions the sales personnel telephoned United States residents and
attempted to induce them to purchase shares in two companies, Hebilla Mining
Corporation and Claravella Corporation, which purported to be engaged in gold
mining in Costa Rica. In addition to the telephone representations, the United
States residents also received promotional material which was mailed from
Panama City, Panama and San José, Costa Rica by associates of Mr. Libman.

 

4.                The telephone sales personnel, on the
direction of Mr. Libman, made material misrepresentations with respect to their
identity, where they were telephoning from, and the quality and value of the
shares they were selling. As a result of these misrepresentations, a large
number of United States residents were induced to purchase shares in the two
mining companies. There was some evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry
from which it could be inferred that these shares were virtually worthless. 

 

5.                The United States residents who agreed
to purchase shares were told by the telephone sales personnel to send their
money to offices operated by Mr. Libman's associates in either San José, Costa
Rica or Panama City, Panama. There was evidence tendered that Mr. Libman went
to a location outside Canada, usually Costa Rica or Panama, to meet with his
associates and receive his share of the proceeds of the sale of the shares. Mr.
Libman then brought this money back to Toronto and distributed a portion of it
to his sales personnel. There was also evidence tendered at the preliminary
inquiry with respect to the wire transfer of monies from Panama City to Mr.
Libman in Toronto.

 

Major Issues on Appeal

 

6.                The basic point raised by the appellant
was that the deprivation of the victim was an essential element, indeed, the
essential element or grava‑ men, of the offence of fraud, and that any
deprivation suffered by the purchasers of the shares in the present case had
occurred outside Canada. The alleged offences could, therefore, not be
prosecuted in Canada.

 

7.                This point of view involves selecting
one ingredient of an offence as its essential ingredient and holding that the
offence occurred where the portion of the transaction constituting that
ingredient took place. On this issue counsel for the appellant principally
relied on R. v. Brixton Prison Governor, Ex parte Rush, [1969] 1
All E.R. 316, a decision of an English divisional court on facts substantially
similar to the present case.

 

8.                For its part, the Crown relied on Re
Chapman (1970), 5 C.C.C. 46, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal
which is also similar to the present case except that the proceeds of the sale
were originally received by the accused in Canada and not in a foreign country.
But the Crown also argued the case on the broader ground that the offences had
been substantially committed in Canada, the fraudulent scheme having been
devised and operated here and the proceeds accruing from it having been
received by Mr. Libman in Canada as contemplated by the scheme.

 

9.                The conspiracy charge was dealt with by
Kerr J. who committed the accused to trial under s. 423(1)(d), which
applies to conspiracies to commit a criminal offence in Canada, and not under
s. 423(3) which expressly deals with conspiracies entered into in Canada to
commit a crime outside Canada. The latter provision was enacted after some of
the acts charged occurred, and in any event it was not relied on. Counsel for
the defence, therefore, argued that s. 423(1)(d) applied only to
conspiracies entered into in Canada to commit a substantive offence here which,
if his argument that the gravamen of the substantive offence occurred abroad is
accepted, was not the case here. For this proposition he also relied on Board
of Trade v. Owen, [1957] A.C. 602, where the House of Lords held that a
conspiracy in England to do a wrongful act abroad was not subject to
prosecution in England. 

 

General Considerations

 

10.              Transnational offences of the kind in
question here have been dealt with in a rather confusing fashion, probably
because they are not of a type individual courts are called upon to deal with
frequently. Accordingly, it will be useful to examine the legal background on a
broad basis as the argument of the Crown rather invites us to do.

 

11.              The primary basis of criminal jurisdiction
is territorial. The reasons for this are obvious. States ordinarily have little
interest in prohibiting activities that occur abroad and they are, as well,
hesitant to incur the displeasure of other states by indiscriminate attempts to
control activities that take place wholly within the boundaries of those other
countries; see R. v. Martin, [1956] 2 All E.R. 86, at p. 92. It is,
however, permissible under international law to exercise jurisdiction on other
bases. For example, states have long exercised jurisdiction over ships that fly
their flags and over their nationals abroad. As well, along with other types of
protective measures, states increasingly exercise jurisdiction over criminal
behaviour in other states that has harmful consequences within their own
territory or jurisdiction; see The Lotus (1927), P.C.I.J., Ser. A., No.
10. It follows from this that the same criminal act may occasionally be subject
to prosecution in more than one country, a matter to which I shall refer from
time to time.

 

The English Legal Background

 

12.              So far as this country is concerned, the
English legal background necessarily sets the stage for our own experience.
However, in this area there have been differences in emphasis so it is useful
to deal with the experience in the two countries separately, beginning with the
English. 

 

13.              Great Britain probably followed the territorial
principle more stringently than other states. This was probably owing to its
insular position, but it must also be remembered that most of the common law
crimes, other than murder, tended by their nature to be territorially confined.
Theft is an example. The early British cases, mostly dealing with murder, do
not provide much assistance as the discussion in Board of Trade v. Owen,
supra, demonstrates. And though the cases on venue, which involve the
question of which court in England has competence to deal with prosecutions for
acts committed in several countries within England, are helpful, they involve,
as Lord Diplock noted in Treacy v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
[1971] A.C. 537, at p. 559, other considerations including the fact that jurors
were originally drawn from those who were more likely to know the facts alleged
to constitute the crime; see also Director of Public Prosecutions v. Doot,
[1973] A.C. 807, per Lord Salmon, at p. 834. I have, therefore,
generally ignored the venue cases cited to us.

 

14.              It took some time before English criminal
law became sufficiently developed to deal with more sophisticated methods of
getting the gullible or unwary to part with their property, by means of false
pretenses for example. And it was later still, in the late 19th century
following the organization of postal, telegraph and telephone systems that the
practitioners of this gentle art of persuasion were able to extend their
talents to the international plane. It is at this stage that the English
experience really becomes relevant.

 

15.              At this point it should be noted that
Parliament seldom adverted to territorial considerations in defining criminal
offences. It was rather the courts that confined criminal offences within the
realm, sometimes by reference to international comity. It would have been
possible, indeed probably more logical as Cockburn C.J. explained in R. v.
Keyn (1876), 2 Ex. D. 63, at p. 233, to say that where different elements
of an offence take place in two countries, the offence occurs beyond the
territorial ambit of either country. But while there were occasional strong
expressions of the territorial principle, particularly in earlier times (see Macleod
v. Attorney‑General for New South Wales, [1891] A.C. 455, per
Lord Halsbury at p. 458), the courts never followed logic that far. It would
have permitted a too easy means of avoiding criminal sanctions. But once it is
decided that transnational crimes must come within the jurisdiction of one
state, then on what basis should one take or refuse jurisdiction? 

 

16.              The cases reveal several possibilities, of
which I mention a few. One is to assume that jurisdiction lies in the country
where the act is planned or initiated. Other possibilities include the place
where the impact of an offence is felt, where it is initiated, where it is
completed, or again where the gravamen, or essential element of the offence
took place. It is also possible to maintain that any country where a
substantial or any part of the chain of events constituting an offence takes
place may take jurisdiction.

 

17.              Though counsel for Mr. Libman argued that
exclusive jurisdiction belongs to the country where the gravamen of the offence
took place or where it was completed, a review of the English authorities does
not really support that position. What it shows is that the courts have taken
different stances at different times and the general result, as several writers
have stated, is one of doctrinal confusion, a confusion compounded by the fact
that the discussion often focuses on the specific offence charged, a discussion
made more complicated by the further fact that some offences are aimed at the
act committed and others at the result of that act.

 

18.              The early cases were certainly not
concerned with the place of impact of the crime or where the deprivation of the
victim took place, or, for that matter, where the crime was completed. Rather,
the courts seem to have weighed the various factors connecting the crime to the
place where the charges were laid. Thus in R. v. Holmes (1883), 12
Q.B.D. 23, a case that bears some resemblance to the present, the accused wrote
and posted a letter at Nottingham addressed to one Gobet in France that contained
a false pretence by which Gobet was fraudulently induced to transmit a draft to
the accused which the latter then cashed in Nottingham. The Court of Crown
Cases Reserved had no difficulty in holding that the offence could be
prosecuted in Nottingham where the letter was mailed and the proceeds arising
out of the false pretence were paid. Lord Coleridge C.J., at p. 24, thought
both ingredients of the offence, the false pretence and the receipt of the
money took place there. Interestingly, he went on to suggest that one
ingredient taking place in Nottingham would have been sufficient to give the
court jurisdiction there.

 

19.              Certainly, about the same time, the cases
of R. v. Jacobi and Hiller (1881), 46 L.T.R. 595n, and R. v. Nillins
(1884), 53 L.J.Q.B. (N.S.) M.C. 157, (which are remarkably similar to one
another) made it clear that a crime could be prosecuted where its impact was
felt by the victim; see also R. v. Godfrey, [1923] 1 K.B. 24. In Nillins,
the accused sent letters containing false pretences from Southampton, England
to a person in Hamburg, Germany, who then transferred goods to agents of the
accused in Germany. The accused also sent his victims forged cheques there. In
extradition proceedings, the court held he could be surrendered to Germany on
the ground that the crime was committed there. In arriving at this conclusion
the court, as in the Holmes case, appears to have weighed the factors
that substantially connected the crime to the place seeking to prosecute him.
Cave J. had this to say at p. M.C. 158: 

 

... it cannot be seriously
contended that he did not commit the crime in Germany; he procured the goods
there, he uttered the forged notes there, and, further, they were delivered to
the merchant of the port or his agent, and upon these the goods were delivered
to his order at Hamburg.

 

20.              Taken together, these cases indicate that
it might be possible to charge an accused in two different countries, as Lord
Coleridge suggests in Holmes. He made this suggestion even more explicit
in giving the judgment of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved in the rather
similar case of R. v. Peters (1886), 16 Q.B.D. 636. There the accused,
an undischarged bankrupt, had, without informing the purchaser as required by
the Bankruptcy Act, 1883 bought a horse from a farmer in Ireland for £‑22,
the farmer to deliver it, at the direction of the accused on board a steamer at
Larne in Ireland. This transaction was effected by means of a letter posted by
the accused in Newcastle, England. The court, over Manisty J.'s dissent on the
ground that property had passed when the horse was delivered to the carrier in
Ireland, held that the offence could be prosecuted in Newcastle. Lord
Coleridge's remarks justifying this holding are reminiscent of those of Cave J.
in Holmes. He said at p. 639:

 

... the credit was
obtained (assuming it to have been obtained at all) in Newcastle. The prisoner
lived there; he wrote to the vendor thence; he received an answer there; he
ordered the horse to be sent there; he received it there.

 

21.              In sum, what the courts in these cases
appear to have been doing, in determining whether a crime should be prosecuted
in a particular area, was to consider the substantial links that connected the
crime to that jurisdiction. They do not deny, as their holdings and Lord
Coleridge's remarks attest, that there may be sufficient links to different
jurisdictions to justify proceedings in more than one place. 

 

22.              Before leaving these cases, it is
interesting to note that the last of them, Peters, bears a considerable
resemblance to the present case. There, the communication came from England
(here Canada) and property technically passed in Ireland (here, probably the
United States, though possibly Costa Rica or Panama), but the benefit from the
transaction was received by the accused in the country where the communication
originated.

 

23.              R. v. Ellis, [1899] 1 Q.B. 230, in
the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, though not inconsistent with the cases
already discussed, reveals an approach that is more supportive than they are of
the theory advanced by appellant's counsel. There the major judgments seek to
identify the gist or gravamen of the offence as revealed from its definition
and hold that the offence was committed where the acts constituting its gist or
gravamen occurred. In that case, Ellis who carried on business in Durham,
England, obtained goods on credit there on the basis of false representations
he had made to the supplier of the goods at the latter's place of business in
Glasgow, Scotland, which was treated for the purpose of the case as a foreign
country. He was convicted of the charge of obtaining goods by false pretences
in Durham, the judges generally appearing to think the gist of the offence was
the obtaining of the goods, and not the false pretences. Bruce J. however, gave
voice to another theory which also supports the appellant's position. In his
view, the offence could properly be dealt with where it was completed, i.e.,
Durham, notwithstanding that some of its ingredients might have occurred
entirely outside the jurisdiction.

 

24.              The ""completion of the offence""
theory was also used by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of R. v.
Stoddart (1909), 2 Cr. App. R. 217, but on facts that were somewhat the
reverse of those in Ellis. There postal orders obtained by false
pretences were mailed in England and received by the defendant's agent abroad.
The court concluded that the English criminal courts had jurisdiction, holding
that the offence was complete when the letters containing the postal orders
were mailed, an approach consistent with cases holding that a contract is
complete when the acceptance of an offer is mailed. 

 

25.              Application of either the gist of the
offence test or the completion of the offence test has the effect of limiting
the courts' jurisdiction in criminal matters to a single location, namely,
where the essential element of the offence occurred or where it was completed.
Such a result does not appear to have occurred in the few cases reported over
the next fifty years. In some cases the courts were able to avoid any limiting
effect by creating the notion of continuity of offences. Thus in R. v.
Mackenzie and Higginson (1910), 6 Cr. App. R. 64, the accused Mackenzie was
accused of procuring a girl to have sexual intercourse with Higginson.
Everything in the nature of procuring occurred in Scotland but the intercourse
took place in London. The court concluded that the offence of procuring is
continuous and since a part of the procuration occurred in England, the court
had jurisdiction. This approach has continued to be applied in more recent
cases; see R. v. Robert Millar (Contractors) Ltd.; R. v. Millar,
[1970] 2 Q.B. 54 (C.A.); Treacy v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra;
R. v. Baxter, [1972] 1 Q.B. 1 (C.A.); Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Doot, supra.

 

26.              Occasionally, the courts sought refuge in
the definition of the offence. Thus in R. v. Lyle (1924), 18 Cr. App. R.
59, the accused was charged with causing the proceeds of a cheque to be
converted to his own use. The offence began in Accra on the Gold Coast but was
not completed until the proceeds were paid to him in London. This approach has
also been followed recently in the cases cited in the last paragraph. 

 

27.              Whether the courts during this period
seriously intended to depart from the rationale in the early cases like Nillins,
Holmes, and Peters it is difficult to say. The cases we have
discussed were really not inconsistent with them and interestingly in Lyle
the Court of Criminal Appeal clearly contemplated that the accused could have
been charged with some of the offences both in London and in Accra. However
that may be, it is clear that later, during the 1960's, the English courts did
take seriously the notion that an offence could take place at one single locus,
whether that was where the offence was completed or where the gist, gravamen or
essential element of the offence took place. This approach was also encouraged
by the views of a respected academic, Professor Glanville Williams; see
""Venue and the Ambit of Criminal Law"" (1965), 81 L.Q.R. 276,
276‑288, 395‑421, 518 et seq.

 

28.              Discussion of this period may conveniently
begin with the House of Lords' decision in Board of Trade v. Owen, supra,
in 1957, although as I will attempt to explain that case is frequently
misunderstood and is clearly inconsistent with any theory that an offence takes
place where the gravamen or gist of the offence occurs. In that case, the
accused were convicted of conspiring in London to defraud an export control
department of the Federal Republic of Germany by causing the department to
grant licences to export certain metals from Germany by fraudulently
representing to the department that the metals would be supplied to Irish
manufacturers, the accused well knowing that they would in fact be exported to
Eastern Bloc countries. The conviction was, however, quashed by the Court of
Criminal Appeal and a further appeal from this decision to the House of Lords
was dismissed.

 

29.              In considering that case, it should first
be underlined that the conspiracy charged was a common law conspiracy. It
involved an agreement in England to commit a crime or to effect an unlawful
purpose abroad. It should also be noted that the House, at p. 622, viewed the
evidence as showing ""that the [false] representations were in fact made in
Germany and the licence was issued there"". Lord Tucker, who gave the major
judgment, carefully distinguished that situation from the conviction for
conspiracy to utter forged documents in count 5, which was not appealed, under
which he noted, again at p. 622, that ""the crime designed to be committed
was the uttering of a forged document in this country with intent to defraud,
it being immaterial whether the person or persons to be defrauded were in
Germany or elsewhere"". 

 

30.              In coming to its conclusion, the House of
Lords expressly stated that it was not departing from the long established view
that the gist of the offence of conspiracy was the agreement, which in that
case had clearly been effected in England. The rationale of the decision
is that the Law Lords simply did not wish to extend the courts' jurisdiction
over criminal acts by the technique of conspiracy, which they described as
""an already indeterminate field"". That offence, it was noted, was
devised as a means of preserving the Queen's peace within the realm by
preventing the commission of an offence even before it reached the stage of an
attempt. The fact that the object of the agreement was to take place outside
the realm was, therefore, not irrelevant. The Law Lords left open the question
whether a different conclusion might be warranted if the conspiracy resulted in
some harmful effect in England, an approach soon adopted by the Court of Appeal
in R. v. Cox, [1968] 1 All E.R. 410, and in later cases.

 

31.              Whether the policy underlying the Owen
case is sound and whether it accords with the Canadian position, I need not for
the moment examine. Suffice it to say that it has nothing to do with the
mechanical exercise of determining where the gist or gravamen of the offence
took place. Indeed, as I noted, the House of Lords held there was no
jurisdiction to try the offence in the English courts despite its express
finding that the agreement constituting the gravamen of the offence took place
in England.

 

32.              Nonetheless in R. v. Harden, [1962]
1 All E.R. 286, the Court of Criminal Appeal again resorted to the expedient of
determining where the acts constituting the gist of the offence had taken place
and where the criminal act had been completed in determining the question of
jurisdiction. There the accused carried on a business in Eastbourne, England of
selling refrigerators, many of which were sold on hire‑purchase terms. To
assist in financing the sales he made an arrangement with a finance company for
what he called discounting of the hire purchase agreements, i.e., he
would assign the agreements to the finance company for the sum owing less the
company charges. These amounts were paid, in accordance with the contract
between them, by a cheque posted in Jersey made payable to a company controlled
by the accused. From time to time the accused forwarded a fictitious hire purchase
agreement to the finance company, as a result of which the accused was
ultimately charged in England with obtaining money by false pretences. The
court held, following Ellis, that he could not be convicted because the
gist of the offence, which was the obtaining of the money, was completed in
Jersey. The contract between the parties made it clear that the parties
intended that property in the cheque passed on posting. 

 

33.              The correctness of this case was later
doubted by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords in Treacy v. Director of
Public Prosecutions, supra, even though the House itself had used
similar reasoning shortly before in an extradition case, though it had there
held the court had jurisdiction; see Athanassiadis v. Government of Greece,
[1969] 3 All E.R. 293. Later still the Court of Appeal in R. v. Tirado
(1974), 59 Cr. App. R. 80, carefully confined Harden to its own facts, i.e.,
to cases where the parties have agreed to the place where delivery is to be
made. But that situation must rank as a classic instance of the fallacy of
transplanting a category to an inappropriate area. The fact that the parties
decide that the posting of a letter shall mark the beginning of the contract
has nothing to do with the policies that should guide a court in exercising
criminal jurisdiction over a transnational transaction. Harden has, it
is true, been followed recently but that was simply on the basis of stare
decisis; see R. v. Governor of Pentonville Prison, Ex parte Khubchandani
(1980), 71 Cr. App. R. 241 (Div. Ct.) On the basis of subsequent cases to be
examined later, it seems clear that only the coup de grâce now remains
to be administered.

 

34.              I have elaborated on the treatment of Harden
because it was heavily relied on, along with Ellis, Owen and Cox,
supra, in R. v. Brixton Prison Governor, Ex parte Rush, supra,
which forms the cornerstone of the appellant's case. There Canada sought to
obtain the surrender of the accused from Great Britain under the English Fugitive
Offenders Act 1967 for a number of offences based on facts on all fours
with the present case, and, indeed, including some of the same participants.
There, too, the ""boiler room"" was in Ontario and the people defrauded
were United States residents who were invited to send their cheques for the
stocks to Panama or Nassau. The charge discussed in the case is one of
conspiracy to obtain goods by false pretences. The court refused to surrender
the accused on that count since in its view the crime did not take place in
Canada even though the cheques were obtained from the victims of the fraud
either when they posted them in the United States or, at the latest, when they
were received in Panama or Nassau at which point the indictable offence ended.
What then happened to the cheques, the court continued, was neither here nor
there. 

 

35.              I shall have more to say about the Rush
case later. For the moment, I shall confine myself to a discussion of the more
recent English cases, which clearly indicate that the type of reasoning in Rush
and Harden no longer finds favour in the English courts.

 

36.              The first of these cases is Treacy v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, supra, decided by the House of
Lords in 1971. There the accused in England posted a letter written by him to a
woman in West Germany in which he demanded money or face exposure of her
private life. He was charged with blackmail in England, i.e., with
making an unwarranted demand with menaces. He objected to the court's
jurisdiction, but the objection was overruled. On appeal to the Court of
Appeal, John Stephenson J., giving the judgment of the court, held that the
English courts had jurisdiction to try the offence, the demand having been
first made when the letter was posted. He added, at p. 543, that the appellant
might also be triable in Germany because ""it may be right to regard the
demand as continuing until it is received"". A majority of the House of
Lords agreed that blackmail was committed when the letter was posted but found
it unnecessary to decide whether the demand could be considered as continuing
until the letter was received. Lord Reid and Lord Morris of Borth‑y‑Gest,
however, dissented on the ground that the offence was not completed until the
letter was received.

 

37.              Lord Diplock agreed with the majority but
also decided the case on broader grounds. In his view, if the facts alleged and
proved constitute the offence charged, the only reason (the technicalities of
venue being jurisdictional and long ago abolished) for refusing to convict was
to be found in the international rules of comity which it must be presumed
Parliament did not intend to break. But he interpreted comity narrowly to
attempts to regulate conduct abroad and not in the United Kingdom. As he put
it, at p. 561:

 

It would be an
unjustifiable interference with the sovereignty of other nations over the
conduct of persons in their own territories if we were to punish persons for
conduct which did not take place in the United Kingdom and had no harmful
consequences there. But I see no reason in comity for requiring any wider
limitation than that upon the exercise by Parliament of its legislative power
in the field of criminal law. 

 

In particular he noted that comity did not prevent Parliament from
prohibiting conduct in England that has consequences abroad. Nor did it give
immunity to persons abroad for conduct there that has harmful consequences in
England. He continued at pp. 561‑62:

 

                   There
is no rule of comity to prevent Parliament from prohibiting under pain of
punishment persons who are present in the United Kingdom, and so owe local
obedience to our law, from doing physical acts in England, notwithstanding that
the consequences of those acts take effect outside the United Kingdom. Indeed,
where the prohibited acts are of a kind calculated to cause harm to private
individuals it would savour of chauvinism rather than comity to treat them as
excusable merely on the ground that the victim was not in the United Kingdom itself
but in some other state.

 

                   Nor, as
the converse of this, can I see any reason in comity to prevent Parliament from
rendering liable to punishment, if they subsequently come to England, persons
who have done outside the United Kingdom physical acts which have had harmful
consequences upon victims in England. The state is under a correlative duty to
those who owe obedience to its laws to protect their interests and one of the
purposes of criminal law is to afford such protection by deterring by threat of
punishment conduct by other persons which is calculated to harm those
interests. Comity gives no right to a state to insist that any person may with
impunity do physical acts in its own territory which have harmful consequences
to persons within the territory of another state. It may be under no obligation
in comity to punish those acts itself, but it has no ground for complaint in
international law if the state in which the harmful consequences had their
effect punishes, when they do enter its territories, persons who did such acts.

 

See also his remarks at pp. 564‑65.

 

38.              Lord Diplock's approach was soon followed
by the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, in R. v. Baxter, supra.
There the accused who was resident in Northern Ireland posted letters there
addressed to football pool promoters in England falsely claiming that he had
correctly forecast the results of football matches and was entitled to
winnings. He was charged with attempting to obtain property by deception, but
he pleaded that the attempt was completed when the letters were posted in
Northern Ireland and in consequence that the attempt was not committed within
the jurisdiction of the English courts. The Court of Appeal, however, held that
the attempt was a continuing one, and adopted the following ruling of the
recorder at p. 11:

 

The conclusion to which I
have come is that the attempts in this case were of a continuing nature.
Whenever the defendant posted one of his fraudulent letters in Northern Ireland
he set in motion a train of events for which he was solely responsible, the
transportation of the letter to Liverpool and its delivery to and reading by
the addressee. The reality of the situation is that the misrepresentations were
designed to be made in England and were made there by the defendant's use of
the post. Whether or not these offences are also triable in Northern Ireland, I
am of the opinion they are triable here. 

 

39.              The technique of continuing offence was
again employed by the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Doot, supra, in 1973 to uphold jurisdiction in the English courts in
respect of a conspiracy entered into by aliens abroad to import drugs into
England for ultimate shipment to the United States, the drugs having pursuant
to the agreement been imported in England. Though the crime could be said to
have been complete at the moment of agreement, it was held that the agreement
continued while it was being consummated in England. While this appears to have
been the approach taken by the majority of the House, several of the Lords
expressed themselves in broader terms. Lord Wilberforce, for example, noted at
p. 817 that there is no mechanical answer to the issue of jurisdiction in the
case of crimes committed in several countries. And Lord Salmon set forth the
realism that must prevail in approaching the notion of comity nowadays. At page
831 he had this to say:

 

It is surely no mitigation
that the defendants intended to commit further crimes by exporting the prohibited
drugs from this country. There is unfortunately a ready market in this country
for these dangerous drugs. I do not doubt that if the respondents had received
an acceptable offer for them here it would have been accepted. However this may
be, it hardly seems in accordance with the rules of international comity that
our courts should treat the defendants with special leniency because their
crimes were more likely to ruin young lives in the United States of America
than in this country.

 

At page 834 he continued:

 

                   I do
not believe that any civilised country, even assuming that its own laws do not
recognize conspiracy as a criminal offence, could today have any reasonable
objection to its nationals being arrested, tried and convicted by English
courts in the circumstances to which I have referred. Today, crime is an
international problem‑‑perhaps not least crimes connected with the
illicit drug traffic‑‑and there is a great deal of cooperation
between the nations to bring criminals to justice. Great care also is taken by
most countries to do nothing which might help their own nationals to commit
what would be crimes in other countries: see, for example, section 3 (2) of the
Dangerous Drugs Act 1965.

 

                                                                    ...

 

In any event, the rules of
international comity are not static and I do not believe that in the modern
world nations are nearly as sensitive about exclusive jurisdiction over crime
as they may have been formerly. 

 

40.              The approach in Treacy and in Doot
has been followed in later cases. In R. v. Wall, [1974] 1 W.L.R. 930
(C.A.), it was held that acts done abroad in order to further the fraudulent
evasion of a restriction on importation of drugs into the United Kingdom were
punishable under the relevant statute. As Cairns L.J., speaking for the court,
noted at p. 934: ""If it were not so, a person abroad who slipped a package
containing a dangerous drug into the luggage of an innocent passenger who then
brought it into this country would not be punishable....""

 

41.              Again in Secretary of State for Trade
v. Markus, [1976] A.C. 35, which also featured ""a gigantic
international swindle"", Lord Diplock, giving the majority judgment in the
House of Lords, stated that in the case of a ""result crime"" of the
same general nature as obtaining by false pretence, the offence is justiciable
in England if any part of the proscribed result takes place in England. There
the proscribed result was taking part in arrangements by victims of the
fraudulent inducements. However, it was not necessary there to canvas the broad
approach he had taken in Treacy.

 

42.              It cannot at this juncture be stated that
the broad approach of Lords Diplock and Salmon has been definitively adopted in
England. But the simple fact is that since the English cases relied upon by the
appellant were decided, the English courts have decisively begun to move away
from definitional obsessions and technical formulations aimed at finding a
single situs of a crime by locating where the gist of the crime occurred
or where it was completed. Rather, they now appear to seek by an examination of
relevant policies to apply the English criminal law where a substantial measure
of the activities constituting a crime take place in England, and restrict its
application in such circumstances solely in cases where it can seriously be
argued on a reasonable view that these activities should, on the basis of
international comity, be dealt with by another country. Indeed, while the
English courts in the past gave a variety of differing reasons, sometimes
inconsistent, it can fairly be said that, with some muddling through, this is
substantially what, with the exception of a relatively few cases, they have
done over the last century.

 

The Canadian Background

 

43.              Canada, as a British colony, of course,
inherited the English tradition of territoriality in criminal jurisdiction, and
indeed it is incorporated into s. 5(2)  of the Criminal Code  which sets
forth the general rule that no person shall be convicted for an offence
committed outside Canada. 

 

44.              In assessing Canada's experience this
country's original colonial status must not be overlooked. During the early
period following Confederation, Canadian courts tended to confine not only
criminal but civil legislation strictly within Canadian territory. This was
undoubtedly owing to concerns flowing from its condition of dependency
reflected in the general doctrine of extra‑territoriality. It was not for
many years that, in the words of Lord Macmillan in Croft v. Dunphy,
[1933] A.C. 156, at p. 163, Canadian legislation having extra‑territorial
implications could be viewed without regard to ""any other consideration
than is applicable to the legislation of a fully Sovereign State"". Such
limitations were not formally removed until the Statute of Westminster, 1931.

 

45.              The restrictive character of judicial
interpretation of Canadian legislative ambit can be seen in the early case of R.
v. Blythe (1895), 1 C.C.C. 263 (B.C.C.A.), where an accused had by letters
written in Victoria B.C. induced a girl under sixteen to leave the State of
Washington where she lived with her parents to come to stay with him in
Victoria. He met her when she arrived in Canada and took her to his home. He
was acquitted on a charge of abduction, albeit by a 3 ‑ 2
majority, on the ground that the abduction took place in the State of
Washington.

 

46.              A case of that kind would seem to invite
the application of the notion of a continuing offence, but neither the majority
nor the minority considered this possibility. Nor, indeed, was it considered in
Re Gertie Johnson (1904), 8 C.C.C. 243 (B.C.S.C.), a procuration case
the facts of which bear a close similarity to the English case of Mackenzie
and Higginson, supra, where that offence was construed as
continuing. For other early cases where Canadian courts strictly confined
criminal offences to Canadian territory, see R. v. Wettman (1894), 1
C.C.C. 287 (Ont. H.C.), and R. v. Walkem (1908), 14 C.C.C. 122
(B.C.C.A.) The territorial limitations then thought to be imposed by international
law and British constitutional law can readily be discerned from reading In
Re Criminal Code Sections Relating to Bigamy (1897), 27 S.C.R. 461. 

 

47.              A restricted view of the territorial
application of criminal law may still occasionally be found in some cases even
in fairly recent years; see for example, United States of America v. Novick
(1960), 128 C.C.C. 319 (Que. S.C.), where the court narrowly restricted the
offence of using the mails to defraud to restrict the place of commission to
the place where a letter was posted and not where it was received. But
generally speaking from about 1910, Canadian courts tended not to confine
criminal offences as strictly to Canadian territory.

 

48.              Interestingly enough, in light of Board
of Trade v. Owen, supra, that tendency has been particularly evident
in cases of conspiracy. An early example is R. v. Bachrack (1913), 21
C.C.C. 257 (Ont. C.A.) There the accused were charged with conspiracy to commit
an abortion, the abortion having been committed in the United States. The
jurisdictional point did not directly arise since the jury found that the
accused had conspired to procure the abortion in Ontario. But the judgment of
the court given by Meredith J.A. makes it clear that the jurisdictional
argument would not have been countenanced. He says at p. 265:

 

                   The law
would be lame if it were powerless to reach conspirators so long as they took
care to agree to carry into effect their wrongs beyond the borders of the country
in which they conspired to do the wrongs. It must be borne in mind always that
the crime of conspiracy may be complete without any thing having been done to
carry it out.

 

49.              This approach was followed a few years
later by Allan J. of the Superior Court of Quebec in Ecrement v. Cusson and
Connolly (1919), 33 C.C.C. 135, aff'd. (1920), 30 Que. K.B. 55 (C.A.),
which involved a conspiracy to commit robbery. More recently in Shulman v.
The King (1946), 2 C.R. 153 (Que. C.A.), an objection to jurisdiction to a
charge of conspiracy to defraud again failed. The facts resembled those in the
present case in many ways. The conspiracy charged there involved an attempt to
foist on members of the public outside Canada the shares of a worthless company
by people whom Walsh J. described, at p. 156, as ""an unholy alliance of
swindlers organized in modern trappings"". As in the present case, the
scheme was organized and developed in Canada, but the monies therefrom were
received in England by persons other than the accused although he ultimately
obtained a portion of the funds here. Speaking of this aspect, Walsh J. had
this to say at p. 156: 

 

In the eyes of some people
only financial gains matter; but there is more to conspiracy than its
successful culmination. Its preparation and evolution, even in the case of
failure, is reprehensible.

 

50.              Interestingly, though the courts were
willing to find jurisdiction in Canada when the agreement and preparation took
place here, they were also ready to hold that the country where the results
contemplated by the conspiracy took effect also had jurisdiction though the
accused was not present there; see Re Brisbois (1962), 133 C.C.C. 188
(Ont. H.C.); Re Devlin, [1964] 3 C.C.C. 228 (Ont. Co. Ct.) Thus, as some
of the English cases had earlier established, it was possible to prosecute an
accused for the same acts in several jurisdictions. Whether an act fell outside
the territory was a matter that was approached with some flexibility. And Brisbois
and Devlin were conspiracy cases so it can scarcely be argued that the
gist or gravamen of the offence determines its situs. I might add that Canadian
cases where a court will exercise jurisdiction over an offence consisting of
acts committed abroad that have adverse effects here are not limited to
conspiracy; see Re Hanes and The Queen (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 420 (Ont.
H.C.)

 

51.              This flexible approach was, however,
interrupted in 1965 by a case in the Ontario Court of Appeal. In R. v.
Selkirk, [1965] 2 C.C.C. 353, the accused filled out an application form in
Ontario for a credit card containing false statements and mailed it to the
credit card company in California which sent him a card with which he obtained
goods and services on credit at various establishments in Ontario. He was
charged and convicted of obtaining credit by fraud, and of defrauding the
credit card company be deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. On appeal,
the first count, which related to his obtaining goods in Canada with the credit
card, was upheld even though the card had been issued in the United States
because the transactions creating the debts occurred entirely in Canada. The
conviction on the second count, of fraudulently obtaining the credit card,
however, was quashed. The delivery of the card was made to the accused in
California when it was received by the post office, the accused having made the
postal authorities his agent by mailing his application. From this, the court
reasoned, the offence took place in the United States. 

 

52.              But the law did not long remain in that
state. The reasoning in the Selkirk case was soon rejected by the
Manitoba Court of Appeal, Freedman, Guy and Dickson JJ.A. (now C.J.C.), in R.
v. Trudel, Ex parte Horbas and Myhaluk, [1969] 3 C.C.C. 95. While the case
was concerned with an interprovincial transaction, the court's reasoning is
nonetheless relevant. The accused were there charged with conspiracy to forge
documents. The alleged agreement was made outside Manitoba and the only act
that took place in Manitoba was the receipt of false documents by the accused.
It was argued, on the basis of Selkirk, that delivery of the documents
was not an act in the commission of the offence since it was merely the
consequence of a mailing that took place in Edmonton. But the court rejected
the notion that the principles applicable to the place of formation of civil
contracts were applicable to the determination of the place where a crime took
place. In deciding the latter question, it noted, other considerations must be
invoked, ""including the fact that some criminal acts are of a continuing
character and may rightly be deemed to occur in more than one
jurisdiction"".

 

53.              The same court had acted in a similar way
in an earlier case, R. v. W. McKenzie Securities Ltd., [1966] 4 C.C.C.
29. There the accused were charged under the Manitoba Securities Act
with unlawfully trading in securities. However, they conducted their activities
entirely from Toronto by letters and telephone calls. Here again, the court
underlined that an offence could occur in more than one place. It had this to
say, at pp. 37‑38: 

 

                   Although
offences are local, the nature of some offences is such that they can properly
be described as occurring in more than one place. This is peculiarly the case
where a transaction is carried on by mail from one territorial jurisdiction to
another, or indeed by telephone from one such jurisdiction to another. This has
been recognized by the common law for centuries.

 

                                                                    ...

 

I think it completely
unrealistic to suggest that when the accused sent their letters by mail from
Toronto, Ontario to Shilo, Manitoba, the act of solicitation there represented
took place only in Toronto or at most within the borders of Ontario. Such an
approach ignores completely the nature and character both of a letter and of
the postal service. The invitation put forward by the accused in their letters
was a continuing one. It started when written in Toronto; it continued when
deposited in the post box there; it did not cease to exist during the period
when it was being transported through the postal service (the agency selected
for that purpose by the accused); and it retained its vitality and spoke with
special effectiveness to McCaffrey at the time when he opened and read the
letter in Shilo in Manitoba. It was in this Province that McCaffrey was
solicited by the accused to purchase the shares in question, and it was in this
Province that McCaffrey responded favourably to such solicitation. I would
agree with the learned Magistrate and the learned County Court Judge that what
took place in the present case constituted an act of trading in securities
within the definition of the Securities Act of Manitoba.

 

54.              These two cases, it is true, related to
interprovincial rather than international situations, but it is clear from the
rejection in Trudel of the reasoning in R. v. Selkirk that the
court attached no importance to this distinction. In any event, the reasoning
in Trudel was approved by a panel of five members of the Ontario Court
of Appeal, consisting of Gale C.J.O. and McGillivray, Kelly, Laskin (later
C.J.C.) and Brooke JJ.A., in 1970 in the important case of Re Chapman, supra.
While that court refrained from saying that the situs of an offence can
never be determined on the basis of notions derived from contract or agency, it
concluded that the court in Selkirk had taken too limited a view.
""Since the credit card did reach the accused in Toronto"", it noted at
p. 53, ""there was factual realization of the fraudulent scheme put into
motion by the accused, and hence, a sound basis for concluding that if an offence
had been committed it was committed in Toronto"". 

 

55.              Like the present case, Chapman
concerned a complicated fraudulent scheme initiated in Canada. It is
unnecessary to go into the details except to say that it involved, in the words
of the court at p. 51, ""the initiation and consummation of a scheme in
Canada through the dispatch of letters from Canada and the receipt in Canada of
money or valuable securities by way of cheques and money orders"". The
accused were charged with several counts including conspiracy to defraud the
public by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means of property, money or
valuable securities, using the mails to transmit letters for the purposes of
defrauding the public and obtaining money under false pretences. The accused,
of course, raised the question of jurisdiction.

 

56.              The court did not address the question
whether the conspiracy had been committed in Canada by reason of its formation
and existence here and, therefore, found it unnecessary to consider the
appropriateness in Canada of the principle set out in Board of Trade v. Owen,
supra. That was because it came to the conclusion that the substantive
offence of fraud took place in Canada, and, a fortiori, that the
conspiracy to commit the fraud could be dealt with by a Canadian court.

 

57.              The court's reasoning in support of its
conclusion that the substantive offence took place in Canada is aptly summed up
in the following paragraph at p. 51:

 

The recital of facts herein,
referable to the Canadian phase of Jamster's operations, shows the initiation
and consummation of a scheme in Canada through the dispatch of letters from
Canada and the receipt in Canada of money or valuable securities by way of
cheques and money orders. This is enough to support a charge of the substantive
offence in Canada, subject only to the construction of the phrase
""defrauds the public or any person"". On the facts before this Court,
the only members of the public or persons who could be said to have been
defrauded were residents of the United States.

 

                   The
completion of the offence under s. 323 (1) lies in the obtaining of the fruits
of the fraudulent means or inducement. What is said in R. v. Brixton Prison
Governor, Ex p. Rush, [1969] 1 All E.R. 316 at p. 322, also points to this
conclusion. If there is an initiation of a fraudulent scheme in Canada (as was
the case here in the mailing out of the letters of solicitation) and a
realization thereof in Canada through receipt of money or securities intended
to be brought in through the scheme, the offence has been committed in Canada
although the inducement has extended only to persons outside Canada. In short,
""the public or any person"" in s. 323 (1) are not limited to the
Canadian public or to persons in Canada: see Shulman v. The King (1946),
2 C.R. 153.

 

58.              The court took a similar tack regarding
the charge of using the mails to defraud. The object of the offence was
""prohibiting the use of a public communications facility for fraudulent
purposes"" (p. 54). There was no justification for limiting ""the
public"" sought to be protected by the section to the Canadian public.
Leave to appeal to this Court was denied (see p. 55 [and [1970] S.C.R. viii]). 

 

59.              The Canadian experience may be summed up
as follows. In the early years after Confederation the territorial principle
was narrowly construed in both civil and criminal cases, consistent with
Canada's dependent status. But as time went on the courts began to interpret
their territorial jurisdiction more liberally. On the whole, though, despite
their policy of extending jurisdiction, they tended to apply the gist of the
offence approach more consistently and mechanically than the English courts.
The countervailing policies that, rightly or wrongly, affected the House of
Lords in Board of Trade v. Owen, supra, do not appear to have
been perceived in the Canadian cases that took the opposite view. However, as
in England, the Canadian courts were prepared to move beyond the gist of the
offence test when the impact of a crime was felt in Canada. And like the
English courts, too, they in time adopted techniques to avoid the strait‑jacket
in which the rigorous application of that test had put them, notably the
technique of continuing offences. In truth, though, they were not frequently
presented with situations (such as that which arose in the English case of Peters)
in which they were forced to go beyond the mechanical approach, then also
prevelant in England but later decried by Lord Wilberforce in Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Doot, supra. But Trudel established
that they could, if called upon to do so, eschew mechanical formulations, such
as the use of contractual concepts that had no bearing on the relevant policy
issues.

 

60.              It remains to examine the present case in
light of this background.

 

Rationale and Conclusion

 

61.              Counsel for the appellant framed his
argument on the fraud counts in this way. Relying on the decision of this Court
in R. v. Olan, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175, he asserted that the gist of that
offence is the deprivation of the victims. On the basis of Rush, which
he invited us to follow, the offence was at an end when the deprivation
occurred. Here only the inducements originated in Canada, the monies having
been posted in the United States to either Costa Rica or Panama where they were
received. The deprivation was then completed in the United States or at the
latest in Costa Rica or Panama. This approach, I may say, could not illogically
be adopted even if one considered the offence to be of a continuing nature. 

 

62.              Counsel distinguished the Chapman
case on the basis that there the monies were sent to Canada, and more
fundamentally that Chapman having been decided before Olan was
wrong in holding that the completion of the offence of fraud lies in the
obtaining of the money.

 

63.              I find it unnecessary to enter these
niceties because my difficulties with the gist of the offence and the
completion of the offence tests arise on a much broader plane. To begin with,
these tests seem to me to involve a large measure of unreality. It requires,
for example, that one hold that what happens to money obtained abroad when it
is in fact brought to Canada in accordance with a carefully concocted
fraudulent scheme originating here, is, in the words of the court in the Rush
case, neither here nor there. This kind of thinking has, perhaps not altogether
fairly, given rise to the reproach that a lawyer is a person who can look at a
thing connected with another as not being so connected. For everyone knows that
the transaction in the present case is both here and there.

 

64.              This is not the only example of the rather
special kind of thinking required to apply the tests proposed. We saw from Harden,
for instance, that a criminal can locate a fraudulent scheme where it is most
convenient to himself by simply arranging with the person whom he proposes to
defraud where the agreement is to be completed. Such absurdities obviously
invite a return to first principles.

 

65.              As noted earlier, the territorial
principle in criminal law was developed by the courts to respond to two
practical considerations, first, that a country has generally little direct
concern for the actions of malefactors abroad; and secondly, that other states
may legitimately take umbrage if a country attempts to regulate matters taking
place wholly or substantially within their territories. For these reasons the
courts adopted a presumption against the application of laws beyond the realm,
a presumption later codified in this country in s. 5(2)  of the Criminal Code .


 

66.              While, we saw, there were occasional
strong expressions of the territorial doctrine, particularly in earlier times,
the fact is that the courts never applied the doctrine rigidly. To have done
so, as Cockburn C.J. noted in Keyn, supra, at p. 233, would have
meant that a state could not apply its laws to offences whose elements occurred
in several countries. This would have provided an easy escape for international
criminals. What the courts sought to do, albeit in ways that were sometimes
rather unsophisticated and at times inconsistent with the expressed rationales
in earlier cases, was to give the principle an interpretation consistent with
its underlying rationale. They did not, and indeed were not really
invited to deal with transactions in other countries that had no domestic
impact. But Canadian courts (like those in England and other countries for that
matter) frequently took jurisdiction over transnational offences that occurred
partly in Canada where they felt this country had a legitimate interest in
doing so. Interestingly, s. 5(2) of the Code expresses the territorial
principle in a manner that rather reflects its purpose. That provision does not
say that criminal law is confined to Canadian territory; it says rather that no
person ""shall be convicted in Canada for an offence committed outside of
Canada"".

 

67.              This country has a legitimate interest in
prosecuting persons for activities that take place abroad but have an unlawful
consequence here, (as in Peters, for example). Indeed, from an early
period the English courts have recognized such an interest in other countries;
see Jacobi and Hiller, Nillins and Godfrey, supra.
The protection of the public in this country is widely acknowledged to be a
legitimate purpose of criminal law, and one moreover that another nation could
not easily say offended the dictates of comity. 

 

68.              But the courts did not confine themselves
to taking jurisdiction over transnational offences whose impact was felt within
the country. As early as 1883 (Holmes) they also took jurisdiction in
cases where the victim and hence the impact was abroad. In the early cases,
there was a tendency to justify this in terms of the links that connected the
act to the jurisdiction. In doing so they foreshadowed modern academic writing
on the subject, which points out that a similar approach prevails in both
public and private international law; see Sharon A. Williams and J.‑G.
Castel, Canadian Criminal Law, International and Transnational Aspects,
c. 2, pp. 71 et seq; see also Lynden Hall, "" `Territorial'
Jurisdiction and the Criminal Law,"" [1972] Crim. L.R. 276.

 

69.              Starting with Ellis in England, the
courts began to use another test: that an offence takes place where its gist or
gravamen occurs. This approach was particularly prevalent in Canada. It is
possible to explain many of the cases on this basis which, at a superficial
level, may seem rational. The location of the offence according to this
approach also corresponds to the place where the fruits of the wrongful scheme
are obtained, so one can easily be led into thinking that is where the wrongful
act takes place. But whatever value the notion of the gist of an offence may
have for other purposes, it has little relevance in this context. The offence
of fraud, for example, consists not only of obtaining money, goods or other
property; it also requires that they have been obtained by fraud. Both elements
must be proved. Similarly in the offence of obtaining property by false
pretences, no matter how much one insists that the gist of the offence is the
obtaining, the offence can only take place if the property is obtained by false
pretences. What is more I see no overriding policy reason that would favour the
place of obtaining the goods. There are many cases, it is true, where this is
also the place where the impact is felt, but that is not necessarily so (see Holmes
for example). Nor will it necessarily be the place where the harm is felt (see Ellis).

 

70.              Sometimes the gist or gravamen test is
associated (though the two may be looked at separately) with the
""completion of the offence"" or terminatory test, as in the present
case, for example. This seems more prevalent in England, at least in the eyes
of some academics; see, for example, Glanville Williams, supra. That
test may have the advantage of removing criminal liability for acts that take
place after the offence as defined is completed, but it also has the result of
removing from consideration earlier acts constituting the offence, here the
fraudulent activities alleged to have occurred in Toronto. 

 

71.              It also ignores the fact that the fruits
of the transaction were obtained in Canada as contemplated by the scheme. Their
delivery here was not accidental or irrelevant. It was an integral part of the
scheme. While it may not in strictness constitute part of the offence, it is, I
think, relevant in considering whether a transaction falls outside Canadian
territory. For in considering that question we must, in my view, take into
account all relevant facts that take place in Canada that may legitimately give
this country an interest in prosecuting the offence. One must then consider
whether there is anything in those facts that offends international comity. If
I may borrow the expression of Meredith J.A., in Bachrack, supra,
the law would be lame indeed if its strictures could be avoided by the simple
artifice of going outside the country to obtain the fruits of a scheme that was
hatched in and largely put into effect in Canada. In this case, the whole
operation of obtaining the proceeds of the fraud outside the country was a mere
sham and should be treated as such.

 

72.              Indeed, I would agree with Osler J., who
heard the application to quash, that the preparatory activities to perpetrate
the fraudulent scheme were in themselves sufficient to warrant a holding that
the offence took place in Canada. The scheme was devised here, the whole
operation that made it function, the directing minds, the boiler room‑‑all
were situate in Toronto. The fact that this approach would catch cases where
the victims of the scheme were harmed outside the country makes no difference.
That would also occur under the gist of the offence test when the monies were
obtained in Canada, as it would under the completion of the crime test when the
crime was completed here. Apart from this, though the criminal law is
undoubtedly intended for the protection of the public, it does not do so solely
by the simple expedient of directly protecting the public from harm. Rather, in
conformity with its major purpose, it attempts to underline the fundamental
values of our society: see the Law Reform Commission of Canada, Report 3, Our
Criminal Law (1979). In doing so, it reinforces the law‑abiding
sentiments in society. Walsh J. in Shulman v. The King, supra,
caught the essence of this when, after noting that ""there is more to
a...[criminal offence] than its successful culmination"", he added:
""Its preparation and evolution, even in the case of failure, is
reprehensible"". It would be a sad commentary on our law if it was limited
to underlining society's values by the prosecution of minor offenders while
permitting more seasoned practitioners to operate on a world‑wide scale
from a Canadian base by the simple manipulation of a technicality of the law's
own making. What would be underlined in the public's mind by allowing criminals
to go free simply because their operations have grown to international
proportions, I shall not attempt to expound. 

 

73.              I am also aware that the view I have taken
leaves open the possibility that a person could be prosecuted for the same
offence in more than one country, but any injustice that might result from this
eventuality could be avoided by resort to the pleas of autrefois acquit
and autrefois convict, which have been applied to persons tried in other
countries; see Burrows v. Jemino (1726), 2 Strange 733, 93 E.R. 815; R.
v. Roche (1775), 1 Leach 134, 168 E.R. 169; R. v. Azzopardi (1843),
2 Mood. 288, 169 E.R. 115; R. v. Aughet (1918), 13 Cr. App. R. 101; see
also Treacy v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra.

 

74.              I might summarize my approach to the
limits of territoriality in this way. As I see it, all that is necessary to
make an offence subject to the jurisdiction of our courts is that a significant
portion of the activities constituting that offence took place in Canada. As it
is put by modern academics, it is sufficient that there be a ""real and
substantial link"" between an offence and this country, a test well‑known
in public and private international law; see Williams and Castel, supra;
Hall, supra. As Professor Hall notes (p. 277), this does not require
legislation. It was the courts after all that defined the manner in which the
doctrine of territoriality applied, and the test proposed simply amounts to a
revival of the earlier way of formulating the principle. It is in fact the test
that best reconciles all the cases. The only ones that do not fall within it
are those like Harden and Rush which, in my view, should no
longer be followed.

 

75.              That this approach is attuned to modern
times is evident from the fact that some variant of it has been recommended by
numerous law reform bodies or adopted in legislation; see, inter alia,
the English Law Commission's Report on the Territorial and Extraterritorial
Extent of the Criminal Law (Law Com. 91, 1978); the American Law
Institute's Model Penal Code (Proposed Official Draft, 1962) § 1.03; the
New Zealand Crimes Act, 1961, 1961 (N.Z.), No. 43, s. 7, and the recent
Law Reform Commission of Canada Working Paper 37, Extraterritorial
Jurisdiction, Part III. 

 

76.              Just what may constitute a real and
substantial link in a particular case, I need not explore. There were ample
links here. The outer limits of the test may, however, well be coterminous with
the requirements of international comity.

 

77.              As I have already noted, in some of the
early cases the English courts tended to express a narrow view of the
territorial application of English law so as to ensure that they did not unduly
infringe on the jurisdiction of other states. However, even as early as the
late 19th century, following the invention and development of modern means of
communication, they began to exercise criminal jurisdiction over transnational
transactions as long as a significant part of the chain of action occurred in
England. Since then means of communications have proliferated at an
accelerating pace and the common interests of states have grown
proportionately. Under these circumstances, the notion of comity, which means
no more nor less than ""kindly and considerate behaviour towards
others"", has also evolved. How considerate is it of the interests of the
United States in this case to permit criminals based in this country to prey on
its citizens? How does it conform to its interests or to ours for us to permit
such activities when law enforcement agencies in both countries have developed
cooperative schemes to prevent and prosecute those engaged in such activities?
To ask these questions is to answer them. No issue of comity is involved here.
In this regard, I make mine the words of Lord Diplock in Treacy v. Director
of Public Prosecutions cited earlier. I also agree with the sentiments
expressed by Lord Salmon in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Doot, supra,
that we should not be indifferent to the protection of the public in other
countries. In a shrinking world, we are all our brother's keepers. In the
criminal arena this is underlined by the international cooperative schemes that
have been developed among national law enforcement bodies.

 

78.              For these reasons, I have no difficulty in
holding on the facts agreed upon for the purpose of this appeal, that the
counts of fraud with which the appellant is charged may properly be prosecuted
in Canada, and I see nothing in the requirements of international comity that
would dictate that this country refrain from exercising its jurisdiction. Since
these fraudulent activities took place in Canada, it follows for the reasons
set forth in the Chapman case that the conspiracy count may also be
proceeded with in Canada. 

 

79.              Under these circumstances, I need not
enter into a discussion of the apparent conflict between the English case of Board
of Trade v. Owen and the Canadian cases such as Bachrack, Ecrement
and Shulman regarding the situation where substantially the only overt
act that takes place in Canada is the agreement, the substantive offence taking
place abroad. There may be a danger, particularly in relation to common law
conspiracy, for this country in essence to engage in punishing acts that take
place wholly in another country that are not criminal there. This appears to be
the major consideration underlying the judgment of the House of Lords in Owen.
There is cogency in the argument but there are countervailing arguments that
have found favour in the Canadian cases. Since those cases were decided
Parliament has provided in s. 423(3)  of the Criminal Code  that a person
who conspires to do anything referred to in subss. 423(1) and (2) in a place
outside Canada that is an offence there shall be deemed to have conspired to do
that thing in Canada. In establishing an offence under that provision it is
necessary not only to prove that the accused violated foreign law outside
Canada, but also that that act would have constituted a crime in Canada; see Bolduc
v. Attorney General of Quebec, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 573. However, s. 423(3) has
no application here; the substantive offence in this case took place in Canada.

 

80.              For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

                   Appellant, while trying to take back possession of
his repossessed vehicles, used a rifle to gain entry, loaded it, and pointed it
before police arrived and disarmed him. Following this incident, four charges
were laid: (1) attempting to steal while armed (s. 302(d)); (2) using a
firearm while attempting to commit an indictable offence (s. 83); (3) having
unlawful possession of a weapon (s. 85); and (4) unlawfully pointing a firearm
(s. 84). Appellant pleaded guilty to the first charge and, after submissions
were received as to whether he could be convicted on the others, was found guilty
on the second and fourth charges. An appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was
dismissed. The issue on appeal concerns the principle against double jeopardy
at common law and under the Charter  when multiple charges arise out of
the same transaction.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed with respect to the conviction on the fourth count but should be
dismissed in all other respects.

 

                   The Kienapple principle does not apply to
prevent conviction under s. 83 by reason of the accused's conviction of robbery
as defined by s. 302(d). Section 83, which prohibits the use of a
firearm while committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,
requires proof of use of a firearm an ingredient that is additional to and
distinct from what is required to be proven under s. 302(d), which
merely requires that the accused be armed.

 

                   ""Fundamental justice"", within the meaning
of s. 7  of the Charter , is not breached by convicting an accused,
already convicted of robbery, of a second offence punishable by mandatory
imprisonment for using, as opposed to being armed with, a firearm while
committing that robbery. It is doubtful that the creation of this offence,
which in this case is in substance an aggravated form of robbery, constituted a
departure from fundamental justice.

 

                   The Kienapple principle applied so as to
absolve the appellant from being convicted of pointing a firearm, under s. 84,
in view of his conviction under s. 83. When an essential ingredient of an
offence includes the use of a firearm, such as the offence against pointing,
Parliament did not intend by s. 83 to make the same objectionable behaviour the
subject of two separate offences, each with its own penalty. No separate and
distinct offence is created where both sections concern the use of a firearm and
this cannot be altered by the fact that a particular use is specified.

Background

 

2.                The appellant was charged with the
following offences:

 

1. ...that he, on or about
the 12th day of October 1981 at the City of Sault Ste. Marie in the District of
Algoma, did unlawfully attempt to steal a Ford Pick‑Up Truck, and a Buick
automobile from Town and Country Towing, while armed with an offensive weapon,
to wit: Browning 308 rifle, contrary to sections 303  and 421  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, and

 

2. ... that he on or about
the 12th day of October, 1981 at the City of Sault Ste. Marie in the District
of Algoma, did use a firearm, to wit: a Browning 308 Rifle bearing serial
number 3377731, while attempting to commit an indictable offence, contrary to
section 83(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, and

 

3. ... that he on or about
the 12th day of October, 1981 at the City of Sault Ste. Marie in the District
of Algoma, did unlawfully have in his possession a weapon, to wit: a Browning
308 rifle bearing serial number 3377731, for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace, contrary to section 85  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, and

 

4. ... that he on or about
the 12th day of October, 1981 at the City of Sault Ste. Marie in the District
of Algoma, did unlawfully and without lawful excuse, point a firearm, to wit: a
Browning 308 Rifle bearing serial number 3377731, at Jim McAllister, contrary
to section 84(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

3.                The applicable provisions, so far as
relevant, read as follows:

 

                   83. (1) Every one who uses a firearm

 

(a) while
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,

 

                                                                    ...

 

whether or not he causes
or means to cause bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of
an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (2) A
sentence imposed on a person for an offence under subsection (1) shall be
served consecutively to any other punishment imposed on him for an offence
arising out of the same event or series of events and to any other sentence to
which he is subject at the time the sentence is imposed on him for an offence
under subsection (1). 

 

                   84. (1) Every one who, without lawful excuse, points a firearm at another
person, whether the firearm is loaded or unloaded,

 

(a) is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years; or

 

(b) is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   85. Every one who carries or has in his possession a weapon or imitation
thereof, for a purpose dangerous to the public peace or for the purpose of
committing an offence, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years.

 

                   302. Every one commits robbery who

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) steals from any
person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.

 

4.                The appellant pleaded guilty to the
first count and not guilty to the remaining counts. The Crown, with the consent
of the appellant, then read the facts in support of the plea of guilty and of
the other counts. Those facts are as follows:

 

5.                During the first two weeks of August
1981, while the appellant and his wife were visiting friends in Sault Ste.
Marie, their car and truck were repossessed by a finance company and taken to
the premises of Town and Country Towing. They returned to visit the same
friends on October 10 or 11 and on October 12 the appellant became adamant
about taking his two vehicles back. At 8:30 p.m. that evening he ordered his
wife and son into a truck, and taking a Browning 308 rifle with him, said that
he was going to Town and Country Towing to get his vehicles back and that he
would shoot anybody who got in his way.

 

6.                When they arrived at the premises of
Town and Country Towing, they found the door to the office locked and one Jim
McAllister inside. The appellant knocked on the door and, when McAllister
responded, the appellant lifted the rifle and ordered McAllister to open the
door. As McAllis­ter complied with this demand the appellant ordered him to
walk back and as he did so he heard the mechanism of the rifle being loaded.
Subsequently, the rifle was lifted so that it was pointed in the general
direction of McAllister. In the course of the discussion which ensued between
the appellant and McAllister, the police arrived at the scene. Aware of their
arrival, McAllister grabbed the rifle, pushed the appellant and pinned him
against the wall. On checking the rifle, the police found a shell in the
chamber and three in the clip. The rifle was subsequently test‑fired and
found to be capable of firing.

 

7.                The charges were heard by Vannini D.C.J.
who, on October 25, 1982, found the appellant guilty on the first count,
attempted theft while armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to ss. 303  and
421  of the Criminal Code . The case was then adjourned to allow the
parties to prepare submissions regarding the question whether the appellant
could be convicted on the remaining counts. 

 

8.                On December 9, 1982, the trial judge
[(1982), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 324] further found the appellant guilty of the second
count, using a firearm while attempting to commit an indictable offence
contrary to s. 83(1)(a) of the Code, as well as of the fourth
count, pointing a firearm at another person contrary to s. 84(1) . These two
counts, he found, were distinct and separate from the first count and from one
another so that the principle against double jeopardy, enunciated in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, was inapplicable.

 

9.                In his view, however, the principle
applied in respect of the third count, possession of a weapon contrary to s. 85
of the Code. The factual elements constituting this offence were
substantially the same as those involved in the first count, attempting to
steal while armed with an offensive weapon.

 

10.              The trial judge then discussed the
possible application of the Charter . Since, in his view, the offences of
which the appellant was charged were separate and distinct offences, the
multiple convictions of the appellant did not constitute a deprivation of his
right to liberty or security in violation of the principles of fundamental
justice under s. 7  of the Charter  or of his right not to be retried for
a crime for which he had already been acquitted or found guilty and punished
under s. 11 (h) of the Charter . Nor, he added, did the multiple
convictions and consequent punishment constitute cruel and unusual punishment
under s. 12  of the Charter .

 

11.              An appeal to the Court of Appeal of
Ontario was dismissed [(1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (note)]. On June 6,
1983 the appellant was given leave to appeal to this Court.

 

Argument on Appeal

 

12.              On this appeal the argument on behalf of
the appellant may thus be summarized. At common law the principle nemo debet
bis puniri pro uno delicto prohibited punishing an offender twice for the
same offence. The pleas of autrefois acquit and convict could be
raised to prevent that occurrence. The principle came to be understood as also
comprising nemo bis vexari which prohibited multiple convictions arising
out of the same wrongful act. The bis vexari principle was expanded by
Laskin J. (later C.J.C.) in the Kienapple case, supra, at p. 751,
in the following terms: 

 

                   If
there is a verdict of guilty on the first count and the same or substantially
the same elements make up the offence charged in a second count, the situation
invites application of a rule against multiple convictions....

 

13.              This is really an application of res
judicata to criminal law and it is not concerned with whether the two
offences are the same but whether the accused is being punished for
substantially the same factual occurrence. Where an act underlies an offence,
the same act cannot be used again to constitute the factual basis of a
conviction for another offence. Laskin J., in Kienapple, thus put it, at
p. 750:

 

The relevant inquiry so
far as res judicata is concerned is whether the same cause or matter
(rather than the same offence) is comprehended by two or more offences.
Moreover, it cannot be the case that if an accused is tried on several counts
charging different offences, he is liable to be convicted and sentenced on each
count, and yet if he was tried and convicted on one only he would be entitled
to set up the defence of res judicata as a defence to other charges
arising out of the same cause or matter.

 

14.              Counsel for the appellant contends that
the conviction of the accused of attempted robbery while armed with a firearm,
coupled with his conviction for using a firearm while attempting to commit an
indictable offence, was contrary to the principle set forth in Kienapple.
So too was his conviction for the offence of pointing a firearm contrary to s.
84(1) . Counsel conceded, however, that Parliament could abrogate the Kienapple
principle by apt legislation and, indeed, that this court in McGuigan v. The
Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 284, had held that an accused could be convicted of
robbery under s. 302(d) and of using a firearm while committing an
offence under s. 83(1) (a) even though this was contrary to the Kienapple
principle. Dickson J. (now C.J.C.), speaking for the majority of the Court in
that case, said at p. 318:

 

                   In my
view Parliament has in the enactment of s. 83 departed from the fundamental
common law principle of the criminal law that nemo debet bis puniri pro uno
delicto, elaborated in Kienapple, and has shown that the use of a
firearm in the commission of the offence of robbery shall also constitute a
separate and distinct offence under s. 83 for which a separate and additional
(increased in the case of second or subsequent offence) punishment shall be
imposed.

 

15.              Counsel, however, sought to get around
this difficulty by relying on ss. 7  and 11 (h) of the Charter 
which read as follows:

 

                   7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and
the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles
of fundamental justice.

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(h) if finally
acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found
guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again.

 

 

16.              These provisions, which, he underlined,
were enacted after the McGuigan case, were intended to elevate the
principle against multiple convictions or double punishment to the status of an
entrenched constitutional right. In short, he argued, Parliament can no longer
abrogate the rule in Kienapple.

 

Sections 83 and 302(d)

 

17.              Before looking into the Charter 
issues, it is, I think, useful to examine the threshold question of the
application of the Kienapple principle in relation to ss. 83  and 302 (d).
Section 302 (d) makes it an offence to steal from any person while
armed with an offensive weapon. Section 83  by contrast provides that every
one who uses a firearm while committing or attempting to commit an
indictable offence is guilty of an offence. Not only is the particular
offensive weapon particularized by s. 83 ; it requires that the firearm be used.
It must be remembered that the principle in the Kienapple case is
ultimately grounded in the doctrine of res judicata. That doctrine would
apply to prevent conviction for both offences if the difference between the two
was limited solely to the fact that s. 83  particularizes the form of
weapon since the specific weapon was, of course, the weapon used in both
offences. But s. 83 also requires that the firearms be used, an act
not necessarily encompassed in being armed with it, and there was
evidence of use apart from that of being armed. In short, to be convicted of an
offence under s. 83  it was necessary to prove that the accused did
something beyond what is required to establish the offence under s. 302 (d).

 

18.              It is not like the offence under the third
count of being in possession of a weapon under s. 85 of the Code, which
the trial judge rightly held to fall within the Kienapple principle, for
if one is armed with a firearm, one must necessarily be in possession of an
offensive weapon, since the latter expression includes a firearm. By contrast,
as Dickson J. noted in the McGuigan case, at p. 318, the use of a
firearm is not an essential ingredient in the crime of robbery under s. 302(d),
and it was not necessary to prove that he used the firearm to establish that he
was armed with it. As he further observed, however, the purpose and effect of
s. 83 was to impose an additional penalty for what is, in a case like the
present, in effect, an aggravated form of robbery. To convict an accused under
that section it must be established that the accused did something more than is
required for the offence of robbery, namely that he used a firearm. 

 

19.              My own view is that the words used in the
two provisions are clear enough to arrive at this result without relying on a
specific intention of Parliament or on antecedent law. However, in the context
in which McGuigan was decided, these concerns were uppermost in the
minds of the judges who decided it. As a result, Dickson J. stressed that
Parliament, by restructuring s. 83, clearly contemplated multiple prosecutions
and convictions where the use of firearms was involved and that this
displacement of the Kienapple principle must be respected by the courts.
This served to distinguish the previous decision of this court in R. v. Quon,
[1948] S.C.R. 508, which had interpreted the predecessor provision to s. 83 as
restricted to offences of which possession of a firearm was not an essential
element. But this predecessor provision applied to the possession of a
firearm. The specific intention of Parliament in enacting s. 83 to cover new
ground became evident when it chose to employ the word ""use"" rather
than ""has upon his person"", i.e., possession, as was done in
the predecessor provision. Parliament's intention was to preclude the
application of the Kienapple principle and has, of course, to be
respected.

 

20.              But it is important for our purpose to
underline the manner in which Parliament achieved this purpose. This was done
by creating a new and distinct offence that precluded the application of the Kienapple
principle. To convict an accused under the new offence, an additional
ingredient had to be established beyond what was required to prove robbery as
defined by s. 302(d). Not only must he be armed (and so in possession)
of a firearm; he had to use it to be convicted under the new s. 83.

 

21.              This approach is inherent in various parts
of Dickson J.'s judgment but his reliance on Martin J.A.'s judgment in the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 138,
underlines his position. In his concluding remarks Dickson J. had this to say
[at p. 319]:

 

                   For the
foregoing reasons, and for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Martin in the Langevin
case, I conclude that the conviction on the charge of attempted armed
robbery did not preclude a conviction on the charge under s. 83 of the Code.
I would dismiss the appeal. 

 

(Emphasis is mine.)

 

22.              When one turns to the remarks of Martin
J.A. in R. v. Langevin, supra, which deals with the same two provisions,
one finds the following statement at p. 145: 

 

                   Being
""armed"" with an offensive weapon and ""using"" an offensive
weapon are not synonymous. A person is ""armed"" with an offensive
weapon if he is equipped with it: see R. v. Sloan (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d)
190 at p. 192. ""Using"" a firearm includes pulling out a firearm which
the offender has upon his person and holding it in his hand to intimidate
another: see Rowe v. The King (1951), 100 C.C.C. 97 at p. 101, [1951] 4
D.L.R. 238, [1951] S.C.R. 713 at p. 717. Notwithstanding that in most cases of
""armed robbery"" the offender will have used the weapon, none the
less, s. 83 (1) , by making the use of a firearm an essential element of the
offence created by the subsection, unlike s. 122 which required only that
the offender have a firearm on his person, imports a further element in
addition to those which suffice to constitute theft while armed with a firearm.

 

                   The
introduction of the requirement of the use of the firearm while committing or
attempting to commit an indictable offence also removes some of the absurdities
referred to in R. v. Quon, supra, and to which a literal
interpretation of s. 122 led, when applied to offences involving possession of
a firearm.

 

23.              In coming to this conclusion, Martin J.A.
placed considerable stress, as had Dickson J., on Parliament's specific
intention in enacting s. 83(1) (a). That is scarcely surprising. Section
83(1) (a) formed part of extensive revisions of the Criminal Code 
popularly known as the ""gun control"" legislation which clearly
revealed, in Dickson J.'s words, at p. 317, that parliament was ""gravely
concerned with the proliferation of firearm‑related crime"" and that
it intended to impose severe restrictions on the use of firearms. In
interpreting words like ""armed"" and ""using"", the penumbrae
of which have considerable overlap, the courts must, in attempting to unravel
Parliament's intention, necessarily closely examine the context in which the
legislation was enacted. The specific selection of the word ""use""
rather than ""possession"" in that context served to underline what
Parliament had in mind.

 

24.              That this was the essential problem in McGuigan
is also evident from the language of Laskin C.J. who dissented. He did not read
into the gun control legislation a Parliamentary intention to override the Kienapple
principle and his decision was grounded in his view that there really was no
substantial difference between ""using"" a firearm in s. 83 and being
in ""possession"" of a firearm, the expression employed in its
predecessor section (s. 122) and dealt with in the Quon case. Thus
at p. 299 of his judgment he says: 

 

The pistol or revolver
brandished by the robber in the Quon case to intimidate the victim, was
clearly in his possession within the then s. 122; and it could be said that it
was ""used"", if that expression had then been in s. 122.
""Use"" was, of course, the basis of the s. 83(1) (a) conviction
in Langevin and also in the present case. Of course, if in the Langevin
case or in the present case the accused had committed a robbery while in
possession of an offensive weapon, but without using the weapon (and I
postulate a distinction between possession and use), then he could not in any
event have been charged under s. 83(1) (a).

 

25.              He further reasoned that there was no
substantial difference between being ""armed"" with a firearm and
""using"" it. Thus he says at p. 301:

 

To hold a person guilty
under s. 83(1) (a) where he has pleaded or been found guilty of robbery,
that is theft while armed with a firearm, carries no clear distinction for me
from a conviction of robbery while armed with a firearm which the accused
brandished resulting in an acquittal in Quon of being in possession of a
firearm while committing robbery.

 

26.              In sum, as in McGuigan, there were
in the present case factual elements of use in addition to mere possession, specifically
the loading and the pointing of the firearm. The Kienapple principle
has, therefore, no application here in relation to the offences under ss. 83
and 302(d).

 

The Charter 

 

27.              I come now to the Charter , and
first to s. 7 . I have gone at length into the McGuigan case to underline
that the essential question there was whether the word ""use"" imported
an ingredient into s. 83(1) (a) not present in the offence of robbery
while ""armed"" as defined in s. 302 (d). So put, it seems to me
that we are not concerned solely with a situation where Parliament redefines an
existing provision or displaces the Kienapple principle. For Parliament
could enact such provisions when there was no relevant earlier legislation and
it could do so in such precise words that the interpretation problem in McGuigan
did not arise. That would not violate the rule in Kienapple or, for that
matter, any other settled rule against multiple convictions. The question,
then, is not so much whether Parliament can displace the Kienapple
principle, but whether ""fundamental justice"" within the meaning of s.
7  is breached by convicting an accused who has already committed a robbery of a
second offence punishable by mandatory imprisonment for using, as opposed to
being armed with, a firearm in committing that robbery. 

 

28.              That brings us squarely to what Parliament
has done and why it has done it; not how it has done it. Now what Parliament
has done in this case, we saw, is in substance to create an aggravated form of
robbery, to punish more severely an accused who uses a firearm in perpetrating
that offence by imposing an additional penalty including a mandatory period of
imprisonment. Parliament's reason for so acting was its grave concern with the
proliferation of firearm‑related crime.

 

29.              That this aggravated form of robbery
exposes the victim to serious injury or death and that there has been a
proliferation of such firearm‑related offences in recent years scarcely
needs demonstration. Under these circumstances, the creation of such an offence
does not, in my view, constitute a departure from fundamental justice.

 

30.              Whether Parliament would in certain
circumstances be prevented by s. 7  from defining or redefining a single
transaction so as to create a series of offences for no obvious reason I need
not consider. Nor need I consider whether, in a particular situation, the
imposition of a mandatory sentence offends against the principles of
fundamental justice or constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. These issues
were not argued before this Court.

 

31.              In view of my conclusion on the question
of multiple convictions, it becomes unnecessary to discuss s. 11 (h) of
the Charter . 

 

Sections 83 and 84

 

32.              There remains the question whether the Kienapple
principle applies so as to absolve the appellant from being convicted under the
fourth count of pointing a firearm under s. 84 in view of his conviction on
other counts. I shall, for the moment, confine my remarks to the interplay
between that section and s. 83. It is obvious that pointing a gun is a manner
of using it and at first blush the Kienapple situation would seem to
apply when a person is charged with offences under both provisions. The trial
judge, however, saw the particularizing of pointing s. 84 as providing an
additional ingredient like that in McGuigan sufficient to indicate an
intention by Parliament to create a separate and distinct offence. There were,
he noted, many different ways in which a firearm may be used. His reasoning
appears in the following paragraph [at p. 336]:

 

                   In the
case now before me the accused made ""use"" of the firearm by producing
it, then by loading it and then by pointing it as well. Because a firearm may
be used within the meaning of s. 83(1) (a) in many ways other than by
pointing it at another and Parliament created the offence under s. 83 and the
offence under s. 84 at the same time, I do hold that they are separate and
distinct offences and that by reason thereof ss. 7 , 11  and 12  of the Charter 
and the principle of Kienapple do not foreclose a conviction for both
offences with the punishment therefore to be governed by the
""disproportionality principle.""

 

If by this statement the trial judge meant that a person might be
convicted of both offences even where there was no other evidence of use other
than the pointing, I cannot agree with him. It is true that Dickson J. in McGuigan
stressed the difference between ""use"" and ""armed"" and con­cluded
that use meant something more than being armed. The use as so construed was necessary
to bring s. 83 into operation. Here we have the reverse situation, the
extra ingredient being in the offence of pointing.

 

33.              It may be, however, that the courts below
thought that the accused should be convicted of both offences because there was
evidence of other types of uses of the firearm sufficient to support a charge
under s. 83 either as additional to the robbery or the pointing charge. This
poses a more difficult problem from a purely logical standpoint. The fact is,
however, that all these types of uses were brought forward in a prosecution for
all these charges. Moreover, in the case of the pointing charge, one would be
securing a conviction on the more serious charge on the basis of a use
preparatory to, and less dangerous than, the pointing. So far as the robbery is
concerned, the accused, it must be remembered, is already receiving additional
punishment under s. 83 for having used a firearm during its commission. 

 

34.              Practical considerations such as these
militate against a too rigorous application of logic in attempting to discern
Parliament's intention. The trial judge's analogy from McGuigan does not
appear to me to be persuasive. As I see it, it is quite reasonable to hold that
Parliament intended to create an offence of using a firearm while engaged in a
robbery that is separate and distinct from the offence of robbery. Indeed, it
is hard to imagine what Parliament could reasonably have intended by s. 83 if
it did not expect it to apply to robbery and other offences where the use of
firearms is most prevalent. Particularly is this so in the context I have
already described.

 

35.              But when an essential ingredient of an offence,
such as the offence against pointing, includes the use of a firearm, it is
difficult to believe that Parliament intended by s. 83 automatically to make
the same objectionable behaviour the subject of two separate offences, each
with its own penalty. And, as I mentioned, if a firearm is used in the
commission of another offence, s. 83 provides a far more serious penalty than
for pointing it, fourteen years imprisonment with minimum periods of
imprisonment as opposed to five years. It would, therefore, require far clearer
language than appears in the legislation to persuade me that Parliament
contemplated the type of result that prevailed below.

 

36.              The foregoing conclusion receives support
from R. v. Langevin, supra. There Martin J.A., we saw, also
stressed the ingredient of using a firearm in s. 83 in addition to being
armed with it, which is the requisite under s. 302(d). But he saw a
clear distinction between that situation and one involving the offence of
pointing. At page 145 he had this to say:

 

                   Mr.
Hunt conceded during argument that it would not be reasonable to interpret s.
83 as applying to offences which by their definitions in the Code
require the use of a firearm as a constituent of the offence, for example,
pointing a firearm at another (s. 84(1)  (rep. & sub. idem)) and
discharging a firearm with intent to wound (s. 228).

 

37.              More recently, Martin J.A., again speaking
for the Ontario Court of Appeal, reiterated this view in R. v. Allison and Dinel
(1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 30, a case involving a multiplicity of offences decided
after the decision of the trial judge in the present case. Martin J.A. there
dealt with the interrelationship of a charge under s. 83 and one of wounding
and maiming under s. 228. The latter section creates a series of offences, some
of which include the discharge of a firearm as a constituent element to the
offence while others require instead the causing of bodily harm. In his view,
s. 83 could not be invoked in the case of offences requiring the discharge of a
firearm. After quoting the passage from Langevin just cited, he added
the following remarks at p. 40: 

 

                   We see
no reason to change the opinion expressed in that case. We do not think it
would be sensible to construe that section as enabling s. 83 to be invoked in
those circumstances. Such an indictment would, in effect, allege that A, while
committing the indictable offence of pointing a firearm (or discharging a
firearm with intent, etc.), did unlawfully use a firearm, contrary to s. 83. We
would not think such an interpretation of s. 83 would be sensible or should be
ascribed to Parliament.

 

38.              As can be seen from that case, this
approach can at times lead to fine distinctions. This, however, should not
obscure the fundamental differences between the two situations with which we
are dealing. In making the major amendments known as the gun control
legislation, Parliament must have intended to create a further deterrence to
the use of firearms in offences such as robbery that may be committed without
the use of a firearm but where such use is prevalent. But these considerations
have no bearing where the principal offence itself requires as a necessary
ingredient the use of a firearm. It is difficult to see what distinct and
separate offence is created in such a case, both being concerned with the use
of a firearm, and I fail to see how this can be altered by the fact that a
particular use is specified in the principal offence. Accordingly, the Kienapple
principle should apply in relation to the second and fourth counts. The gravity
of the offence under s. 83(1) (a) being greater, I do not think a verdict
of guilty should have been entered in respect of the charge of pointing. The Charter 
argument does not, therefore, arise in this context.

 

Conclusion

 

39.              For these reasons I would allow the appeal
against conviction on the fourth count, quash the conviction thereon and order
a verdict of not guilty to be entered in lieu thereof. In other respects, the
appeal should be dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Obscenity ‑‑
Possession of obscene articles for purpose of sale ‑‑ Whether
articles publications ‑‑ Words “For Adults Only” not relevant in
determining whether publication obscene ‑‑ Test of obscenity ‑‑
Criminal Code , s. 159(2) (a), (8) .

 

                   Appellant was found guilty under s. 159(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code  of having in his possession for the purpose of sale
various obscene articles. Appellant operated a shop specializing in the sale of
erotic articles. The name of the shop, ""National Sexe Boutique"", was
written on a sign above the windows of the establishment and on the door the
words ""For Adults Only"" were written. In July 1977 the police seized
forty‑five articles at his shop, all concerned with satisfying the sexual
desires of men or women. These articles were displayed where they could be seen
by the public entering the store. Relying on the definition of obscenity in s.
159(8)  of the Criminal Code , the Municipal Court judge ruled seventeen
of the articles seized obscene and found appellant guilty. The articles ruled
obscene were in the same category as those in Dechow v. The Queen,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 951. In that case, the articles were accompanied by a printed
description in language the dominant characteristic of which was the undue
exploitation of sex. In the case at bar only one of the articles was
accompanied by such a description. The conviction was upheld by the Superior
Court and the Court of Appeal.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre, Chouinard, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: The articles ruled obscene by
the Municipal Court judge were publications within the meaning of s. 159(8)  of
the Criminal Code . The word ""publication"", defined by this
Court in Dechow, means an article the character of which is made public.
In the case at bar the sign outside, ""National Sexe Boutique"", above
the windows of the shop, and the laying out of the articles inside the shop,
displayed to the view of visitors, suffices to make public the character of the
material offered for sale. It is not necessary for the articles to have been
accompanied by a printed description. 

 

                   The lower courts did not err by failing to take into
account the context in which the articles were displayed, in determining the
parameter of Canadian community tolerance. The words ""For Adults
Only"" over the shop door are not a factor in determining whether a
publication is obscene. This Court has already held in Towne Cinema Theatres
Ltd. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, that the audience viewing a film or
other publication is not relevant in determining whether the film or
publication is obscene.

 

                   Finally, the Municipal Court judge and the Court of
Appeal did not confuse tolerance and morality in their assessment of the
parameter of Canadian community tolerance.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Lamer, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: In determining whether the articles in the
possession of appellant for the purpose of sale were obscene, it is not
necessary first to consider whether the articles were publications. Section
159(8)  of the Criminal Code  provides a definition of obscenity
with regard to publications. This definition must be applied whether or not the
articles in question are publications.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Lamer J.: A majority of this Court decided in Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd.
that the target audience is not relevant in determining whether an item is
obscene and we respect that decision.

 

                   Per Wilson J.: I agree
with Chouinard and La Forest JJ. that the appeal should be dismissed.

                   (8) For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is
the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following
subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene. 

 

9.                

                   The Municipal Court judge stated the following:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
On July 7, 1977 two police officers, armed with a search warrant, went to the
store operated by the accused at 723, Mont‑Royal St. East, in Montreal,
and seized forty‑five assorted articles. All were concerned with
satisfying the sexual desires of men or women.

 

                   These
articles were displayed where they could be seen by the public entering the
store. The latter had three windows: two facing on Mont‑Royal Street and
one on Resther Street. There was a door opening on Mont‑Royal Street.
Above the two windows of Mont‑Royal Street, the name of the shop was
written on a sign: ""National Sexe Boutique"". On the door the words
""For Adults Only"" were written.

 

10.              Seventeen of the seized articles were
ruled obscene by the Municipal Court judge, who listed them.

 

11.              These articles were in the same category
as those at issue in Dechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951. They were
there described in general terms as sex stimulators.

 

12.              In Dechow a majority of the Court
held that these articles were publications within the meaning of s. 159  of the Criminal
Code  and that, in accordance with the definition of obscenity given by
subs. (8) of that section, they were obscene.

 

13.              Ritchie J. wrote for the majority, at p.
966: ""The issue in my view must therefore turn on the meaning to be given
to the word `publication'""; and he concluded as indicated above.

 

14.              First, appellant sought to make a
distinction between that case and the one at bar, otherwise it would be fatal
to his argument on the question of whether publications were involved.

 

15.              As Lagacé J. of the Superior Court
correctly observed, there are only two differences between the two cases. The
first is that, unlike in Dechow, in the case at bar ""For Adults
Only"" was written on the door. The phrase ""For Adults Only"" will
be discussed in examining the second and principal argument of appellant. The
second difference is that in Dechow all the articles were accompanied by
""framed printed descriptions of the articles phrased in language the
dominant characteristic of which was the undue exploitation of sex"",
whereas in the case at bar only one of the seventeen articles ruled obscene was
accompanied by a description. 

16.              Appellant's argument was that it was
because of this description accompanying the articles that the Court classified
them as publications.

 

17.              This argument may be based on various
passages from the reasons of Ritchie J., in particular the following, at p.
968:

 

                   I agree
with the courts below that the articles here in question, displayed as they
were in conjunction with the printed explanations of their use, were to be
judged by the standard laid down in s. 159(8) ....

 

18.              In the opinion of the Superior Court
judge, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, this is not the meaning that should be
given to the case. The judge wrote:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
Contrary to the defence arguments, we consider that Dechow does not make
it a prerequisite that the articles at issue should be accompanied by a
description written in language the dominant characteristic of which is the
exploitation of sex. Depending on the circumstances, it may suffice for the
articles offered for sale to the public to have such a characteristic.

 

19.              In so finding the Superior Court judge
relied on the following passage from the reasons of Ritchie J., at pp. 966‑67,
saying that it [TRANSLATION]  ""should suffice to refute this defence
argument and restore to that case its true meaning"":

 

                   It was
contended on behalf of the appellant that none of the materials of which he was
found to be in possession was a ""publication"" so that the provisions
of s. 159(8)  could not apply and there being no other statutory standard of
obscenity, resort must be had to the common law.

 

                   With
the greatest respect for those who may hold a different view, I am of opinion
that, when the plain and ordinary meaning is given to the language used in s.
159(8)  it is to be construed as referring only to publications, nothing else is
mentioned in that section, and it appears to me to be straining the language
there used to construe it as being directed to any other form of expression.
The issue in my view must therefore turn on the meaning to be given to the word
""publication"". In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary this word is
defined in part as follows:

 

The action of publishing
or that which is published.

 

1. The action of making
publicly known; public notification or announcement; promulgation. Notification
or communication to those concerned, or to a limited number regarded as
representing the public ...

 

2. The issuing, or
offering to the public, of a book, map, engraving, piece of music, etc.; also
the work or business of producing and issuing copies of such works . . . b. a
work published; a book or the like printed or otherwise produced and issued for
public sale . . . 

 

 

                   We are
not concerned here with the meaning derived from the verb ""to
publish"" but rather with the noun, i.e., ""publication"", and in
this latter sentence the given meaning is ""that which is published""
and this is made manifest by the example given under 2. b. in the definition,
namely, ""a work published; a book or the like printed or otherwise
produced and issued for public sale."" This latter definition was adopted
by Maclean J.A. in writing the reasons for judgment for the majority of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R. v. Fraser, [1966] 1
C.C.C. 110, aff'd [1967] S.C.R. 38, at p. 121, where the statutory definition
was held to apply to moving pictures, and in the case of R. v. Cameron,
[1966] 4 C.C.C. 273, appeal quashed [1967] S.C.R. v., Laskin, J.A., as he then
was, in the course of his dissenting reasons for judgment wherein he found that
the pictures there in question were not obscene, had occasion to observe, at p.
301, speaking of the counsel in that case, that:

 

They also agree that the
term ‘publication’, awkward as it is to embrace paintings or drawings, should
be taken as being comprehensive enough to do so. In the result, the inquiry to
be made is whether in the case of each picture `a dominant characteristic . . .
is the undue exploitation of sex'.

 

                   It is
apparent therefore that although the conclusion that the word
""publication"" applied to paintings or drawings was founded on an
agreement of counsel, it was nevertheless the basis upon which all judges in
that case treated the problem before them.

 

20.              I share the view of the Superior Court and
the Court of Appeal on this point, and in my opinion one may further rely on
the following passage, at p. 967, which comes immediately after the passage
cited above:

 

                   I cannot
escape the conclusion that in making it publicly known by two large signs on
either side of the entrance to his store, that it was dealing in erotic
material and by displaying the articles in question in glass cases plainly
visible to the public who entered his store and which were accompanied in each
case by framed printed descriptions of the articles phrased in language the
dominant characteristic of which was the undue exploitation of sex, the
appellant was making the character of his wares publicly known and they
therefore fell into the category of articles that were published and that were
""printed or otherwise produced and issued for public sale..."". The
articles in question were, therefore, in my opinion, publications within the
meaning of s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code .

 

21.              I conclude from this passage that in the
view of the Court ""publication"" extends to an article the character
of which is made public. In Dechow the accused made this character
public in three ways: (i) by informing the public, by two large signs on each
side of the entrance to his store, that it was dealing in erotic material; (ii)
by displaying the articles in question in glass cases plainly visible to the
public who entered his store; (iii) by accompanying the articles by framed
printed descriptions the dominant characteristic of which was the undue
exploitation of sex. Though all three of these methods of publication were
present in Dechow, nothing in that case requires that they should be so.
In the case at bar, there were two: the sign outside, about which the Municipal
Court judge wrote: [TRANSLATION]  ""The sign ‘National Sexe Boutique’
surrounded by about 100 flashing lights is likely to attract attention"";
and the laying out of the articles inside ""displayed to the view of the
public entering the store"". This in my opinion suffices to make public the
character of the material offered for sale; and if it were necessary to decide
the point, I would be prepared to find that the mere fact of displaying to the
view of visitors would be sufficient. 

 

22.              This first argument by appellant is
without foundation.

 

23.              Appellant's second argument, and the one
on which discussion principally centred in this Court, is that the Court of
Appeal failed to take into account the context in which the articles were
displayed, inside a store on the door of which the words ""For Adults
Only"" were written. This argument was made with respect to the Court of
Appeal, the judgment of which is on appeal, but it could equally well be made
with respect to the Superior Court and the Municipal Court judge, who also did
not mention the point. Counsel for the appellant said in his submission:

 

[TRANSLATION]  The
judgment of the Court of Appeal is also wrong in law in that the three judges
completely failed to take into consideration the display context
guideline as a factor in determining the parameter of Canadian community
tolerance.

 

24.              Appellant relied on precedent in this
regard, in particular the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Sudbury News Service Ltd. (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 1. Howland C.J.O. wrote
for the Court, at p. 8:

 

                   The
next question which arises is the extent to which the manner and circumstances
of distribution are relevant in determining whether or not a publication is
obscene. There are some publications which are so blatantly indecent that they
would not be tolerable by the Canadian community under any circumstances. Some
pictures are offensive to the majority of people to the point that the Canadian
community would not tolerate them on a billboard, or on the cover of a
magazine, or on a television screen where persons of all ages and sensibilities
would be exposed to them, but would be prepared to tolerate them being viewed
by persons who wished to view them. Some pictures would not be acceptable by
Canadian community standards in a children's bedtime story‑book or primer
but would be in a magazine for general distribution. The Canadian community
might be prepared to tolerate the exhibition of a motion picture to an adult
audience, but would consider the exhibition of the same motion picture to a
general audience, which included children, to be an undue exploitation of sex.
Similarly, the general distribution of certain magazines to a neighbourhood
store accessible to all ages would not be tolerable, whereas the distribution
of such magazines to ""adult"" bookstores to which children under a
certain age were not admitted might not be objectionable. The packaging and
pricing of a publication may also be relevant in considering whether Canadian
community standards have been exceeded. The distribution of magazines in plastic
covers marked ""adult"" in some respects might act as an attraction
rather than a deterrent unless the price was high enough to place it beyond the
reach of most children. 

 

25.              At page 10, he stated:

 

In my opinion, the manner
and circumstances of distribution are relevant in determining whether the
standards of tolerance by the Canadian community have been exceeded. Here the
distribution was to ordinary confectionery stores who made their merchandise
available to the general public. In my opinion, the Canadian community would be
less tolerant in the case of such distribution than they would be in the case
of distribution to stores who only made sales to persons 18 years of age and
over, or who confined their sales to publications of legitimate interest to
particular segments of the Canadian community, such as, for example, writers
and artists. It is not necessary in this appeal to consider to what extent the
Canadian community would extend greater tolerance to publications which were
enclosed in a plastic dust cover and were labelled ""For sale only to
adults"" as that was not the method of distribution in this appeal.

 

26.              Appellant further cited Working Paper No.
10 of the Canada Law Reform Commission, titled Limits of Criminal Law‑‑Obscenity:
A Test Case (1975), which states at p. 47:

 

                   So
should obscenity be against the criminal law? In our view, yes, and no. Public
obscenity‑‑like other nuisances that give offence‑‑can
rightly be the subject of the criminal law. Private obscenity‑‑which
causes little, if any, harm, and which doesn't threaten significantly‑‑on
the whole cannot. That's not to say that it can't be the subject of other types
of law.

 

27.              It also states at p. 48:

 

In detail, it would mean
that pornography [sic] stores, pictures and so on carefully restricted
to ""adults only"" would be allowed.

 

28.              Since the hearing of the case at bar,
however, this Court has held in Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, that the audience viewing a film or other publication is
not relevant in determining whether the film or publication is obscene. 

 

29.              That case disposes of appellant's second
argument. There is no distinction, in my view, between a film ""For Adults
Only"" shown in a cinema and the articles at issue displayed and offered
for sale in a store access to which is restricted to adults.

 

30.              The third argument made by appellant is
that the Court of Appeal, like the Municipal Court judge, confused tolerance
and morality. This argument reads as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  The
majority opinion by Monet J.A. (concurred in by Montgomery J.A.) is wrong in
law in its assessment of the parameter of Canadian community tolerance, in that
it confuses a simple reference to the concept of morality and an assessment
based essentially on the said concept of morality.

 

31.              In Towne Cinema this Court, in
deciding what constituted undue exploitation within the meaning of s. 159(8) of
the Code, formulated an objective standard, that of tolerance accepted
in contemporary Canadian society. In the reasons of Dickson C.J., it said at p.
508:

 

What matters is not what
Canadians think is right for themselves to see. What matters is what Canadians
would not abide other Canadians seeing because it would be beyond the
contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see it.

 

32.              In the case at bar, appellant recognized
that the Municipal Court judge had correctly stated the problem when he wrote:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
Is this exploitation undue? Is a reasonable Canadian citizen willing to
tolerate the distribution and sale of such articles? Were the articles offered
for sale and displayed to the view of the public entering the accused's
establishment beyond the limits of tolerance of an average reasonable Canadian
in 1977, taking into account the increasingly liberal atmosphere prevailing
throughout the Canadian community in recent years?

 

33.              However, appellant objected to the fact
that the judge stated his finding as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  . . . I
consider that the following articles offered for sale by the accused are likely
to offend the innate sense of morality of the average Canadian and constitute
an undue exploitation of sex. They are therefore obscene.

 

34.              This passage may seem ambiguous. However,
it must be read in its context, that is with the judgment as a whole. Moreover,
if there is any ambiguity it is dissipated by the Superior Court judge, who
wrote in this regard, and was affirmed by the Court of Appeal: 

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
If we had had to write this part of the judgment we might well have said, as
Hugessen J. did in the recent case of Priape Enrg. et Leblanc et Duchesne v.
Le Sous‑Ministre du Revenu National, [[1980] C.S. 86], after
referring to the relevant case law, that:

 

 

. . . the test of undue
exploitation of sex is whether the accepted standards of tolerance of the
contemporary Canadian community as a whole have been exceeded.

 

Though the trial judge
chose to express himself differently, in our opinion the facts of the case
fully justify the conclusion that the accepted standards of tolerance of the
average Canadian have been exceeded in the way required by the test of Hugessen
J. in Priape, supra: so that there is no reason to intervene, even if the proposition
of law may have been badly expressed on the question of what constitutes undue
exploitation of sex.

 

35.              Appellant's third argument is also without
foundation.

 

36.              I would dismiss the appeal.

                   English version of the reasons of Le Dain and La

38.              La
Forest J.‑‑I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for
judgment of my brother Chouinard J., and I agree with him that the appeal
should be dismissed. I also concur in his reasons. However, I would dispose of
the first ground of appeal, concerning the meaning of the word
""obscene"" for the purposes of s. 159  of the Criminal Code , on
a broader basis.

 

39.              Section 159(2) (a), under which the
accused was convicted, prohibits the sale or exposing to public view of obscene
matter. In determining whether the articles in the possession of the accused
for the purpose of sale were obscene Chouinard J., following Ritchie J. in Dechow
v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951, first considered whether in the
circumstances those articles were publications, since in that case the
definition of obscenity with regard to publications, contained in s. 159(8) ,
applies. As the articles were similar to those at issue in Dechow, he
concluded that they were obscene publications under that subsection.

 

40.              Although it is possible to arrive at this
conclusion by this means, I think that it is preferable to dispose of the
question more directly. In my view obscenity has the same meaning whether or
not the articles at issue are publications. It is true that the route taken by
Chouinard J. had already been indicated by Ritchie J., who wrote the majority
judgment in Dechow; but in Dechow, the charge was laid under s.
159(1), which deals primarily with publication and other activities of that
kind. Section 159(2) (a), on the other hand, deals with the sale of
articles and their exposure to public view. These articles may undoubtedly be
publications. But can it reasonably be concluded that if the articles in
question in the present case were not publications, a different meaning could
be given to the word ""obscene"" in this provision? I do not think so.
I share the view expressed by the late Laskin C.J., in his concurring reasons
in Dechow, that the word ""obscene"" must be given the same
meaning whether or not the articles in question are publications, that is, the
meaning which appears in s. 159(8) . 

 

41.              For many years the courts relied on the
definition of obscenity formulated in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B.
360. More recently, however, this definition has been seriously criticized both
in the courts and in academic writings. In Brodie v. The Queen, [1962]
S.C.R. 681, for example, Judson J. described it as ""vague, difficult and
unsatisfactory to apply"". It is worth noting that in the recent decision
in Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, Dickson
C.J., in a judgment concurred in by Lamer and Le Dain JJ., said at p. 502:

 

It [the rule stated in s.
159(8) ] supersedes rather than supplements the much‑criticized test
enunciated by Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin. . . .

 

Although in that case the Chief Justice's observation concerned films,
it nonetheless suggests that application of the old rule is questionable to say
the least. In this state of flux, especially in a matter so related to public
opinion as obscenity, the courts should pay particular attention to what is
said by Parliament, even when it does not directly address the point at issue.
This is especially true here, for if we applied the old definition to articles
which are not publications, not only would we be giving a different definition
to the word in the same provision, we would be applying a harsher definition in
less serious circumstances, as for example in the case of a private sale by
someone not a merchant.

 

42.              It is true that the opinion of Ritchie J.
in Dechow was a majority opinion. Nevertheless, he did not indicate that
he disagreed with the reasons of Laskin C.J. Rather, he simply said, at p. 968,
that he ""[did] not find it necessary to consider what test is to be
applied in determining whether or not matters other than publications are
obscene"". This was quite natural in the circumstances of Dechow,
where the charge was based on s. 159(1) of the Code, dealing primarily
with publications. That is not true in s. 159(2) (a), and the fact that a
publication is involved in the case at bar is only a matter of chance.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Powers of Court of
Appeal ‑‑ Errors at trial ‑‑ Trial judge failing to
limit cross‑examination of accused and misdirecting jury on alibi defence
‑‑ Errors prejudicial to accused ‑‑ Section
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code inapplicable to uphold conviction ‑‑
Criminal Code, s. 613(1) (a)(iii), (b)(iii).

 

                   The Court of Appeal dismissed appellant's appeal
against his conviction for gross indecency under s. 157  of the Criminal Code .
Because of the strength of the Crown's circumstantial case against the
appellant, the Court of Appeal applied the proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code to uphold the conviction despite its findings (1) that the
Crown's cross‑examination of appellant dealing with his previous sexual
conduct was improper and ""could only unfairly prejudice the
appellant"" and (2) that the trial judge's direction with respect to
appellant's alibi evidence was wrong and also prejudicial to him. This appeal
is to determine whether the Court of Appeal erred in the application of s.
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed. 

 

                   The Court of Appeal erred in applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code to uphold the conviction. The proviso of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
applies only where a court of appeal is of the opinion that on the ground of a
wrong decision on a question of law an appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, and where it is also of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred. Here, the trial judge's failure to limit
the cross‑examination was an error of mixed law and fact and,
accordingly, the conviction could not be saved by the application of the
proviso. Having found that the abusive cross‑examination was unfairly
prejudicial to the appellant, the Court of Appeal should have allowed the
appeal on the basis that there had been a miscarriage of justice under s.
613(1)(a)(iii) of the Code.

1.                McIntyre
J.‑‑This is an appeal against the judgment of the Ontario
Court of Appeal, dated June 2, 1982, which dismissed the appellant's appeal
against his conviction for gross indecency under s. 157  of the Criminal Code .
The appeal was dismissed by the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code
after findings that the cross‑examination of the appellant by Crown
counsel at trial ""could only unfairly prejudice the appellant"", and
that an error in charging the jury to the effect that ""mere disbelief in
the alibi evidence could be used as evidence of guilt itself"" was wrong
and was prejudicial to the accused.

 

2.                The appellant was charged with
committing an act of gross indecency with one Kenneth Jodoin, contrary to s.
157  of the Criminal Code , and with indecent assault on Kenneth Jodoin,
contrary to s. 156 of the Code (since repealed). He was tried at Hamilton
before His Honour Judge Clare and a jury and convicted on both counts. His
appeal to the Court of Appeal (Jessup, Brooke and Cory JJ.A.) was allowed in
part. The conviction under s. 156 of the Code was quashed but the appeal
against the gross indecency conviction under s. 157  was dismissed.

 

3.                On May 27, 1981, the complainant was
attacked in his apartment at about 1: 00 a.m. He had been undergoing
hormone treatment in preparation for what was described as a ""sex‑change
operation"", and was dressed as, and had assumed the appearance of, a
woman. He was planning to leave his apartment when he heard a motor vehicle
stop in front of the building. He saw a man, whom he later identified as the
appellant, enter the building. The man asked Jodoin for a beer. The complainant
said he had no beer, but at the visitor's request he allowed entry to his
apartment because the visitor wished to use the washroom. When in the apartment
the visitor attacked the complainant. There was a struggle and a forced act of
fellatio by the complainant. The assailant then left. 

 

4.                There was evidence of identification of
the appellant, including evidence relating to his clothing, and also evidence
identifying the licence number of the motor vehicle which was correct to within
one digit of the licence number of the appellant's vehicle. There was, as found
by the Court of Appeal, a very strong circumstantial case against the
appellant. The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He denied having been
the attacker and swore he was not at the complainant's apartment building on
that occasion though he had visited another tenant of the block on another
occasion. He gave an account of his movements on the night in question, which
placed him elsewhere than the scene of the crime and which was supported by
witnesses called on his behalf. The jury, having heard all the evidence,
clearly disbelieved the appellant and convicted him.

 

5.                During the trial, Crown counsel (not
counsel on this appeal) conducted a repetitive and improper cross‑examination
of the appellant. The trial judge interfered on two occasions cautioning Crown
counsel but did not prevent the continuation of the examination. Evidence of
previous sexual conduct of the appellant unrelated to the offence charged had
been admitted as part of the Crown's case. The Court of Appeal considered that
its admission was improper. The cross‑examination dealt extensively with
that evidence. The appellant was challenged to explain away or account for the
evidence of Crown witnesses, and it is apparent from a reading of the
transcript that the appellant became upset and emotionally disturbed by the
constant repetition of questions which he had already answered. These facts
appear to have led the court to interfere. The Court of Appeal was of the view
that the cross‑examination was improper. Brooke J.A., with whom Cory J.A.
agreed, after noting that the case for the defence depended on the jury's view
of the evidence of the appellant and his witnesses to his alibi, said: 

 

As to the cross‑examination,
while the evidence led in the cross‑examination was to some extent
relevant to show that the appellant was in the building where the complainant
resides and at the hour that she says that he was there, it went too far when
the appellant's sexual conduct on another occasion was introduced in the cross‑examination
and, in particular, when Crown counsel persisted in this regard over the
accused's denial. Crown counsel sought and was permitted to lead that evidence
which was not really relevant to the issue and could only unfairly prejudice
the appellant. Nothing further need be said about the misdirection that mere
disbelief in the alibi evidence could be used as evidence of guilt itself. This
Court has dealt with such matters on a number of other occasions. The direction
was wrong and, of course, was prejudicial to the accused.

 

He concluded because of the strength of the Crown's circumstantial case
it was a proper case for the application of the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code.

 

6.                In this Court it was contended by the
appellant that the application of the proviso was improper and that it
constituted reversible error. It was contended that the impropriety of the
cross‑examination raised at most a question of mixed law and fact and,
accordingly, it could not be the subject of the application of the proviso.
Furthermore, the error found by the Court of Appeal to be ""unfairly
prejudicial"", even if considered an error of law, was not such an error
that the proviso should have been applied. The Crown argued that the impugned
cross‑examination viewed in the context of the admissibility of evidence
did raise a question of law, and one to which the proviso could apply. It was
also argued that, apart from questions of admissibility of evidence, the
impugned cross‑examination could raise questions concerning the fairness
of the proceedings. The nature or manner in which cross‑examination is
conducted does not necessarily raise a question of law to which the proviso may
apply, but does raise an issue whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred
under s. 613(1) (a)(iii). However, the Court of Appeal, it was said, made
no error in law in holding that there had been no miscarriage of justice.

 

7.                The relevant portions of s. 613  of the Criminal
Code  are set out hereunder:

 

                   613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a
verdict that the appellant is unfit, on account of insanity, to stand his
trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty on account of insanity, the
court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the
appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

                                                                    ...


 

(ii) the judgment of the
trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question
of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there
was a miscarriage of justice;

 

(b) may dismiss the
appeal where

 

                                                                    ...

 

(iii) notwithstanding that
the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii)
the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

 

The proviso may be applied by the Court of Appeal only where it has
formed the opinion that the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant
because of a wrong decision on a question of law, and where it is also of the
opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. This
is clear from the wording of the statute and, indeed, was accepted by the Crown
in its factum.

 

8.                The errors at trial were enumerated by
Jessup J.A. in his short judgment ""for the judge's future guidance"".
They were stated to be that:

 

 

 

(1)  He charged the
jury that mere disbelief of the alibi evidence could be used as evidence of
guilt itself.

 

(2)  He permitted
evidence of the appellant's sexual conduct unrelated to this offence, although
it was not similar fact evidence and he permitted the Crown to cross‑examine
on that evidence.

 

(3)  The trial judge
erred when he said to the jury ""It is your duty to give the benefit of the
doubt to the accused, but having done so, to convict if you believe guilt is
established.""

 

Points (1) and (3) are errors of law. Point (2) is the error on which
the appellant bases the principle part of his argument. The appellant raises
two propositions. He argues, firstly, that the Court of Appeal has found that
the abusive cross‑examination was unfairly prejudicial to the appellant.
The Court of Appeal should, therefore, have allowed the appellant's appeal on
the basis that there had been a miscarriage of justice under s. 613(1) (a)(iii).
The application of the proviso, it was argued, was reversible error because the
Court of Appeal had no power to apply the proviso unless an error of law could
be shown. The error in permitting the abusive cross‑examination was, at
most, one of mixed law and fact and, accordingly, the conviction could not be
saved by the application of the proviso. Secondly, the appellant contended
that, even if the error with respect to the cross‑examination could be
considered to be an error of law, it was of such a nature that the Court of
Appeal erred in applying the proviso to dismiss the appeal. 

 

9.                Was the failure of the trial judge to
restrain the abusive cross‑examination an error of law? Of course, a
legal element was involved in the decision which faced the trial judge. The
question of admissibility of evidence is a question of law. Crown counsel has a
right in law to cross‑examine the accused and, accordingly, to deny that
right or unduly limit it raises considerations of law. There are, however,
limits to the extent of the cross‑examination and the manner in which it
may be conducted, and there is always a discretion in the trial judge and a
duty to confine the cross‑examination within proper limits. There is, of
course, no doubt that in cross‑examination in criminal cases,
particularly where questions of credibility of witnesses are in issue, a wide
latitude is accorded to counsel and too fine a line should not be drawn to confine
or limit a detailed and searching inquiry into the matters raised by the
evidence given by the accused and other witnesses. The discretion to intervene
in a cross‑examination must, of course, be exercised judicially. Its
exercise does not rest on legal considerations alone, but will depend as well
on the facts and circumstances in each case, and will not be determined by the
simple application of a fixed rule of law. The decision to exercise the
discretion to intervene in cross‑examination, or to refrain from
intervention, is one involving considerations of both law and fact and cannot
be said to be a question of law alone. Each case will depend on its own
circumstances, and no doubt there will frequently be difficulty in deciding
from case to case whether the point has arrived in a cross‑examination
where the trial judge should intervene. It is in this case abundantly clear,
however, that that point was reached and passed. The trial judge was obviously
concerned at the course the cross‑examination was taking. He did
intervene on at least two occasions to caution counsel and to attempt to
restrict counsel within proper limits, but this did not affect the cross‑examination
in any significant way. That he was in error in this regard was found by the
Court of Appeal and it was noted by Brooke J.A. that it ""could only
unfairly prejudice the appellant"". 

 

10.              The Court of Appeal, despite its finding
of prejudice, relied on the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code . It applied the proviso to dismiss the appeal. In this, it is my view
that they were in error. Section 613(1) (b)(iii) permits of the
application of the proviso only where it is of the opinion that on the ground
of a wrong decision on a question of law an appeal might be decided in favour
of the appellant, but it is also of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred. Here no error of law alone is relied upon,
and the error in failing to limit the cross‑examination may not be
relieved against by the application of the proviso. Prejudicial error had been
found and the appellant, in my view, was entitled to have the court consider
whether the appeal should have been allowed under the provisions of s. 613(1)(a)(iii)
of the Code on the ground that a miscarriage of justice had occurred.

 

11.              I find it impossible to conclude that no
miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the appellant's cross‑examination.
A person charged with the commission of a crime is entitled to a fair trial
according to law. Any error which occurs at trial that deprives the accused of
that entitlement is a miscarriage of justice. It is not every error which will
result in a miscarriage of justice, the very existence of the proviso to relieve
against errors of law which do not cause a miscarriage of justice recognizes
that fact. However, I am not able to say that an error which, in the words of
Brooke J.A., ""could only unfairly prejudice"", would not by itself
cause a miscarriage of justice. It would be wholly inconsistent with a finding
of unfair prejudice in a trial to find, nonetheless, that no miscarriage of
justice occurred. In my opinion, the Court of Appeal, having found as it did,
ought to have allowed the appeal under s. 613(1) (a) (iii) of the Criminal
Code . For these reasons, s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code could
not influence the decision and further exploration of that section in dealing
with the second or alternative argument raised by the appellant is unnecessary.

 

12.              I would allow the appeal.

                   Appellant and a fellow constable, O'Donnell, were
charged jointly with second degree murder and tried before a judge sitting with
a jury. They had been called to investigate a complaint that Hollett, the
victim, was interfering with traffic. O'Donnell hailed Hollett who after a few
questions walked away. O'Donnell left the police van and went after him. A
struggle ensued. Appellant, who had remained in the van, heard O'Donnell's
shout, saw Hollett holding O'Donnell's hair and ran to the scene. He ordered
Hollett to release O'Donnell and when Hollett failed to do so, appellant told
him he was ""under arrest for assaulting a police officer"". Appellant
tried to restrain Hollett who only released O'Donnell's hair when the latter
struck him several times in the head and chest. He was eventually subdued and
taken to a hospital where he died two weeks later from complications of
injuries received during the altercation. At trial, O'Donnell was convicted of manslaughter
and appellant was acquitted. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
Appeal Division, dismissed O'Donnell's appeal but allowed the appeal against
the acquittal of the appellant on the grounds that the trial judge had
misdirected the jury as to the justified use of force by a police officer and
as to the mental element required for aiding or abetting manslaughter and that
he had failed to point out the evidence that could support a finding of
manslaughter against the appellant. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial of
the appellant on the included offence of manslaughter.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   The Court of Appeal erred, in so far as the
appellant was concerned, in holding that the trial judge misdirected the jury
as to the lawful or justified use of force by a police officer by conveying the
impression that a police officer is justified in using necessary force to carry
out an investigation short of arrest. Assuming, without expressing an opinion,
that the trial judge's charge to the jury on the lawful or justified use of
force, which purported to be, and was essentially, based on the terms of s.
25(1)  of the Criminal Code , might have been misleading with respect to
Constable O'Donnell, it could not have been misleading with respect to the
appellant because of his different position with respect to the power of
arrest. It was open to the jury on the evidence to conclude, in the context of
the trial judge's charge as a whole, that the appellant was exercising the
power, under s. 450(1) of the Code, to arrest Hollett as a person who he
had reasonable grounds for believing was apparently committing the criminal
offence of assault, that he was justified in using necessary force for such
purpose, and that he did not use excessive force. In considering the effect, in
relation to the appellant, of the trial judge's statements based on s. 25 
concerning the use of force, the Court of Appeal failed to take into account
the different positions of the two police officers with respect to the power of
arrest. 

 

                   There was also no error in the trial judge's charge
with respect to the mental element required to become a party to an offence by
aiding or abetting. In view of his earlier clear direction on the difference,
in respect of mens rea, between murder and manslaughter, the trial
judge's charge could not have confused or misled the jury into thinking that
aiding or abetting manslaughter required an intention to kill that manslaughter
itself did not. The trial judge's charge taken as a whole left the jury with a
sufficient understanding of the mental element required for aiding or abetting
manslaughter.

 

                   Finally, the trial judge did not fail to indicate
the evidence that could support a finding of manslaughter against the
appellant. The trial judge set out the contentions of the parties, as well as
the applicable law, and made a very full summary of the relevant evidence. He
clearly indicated the possibility of manslaughter. He did not have a duty to
relate specific portions of the evidence to the issue of manslaughter, in so
far as the appellant was concerned.

3.                The voluminous evidence is summarized in
the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal. I venture a brief statement of
facts which it was open to the jury to find in order to indicate the general
background of the issues in the appeal.

 

4.                On July 27, 1980 the appellant, a police
officer in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and a fellow constable, Harry O'Donnell,
were called to the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge, which connects Dartmouth and
Halifax. The bridge traffic officer was having difficulty removing a pedestrian
who was interfering with traffic by walking on the traffic lanes while
attempting to hitch‑hike. The constables had also received a report that
a patient was missing from the Nova Scotia Hospital and could have gone in the
direction of the bridge. By the time the two officers reached the bridge, the
pedestrian, Earle Hollett, had moved into the intersection of Nantucket Avenue
and Wyse Road, a busy junction near the bridge on the Dartmouth side, where he
appeared to be obstructing traffic. The constables parked their police van, and
O'Donnell called Hollett over. The two spoke briefly. Hollett then turned and
walked away. O'Donnell got out of the van and went after Hollett. A struggle
between them ensued. O'Donnell gave a shout. The appellant, who had apparently
not seen what was happening up to this point, came around the back of the
police van to O'Donnell's aid. He saw that Hollett had hold of O'Donnell's
hair. The appellant ordered Hollett to release O'Donnell. When Hollett failed
to do so, the appellant told him he was ""under arrest for assaulting a
police officer"". The appellant then attempted to put a restraining hold on
Hollett while calling for help on his belt radio. When Hollett would not
release his hold on O'Donnell's hair O'Donnell struck him repeatedly in the
head and chest. Hollett was eventually subdued with the help of two other
police officers. He was put in the back of the police van and taken to the Dartmouth
General Hospital. On arrival at the hospital Hollett did not seem critically
injured. Soon afterwards, however, he suffered a respiratory arrest and fell
into a coma. He was taken to the Victoria General Hospital in Halifax, where it
was discovered that he suffered from ankylosing spondylitis, an arthritic
disease of the spine that had rendered it rigid and brittle and particularly
vulnerable to serious injury from the kind of blows he had received. Hollett
died at the Victoria General Hospital on August 11, 1980. In the opinion of the
Chief Medical Officer, who performed the autopsy, the cause of death was
cerebral anoxia, or lack of oxygen to the brain, as a result of respiratory
arrest which was a direct complication of the injuries Hollett had received in
the area of the neck and upper chest. 

 

5.                The appellant and Constable O'Donnell
were charged jointly with second degree murder and tried before Clarke J. of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting with a jury. O'Donnell was convicted
of manslaughter. The appellant was acquitted.

 

6.                The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal
Division (1982), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 333, dismissed the appeal against the conviction
of Constable O'Donnell but allowed the appeal against the acquittal of the
appellant on the grounds that the trial judge had misdirected the jury as to
the justified use of force by a police officer and as to the mental element
required for aiding or abetting manslaughter and had failed to point out the
evidence that could support a finding of manslaughter against the appellant. In
ordering a new trial of the appellant on the included offence of manslaughter
the Court of Appeal held that the verdict would not necessarily have been the
same had the trial judge properly instructed the jury.

 

7.                The appellant contends that the Court of
Appeal erred in these conclusions.

 

8.                These then are the issues in the appeal:

 

(a)               Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the trial judge misdirected the jury as
to the lawful or justified use of force by a police officer?

 

(b)               Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the trial judge misdirected the jury as
to the mental element required for aiding or abetting manslaughter?

 

(c)               Did
the Court of Appeal err in holding that the trial judge failed to indicate the
evidence that could support a finding of manslaughter against the appellant?

 

                                                                    II

 

9.                In his directions to the jury concerning
the lawful or justified use of force by police officers the trial judge
referred to several sections of the Criminal Code , including s. 27 
respecting the use of force to prevent the commission of an offence, ss. 34  and
35  respecting the use of force in self defence and s. 26  respecting the use of
excessive force. The direction which was found by the Court of Appeal to have
been in error was based on s. 25(1) of the Code, which reads as follows:


 

                   25. (1) Every one who is required or authorized by law to do anything in
the administration or enforcement of the law

 

(a) as a private
person,

 

(b) as a peace
officer or public officer,

 

(c) in aid of a
peace officer or public officer, or

 

(d) by virtue of
his office,

 

is, if he acts on
reasonable and probable grounds, justified in doing what he is required or
authorized to do and in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.

 

10.              After referring to the defence contention
that the police constables were carrying out their duties under the provincial Motor
Vehicle Act, the by‑laws of the Halifax‑Dartmouth Bridge
Commission and the provincial Hospitals Act when the encounter with Hollett
began, and after reading s. 25  to the jury, the trial judge made the following
statements, purporting to be based on the terms of s. 25 , concerning the
justified use of force by police officers:

 

...again, under that
Section 25 , every person acting as a peace officer or in aid of a peace officer
in the administration or enforcement of the law is, if he acts on reasonable
and probable grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to
do and in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.

 

                                                                    ...

 

It appears to me that in
responding to the call of Sergeant Purcell, the police officers can be said to
be carrying out an investigation within their authority. They responded to the
call as police officers. They went there as police officers. They approached
Hollett in the course of their duties as police officers. Whether in the
subsequent events which occurred after Constable O'Donnell left the driver's
seat of the van and Cluett left the passenger seat of the van, the Constables
abused their duty and authority in any way, is a matter I leave with you.
Police officers are authorized to use such force as is reasonable, proper and
necessary to carry out their duties, providing that no wanton or unnecessary
violence is imposed. What is reasonable and proper in the particular
circumstance, and in the particular case, will depend upon all the
circumstances. It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rule, except
the test of reasonableness. If the police officer in carrying out his authority
acts on reasonable and probable grounds, he is justified in doing what he is
required to do and in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Therefore, if a police
officer is doing anything in the administration or enforcement of the law and
who is required or authorized to do so, he is, if acting on reasonable and
probable grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to do and
in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose. 

 

11.              The Court of Appeal found these statements
to be a misdirection by the trial judge as to the lawful or justified use of
force by a police officer. Jones J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of
the Court, appears to have concluded from the context in which the statements
were made that the trial judge was of the view and conveyed to the jury the
impression that a police officer was justified in using necessary force to
carry out an investigation short of arrest. After referring to a statement to
the jury by counsel for Constable O'Donnell suggesting that the issue was
whether the constables had used excessive force in investigating a complaint,
Jones J.A. said (at pp. 345‑47):

 

That statement was based
on the legal premise that even if Mr. Hollett had not been arrested the
officers were entitled to use whatever force was necessary to have him return
to the van in order to identify him and complete the investigations they had
undertaken.

 

                   It is
apparent that the learned trial judge accepted that position. He gave the jury
extensive instructions on a number of provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act,
the Hospitals Act, 1977 (N.S.), c. 45, and the Bridge Commission
Regulations, all intended to establish that the officers had reason to believe
that Mr. Hollett was committing a number of offences and hence the officers
were in the lawful execution of their duty when they approached him. After
referring to these various provisions the trial judge instructed the jury on
the provisions of s. 25  of the Criminal Code  and the powers of a police
officer under the Police Act, 1974 (N.S.), c. 9. The trial judge then
stated [and here Jones J.A. quoted the second of the three passages quoted
above from the trial judge's charge to the jury].

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   It is
necessary to examine whether the trial judge was correct in instructing the
jury that under s. 25 of the Code the officers were justified in using
as much force as necessary to generally carry out the lawful execution of their
duty. With respect, I am unable to agree that s. 25 of the Code or
the common law supports that position. I should note at the outset that I have
no doubt on the evidence that the officers were in lawful execution of their
duty, certainly up to the time that they called Mr. Hollett over to the van....


 

                   The
undoubted duty of a police officer is to investigate crimes and to ask
questions of citizens for that purpose, and in some circumstances to insist on
answers, but that does not imply any right to detain a person or to use force
for that purpose short of arrest.

 

12.              After referring to several decisions with
particular reference to the power of arrest, including the judgment of this
Court in R. v. Biron, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 56, Jones J.A. concluded on this
issue as follows (at pp. 351‑52):

 

There should be no doubt
that the police are not entitled to use force unless an arrest is warranted and
has been properly made. The obligation to inform a citizen of the reasons for
arrest ensures that police officers will exercise their powers properly and
with some degree of discretion.

 

                   From
these authorities I think it is clear that the direction in this case regarding
the use of force was in error. If the constables failed to arrest Mr. Hollett
when they first approached him and to give him the reasons why he was being
arrested the arrest was unlawful and the officers were not acting in the
execution of their duty. In the result they were not justified in using force
by virtue of s. 25 of the Code. Their apprehension of Mr. Hollett
constituted an assault which he was entitled to resist at common law and by
virtue of s. 34(1) of the Code which provides:

 

                   34. (1)
Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is
justified in re‑ pelling force by force if the force he uses is not
intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is
necessary to enable him to defend himself.

 

13.              Counsel for the appellant conceded that
the direction of the trial judge with respect to the use of force, if viewed in
isolation from the particular position of the appellant, might have left the
impression with the jury that a police officer was justified in using necessary
force to restrain a person short of arrest for the purpose of carrying out an
investigation, and that this would have been an error. He submitted, however,
that in considering the effect of this direction, in so far as the appellant
was concerned, the Court of Appeal failed to take into account the different
positions of the appellant and O'Donnell with respect to the power of arrest.

 

14.              The appellant testified that he had not
observed how the struggle between O'Donnell and Hollett began, that when he
responded to O'Donnell's cry he called on Hollett to release his hold on
O'Donnell's head, and that when Hollett refused to do so, the appellant
arrested him, informing him that he was being arrested for assaulting a police
officer. Because of the importance in this case of the difference in the
positions of O'Donnell and the appellant with respect to the power of arrest I
think it is desirable to quote the following testimony of the appellant as to
what happened after O'Donnell left the van to go after Hollett: 

 

 

 

Q.               You made mention that he walked away. Do you know
in what direction he walked?

 

A.                Yes, it was in a southwesterly direction away
from the driver's door of the van.

 

Q.               At that time, do you know how far he walked?

 

A.                No, Sir. I lost sight of him once he got away
from the driver's door.

 

Q.               What if anything did Constable O'Donnell do at
that time?

 

A.                Constable O'Donnell got out of the driver's door
of the truck and went in the direction of the man.

 

Q.               For what period of time was he.. was he in your
sight at all times?

 

A.                No, I lost sight of Constable O'Donnell as well,
so then I just stayed seated in the passenger seat and I was looking out front,
and I was looking across to the Esso Centre and I noticed a group of people
there getting gas and, just glaring around and then I heard a holler.

 

Q.               Now, what type of holler did you hear?

 

A.                It was..it's a little difficult to describe it
was just a loud holler. Not a moan but like somebody hollering like a
""AHHHHH"" type of thing. And, my automatic reaction being two‑man
and when the other guy leaves the van, I just leaned forward and looked, and at
that time I saw that the man had Constable O'Donnell in the top of the head in
a bent over at the waist position.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Q.               And, what did you do upon your arrival?

 

A.                Upon the arrival I said on two occasions to the
man, I said ""Get your arms off my partner's head"". I said that twice,
one after another. ""Get your hands off my partner's head"".

 

Q.               What was Constable O'Donnell doing at this time?

 

A.                He was hollering at the top of his voice
""Get the...guy off...it hurts... get him off"".

 

Q.               And, what if anything did Mr. Hollett do at this
time?

 

A.                Didn't seem to jar him. From what I observed as
I mentioned he was standing there, his arms were just anchored right in the top
of Constable O'Donnell's hair and his arms straight, and his arms and his head
were quivering just like he was cold, and he had a moaning like
""Ahhh ...ssss ...ahhh"" (?) that type of groaning coming
from him. So, at that time, I said ""You're under arrest for assaulting a
police officer"". 

 

15.              Constable O'Donnell also testified that
the appellant arrested Hollett, informing him that he was being arrested for
assaulting a police officer, after telling him to release his hold on O'Donnell's
hair.

 

16.              In his charge to the jury the trial judge
stressed the importance of bearing in mind that there were two accused and that
the case against each of them must be considered separately. He said at one
point in his charge:

 

Now, remember please that
there are two accused. You have to consider each separately and render a
verdict for each one.

 

To the same effect he said later in his charge:

 

Each accused is charged on
a common indictment, but each accused is entitled to have his guilt or
innocence as to the crime charged determined from his own conduct and from the
evidence which applies to him as if he were being tried alone. Each of the
accused then in that sense must be considered separately. Evidence which is
before you may relate to one of the accused and not to the other accused. In
that sense you cannot necessarily accept the evidence for or against one
accused as being for or against the other accused. In the end, you will have to
render a verdict, meaning a separate verdict, with respect to each of the
accused. That is to say, you will render a verdict with respect to each of the
accused, considered separately, which may or may not be the same verdict.

 

17.              The trial judge referred to the power of
arrest without warrant conferred by s. 450(1) (b) of the Criminal Code 
where a police officer finds a person apparently committing a criminal offence.
The direction concerning the justified use of force, based on the terms of s.
25 of the Code, immediately followed the instructions concerning the
power of arrest. The trial judge put to the jury the defence based on arrest
and the right to use necessary force to effect arrest. He directed the jury's
attention to the evidence of the appellant and O'Donnell with respect to the
appellant's arrest of Hollett. 

 

18.              On this evidence it was open to the jury
to conclude in the context of the trial judge's charge as a whole, that the
appellant was exercising the power, under s. 450(1)(b) of the Code,
to arrest Hollett as a person who, he had reasonable grounds for believing, was
apparently committing the criminal offence of assault (see Roberge v. The
Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 312 at pp. 324‑25), that he was justified in
using necessary force for such purpose, and that he did not use excessive
force. I am far from satisfied that the trial judge's charge to the jury with
respect to the justified use of force by a police officer, which purported to
be, and was in fact, based essentially on the terms of s. 25 of the Code,
was clearly calculated to convey the impression to the jury that a police
officer was justified in using necessary force to carry out an investigation
short of arrest. But assuming that that direction might have been misleading in
so far as the position of Constable O'Donnell was concerned, I do not think
that it could have misled the jury with respect to the appellant because of his
different position with respect to the power of arrest. Clearly the jury was
able to distinguish the positions of the two constables. The Court of Appeal,
although it noted the evidence of the appellant's arrest of Hollett, failed to
distinguish the positions of the two constables with respect to the power of
arrest, as indicated by the following statement of Jones J.A.: ""If the
constables failed to arrest Mr. Hollett when they first approached him and to
give him the reasons why he was being arrested the arrest was unlawful and the
officers were not acting in the execution of their duty."" That the Court
of Appeal failed to attach significance to the different positions of the
appellant and O'Donnell with respect to the power of arrest, in considering the
effect of the direction as to the use of force in the appellant's case, is
further indicated, I think, by the statement of Jones J.A. that misdirection as
to the use of force and as to the mental element required for aiding or
abetting manslaughter provided the only plausible explanation of how the jury
could have reached a different verdict with respect to the two accused. For
these reasons I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal erred in holding
that there was misdirection by the trial judge concerning the use of force, at
least in so far as the appellant was concerned, calling for the setting aside
of the appellant's acquittal. 

 

                                                                   III

 

19.              The conclusion of the Court of Appeal that
the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the mental element required for
aiding or abetting manslaughter was based on the following statement by the
trial judge: ""Of course, such a person who is alleged to have aided or
abetted another person to commit an offence must have done so with a guilty
intent before he can be found guilty of the offence itself."" That
statement was part of a rather long charge on the mental element required to
become a party to an offence under s. 21(1) of the Code by aiding or
abetting the principal offender, in the course of which the trial judge used a
variety of expressions to characterize the required state of mind or conduct.
The essential emphasis in the trial judge's charge on this point was that there
must be an intent to aid or abet, as reflected in the following statement:
""There must be intentional encouragement or assistance in the commission
of the crime for an accused to be guilty of aiding or abetting."" The
charge on the mental element required for aiding or abetting followed a very
full and clear exposition of the difference, in respect of mens rea, between
murder and manslaughter, in the course of which the trial judge said: ""No
intention to kill or cause bodily harm of the nature I have described need be
proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a verdict of
manslaughter. Manslaughter is unintentional killing resulting from an unlawful
act...."" 

 

20.              The reasoning and conclusion of the Court
of Appeal on this issue is indicated in the following passages from the reasons
for judgment of Jones J.A. (at pp. 368‑69):

 

Having initially
instructed the jury that no intention to kill was necessary to convict of
manslaughter, in referring to parties, the trial judge mentioned the need for
""guilty intent"" without explaining what was meant to the jury. The
question of intent was vital, of course, if a person was a party to the offence
of murder. The Crown argues that it was necessary for the trial judge at this
point to explain to the jury the mens rea required of a party to the
offence of murder or manslaughter and to distinguish between the two offences.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   To aid
or abet the offence of manslaughter it was only necessary for Constable Cluett
to know that an unlawful assault was taking place or if a lawful arrest had
been effected that excessive force was being used. No other intention was
necessary. The distinction between parties to the offences of murder and
manslaughter was not made clear to the jury.

 

21.              I am of the opinion that there was no
error in the trial judge's charge with respect to the mental element required
to become a party to an offence by aiding or abetting, and that his charge on
this question could not have confused or misled the jury, in view of his
earlier clear direction on the difference, in respect of mens rea,
between murder and manslaughter, into thinking that aiding or abetting
manslaughter required an intention to kill that manslaughter itself did not. As
I have said, the trial judge's charge to the jury on the mental element
required for aiding or abetting was a long one in which he used a variety of
expressions to characterize the required mental element, including a reference
to ""prior knowledge of the principal's intention to commit the
offence"". From the various ways in which he expressed the necessary mental
element for aiding or abetting I would infer that his charge was based
essentially on the language used by Dickson J. (as he then was) and the
authorities from which he quoted in Dunlop and Sylvester v. The Queen,
[1979] 2 S.C.R. 881 at pp. 891‑96. Because of the nature of the trial
judge's charge on the mental element required for aiding or abetting it was
impossible in my opinion for the jury to conclude that in using the words
""guilty intent"" he was referring, not to the mental element required
for aiding or abetting, but to that required for manslaughter. Towards the end
of his charge to the jury the trial judge again emphasized the difference, in
respect of mens rea, between murder and manslaughter, saying, ""No
intention to kill or cause bodily harm of the nature I have described need be
proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a verdict of manslaughter.
Manslaughter is unintentional killing resulting from an unlawful act....""
As for the possibility that there should have been a clearer reference by the
trial judge to the necessity of knowledge that the principal offender was
commiting an unlawful act, such a reference could only have been favourable to
the appellant in view of the evidence to which I have referred concerning the
appellant's arrest of Hollett. Looking at the trial judge's charge to the jury
as a whole, I am of the opinion that the jury were left with a sufficient
understanding, in relation to the appellant, of the mental element required for
aiding or abetting manslaughter. 

 

                                                                   IV

 

22.              The conclusion of the Court of Appeal that
the trial judge failed to indicate the evidence that could support a finding of
manslaughter against the appellant is contained in the following passage of the
reasons of Jones J.A. (at pp. 369‑70):

 

In addition, the trial
judge failed to point out the facts which could support a finding of
manslaughter against Constable Cluett. Taken in conjunction with the direction
on the right to use force it was impossible for the jury to appreciate the case
for the Crown. As I have already noted, this appears to be the most plausible
explanation of the jury's verdict. In the event that the jury had been properly
instructed it is difficult to see how they could have reached a different
verdict with regard to each of the accused.

 

23.              I am unable to agree with this conclusion.
The trial judge set out the contentions of the Crown and the accused, as well
as the applicable law, and made a very full summary of the relevant evidence.
He clearly indicated the possibility of manslaughter. He did not have a duty to
relate specific portions of the evidence to the issue of manslaughter, in so
far as the appellant was concerned. See John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R.
781 at pp. 792‑93. Moreover, his summary of the evidence, in so far as
the possibility of a finding of manslaughter against the appellant was
concerned, must be seen in relation to the evidence that the appellant did not
see how the struggle between O'Donnell and Hollett began and arrested Hollett
as a person who he had reasonable grounds for believing was apparently
assaulting O'Donnell.

 

24.              For these reasons I would allow the
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the acquittal
of the appellant.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Preliminary hearing — Committal
for trial — Charge of conspiracy — Whether any evidence of conspiracy involving
the accused — Whether certiorari available to
quash committal if no evidence on an essential ingredient of
the charge — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (as am. by R.S.C. 1970 (2nd
Supp.), c. 2, s. 8), s. 475.

Certiorari — Committal for trial — Charge of
conspiracy — Application to quash committal for trial — Whether evidence
supporting the committal — Whether certiorari available if no evidence on an
essential ingredient of the charge — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (as
am. by R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2, s. 8), s. 475.

Appellant with two others was charged with
conspiracy to use a forged document contrary to s. 326  of the Criminal Code .
At the preliminary hearing, the Provincial Court Judge was satisfied that
there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury properly instructed could
convict and accordingly committed the appellant for trial. Appellant
successfully petitioned the Supreme Court of British Columbia for certiorari
to quash the committal for trial on the ground that there was no evidence
before the Provincial Court Judge of his membership in the conspiracy, an
essential ingredient of the offence charged, and that therefore, it was beyond
the Provincial Judge's jurisdiction to commit in the circumstances. On appeal,
the Crown conceded that there was no evidence of a conspiratorial agreement but
argued that, in any event, certiorari did not lie to review a committal
order under s. 475 of the Code in circumstances where there was no
evidence to support that order. The Court of Appeal set aside the order to
quash. Hence this appeal.

[page 94]

Held (Beetz,
McIntyre and Chouinard JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Dickson,
Estey, Lamer and Wilson JJ.: The committal of an accused for trial in the
absence of evidence on an essential ingredient of the charge constitutes a
jurisdictional error reviewable on certiorari. Under section 475 of the Criminal
Code , a judge sitting on a preliminary inquiry is called upon to form an
opinion as to whether or not the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on
trial. ""No evidence"" on an essential element of the charge can never
amount to ""sufficient evidence"" under s. 475 . The Court must
independently assess the record to determine whether there was any evidence to
support the committal: it is not bound to accept the Crown's view of the
evidence or its submission. The parties cannot alter the record nor convert the
appeal into a request for an advisory opinion. Here, where there was some
evidence of the accused's membership in the conspiracy, the reviewing judge
erred in quashing the committal order. The Crown, however, in the exercise of
its enforcement discretion, took as its sole position both here and below that
even in the absence of any evidence of an essential element of the charge no
review of the decision to commit lay by certiorari; and which position
was tantamount to a submission of a reference on a point of law. Instead of
seeking a reversal of the order on a ground known to law, the Crown is trying
to extend a principle or even to establish new law. This Court, in finding that
the order of the reviewing judge should not have been invalidated by the Court
of Appeal on the basis advanced by the Crown, is free to restore that order and
so leave the Crown in the same position as if it had elected not to appeal the
order of the reviewing judge. The prosecutorial arm of the state holds the view
that there is no evidentiary basis for the charge against this accused and
accordingly he should not be put on trial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 14, [1982] 3 W.W.R. 367,
allowing the Crown's appeal from a judgment of Bouck J. (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d)
385, allowing appellant's application for certiorari to quash his
committal for trial. Appeal allowed, Beetz, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ.
dissenting.

B. A. Crane, Q.C., and Christopher
Brennan, for the appellant.

A. M.
Stewart, for the respondent.

The judgment of Dickson, Estey, Lamer and Wilson
JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY
J.—The essential characteristic of this appeal is derived from the stance
adopted by the Crown here and below, namely that certiorari does not lie for the review of a committal order under s. 475  of the
Criminal
Code  even where there is no evidence to support the
order committing the accused for trial. The Crown factum on this point in this
Court stated:

In the Court of Appeal, the Crown took the
position that this case should be viewed as
a case in which there was ""no evidence"" to support the
justice's opinion that the accused should be committed for trial (A.B. 283). The
issue before the Court of Appeal, said the Crown, was the scope of the remedy
available by way of an application for an order in the nature of certiorari.

[page 96]

This was the
ultimate response of the Crown to the grounds upon which the appellant-accused
brought his motion in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an order in the
nature of certiorari to
quash the order of committal.

THAT proof of an ""agreement"" is an
essential ingredient of the charge alleged
against LARRY CLIFF
SKOGMAN; that there was no
evidence led at the preliminary inquiry to prove such
an ""agreement"" and that without such evidence it was beyond the
jurisdiction of His Honour
Judge Giles to commit LARRY CLIFF SKOGMAN to stand trial.

This litigation has
proceeded, since the order of Bouck J., on the footing that there was no
evidence of the conspiratorial agreement which, of course, is the bedrock
requirement in a charge of conspiracy.

The following is the
history of these proceedings in the courts below.

a) The appellant was committed to trial,
after a preliminary inquiry, on a conspiracy charge. The committing judge was
""satisfied that there [was] sufficient evidence to put to a jury and
sufficient evidence upon which a jury properly instructed could convict"".
In his reasons for committal, the learned judge adopted the submissions of
Crown counsel including the submission that there was evidence from which an
inference could be drawn that the appellant had joined the common purpose of
tendering forged bonds.

b) The appellant petitioned the Supreme Court
for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the committal for trial.
The ground upon which relief was sought was that the committing judge exceeded
his jurisdiction by committing the appellant to trial when there was no
evidence of an essential element of the offence with which he was charged, that
is, of a conspiratorial agreement.

[page 97]

c) Bouck J., who heard the petition to quash,
held that:

i) there was no evidence that the accused was
a member of the conspiracy alleged;

ii) a committal order can be quashed by certiorari
when there is a loss of jurisdiction during the preliminary inquiry;

iii) in this case the committing judge lost
his jurisdiction when he committed the accused for trial when there was no
evidence of his membership in the conspiracy alleged.

Bouck J. accordingly quashed the committal
order.

d) The Crown appealed to the British Columbia
Court of Appeal from the order quashing the committal for trial. The Crown
formally abandoned, before the Court of Appeal, the ground of appeal as to
whether there was sufficient evidence before the committing judge to support a
committal for trial. The appeal was then argued on the basis that Bouck J. was
correct in finding that there was no evidence that the appellant had joined the
conspiracy.

e) The British Columbia Court of Appeal
allowed the Crown's appeal and restored the committal for trial. One cannot be
certain whether the majority opinion proceeded on the basis that, in fact and
in law, there was 'no evidence' or 'some evidence' in relation to the essential
elements of the charge. On the one hand, it is stated by the majority:

If, as is assumed
for the purposes of this appeal, there was no evidence to support the Provincial
Court Judge's opinion that the evidence was
sufficient to put the respondent on trial, the Judge made an error in
the exercise of a jurisdiction which he did possess.

On the other hand, this statement is followed
by the statement:

I think the
Chambers Judge erred in substituting his opinion of the
sufficiency of the evidence for the
opinion of the Provincial Court Judge on that
question.

[page 98]

The concurring opinion by Lambert J.A. on
this point includes the statement:

This is not a case where there is no evidence
at all in the sense of an entire absence of
proper material as the basis for the
foundation of a judicial opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put
the accused on trial. Nor is this a case where there is no evidence to provide a platform for
the committing Judge's exercise of his powers, or for his assumption of
jurisdiction in accordance with the jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475  of
the Criminal Code .

In restoring the committal order, the British
Columbia Court of Appeal held that the committing judge did not lose his
jurisdiction in committing the appellant and that certiorari does not lie in the circumstances. Lambert J.A.
concurring, did not wish to adopt what the learned justice took to be obiter in the decision of this Court in Martin v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 511, that a committal order,
unsupported by any evidence on each essential issue of the charge, can be
quashed by writ of certiorari. The
learned justice preferred to follow R. v.
Kopan (1975), 3 B.C.L.R.
102, in allowing the appeal.

f) Argument before this Court, by all
counsel, proceeded on the basis that Bouck J. was correct in finding that there
was no evidence of an essential element of the offence. In its factum, at p. 4,
para. 5, the Crown stated that it was proceeding ""on the basis that the
issue before this Court is whether or not certiorari
should be granted in such circumstances.""

This calls into question the reach of the writ
of certiorari as a tool for the
review of committals for trial at preliminary hearings. In its earliest
application by the courts, the prerogative or royal writs, including certiorari, were a mechanism whereby the
Royal Courts of Justice maintained a surveillance over the conduct of the
inferior tribunals of the land. Gradually, as the organization of justice and
the judiciary developed, these review mechanisms were broadened in their reach
and

[page 99]

refined in the
degree of control until, by 1878, certiorari was
available not only for the review of jurisdictional transgressions by statutory
tribunals, but also for errors committed by those tribunals in the course of
the discharge of their assigned function, where such errors were apparent on
the face of the record. See Williams J. in Hodgkinson v. Fernie (1857), 3 C.B. (N.S.) 189.
During this same epoch, there developed a parallel procedure by way of application
to a court of general jurisdiction for the judicial control of non-statutory
tribunals and emanations of the state which did not have the attributes of an
inferior court. Limitations, as will be seen in Re King and Duveen, [1913] 2 K.B. 32, per Channell L. J., were gradually introduced whereby certiorari review was precluded in the case of a tribunal
determining a question of law submitted to it for determination as the primary
issue by the parties to the proceeding. Other refinements in this branch of the
law have come and gone; for example, the concept of collateral issues whereby
the doctrine of certiorari
review was limited to
calling into question in the court of general jurisdiction decisions made by
the lesser tribunals which were a prelude to the exercise of the primary or
principal jurisdiction of the body whose conduct was under review. We are no
longer concerned with such matters: Service Employees' International Union, Local No. 333 v. Nipawin District Staff Nurses
Association, [1975] 1
S.C.R. 382; Canadian
Union of Public Employees Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corporation., [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227.

In the result, certiorari, or the newer term of judicial review, runs largely
to jurisdictional review or surveillance by a superior court of statutory
tribunals, the term 'jurisdiction' being given its narrow or technical sense.
In the absence of a privative clause, the Court may also review for error of
law on the face of the record. However, even then, under the most recent
authorities, the error must assume a jurisdictional dimension.

[page 100]

These authorities
and the development and Darwin-like elimination of subdoctrines are reviewed in
Douglas Aircraft Company of Canada Ltd. v.
McConnell, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 245, particularly
at pp. 265-78. It is clear, however, that certiorari remains
available to the courts for the review of the functioning of the preliminary
hearing tribunal only where it is alleged that the tribunal has acted in excess
of its assigned statutory jurisdiction or has acted in breach of the principles
of natural justice which, by the authorities, is taken to be an excess of
jurisdiction (see Forsythe v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 268). It need
only be added by way of emphasis that such certiorari
review does not
authorize a superior court to reach inside the functioning of the statutory
tribunal for the purpose of challenging a decision reached by that tribunal
within its assigned jurisdiction on the ground that the tribunal committed an
error of law in reaching that decision, or reached a conclusion different from
that which the reviewing tribunal might have reached.

This brings me to
the question of the reviewability by the writ of certiorari
of the conduct of a
judge sitting in preliminary hearing under s. 475  of the Criminal
Code . Section 475  states:

475. (1) When all the evidence has been taken
by the justice he shall,

(a) if in his opinion the evidence is
sufficient to put the accused on trial,

(i) commit the accused for trial, or

(ii) order the
accused, where it is a corporation, to stand trial in
the court having criminal jurisdiction; or

(b) discharge the accused, if in his opinion
upon the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial.

At minimum, this
section calls upon the presiding justice to form an opinion as to whether
evidence is ""sufficient"" or whether ""no sufficient case is made
out"" so as to justify a conclusion by the presiding

[page 101]

justice ""to put
the accused on trial"" or not to commit the accused to trial. There is no
rule within the statutory framework adopted by Parliament for arbitrary action
by the tribunal. The question therefore arises as to whether or not the
reviewing judge can commit an accused for trial where there is no evidence on
an essential element on a charge with which the accused is faced. In applying
the test of the applicability of certiorari in
such circumstances, we are not concerned with the older test of the presence or
absence of an error of law on the face of the record, but rather we are concerned
with ascertaining whether the preliminary hearing tribunal has discharged its
assigned jurisdiction under s. 475 . This Court, speaking through Judson J. in Patterson v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409, stated at p. 411 with
reference to the review of preliminary hearing:

... there is only one ground for action by
the reviewing Court and that is lack of
jurisdiction.

This is the starting
point, the theorem of review applicable in determining the availability of the
prerogative writ of certiorari
for the purpose of
calling into question a committal for trial under s. 475 . Spence J., in
dissent, agreed, however, with regard to the availability of certiorari when he said, at p. 419:

I am, however, of the view that certiorari does
lie to quash a magistrate's committal for trial when he has exceeded his
jurisdiction or when he has refused to exercise his jurisdiction.

Patterson emerged from this court after an
extensive review of the subject in the provincial Courts of appeal; vide R. v. Botting, [1966] 3 C.C.C. 373 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Norgren (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 488 (B.C. C.A.)
All of these authorities draw their principal support from the judgment of Lord
Sumner in R. v. Nat Bell
Liquors Ltd., [1922] 2
A.C. 128. While that judgment of the Privy Council deals with the review of a
conviction under a provincial statute, it has long been regarded as applicable
in determining the review jurisdiction in the superior court of the proceedings
at preliminary hearing: Re
Martin, Simard and Desjardins
and The Queen (1977), 20 O.R. (2d) 455, at p.

[page 102]

486.
Lord
Sumner, at p. 144 in
the Appeal Cases, said in part:

On certiorari, so far as the presence or
absence of evidence becomes material, the question can at most be whether any
evidence at all was given on the essential point referred to. Its weight is
entirely for the inferior Court:...

Some
complication has, on occasion in the past, resulted from the presence in the Nat Bell judgment, supra, of observations which
were directed at the position of the reviewing tribunal where the action below
consisted not of a preliminary hearing committal or discharge but rather a
conviction in a quasi-criminal process conducted in a tribunal of restricted
jurisdiction, which was the actual case before the Privy Council in Nat Bell. The Ontario Court of Appeal in Martin, supra, in examining a certiorari review of a preliminary
hearing, stated at pp. 486-87:

… we conclude that the learned Provincial Court Judge here acted
within his jurisdiction, unless it can be said that he committed these
respondents on the counts specified without any evidence at all, in the sense
of an entire absence of proper material as a basis for the formation of a
judicial opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial.
That is quite a different question from the question ""whether in the
opinion of the reviewing tribunal there was evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury acting judicially could convict"". It remained, therefore,
to examine the excerpts of evidence, as placed before this Court from the
lengthy transcript taken at the preliminary hearing, in order to determine
whether there was any evidence at all on which the committing tribunal was able
to base its opinion to commit, as required by the terms of the Code

The
Court of Appeal of Ontario then concluded:

... in the case of each of the three
respondents there is sufficient evidence relating to the charges and the
counts in issue to call upon the learned Provincial Judge to form an opinion as
to whether there was sufficient evidence to commit the accused for trial,
pursuant to 

[page 103]

s. 475  . . . . Having properly directed his mind to the evidence and to
the question of whether there was ""sufficient evidence"" to commit,
his decision is not subject to review.

(Emphasis added.)

An appeal was
dismissed by this Court, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 511, the Chief Justice concluding as
follows, at p. 514:

... the review on sufficiency must be a
review to determine whether the committal was made arbitrarily or, at the most,
whether there was some evidence upon which an
opinion could be formed that an accused should go to trial.

More recently, this
Court engaged the problem of review of the preliminary hearing process in Forsythe v. The Queen, supra. Again it was Chief Justice Laskin,
speaking for the Court, and in reference to Patterson, supra, who stated at pp. 271-72:

In speaking of
lack of jurisdiction, this Court was not referring to
lack of initial jurisdiction of a judge or a magistrate to enter upon a
preliminary inquiry. This is hardly a
likelihood. The concern rather was with the loss of this initial
jurisdiction and, in my opinion, the situations in which there can be a loss of
jurisdiction in the course of a preliminary inquiry are few indeed. However, jurisdiction will be lost by a magistrate
who fails to observe a mandatory
provision of the Criminal
Code : see Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597. Canadian law
recognizes that a denial of natural justice goes to jurisdiction:…

A helpful
comparison was drawn by Ritchie J. in United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080,
between the standard applied by the tribunal under s. 475  (s. 475(1)) and the
function performed by a judge sitting at trial with jury:

I agree that the
duty imposed upon a 'justice' under s. 475 (l) is the
same as that which governs a trial judge sitting with a jury in deciding
whether the evidence is 'sufficient' to justify him in withdrawing the case
from the jury and this is to be determined according to whether or not there is
any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a
verdict of guilty.

The Ontario Court
of Appeal in Stillo v.
R. (1981), 22 C.R.
(3d) 224, was faced with the issue

[page 104]

of reviewability of a committal where there was
no evidence capable of corroborating a minor's testimony in a charge of
indecent assault. The reviewing court, the High Court of Justice of Ontario,
had quashed the committal because of the jurisdictional error committed by the
tribunal at the preliminary hearing in committing the accused. Morden J.A.,
speaking for the Court of Appeal of Ontario, stated, at p. 227:

In our view,
there was no evidence in this case satisfying these
requirements. There was, in law, no evidence at all upon which a finding of
guilt could be made. Mr. Watt conceded, accurately and fairly, in our view,
that if failure to meet a mandatory corroboration requirement has to result in
a case being taken from a jury, which it does, then he could not reasonably
argue that a different result should occur with respect to a preliminary
inquiry, unless it could be said that the error fell short of being of a jurisdictional nature. In our view, it is
established that complete absence of evidence does amount to jurisdictional
error.

The courts of this country have, since the
judgment in Martin, supra, generally
adopted the rule that a committal of an accused at a preliminary, in the
absence of evidence on an essential ingredient in a charge, is a reviewable
jurisdictional error. See: Re Guttman and
The Queen (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 342 (Que. S.C.); Procureur général du Québec v. Poirier, [1981] C.A. 228, sub nom. Re Poirier and The Queen (1981),
62 C.C.C. (2d) 452; Re Leroux and The
Queen (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 398 (Que. S.C.); Re Robar and The Queen (1978), 42 C.C.C.
(2d) 133 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused,
October 3, 1978, [1978] 2 S.C.R. x; Re Mackie and The Queen (1978), 43 C.C.C.
(2d) 269 (Ont. H.C.); Stillo v. R., supra.
""No evidence"" on an essential element of the charge against the
accused cannot amount to ""sufficient evidence"" under s. 475 . In my
view, this is the state of the law in this country on this issue.

[page 105]

I return, therefore, to the essential
characteristic of this proceeding, accepting for the moment the concession by
the prosecutorial authority that there is no evidence whatever of the
involvement of the accused in the allegedly conspiratorial agreement which
underlies and sustains, if it be sustainable, the charge before the preliminary
hearing tribunal. In my view, with all respect to those including the courts
below who may hold the view to the contrary, a committal cannot survive in
these circumstances. The purpose of a preliminary hearing is to protect the
accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where
the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the
continuation of the process. In addition, in the course of its development in
this country, the preliminary hearing has become a forum where the accused is
afforded an opportunity to discover and to appreciate the case to be made
against him at trial where the requisite evidence is found to be present. The
status of the preliminary inquiry in the United Kingdom is discussed by Patrick
Devlin in The Criminal Prosecution in
England (1960), at p. 10:

The preliminary
inquiry before the magistrates is now a purely legal
proceeding; it was designed as an instrument of the prosecution for finding the
culprit and preparing the evidence against him; it has become a shield for the
defence, allowing the defendant to ascertain precisely what the material is
that is to be used against him and relieving him from the expense and odium of
a trial if in the judgment of impartial persons there is not enough evidence to
justify it.

The development of the institution of the
preliminary hearing has taken a slightly different course in our country:

The Canadian preliminary inquiry stems from
an inquisitorial system of criminal investigation and prosecution in England,
in which justices of the peace originally performed all of the investigative
functions now performed by the police. The
role of the justice of the peace gradually changed and eventually began
to take on judicial characteristics. At the same time the inquiry over which the justice of the peace
presided also changed, becoming
mainly a judicial examination of the justification and need for
pre-trial detention of the

[page 106]

accused as well as an examination of the need
for a trial itself. In this proceeding
the prosecution was required to present
its case, or at least to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case. [Footnotes omitted.]

(Law
Reform Commission of Canada Study Report: Discovery in Criminal Cases (1974), at p. 8.)

It
is interesting to go back to a description applied by G. Arthur Martin, Q.C.,
to the preliminary hearing in Canada:

The preliminary
hearing has two aspects. Its primary purpose, of
course, is to ascertain whether or not there is sufficient evidence to warrant the accused being placed upon his trial. In determining this, a
magistrate, who is conducting a preliminary
hearing is not determining whether or not the accused is guilty or not guilty.
His function is to ascertain whether or not there is sufficient evidence to induce the belief in the mind of a
cautious man that the accused is probably guilty. Therefore, considerations
of reasonable doubt have no application at
this stage of the proceedings.

[…]

From the point
of view of defence counsel the preliminary hearing has
another aspect. It affords counsel an opportunity of ascertaining the nature
and the strength of the case against his client and it may be likened in that
respect to an Examination for Discovery.

(G.
Arthur Martin, Q.C.: ""Preliminary Hearings"", Special Lectures of the
Law Society of Upper Canada, 1955, p. 1.)

In
the course of a preliminary hearing, evidence may be adduced through witnesses,
exhibits, or admissions. The purpose of adducing evidence is to enable the
judge to exercise his jurisdiction by making determinations of fact, applying
the law to those facts, and finally, to exercise his discretion to commit or
discharge the accused. Where the record established in the preliminary hearing
does not include evidence relating to each essential element of the charge
brought against the accused, a committal of the accused to stand trial can be
brought forward by way of a writ of certiorari to a superior court and can be
quashed. I return then to explore the precise effect on these proceedings of
the Crown's concession made here and in the Court of Appeal.

[page 107]

The argument,
agreement or undertaking, as the case may be, of a Crown agent as to the
consequence to be drawn from testimony taken at trial is not in any way binding
upon the Court. Indeed, quite the opposite is true. The Court still must be
satisfied that the evidentiary test has been passed or failed, as the case may
be, as a matter of law. This includes a burden of proof in some cases and in
others the presence or absence, as here, of some evidence to support a
committal under s. 475 . Neither party, separately or jointly, can alter the
record nor convert the appeal into a request for an advisory opinion. It
follows that the court is not in any way bound to accept the Crown's view of
this evidence nor the Crown submission of law based upon the Crown's view of
that evidence. Rather, the Court must independently assess the record to
determine whether there was any evidence to support the committal for trial.

In my view, here
there was some evidence of the essential element of an agreement. The evidence at the preliminary hearing reveals that
the accused came into possession of the bogus bond which had been prepared by others alleged to be
the accused's co-conspirators. The evidence further
revealed that at an earlier
time a person alleged to be a co-conspirator had caused the counterfeit bond to
be created and had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade an employee at a branch
of a trust company to cash the counterfeit bond. The accused, according to the
evidence, later took the bogus bond to the same branch of the trust company
where the aforementioned employee worked, and cashed the bond. It should here
be noted that the evidence includes a denial by the unindicted co-conspirator
and by the employee of the trust company, unsuccessfully importuned as
aforesaid, of any knowledge of or relationship with the accused. The evidence
further reveals that the accused, in presenting the bond at the trust company,
did not approach that employee for the purpose of cashing the bond. From this
evidence it is remotely but
nonetheless possible, in my view, to distill an agreement between the accused and the creators of the
counterfeit bond to convert the bond to cash by presenting it to a trust
company or a bank. This evidence approaches the traditional

[page 108]

expression ""a
scintilla of evidence"" but falls short of what may be classified as
fanciful. Consequently, there can be gleaned from the record 'some evidence' to
support the action of committal. In so stating, it must always be added that
the ""some evidence"" and ""no evidence"" rules must relate to
all the essential elements of the charge in question.

The conclusion which
I have reached, that there was a scintilla of evidence to support the committal
of the appellant to trial, brings us back full circle to the unusual procedural
history of this case. On appeal, the Crown did not seek to impeach the finding
of Bouck J. that there was 'no evidence' of a conspiratorial agreement. Rather,
it was argued that in any event certiorari was not available to review
for 'no evidence' at all on the essential elements of the charge. The executive
branch of government has assumed primary responsibility for the enforcement of
the criminal law. The historic ascendency of the executive branch as the agency
for the enforcement of criminal law in the community is recognized in Canada
today, in fact and in law, in the Criminal Code  where it is given an ascendency at critical junctures of a prosecution
over the private prosecutor. This branch may, in its wisdom, decide to lay or
not to lay a charge. It might decide at any stage in the process to withdraw
the charge. The Attorney General of the province, as represented by the Crown
agent in the courtroom, might, for example, decide to withdraw a charge in the
course of a preliminary hearing. Similarly, the charge might be withdrawn with
the permission of the Court in the course of a trial. The following dicta of
Schroeder J.A. in City of Toronto v. Polai (1969), 8 D.L.R. (3d) 689 in
a different context, accurately, in my view, reflects the importance of the
role assumed by the executive with respect to criminal prosecutions (at p.
697):

The decision whether or not the
Attorney-General should prosecute or sue is a matter for him, and the

[page 109]

Courts have no power to question his right to
do so or to refrain from doing so as
distinct from his right to relief.

The Attorney-General is in a different
position from the ordinary litigant,
for he represents the public interest in the
community at large; …

The Crown agent in
this case might have decided, in its exclusive discretion as the public
enforcement agency of the community, the executive branch, not to oppose the
application for an order to quash; or the Crown might have decided not to
appeal from the quashing order. Here the Crown exercised its enforcement
discretion by asking the Court of Appeal, and this Court as well, to set aside
the quashing order on a ground not known to the law. No other request was made
by the Crown, and indeed, the Crown expressed its agreement that the Court
should dispose of the appeal on the one ground selected by the Crown. The sole
position taken by the Crown on this appeal in this Court, and apparently in the
court below, is tantamount to a submission of a Reference on a point of law to
this Court. The Crown does not here seek a reversal of the order of the
reviewing judge of first instance on a ground known to the law. Rather the
Crown seeks to establish a new or extended rule of law.

Whether there is, in
the judicial sense, 'no evidence' revealed in the record, is a question of law.
In finding there was 'no evidence' in the record at the preliminary hearing,
the learned reviewing judge committed an error of law. Such a finding,
unsupported by the record, is, in my view, a reversible error which, in the
absence of other overriding considerations, would dispose of the appeal.

There now remains to
be examined the question as to whether these proceedings reveal a further and
finally controlling factor which ordains another disposition of the proceeding.
This Court, on the review of the proceedings below, must conclude that, while
the committing judge was in law correct in his order under s. 475 , and the
reviewing judge was wrong in law in quashing the committal, the quashing order
was attacked by the

[page 110]

Crown on a basis
unknown to the law. The Crown in its executive role can, at that point, elect
not to appeal or to appeal on a limited basis, or to appeal from the order on
all possible grounds known to the law. The Crown role continues at this stage
in the same way as in the earliest stages of the process when it determines
whether to lay a charge, against whom the charge should be laid, and if so,
whether to proceed to or by way of the preliminary hearing.

In determining the
proper disposition to be made of this appeal, one should not overlook the
effect the position taken by the Crown in the appellate process has had, not
only upon the criminal process itself but upon the accused. The accused has not
been called upon to address the issue of 'no evidence' in either the Court of
Appeal or in this Court. He has not been called upon to meet the 'no evidence'
or 'some evidence' issue because of the quasi-reference approach taken by the
Crown in the form of an appeal from the order of Bouck J.

As a result of all
these proceedings and steps, this Court, making the order which is respectfully
found to be the order which the Court of Appeal should have made, finds that
this appeal should be allowed and the order of the reviewing judge restored.
This is the disposition which must, in law, follow from the course chosen by
the executive branch in the discharge of its function as an agency charged with
law enforcement in the province. The Crown having pursued this course, as in
its wisdom it is free to do, the result must be the restoration of the order
quashing the committal. The focus of this entire process is on the liberty of
the subject. The appellant stands accused under the criminal law. The agency
charged with the administration of justice on behalf of the Crown in the right
of the province has, upon its investigation and initial prosecutorial steps,
determined that the community is possessed of no evidence that the

[page 111]

accused is guilty of
the conspiracy charged. Can the community be expected to tolerate, let alone
support, a law which permits a person, against whom the state enforcement
agency claims possession of no evidence of guilt as charged, to be prosecuted
on such a charge with the full power and resources of the state? This is not an
absence of process; it is an abandonment of process. It is fundamental to our
criminal law traditions that no citizen shall be called upon to answer a charge
in this stark circumstance. Any other criminal law technique is but organized
tyranny focussed on the wrongly accused in the view of the arm of the state
empowered to initiate and process that accusation. Section 475  cannot, in my
opinion, be properly construed in the tradition of statutory interpretation of
criminal statutes as requiring such a startling result in a free society.

It follows that in
doing so, the Court has not treated itself as bound by, nor indeed in any way
has it acted upon, the submission by the Crown that there was no evidence of
each essential element of the charge. Rather, the Court has responded to the
only position taken by the prosecution.

I therefore would
allow the appeal and restore the order of Bouck J. in Chambers in the Supreme
Court of British Columbia.

The reasons of
Beetz, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ. were delivered by

MCINTYRE
J. (dissenting)—This appeal again raises the question of an
application in the nature of certiorari to
quash a committal for trial after preliminary hearing where it was agreed
between the Crown and the appellant that there was no evidence adduced before
the committing Provincial Court Judge on an essential ingredient of the offence
charged.

The appellant was
charged with two others named Grenon and Pellerin, and others unknown, with
conspiracy to use a forged document as if it were genuine, contrary to s. 326 
of the Criminal Code . At the opening of the preliminary
hearing a

[page 112]

stay of proceedings
was entered in respect of Grenon, who gave evidence for the Crown, and Pellerin
did not appear. The hearing proceeded in respect of the appellant Skogman.

The evidence
revealed that Grenon worked in the office of the Queen's Printer in Victoria.
Early in the year 1980 he stole an unnumbered British Columbia School
District's Capital Financing Authority debenture having a face value of
$25,000. The debenture was dated May 1, 1966 and it had coupons attached, each
in the amount of $781.25, dated November 1 and May 1 for each year up to 1986.
He retained it in his possession until October, 1980 when he mentioned it to
his co-accused, Pellerin. They decided to negotiate the bond or the coupons or
both. The two, Grenon and Pellerin, went to the office of the Queen's Printer
where Grenon made a casting of a serial number so that it could be stamped on
the debenture and its coupons. He gave the casting to Pellerin who by this time
had the debenture. Pellerin then spoke to a woman friend who was employed by
the Royal Trust Company at its branch on Grant Street in Victoria. He
endeavoured to make arrangements with her to negotiate the debenture, but she
refused.

At about the end of
October the appellant Skogman opened an account at the Grant Street Branch of
the Royal Trust Company in the name of one Brune who was an acquaintance, but
who knew nothing of the account. The appellant then handed over for negotiation
the coupons from the debenture. The coupons bore a fictitious number and had a
face value of $14,843.75. On surrender of the coupons the appellant received
from the trust company $2,500 cash, and the remaining $12,343.75 was deposited
to the account he had opened in the name of Brune.

There was evidence
identifying the appellant as the person who handed over the coupons to the
Royal Trust Company on October 31 at the Grant Street branch, but there was no
direct evidence of any association between the appellant and the other alleged
conspirators. However, in argument

[page 113]

at the preliminary
hearing, counsel for the Crown said:

Mr. Pellerin gained access and custody of the
coupons. He showed them to Heather Robb and Heather Robb says, ""Yes, those
are the items and I told him that they wouldn't pass muster because they look
smudged and they are obvious forgeries.""

The coupons then go from Mr. Pellerin somehow
to Mr. Scogman [sic] and an
inference can be drawn—and I suggest it is the only inference that can be drawn—that
Mr. Scogman [sic] then joins the common purpose.

We have the
identification of the coupons in Pellerin's hands and we next have Mr. Scogman [sic]
showing up at Royal Trust.

And at the
conclusion of the hearing, the Provincial Court Judge said in part:

I am adopting, as my reasons for committing,
the submissions made by Crown counsel, Mr.
Macdonald, who summarized the case. He summarized the facts very succinctly and I can do no better than merely
adopt them as reasons.

I therefore am satisfied that there is
sufficient evidence to put to a jury and sufficient evidence upon which a jury
properly instructed could convict.

I therefore commit the accused for trial
before Judge and Jury at the next court of
competent jurisdiction and I am referring to the accused, Larry Cliff
Scogman [sic].

The appellant
petitioned the Supreme Court for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the committal for trial. Essentially, the grounds upon which
relief was sought were that evidence of an agreement between the appellant and
one or more of his co-conspirators, a necessary ingredient of the charge of
conspiracy, had not been tendered. It was contended that there was no evidence
before the committing Provincial Court Judge of any such agreement between the
appellant and the others and, therefore, there was not sufficient evidence to
justify a committal. It was therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Provincial
Court Judge to commit in the circumstances.

[page 114]

The
Chambers Judge in the Supreme Court who heard the petition wrote a detailed and carefully considered judgment in which
he reviewed many of the authorities on this question and concluded that the
relief sought should be granted. He quashed the committal. At the conclusion of
his reasons for judgment the Chambers Judge conveniently summarized his
conclusions under six headings. The second conclusion he reached was in these
terms:

(2) At the preliminary hearing, there was no
evidence the accused was a member of the
conspiracy alleged in the information. Put another way, there was an
entire absence of evidence as a basis for the formation of a judicial opinion
that the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial. There was only
circumstantial evidence which gives rise to rational inferences other than his
membership in the conspiracy.

The
fourth, fifth and sixth conclusions were in these terms:

(4) The Supreme Court of Canada has approved
the practice of quashing committal orders by certiorari when there is a loss of jurisdiction during the
preliminary enquiry. Examples of how this can occur
include denial of natural justice and failure to observe a mandatory
provision of the Criminal Code .

(5) There was no breach of the rules of
natural justice by reason of the committal proceedings.

(6) The Provincial Court Judge lost
jurisdiction at the preliminary inquiry when
he failed to observe s. 475  of the Criminal
Code  because he committed the accused
for trial when there was no evidence of his membership in the conspiracy
which justified the committal order, or put another way, there was an entire
absence of evidence as a basis for the formation of a judicial opinion by him
that the evidence of his membership in the conspiracy was sufficient to put the
accused on trial.

The
Court of Appeal was unanimous in allowing the Crown's appeal. McFarlane J.A.
wrote reasons with which Craig J.A. concurred. Lambert J.A. concurred in the
result but wrote separate reasons. McFarlane J.A., after outlining the facts,
said:

[page 115]

The appeal by the Crown to this Court is
presented on the assumption that there was no evidence to support the
Provincial Court Judge's opinion. It is, of course, not conceded or assumed
that the circumstances did not require the Provincial Court Judge to apply his
mind to the question whether he should or should not be of opinion that the
evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial. It is not suggested that
there was such a complete absence of evidence that s. 475(1) could not be
invoked or applied at all. The contrary is the case. There can be no doubt that
at the conclusion of hearing of the evidence presented by the Crown, the
Provincial Court Judge was required to form his opinion on the application of
s-s. 1(a) and 1(b), i.e., to commit or discharge. The distinction is important
because it points up the difference between the acquisition of jurisdiction by
the Provincial Court Judge and the loss of a jurisdiction once properly
acquired.

After
reviewing the authorities, including Re Martin, Simard and Desjardins and The Queen (1977), 20 O.R. (2d)
455 (C.A.), affirmed sub
nom. Martin v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 511; R. v. Norgren (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 488 (B.C.C.A.); Patterson v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409; R. v. Kopan (1975), 3 B.C.L.R. 102; Attorney General of Quebec v. Cohen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 305; Forsythe v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 268, he
went on to say:

In the present case there was clearly no lack
of jurisdiction to enter upon the preliminary inquiry. If, as is assumed for
the purposes of this appeal, there was no evidence to support the Provincial
Court Judge's opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put the respondent on
trial, the Judge made an error in the exercise of a jurisdiction which he did
possess. I think the Chambers Judge erred in substituting his opinion of the
sufficiency of the evidence for the opinion of the Provincial Court Judge on
that question. The question whether circumstantial evidence is equally, or more
consistent with innocence than with guilt, is a question for the trial Judge or
jury.

As has been said, Lambert
J.A. reached the same conclusion and expressed disagreement with certain dicta
from Re Martin, Simard
and Desjardins and The Queen and Forsythe v. The Queen, as argued by counsel for the accused, and he followed R. v. Kopan which had held that a total lack of

[page 116]

evidence on a
preliminary hearing would not go to jurisdiction and permit a quashing by certiorari.

In this Court
argument proceeded on the basis that there was no evidence before the
Provincial Court Judge of association by the appellant with either of his
co-accused, an essential ingredient of the crime of conspiracy, and therefore
no basis existed for a committal for trial. The appellant argued that while
there was no case directly on point in this Court, the weight of authority
established that certiorari
was available in Canada
to quash a committal for trial and that an absence of evidence on an essential
point was a ground for such relief. The Court was referred to many authorities,
including Re Robar and
The Queen (1978), 42
C.C.C. (2d) 133 (N.S. C.A.); Procureur général du Québec v.
Poirier, [1981]
C.A. 228, sub nom. Re Poirier and The Queen (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 452; Stillo v. R. (1981), 22 C.R. (3d) 224 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Boylan (1979), 8 C.R. (3d) 36 (Sask. C.A.); Re Leroux and The Queen (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 398 (Que. S.C.); Re Mackie and The Queen (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 269 (Ont. H.C.); Re Harrigan (1977), 17 N.B.R. (2d) 478 (C.A.); Chromium Mining and Smelting Corp. v.
Fortin, [1968] Que.
Q.B. 536; R. v. Gibbon,
Bell and Faryon (1965),
45 C.R. 314 (Man. Q.B.) Particular reliance was placed on the case of Re Martin, Simard and Desjardins and The Queen.

Counsel for the
Crown argued that the point had been settled sixty years ago in R. v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd., [1922] 2 A.C. 128, and that sound
grounds of policy and law supported the proposition that had been established
in the British Columbia Court of Appeal to the effect that an absence of
evidence will not be grounds for review of a committal for trial by certiorari. He reviewed many of the cases on the subject which
illustrate the different views that have been adopted in different appellate
courts in Canada and submitted that this Court should set the matter at rest
with a clear pronouncement.

[page 117]

In approaching the case at bar I refer, firstly,
to Patterson v. The Queen where,
at a preliminary hearing into a charge of using an instrument to procure a
miscarriage, the committing magistrate refused to order the production of
statements made by two Crown witnesses. The accused was committed for trial and
on application for a writ of certiorari the
committal was quashed. The committal was restored in the Court of Appeal and
the accused appealed to this Court. Judson J., speaking for himself, Abbott,
Martland, Ritchie, and Pigeon JJ., Spence J. dissenting, said at pp. 411-12:

I intend to confine these reasons within the
very narrow issues raised by the case and to repeat what has been emphasized so often that if it is sought to
review a committal for trial, there is only one ground for action by the
reviewing Court and that is lack of jurisdiction. The refusal by the
magistrate, on this hearing, to order production of these statements does not
go to the question of jurisdiction. In the first place, I think that his ruling
was correct and, further, even if it was in error that there would still be no
problem of jurisdiction.

Hall J. concurred in the result. This case I
take to be clear authority for the proposition that an error in law during the
course of exercising a jurisdiction is not itself jurisdictional and will not
be reviewed on certiorari. The Patterson case was followed and approved
in this Court in Attorney General of
Quebec v. Cohen. Pigeon J. wrote the judgment in this Court in the Cohen case and referred with approval to
the case of Norgren in the
British Columbia Court of Appeal which dealt with the same point. The British
Columbia Court of Appeal later followed and approved Norgren in the case of Kopan.
These cases all have their roots in the judgment of Lord Sumner in
the Nat Bell case and carry the
authority of this Court.

The two cases upon which most of the argument
centred in this appeal are Re Martin,
Simard and Desjardins and The Queen in
the Ontario Court of Appeal and in this Court, and Forsythe v. The Queen in this Court. It was argued that these
cases had modified, or at least cast doubt on, the earlier cases relied upon by
the Crown. In the Martin case

[page 118]

orders of committal
had been made after a preliminary hearing and then quashed in the High Court on
certiorari. The basis of the quashing order in the High Court
was that there was error of law on the face of the record. The issue in the
Court of Appeal then became, in the words of Estey C.J.O. (as he then was),
""whether certiorari is available to quash a committal for
trial where there is an error of law on the face of the record"" (p. 484).
He went on to say that the Court of Appeal of Ontario had already applied the
principle that excess or want of jurisdiction was the only ground upon which certiorari might
apply and referred on this point to the Ontario cases of R. v. Botting, [1966] 3 C.C.C. 373 and Re Stewart and The
Queen (No. 2) (1977),
35 C.C.C. (2d) 281, and to the Norgren case in the British Columbia Court of
Appeal. He then observed, as I have done, that these cases find their roots in
the Nat Bell case. As to the extent of review on jurisdictional
grounds, he referred to the words of Lord Sumner in the Nat Bell case
to the effect that:

On certiorari, so far as the presence
or absence of evidence becomes material, the
question can, at most, be whether any evidence at all was given on the
essential point referred to. Its weight is entirely for the inferior Court:...

Estey C.J.O. then
went on to say, at pp. 486-87:

The Code asserts this principle. Where
there is any evidence at all upon a charge
or issue arising thereunder, the Provincial Court Judge is called upon
by s. 475 of the Code to hear it and determine ""if in his opinion
the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial ... ""; and his
decision is not subject to review.

Applying these judgments, some of which are
binding upon this Court, we conclude that the learned Provincial Court
Judge here acted within his jurisdiction, unless it can be said
that he committed these respondents on the counts specified without any
evidence at all, in the sense of an entire absence of proper material as a basis
for the formation of a judicial
opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on trial. That is
quite a

[page 119]

different question from the question
""whether in the opinion of the reviewing tribunal there was evidence upon
which a properly instructed jury acting judicially could convict"". It
remained, therefore, to examine the excerpts of evidence, as placed before this
Court from the lengthy transcript taken at the preliminary hearing, in order to determine whether there was any
evidence at all on which the
committing tribunal was able to base its opinion to commit, as required by the terms of the Code already cited. There is, of course, a considerable
volume of evidence, testimonial and documentary, and it
is my view that in the case of each of the three respondents there is
sufficient evidence relating to the charges and the counts in issue to call
upon the learned Provincial Judge to form an opinion as to whether there was
sufficient evidence to commit the accused for trial, pursuant to s. 475 , ....
Having properly directed his mind to the evidence and to the question of
whether there was ""sufficient evidence"" to commit, his decision is
not subject to review.

The order to quash
was reversed. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.

In the Martin case Estey C.J.O. went far to
rationalize the conflicting case law on this question. As I read his judgment
in that case, he recognized that the remedy of certiorari was jurisdictional and that it could be
invoked only to cure jurisdictional error. He went on to say that it would lie
to quash a committal for trial on this basis only where there was a total
absence of evidence before the committing justice on which he could commit. He
went on to state the test of sufficiency of evidence for a committal and drew a
distinction between that amount of evidence which would warrant a committal for
trial, and that lesser amount which, though not being sufficient to warrant a
committal, would be sufficient to compel the committing justice to examine the
evidence and reach a judicial opinion as to its sufficiency. He concluded by
saying that there was such evidence, that is, evidence sufficient to put the
committing justice to a decision as to its sufficiency and that, after the
committing justice had addressed his mind to the evidence and reached his
conclusion, the decision was not reviewable on certiorari even though wrong in law. This judgment
was affirmed in this Court and is, in my view, consistent with the judgment of
this

[page 120]

Court in Forsythe
in which case it was held that only a denial of natural justice or a
failure to obey the jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475  of the Criminal
Code  would justify a review and quashing of a committal by certiorari.

To apply the above
proposition to the case at bar, it should first be recognized that the parties
argued the case before us on the basis that there was no evidence before the
trial judge. Counsel for the Crown put it that there was no evidence of an
essential ingredient of a charge of conspiracy, that is, evidence of agreement.
While it could be said then that there was no evidence sufficient to meet the
test for a committal—evidence which, if believed by a properly instructed jury,
would justify a conviction—it could not be said that there was no evidence at
all. The evidence disclosed that Grenon had stolen the debenture and the
coupons. He had then given them to Pellerin and made a moulding from which a
false serial number was made and put on the documents. The evidence also showed
that Pellerin had approached an employee of the Royal Trust Company branch
office on Grant Street in Victoria and had attempted to arrange for the
negotiation of the debenture or coupons. She refused to cooperate but, after a
day or two, the appellant went to the same branch of the Royal Trust Company,
opened an account and negotiated the debenture coupons under a false name.

Now the parties have conceded that there was no
direct evidence of association. Whatever one might think of the validity of
such a concession by the Crown, it is abundantly clear that the committing
justice, having heard the evidence described above, was confronted with the
task of deciding whether or not there was evidence of association, and whether
or not there was evidence to warrant a committal. There was no absolute lack of
evidence,

[page 121]

 as described by Estey C.J.O. in Martin. The
formation of a judicial opinion by the committing justice was therefore
required under s. 475  of the Criminal Code . The justice's words in
giving judgment reveal that he addressed the evidence and formed his opinion as
to its sufficiency. His judgment then is not reviewable in proceedings by certiorari.
It should be remembered that there were no concessions as to sufficiency of
evidence made before the committing justice. He was required to address the
question and reach his own conclusion. He did so, and, even though it may have
been wrong in law, it is, in my view, unreviewable.

This question came to this Court again in the
case of Forsythe v. The Queen. In that case, on a preliminary inquiry
concerning a charge of rape, the appellant was denied the right to question the
complainant with respect to her past sexual conduct with persons other than the
accused in the in camera hearing held under s. 142  of the Criminal
Code . He was also refused the right to examine the notes of a police
officer made during an interview with the complainant and to cross-examine on
them. He was committed for trial. He applied for an order quashing the
committal which was denied in the Supreme Court of Ontario and his appeal to
the Court of Appeal was dismissed. He appealed to this Court. The Chief Justice
wrote the judgment for a unanimous Court and held that certiorari may be
involved to quash a committal. He referred to the Patterson case and
said, at pp. 271-72:

In speaking of
lack of jurisdiction, this Court was not referring to
lack of initial jurisdiction of a judge or a magistrate to enter upon a
preliminary inquiry. This is hardly a
likelihood. The concern rather was with the loss of this initial
jurisdiction and, in my opinion, the situations in which there can be a loss of
jurisdiction in the course of a preliminary inquiry are few indeed. However, jurisdiction will be lost by a magistrate who fails to observe a mandatory provision of
the Criminal Code : see Doyle
v. The Queen [1977]
1 S.C.R. 597. Canadian law
recognizes that a denial of natural justice goes to jurisdiction: see Alliance
des Professeurs catholiques de Montréal v. Labour Relations Board of Quebec [1953] 2 S.C.R. 140.

[page 122]

 ln the case of a preliminary inquiry, I cannot conceive that this could arise otherwise
than by a complete denial to the accused of a right to call witnesses or
of a right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.
More disallowance of a question or questions on cross-examination or other rulings on proffered evidence would
not, in my view, amount to a jurisdictional error. However, the judge or
magistrate who presides at a preliminary inquiry has the obligation to obey the
jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475  of the Criminal Code .

He went on to
comment on the case of Attorney
General of Quebec v. Cohen. The Forsythe appeal was dismissed.

It is evident then
that this Court has held that only a denial of natural justice or a failure to
""obey the jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475  of the Criminal Code "" will serve to permit the quashing of a committal for trial by certiorari.

How would this
apply to the case at bar? It has never been suggested that there was any denial
of natural justice. The inquiry was conducted in a normal open fashion and the
appellant was in no way impeded in the conduct of the case. What of the
jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475 ? Section 475  is reproduced hereunder:

475. (1) When all the evidence has been taken
by the justice he shall,

(a) if in his opinion the evidence is
sufficient to put the accused on trial,

(i) commit the accused for trial, or

(ii) order the accused, where it is a
corporation, to stand trial in the court having criminal jurisdiction; or

(b) discharge the accused, if in his opinion
upon the whole of the evidence no sufficient
case is made out to put the accused on trial.

The committing
judge is required upon the conclusion of the evidence to form an opinion either
that the evidence is sufficient for a committal or that it is not. If, in his
opinion, it is sufficient, he must commit, and if, in his opinion, it is not,
he must discharge. In his reasons the Provincial Court

[page 123]

Judge clearly
addressed this issue and complied with the jurisdictional prescriptions of the
section by forming a judicial opinion as to the sufficiency of the evidence. His
words in this respect have already been referred to. Even if he was wrong in
forming his opinion, it cannot be said that he lost jurisdiction in the last
act of a heretofore properly conducted hearing merely by making a mistake in
law. There was clearly before him enough evidence, in the words of Estey
C.J.O., to require him to address the question and to form a judicial opinion
as to its sufficiency for a committal. This he did with no suggestion of bias
or other improper motive. Even if he was wrong, he addressed his mind to the
issues and his determination is not reviewable on certiorari.

I would dismiss the
appeal and I would say that where, in a preliminary hearing, there is no denial
of natural justice then, even in an absence of evidence on an essential point
in an offence charged, where the committing magistrate has addressed his mind
to the requirements of s. 475  of the Criminal Code  and decided that in his opinion there is sufficient
evidence to commit, the resulting order of committal is unreviewable on certiorari. If it is thought necessary to provide a means of
appeal or a review of committals, Parliament may do so.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Jurisdiction—Procedure—Joinder—Indictable and summary conviction
offences—Trial by magistrate elected prior to entering plea on indictable
offence—Accused consenting to evidence on both counts being applied to each
count—Whether or not jurisdiction to try together separate
informations—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 85, 388(1), 484,
717.

Appellant was charged, in separate
informations, with an indictable offence and with a summary conviction offence.
She elected trial by magistrate prior to entering a plea on the indictable
offence, was arraigned on both counts and entered pleas of not guilty. Both
informations were tried together and she was convicted on each. Appellant appealed
her convictions and sentences but the Court of Appeal concluded that there was
evidence to sustain the convictions and that the sentences were not
inappropriate.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The trial judge, in light of the principle
pronounced by this Court in Phillips and Phillips v. The Queen, was
without jurisdiction to try together the separate informations. This case is
not distinguishable from that case.

Phillips and Phillips v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 61, followed.

of Appeal dismissing an appeal from convictions and sentences pronounced by J.

[Page 63]

Pamela Khan, appearing on her own behalf.

Brian J. Gover, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The appellant was charged in an
information with an indictable offence under s. 85  of the Criminal Code 
that:

Pamela Khan on or about the 27th day of
August, 1981, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial
District of York, unlawfully did have in her possession a weapon, to wit: knife
for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to the Criminal Code .

She was also charged in a separate information
with an offence punishable on summary conviction under s. 388(1)  of the Criminal
Code  that:

Pamela Khan on or about the 27th day of
August, 1981, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial
District of York, unlawfully did wilfully damage makeup jars and glasses
situate at 24 Madison Avenue, the property of Renee Palisa said damage not to
exceed $50.00 in value, contrary to the Criminal Code .

Prior to entering a plea in respect of the
information charging the indictable offence of possessing a weapon for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace, she elected trial by magistrate,
pursuant to s. 484  of the Criminal Code . On September 10, 1981 she was
arraigned and entered pleas of ‘not guilty’ to each information. Before
evidence was called there occurred the following discussion:

THE COURT: Yes, now prior to starting,
Mr. Crown Attorney, which information are you proceeding on?

MR. KAPPY: I have asked her to be
arraigned on both. The evidence is very similar with the same witnesses. I am
in Your Honour’s hands.

THE COURT: Miss Khan, it’s my understanding
from the Crown Attorney that the evidence—you had been arraigned on both
charges. Do you wish the evidence on both counts to apply? You do not have to
have the evidence apply? You may proceed on one count and then hear evidence on
the other count. Do you wish all

[Page 64]

evidence on both charges to be applied to
each of the two counts?

THE ACCUSED: (Nods affirmatively.)

THE COURT: Is that yes?

THE ACCUSED: Yes.

THE COURT: Yes. Thank you. All right.

It should be noted that the appellant was not
represented by counsel.

The two informations were then tried together,
the offences arising out of the same or very closely related events, and the
appellant was convicted on both. She was sentenced to a term of nine months’
imprisonment on the indictable offence of possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public, and to imprisonment for thirty days to be served
concurrently for the offence of wilful damage. She has served both sentences.
She appealed the convictions and sentences to the Court of Appeal. Her appeals
were dismissed on January 25, 1982, the court concluding that there was evidence on which the verdicts
could be sustained, and that it had not been shown that the sentences were
inappropriate. This appeal was heard and disposed of before the judgment of
this Court in Phillips and Phillips v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 61,
was released.

Despite the submissions of the Crown to the
contrary, I am of the view that this case is not distinguishable from Phillips.
Following that case then it is apparent that the trial judge was without
jurisdiction to try together the separate informations.

The appeal must therefore be allowed and the
convictions quashed. The situation which arises here is made difficult because
the appellant whose convictions are now quashed has already served the
sentences which were imposed by the trial judge. The convictions are quashed on
a technical point which in no way involves consideration of the merits of the
case. I would therefore direct a new trial on each information so the merits
may be dealt with and, in the event of a conviction, it

[Page 65]

would follow that no further sentence would be
imposed, the sentences already having been served.

This, in my opinion, is a proper case in which
this Court should make an order under s. 717  of the Criminal Code .
Accordingly, I would order that no civil proceedings shall be taken against the
magistrate, His Honour Judge J. Murphy, of the Provincial
 Court (Criminal Division) Judicial District of York,
in respect of the convictions made in this case or against any officer who
acted under the convictions or under any warrant which may have been issued to
enforce them.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Assault—Defences—Protection of
persons in authority—Common assault by Mental Retardation Counsellor on
mentally retarded adult patient—Whether defence under s. 43  of the
Criminal Code  available—Whether Mental Retardation Counsellor a “person
standing in the place of a parent” or a “schoolteacher”—Whether victim a
“child” or a “pupil”—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 43, 771.

Appellant, a Mental Retardation Counsellor,
was charged with common assault after hitting a severely handicapped twenty-one
year old patient several times on the forehead with a large metal spoon after
he had spilled his milk. At trial, the appellant claimed the protection of s.
43  of the Criminal Code  arguing that by virtue of his position, his
relationship with the patient was that of “a person standing in the place of a
parent” or a “schoolteacher” using reasonable force to correct a “child” or
“pupil” in his charge.

The Provincial Court Judge dismissed the
charges. The County Court Judge overturned this judgment and entered a
conviction. On further appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal returned the case to
County Court for a new hearing. The County Court held that s. 43  applied and
acquitted the accused. On second appeal to the Court of Appeal the acquittai
was set aside. It was held that the appellant was not a “schoolteacher” or
“person standing in the place of a parent” and the complainant was neither a
“pupil” nor “child” within the meaning of s. 43 . The issue on this appeal is
whether a Mental Retardation Counsellor who uses physical force on a mentally
retarded adult under his supervision has the benefit of s. 43 of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Ontario Court of Appeal properly took
jurisdiction to consider this appeal pursuant to s. 771(1) of the

[Page 174]

Criminal Code ; the definition and meaning of various terms in s. 43  and the
question whether there was any evidence capable of sustaining a conclusion that
s. 43  applied are issues of law.

Section 43  of the Criminal Code  recognizes
the right of a schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a
parent to use reasonable force in the correction of a child or a pupil. This
section must be strictly construed since it deprives an individual or a
group of the equal protection normally offered by the criminal law, namely the
right to be free from unconsented invasions of physical security or dignity.
Here section 43 has no application: a Mental Retardation Counsellor is not
a “person standing in the place of a parent” or a “schoolteacher” and a
mentally retarded adult under his care, even if severely retarded, is neither a
“child” nor a “pupil” within the meaning of s. 43 .

In the Criminal Code and in the common
law antecedents of s. 43 , as well as other relevant statutes, the word “child”
always refers to a person chronologically younger than the age of majority;
there is no basis for interpreting the word “child” to include adults who are
childlike or who are dependant upon a “parenting” figure. A Mental Retardation
Officer is not a person standing in place of a parent since he has not assumed
all of the obligations incidental to parental relationships, particularly that
of support and maintenance. Even assuming that the complainant’s admission to
the Centre as a voluntary patient with parental consent implies a delegation of
parental powers in favour of the Minister of Social Services, the appellant was
not a delegate of the Minister for purposes of exercising any right of
correction; indeed, Personal Directive No. M.R. 17 specified that physical
force against any resident was forbidden. The meaning of the term “pupil” in s.
43  is limited to a child taking instruction, in the same manner it was at
common law. Finally, the term “schoolteacher” generally refers to a person who
gives formal instruction in a children’s school. Mental Retardation Counsellors
are neither qualified nor licensed as schoolteachers and their functions are
those of personal care and not, in any meaningful sense, of teaching.

Even assuming that s. 43 applied to the
parties in this case, the appellant’s use of force cannot constitute “using
force by way of correction”. The record discloses that the person being
corrected was, to the knowledge of

[Page 175]

the person applying the force, incapable of
remembering the correction within minutes of its application.

acquittal on a charge of common assault. Appeal dismissed.

Ronald L. Doering, for the appellant.

S. Casey Hill and Kenneth L. Campbell,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This appeal raises the issue of
whether a Mental Retardation Counsellor (M.R.C.) who uses physical force on a
mentally retarded adult under his supervision has the benefit of s. 43 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34. Section 43 reads:

43. Every
schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified
in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may
be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable
under the circumstances.

The question of the applicability of s. 43 is
basically one of statutory construction but inevitably it puts into issue two
sensitive topics, namely, the status and rights of mentally retarded persons,
and the limits on the disciplinary prerogatives of persons in authority over
those in their charge. Despite this overlay of social concerns it is important
to remember that the case before this Court is a criminal one and its
resolution must be based on

[Page 176]

legal principles.

I Background and Facts

Mr. Ogg-Moss was charged with assaulting
one Kent Henderson, a twenty-one year old developmentally handicapped resident
of the Rideau Regional Centre, located in Smith Falls, Ontario. Mr. Ogg-Moss was employed at the Regional Centre as
an M.R.C. He argues that by virtue of this position, his relationship with
Mr. Henderson was that of “a person standing in the place of a parent” or
of a “schoolteacher” using reasonable force to “correct” a “child” or “pupil”
in his charge. He claims therefore the protection of s. 43.

Mental Retardation Counsellors are the
“frontline direct care staff in provincial facilities for the developmentally
handicapped. Their duties are set out in Regulations and Directives made
pursuant to the Developmental Services Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 118. These
duties include providing daily care for the residents of such facilities and
implementing programs designed and supervised by physicians, psychologists and
other more senior professional personnel.

On the day in question Mr. Ogg-Moss was
supervising a group of residents in a low grade ward. The residents, including
Mr. Henderson, were seated at tables awaiting lunch. Mr. Henderson
was described in evidence at trial as “very low functioning” and “profoundly
retarded” with an I.Q. of less than 20. He was incapable of speech and, as a
result of being a “head-banger” suffered from a large haemotoma on his
forehead. In an apparent attempt to attract Mr. Ogg-Moss’s attention,
Mr. Henderson spilled his milk on the table before him, whereupon
Mr. Ogg-Moss shouted “no” and struck Mr. Henderson five times on the
forehead with a large metal spoon for the purpose, according to his later
testimony, “of punishing him for what he did”.

[Page 177]

The incident was reported by a summer student at
the Rideau Regional Centre. It was her testimony that Mr. Henderson did
not cry out as a result of being struck but appeared “quite startled”. She felt
that had she been hit with that force she would have cried. In his evidence, in
response to a question as to Mr. Henderson’s reaction to the blows,
Mr. Ogg-Moss replied “Kent
can’t speak but he gives this guttural sound and he did give a cry when I hit
him”. Mr. Ogg-Moss stated further that five minutes after being hit with
the spoon, Mr. Henderson would be incapable of remembering the incident.
He conceded he was aware that it was a contravention of hospital policy to
strike residents. Previous to the incident he had certified in writing that he
had read and understood Personnel Directive Number M.R. 17 of the Ministry of
Social Services which specified that physical force against any resident for
any reason whatsoever was strictly forbidden.

Paragraph N of the Directive reads:

Striking of Patients:—No patient is to be struck for any reason whatsoever; approved
methods of necessary patient restraint specifically exclude striking and any
other form of unnecessary aggression. Any employee who strikes, slaps or kicks
a patient will be dismissed.

II The Decisions in the Ontario Courts

At first instance in the Ontario Provincial Court, counsel for the
Crown conceded that s. 43 was potentially available to the accused as a
defence. The case was therefore argued on the issue of whether the force used
by Mr. Ogg-Moss was more than “reasonable” in the circumstances. Smith
Prov. Ct. J. held that it was not, and that Mr. Ogg-Moss was justified in
taking the action he did to discipline the resident and to prevent the hospital
from becoming a “mad house”. He dismissed the charge.

The Crown appealed to the County Court where
Matheson Co. Ct. J. took a different view of the incident and its surrounding
circumstances. While acknowledging the difficult nature of the accused’s

[Page 178]

job, Matheson Co. Ct. J. held that the force
used was neither reasonable nor justified and substituted a conviction and a
fine.

On further appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal
the applicability of s. 43 was for the first time challenged by the Crown.
Since there was no evidence before them on this issue, Justices Jessup, Martin
and Weatherston sent the case back to the County Court for a new hearing of the
appeal. At this new hearing Flanigan Co. Ct. J. held that a “child” for
purposes of s. 43 included a “severely retarded” adult and that
Mr. Ogg-Moss stood “in the place of a parent” to Mr. Henderson.
Flanigan Co. Ct. J. then stated that in view of what he saw as the limited role
of the appellate court on review, he was unwilling to draw different inferences
from those drawn by the trial judge on the issue of the reasonableness of the
force used by Mr. Ogg‑Moss. He restored the acquittal at trial.

The appeal then returned a second time to the
Ontario Court of Appeal (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 127, 24 C.R. (3d) 264. In a very
brief oral judgment delivered for himself and for Martin and Lacourcière JJ.A.,
Jessup J.A. set out the facts of the case and then held:

However, in our opinion, the respondent was
not a schoolteacher or person standing in the place of a parent and the
complainant was neither a pupil or child within the meaning of s. 43. In the
result we think the appeal must be allowed and the verdict of acquittal set
aside and a verdict of guilty entered. By way of penalty we would impose an
absolute discharge.

III The Grounds of Appeal

The appellant was granted leave to appeal on
five grounds:

1. Whether the Ontario Court of Appeal
erred in holding that a Mental Retardation Counsellor charged with the daily
care of profoundly mentally retarded persons are [sic] not in the place
of a parent vis-à-vis these persons;

[Page 179]

2. whether the Ontario Court of Appeal
erred in holding that a profoundly retarded person with the physical age of
twenty-one and the mental age of five is not a “child” for the purposes of the
application of Section 43  of the Criminal Code  of Canada;

3. whether the Ontario Court of Appeal
erred in holding that a Mental Retardation Counsellor charged with training
mentally retarded persons in basic life skills are [sic] not
schoolteachers and their charges not pupils in the circumstances of an
institution for the mentally retarded;

4. whether the Ontario Court of Appeal
erred in not ordering a new trial, having concluded that Section 43  of the
Criminal Code  had no application;

5. that the learned Justices of the Court
of Appeal erred in law by basing their decision on a question of fact alone,
when the jurisdiction of that Honourable Court was one of appeal restricted to
questions of law alone, pursuant to Section 771(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

Though listed last, the fourth and fifth of
these grounds are logically prior to the others since they challenge the jurisdiction
of the Court of Appeal to proceed as it did. Counsel for Mr. Ogg-Moss
argues that the applicability of a specific section of the Criminal
Code  to a given set of circumstances is a question of fact. He submits,
therefore, that the Court of Appeal’s overturning of Flanigan Co. Ct. J.’s
conclusions as to the applicability of s. 43  to the facts of the present case
was beyond its jurisdiction which (in summary conviction matters, pursuant to
s. 771(1) ) is restricted to questions of law. He argues further that if the
Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the courts below did not adequately
deal with the question of the applicability of s. 43 , the proper course would
have been to order a new trial.

I cannot accept these submissions. In the
present case the issue of the applicability of s. 43  depends on the legal
definition and meaning of various terms and phrases in that section and
whether, therefore, there was any evidence before the courts below capable of
sustaining a conclusion that s. 43  did apply. These are clearly legal questions
and therefore within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. If it is correct
that s. 43  cannot apply to a

[Page 180]

situation like the present then it must
inevitably follow that the blows admittedly struck by Mr. Ogg-Moss
constituted an assault under s. 245(1) and the Court of Appeal, in the exercise
of its discretion, was within its jurisdiction under s. 613(4)(b)(ii) in
substituting a conviction for the acquittal below.

The other three grounds of appeal present
different facets of the main question as to whether the Court of Appeal was
correct in concluding that s. 43  could not apply to the present case.
Mr. Ogg-Moss submits that that court erred in all three of its major
conclusions on the question. In contrast to the Court of Appeal’s conclusions,
he submits that (1) Mr. Henderson was a “child” within the meaning of s.
43 ; (2) Mr. Ogg-Moss was “in the place of a parent” to him for purposes of
that section, and (3) the relationship between them was that of “schoolteacher”
and “pupil”. The Crown submits, on the contrary, that the Court of Appeal was
correct in its conclusion on each of the three points and therefore correct in
entering a conviction in place of the acquittal below.

Although he purports to base his reading of the
terms in issue in this appeal on their “natural and ordinary meaning”, the
appellant’s argument is essentially a functional one. He argues that the terms
“person in the place of a parent” and “child”, on the one hand, and
“schoolteacher” and “pupil”, on the other, refer to relationships.
Consequently, he says, the application of s. 43  ought to be determined
primarily on the basis of the nature and quality of the relationship between
the “parenting person” and the “child” under his care, or between the
“schoolteacher” and his “pupil”, rather than on the basis of such factors as
the chronological age of the “child” or “pupil”.

Mr. Ogg-Moss therefore seeks to support his
contention that he was “in the place of a parent” to Mr. Henderson by
citing the Province of Ontario Manual of Program Care Standards

[Page 181]

(September 1976), from which he quotes the
following passage:

Direct-care staff shall be responsible for
observing, detecting, reporting and managing usual resident illness and
behaviour. They shall be trained as surrogate parents to handle such
illness and behaviour as are commonly met in the working situation.

(Emphasis added.)

He argues that the functions of an M.R.C.
correspond to those of a parent and that, in fact, the M.R.C. is the only “parent”
many mentally retarded persons will know. This line of argument found favour
with Flanigan Co. Ct. J. who prefaced his conclusion that Mr. Ogg‑Moss
stood in the place of a parent to Mr. Henderson by observing:

I can’t think of any person more closely
associated with this particular victim [sic] as a parent image than the
accused.

On the basis of his contention that an M.R.C.
stands in the place of a parent to a mentally retarded person, the appellant
argues that the mentally retarded person is a “child” for purposes of s. 43  no
matter what his chronological age may be. He contends that this reading of s.
43  is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word “child”, which, as
defined by Webster’s Dictionary of the English Language, includes a
“childlike or childish person”. The appellant cites from the decision of
Flanigan Co. Ct. J.:

When one looks at the job description that
is affixed to the Appellant’s Affidavit…and when one refers to the evidence as
to the condition of the victim who has been in this institution for many years,
one can come to no other conclusion on any reasonable basis that [sic]
the word “child” could not [sic] apply to him. Surely the very services
that are applied and that this victim requires are those that we envisage being
required by a child of tender years.

Finally, the appellant urges, even if
Mr. Henderson was not a “child” within the meaning of s. 43 , his
relationship to Mr. Ogg-Moss was nevertheless that of a “pupil” to a
“schoolteacher”. He contends that the job description of a M.R.C.

[Page 182]

includes teaching “life skills” and that at the
time of the incident in question he was teaching Mr. Henderson to eat with
a spoon. In the absence of a statutory definition, the terms “schoolteacher”
and “pupil” should, he submits, be given a liberal interpretation so as to
include this sort of instructional activity.

IV The Purpose and the Effect of s. 43 

Mr. Ogg-Moss urges a broad, functional
approach to the terms in s. 43 . In his submission, the purpose of s. 43  is to
protect persons exercising certain parental and instructional functions and
therefore its terms ought to be defined so as to further that purpose. I do not
doubt that a functional reading is often more appropriate to statutory
construction than a slavishly literal one and is often better suited to the
attainment of legislative purposes. This appropriateness, however, depends on
the accuracy with which the purpose of the enactment is identified.

I note that in the present appeal, there is
something circular in the way the appellant identifies the purpose of s. 43 . If
he is correct, and the terms “in the place of a parent” and “child” or
“schoolteacher” and “pupil” ought to be given wide interpretations, then he
will also be correct that a particular result, and arguably the purpose, of s.
43  will be to protect persons exercising widely-defined “parental” or
“educational” functions. But since the accuracy of this identification of the
purpose of s. 43  depends on the accuracy of Mr. Ogg-Moss’s “liberal
definitions of its terms, I do not see how it is possible then to turn around
and use this purpose to support these very same definitions. It seems
clearly true that the purpose of s. 43  and the meaning of its terms are closely
intertwined, but the consequence is that neither one can be deduced from an a
priori definition of the other. An abstract definition of the hypothetical
purpose cannot, therefore, be the proper starting point for a consideration of
the meaning of its terms.

[Page 183]

A better starting point, in my view, is not the purpose
of s. 43  but its effects. While a confident conclusion as to the purpose of
s. 43  must await an accurate assessment of the meaning of its terms, the
overall effects of that section are clear, no matter how its terms
are defined. It exculpates the use of what would otherwise be criminal force by
one group of persons against another. It protects the first group of
persons, but, it should be noted, at the same time it removes the
protection of the criminal law from the second. For the Attorney General of
Ontario this latter effect justifies a restrictive reading of s. 43 ,
specifically of the terms “child” and “pupil”. It is his submission that:

…the class of persons against whom
otherwise criminal force can be employed ought to be restricted, not broadened,
and…any section which authorizes otherwise illegal physical violence
should be strictly construed against the actor.

There is much to be said in favour of this
submission. As a statement of general principle it accords with our normal
assumptions about the purpose and operation of the criminal law. One of the key
rights in our society is the individual’s right to be free from unconsented
invasions on his or her physical security or dignity and it is a central
purpose of the criminal law to protect members of society from such invasions.
I agree with the Attorney General that any derogation from this right and this
protection ought to be strictly construed. Where the effect of such a purported
derogation is to deprive a specific individual or group of the equal protection
we normally assume is offered by the criminal law, I think it appropriate to
view the proferred definition with suspicion and to insist on a demonstration
of the logic and rationale of the interpretation.

Finally, on this point, it should be noted that
s. 43  is not necessary for the protection of persons using physical force in
response to violent or dangerous behaviour or in the course of approved
treatment. The former situations are already covered by, inter alia, ss.
34, 35, 37, 38, 39 and 41 of

[Page 184]

the Criminal Code . The latter are dealt
with by provincial legislation such as the Developmental Services Act,
supra, and the Mental Health Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 262, and by
regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by the common law.
Section 43  only applies to “correctional” force unrelated to treatment or
to the protection of self or others.

V Is a mentally retarded adult a “child” for
purposes of s. 43 ?

Why in law or in policy should the word “child”
be given a definition which would make a mentally retarded person over 21
subject to blows which, if directed at a mentally normal 21‑year old,
would constitute an assault? In my view the proposition that a person in
Mr. Henderson’s position is a “child”, within the meaning of s. 43 , is
refuted by the history of s. 43  and its common law antecedents and by the
very “functional” analysis through which the proposition is articulated.

(a) ‘‘Child” in s. 43  and its common law
antecedents

Both in common parlance and as a legal concept
the term “child” has two primary meanings. One refers to chronological age and
is the converse of the term “adult”; the other refers to lineage and is the
reciprocal of the term “parent”. A child in the first sense was defined at
common law as a person under the age of fourteen. This definition may be
modified by statutory provision: see, for example, the Child Welfare Act, R.S.O.
1980, c. 66, s. 19(1); the Children s Institutions Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.
67, s. 1(c) and the Children’s Residential Services Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.
71, s. 1(b). No statutory modification, however, fixes an age
higher than the age of majority which, in Ontario, pursuant to the Age of Majority and Accountability Act, R.S.O.
1980, c. 7, s. 1(1), is 18 years. A child in the second sense was defined at
common law as the legitimate offspring of a parent, but in most jurisdictions
this definition has been amended by statute to constitute all offspring,
whether legitimate or not, as the “children” of their natural

[Page 185]

or adoptive parents: see, for example, the Children’s
Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 68, s. 1.

As I have indicated, according to the appellant
there is a third meaning for the term “child” which focusses on the
“childishness” or “childlike” behaviour of the person to whom it applies. To my
knowledge this definition of child has no equivalent as a legal concept,
nor—unless it succeed in the current case—has it ever successfully been urged
to interpret a statutory provision. Certainly it is not the meaning of the term
child in the common law antecedents of s. 43 .

Like s. 43, the common law recognized a right of
certain persons to use force in the correction of a “child”. The “child”
referred to was a child in the sense both of chronology and of lineage.
This is how Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book
I, chap. 16, described the common law right:

The power of a parent by our English laws
is much more moderate [than that of the paterfamilias in Roman law]; but
still sufficient to keep the child in order and obedience. He may lawfully
correct his child being under age, in a reasonable manner; for this is for
the benefit of his education… He may also delegate part of his parental
authority, during his life, to the tutor or schoolmaster of his child; who is
then in loco parentis [in the place of a parent], and has such a portion
of the power of the parent committed to his charge, viz. that of
restraint and correction, as may be necessary to answer the purposes for which
he is employed.

(Emphasis added.)

I shall have occasion to return to this quote,
but the underlined portion clearly indicates that the power to chastise was, at
least at common law, the power of a parent (specifically the father) or of his
direct delegate, to discipline his offspring until the age of majority. Blackstone
is explicit on this point:

The legal power of a father (for a mother,
as such, is entitled to no power, but only to reverence and respect)

[Page 186]

the power of a father, I say, over the
persons of his children ceases at the age of twenty one:…

I have no doubt, therefore, that at common law
no chronological adult, no matter how “childish” or “childlike”, was subject to
corporal correction from his father or his father’s delegate. History does not
support the appellant’s interpretation.

Given the seemingly clear restriction of the
common law right of correction to a “child” under the age of majority, it seems
highly unlikely that the framers of the Criminal Code  used this same
word to render a wider class of persons subject to such correction. This
impression is reinforced by the fact that when a “child” is referred to
elsewhere in the Code either explicitly or by implication, it always refers
to a person chronologically younger than the age of majority: see ss. 3 , 140 , 146 ,
168(3)  and 197 . It should also be noted that when the Code does wish to
refer to a person with a mental handicap it does so not metaphorically as a
“child” or by reference to his purportedly “childlike” or “childish”
characteristics, but rather directly, if somewhat bluntly, as a “feeble-minded
person” or “an idiot” or “imbecile” or simply “insane”. See, for example, ss.
2 , 158(2) (b)(ii). Although somewhat disturbing to modern sensibilities
the terms “feeble-minded”, “idiot” and “imbecile” are, in fact, the legal
equivalents to the current concepts of “mentally retarded” or “developmentally
handicapped”. Had the Criminal Code  intended to include mentally
retarded adults in the category of person subject to corporal punishment, these
are the terms it would have used, not “child”.

(b) The “functional” reading of “child”

The foregoing factors of history and statutory
construction make the appellant’s proposed interpretation highly unlikely.
Beyond them, the skepticism which would in any event be the proper judicial
response to the appellant’s proposed extension of the category of persons the
common law made subject to corporal correction is in no way allayed even by his
“functional” reading of the

[Page 187]

term “child”. The single basis cited by
Mr. Ogg-Moss for his metaphorical reading of the word “child” is the
purported correspondence between the dependency on a parenting figure by a
severely retarded adult and by a “child”. Beyond this single asserted
correspondence, there are no submissions that would support a conclusion as to
the “childish” or “childlike” nature of mentally retarded persons; nor do I
believe that any such arguments could be successfully maintained. Certainly the
description in the record of Mr. Henderson’s condition affords no support for
such an argument. Incapacity for speech, “headbanging” and inability to recall
incidents for more than a few minutes are signs of severe physiological
affliction. They do not correspond to any recognizable image of childhood. I
agree with the Attorney General for Ontario that there is a qualitative difference between “immaturity”,
“childishness” or “childlike” behaviour and the behaviour of a mentally
retarded adult, especially as in the present case, of a severely retarded
adult.

A further important consideration is that
chronological childhood is a transitory phase, and for a child in the
chronological sense the suspension of the criminal law’s protection against
certain kinds of assault is a temporary phenomenon. For the mentally retarded
person the definition of “childhood” proposed by the appellant is a life
sentence and the consequent attenuation of his right to dignity and physical
security is permanent. I cannot believe that it is the intention of the Criminal
Code  to create such a category of permanent second-class citizens on the
basis of a mental or physical handicap.

If mentally retarded adults are to be considered
“children” solely on the basis of their dependency on a “parenting” figure, it
is difficult to see how the category of “children” would be limited to the
mentally retarded. Essentially the same argument could be made with regard to
the functional relationship between sufferers from senility or other cognitive
disorder, or perhaps even stroke victims or other invalids, and those who take
care of them.

[Page 188]

If an inability to tend to one’s basic needs, or
an inability, because of one’s mental state, to function unassisted in society,
are indices of “childishness”, then the category of adults subject to
correction is a very broad one indeed. I do not believe that a functional
analysis of childlike dependency is appropriate in these latter cases and for
similar reasons I cannot accept it with regard to mentally retarded adults.

A mentally retarded adult is not a child in
fact, nor for purposes of the law in general, nor for purposes of s. 43  of the Criminal
Code  in particular.

VI Is a Mental Retardation Counsellor a
“Person Standing in the Place of a Parent” to a Mentally Retarded Person under
His Charge?

Section 43  only authorizes a “person
standing in the place of a parent” to use force by way of correction of a child.
Since I have concluded that a mentally-retarded adult is not a “child”, it
must follow that even if an M.R.C. were a person standing in the place of a
parent, he would not be authorized to use force to correct a mentally retarded
adult like Mr. Henderson. Even if I were wrong, however, and a mentally
retarded adult could be a “child” for purposes of s. 43 , I would
nevertheless hold that an M.R.C. in the position of Mr. Ogg-Moss is not a
“person standing in the place of a parent” within the meaning of that section.

At common law the power to use force for the
correction of a child was vested in the child’s parents (originally the
father). Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book I, chap.
16, saw it as one of the parental rights which were the correlatives of
the parental duties of support, education and protection. As the passage
quoted earlier indicates, this right was conceptualized as an aid in
discharging the parental duty of education and could be delegated by the parent
to a schoolmaster.

[Page 189]

It follows, then, that at common law there are
two ways in which a person could put himself “in the place of a parent”. The
first is to assume, in the absence or default of the natural parents, the
parental duties that give rise to parental rights. The second is to have that
right delegated to one by the natural parent.

The first way of assuming the place of a parent
is consonant with the well-known line of cases defining the legal meaning of
the term in loco parentis or “in the place of a parent”. The locus
classicus is the decision of Jessel M.R. in Bennet v. Bennet (1879),
10 Ch. D. 474 (which was itself based on the decisions of Lord Eldon in Ex
parte Pye (1811), 18 Ves. 140 and Lord Cottenham, in Powys v. Mansfield (1837),
3 My. & Cr. 359) wherein Jessel M.R. held at pp. 477-78:

…a person in loco parentis means a
person taking upon himself the duty of a father of a child to make a provision
for that child.

…

In the case of a person in loco parentis
you must prove that he took upon himself the obligation.

This line of cases has been applied in Canada, inter
alia, in Mitchell v. City of Toronto (1921), 64 D.L.R. 569 (Ont.
C.A.) and Shtitz v. C.N.R., [1927] 1 D.L.R. 951 (Sask. C.A.) and in the
United States, inter alia, in Fuller v. Fuller, 418 F. 2d 1189
(C.A.D.C. 1969), and in Busillo v. Hetzel, 374 N.E. 2d 1090 (I11. App.
1978). These decisions have stressed the central necessity of taking upon
oneself responsibility for the child’s financial support in order to fall
within the definition of a “person standing in the place of a parent”. See, for
example, the passage from the judgment of Turgeon J.A. in the Shtitz case,
at p. 959:

A person in loco parentis to a child
is one who has acted so as to evidence his intention of placing himself towards
the child in the situation which is ordinarily occupied by the father for the
provision of the child’s pecuniary wants.

The English cases upon which this definition is
based dealt mainly with questions of inheritance, specifically the presumptions
of satisfaction and

[Page 190]

ademption in equity. The definition is also
relevant, however, to the question of whether the functions a person discharges
vis-à-vis a child are sufficiently similar to those of a parent to
entitle him to use force in the correction of a child.

The Bennet v. Bennet definition was
applied implicitly in R. v. Woods (1921), 85 J.P. 272. In that case
Avory J. rejected the claim that an elder brother was in loco parentis for
purposes of correction, on the ground that once the children’s father had
returned from the war the elder brother could no longer be said to be taking
his place. It was applied explicitly and in a manner directly relevant to the
current appeal, in North Carolina v. Pittard, 263 S.E. 2d 809 (N.C. App.
1980). In that case a day-care worker had claimed the right to use force in the
correction of a child by virtue of the similarity of her functions in caring
for the child and those of a parent. Wells J., speaking for the Court, rejected
this claim at p. 811:

The relationship of in loco parentis does
not arise from the mere placing of a child in the temporary care of other
persons by a parent or guardian of such child. The relationship is established
only when the person with whom the child is placed intends to assume the status
of a parent—by taking on obligations incidental to the parental relationships
particularly that of support and maintenance.

(Emphasis added.)

See also, to the same effect, Martin v.
United States, 452 A. 2d 360 (D.C. App. 1982).

I agree with these conclusions. Insofar as
Mr. Ogg-Moss’s claim to status of a “person standing in the place of a
parent” for purposes of using force by way of correction rests on the
similarity between the functions of an M.R.C. and of a parent, it cannot
succeed. The parent’s power of correction arises from his assumption of all the
obligations of parenthood. A person does not step into the place of a parent
for purposes of assuming this power unless he also assumes all these obliga-

[Page 191]

tions. Not only does an M.R.C. have no
responsibility for the pecuniary needs of the children under his temporary
care, those “parental” responsibilities which he does exercise are exercised
under the direction and supervision of the Minister and the senior professional
staff designated by the Regulations under the Developmental Services Act,
supra. He does not, by exercising these limited responsibilities become in
the relevant sense, a “person standing in the place of a parent”.

Even if a person does not stand “in the place of
a parent” in the Bennet v. Bennet sense, there still remains the second
way of assuming this position, that of delegation. Flanigan Co. Ct. J. found
that Mr. Ogg-Moss stood in loco parentis to Mr. Henderson “as
an agent of the Minister and an employee of the Department”. With respect, I
cannot agree. As the decision in Pittard, supra, clearly indicates,
delegation cannot simply be inferred from the fact of placing a child in the
care of another. I am willing to assume that Mr. Henderson’s admission in
early childhood to the Rideau Regional Centre as a voluntary patient with
parental consent implies a delegation of parental powers in favour of the
Minister. This, however, is not enough. For Mr. Ogg-Moss to succeed, the
power must then have moved from the Minister to Mr. Ogg‑Moss. On
this latter point, the record in the present case goes beyond a simple absence
of evidence of sub-delegation to positive evidence of non-delegation in the form
of the prohibition in Personnel Directive Number M.R. 17 forbidding the
striking of any resident for any reason whatsoever. Mr. Ogg-Moss was not
a delegate of the Minister for purposes of exercising any right of
correction that may have been delegated to the Minister; nor, as a consequence
of his certification that he read and understood this directive, could he
assert that he mistakenly thought that he was.

I conclude that even if a person in the position
of Mr. Henderson were a child for purposes of

[Page 192]

s. 43 , an M.R.C. in the position of
Mr. Ogg-Moss would not be a “person standing in the place of a parent”
within the meaning of the section.

VII Is the Relationship between a Mental
Retardation Counsellor and a Mentally Retarded Adult under his Care that of
“Schoolteacher” and “Pupil”?

(a) “Pupil”

The same considerations apply to the definition
of “pupil” for the purposes of s. 43  as to the definition of “child”.

Blackstone, in the passage quoted earlier, makes
it clear that at common law the schoolmaster’s right of corporal correction
only applied to a chronological child under his charge. He speaks of a parent’s
power to correct his underage child being delegated to the “tutor or
schoolmaster of his child”. A similar connotation of childhood attaches to the
word “pupil” used in s. 43 , which, unlike the more neutral “student”, has
overtones of immaturity or youthfulness. Were this not so, and were the s. 43 
relationship between “schoolmaster” and “pupil” to be read as authorizing
corporal correction by anyone teaching something to someone else, then anyone,
no matter what his age or his mental competence, would be vulnerable to
corporal correction anytime he sought instruction in any field. This would be
ludicrous. It is clear that whatever else it may mean, the term “pupil” as used
in s. 43  must be limited, as it was at common law, to a child taking
instruction.

Since I have already concluded that a mentally
retarded adult is not a child for purposes of s. 43 , it follows that he is also
not a “pupil” within the meaning of that section.

(b) “Schoolteacher”

Because Mr. Henderson is not a “pupil”
Mr. Ogg-Moss’s claim to protection by virtue of his status as
“schoolteacher” would fail in any event. It also fails because an M.R.C. is not
a schoolteacher.

[Page 193]

Like its reciprocal term “pupil” which is
narrower than the term “student”, the term “schoolteacher” is narrower than the
terms “teacher” or “instructor”. Generally, it refers to a person who gives
formal instruction in a children’s school. I would in any event have doubt as
to whether an M.R.C. could fall even within the wider definition of “teacher”,
since his functions are those of personal care and not, in any meaningful
sense, of “teaching”. A fortiori an M.R.C. cannot fall within the more restrictive
definition of “schoolteacher”. Mental Retardation Counsellors are neither
qualified nor licensed as schoolteachers. Such “educational” responsibilities
as they do possess (Mr. Ogg-Moss’s claim rests on the fact that he was
“instructing” Mr. Henderson on how to eat with a spoon) have no academic
content, and the context in which they are carried out has not even a
metaphorical connection with that in which a schoolteacher functions. I think
counsel for Mr. Ogg-Moss was well advised at first instance to disclaim
any reliance on an M.R.C.’s status as a “schoolteacher”. He has none.

VIII Using Force By Way of Correction

Even if all of the above were incorrect and an
M.R.C. could be a “schoolteacher” or “person standing in the place of a parent”
and a mentally retarded adult could be a “child” or “pupil” within the meaning
of s. 43 , the appeal would still fail.

Section 43  authorizes the use of force “by
way of correction”. As Blackstone noted, such “correction” of a child is
countenanced by the law because it is “for the benefit of his education”.
Section 43  is, in other words, a justification. It exculpates a
parent, schoolteacher or person standing in the place of a parent who uses
force in the correction of a child, because it considers such an action not a
wrongful, but a rightful, one. It follows that unless the force is “by
way of correction”, that is, for the benefit of the education of the child, the
use of force will not be justified.

[Page 194]

An early Canadian illustration of one aspect of
this principle is Mitchell v. Defries (1846), 2 U.C.Q.B. 430, which
dealt with the common law authorization, now no longer in effect, for a
“master” to use force in the correction of his “apprentice”. The Upper Canada
Court of Appeal was clearly correct in refusing to read the term “apprentice”
so widely as to include a servant. A “master” had a responsibility for the
education of his “apprentice”; an employer had no such responsibility toward
his employees.

Where the context does imply an educational
responsibility, this same reasoning demands that the person applying the force
intended it for “correction”, and that the person being “corrected” be capable
of learning from the correction. These stipulations are separate and distinct
from the additional requirement, essentially a question of fact, that the force
used be reasonable in the circumstances.

The first prerequisite, that the force be
intended for correction, has been a part of Canadian law since Brisson v.
Lafontaine (1864), 8 L.C. Jur. 173 (S.C.) In a passage that has been quoted
in almost every subsequent case on the right of correction, Loranger J. said at
p. 175 that the schoolteacher’s power of correction could only be exercised in
“the interests of instruction” and that “any punishment…motivated by
arbitrariness, caprice, anger or bad humour constitutes an offence punishable
like ordinary offences.”

The second prerequisite, referring to the
child’s capacity, was articulated by Martin B. in R. v. Griffin (1869),
11 Cox C.C. 402, at p. 403: “The law as to correction has reference only to a
child capable of appreciating correction.” In Griffin, Martin B. held
that a two-and-a-half year old child was not so capable. The English scholar,
Professor H.K. Bevan, in his work, The Law Relating to Children (1973),
has concluded at p. 212, footnote 11, that on this same basis “there would be
no right to punish a child who was mentally disordered”.

[Page 195]

This latter conclusion could, of course, be
highly relevant to the present appeal. I find it impossible and unnecessary to
decide the correctness of the full breadth of Professor Bevan’s categorical
statement. There is no evidence before this Court to the effect that mentally
retarded children either are or are not, as a class, capable of appreciating
correction. I do agree, however, that insofar as a given mentally retarded
child is incapable of appreciating correction, s. 43  does not, as a matter of
law, justify the use of force by a person standing in the place of a parent or
by a schoolteacher. In the present case where the record discloses that the
person being “corrected” was, to the knowledge of the person applying the
force, incapable of remembering the “correction” within minutes of its
application, the assault could not, as a matter of law, constitute “using force
by way of correction” and the person committing it could not have recourse to
s. 43 .

IX Conclusion

In my view the Court of Appeal was correct in
each of its conclusions. An M.R.C. is neither a “person standing in the place
of a parent” nor a “schoolteacher” and a mentally retarded adult under his
care, even if “severely” or “profoundly” retarded, is neither a “child” nor a
“pupil” within the meaning of s. 43 . Section 43  cannot therefore have any
application to a case like the present.

I wish to reiterate that this conclusion in no
way affects the right of a person in authority to use force to protect himself
or others from violent or threatening behaviour. The fact that the person
behaving in this violent or threatening manner may be mentally handicapped is
irrelevant to this right. My conclusion as to the inapplicability of s. 43  also
has no effect on the statutory or common law protection enjoyed by those who
apply force in the course of medical treatment for which the proper consent has
been obtained.

Since s. 43 does not justify the intentional
application of force in a situation like the present, it follows that this use
of force constitutes an

[Page 196]

assault within the meaning of s. 245(1), I make
no comment on the gravity of the, assault nor on the appropriateness of laying
criminal charges. These questions are not before us; as in the case of any
other intentional application of force they are matters for prosecutorial
judgment and the discretion of the sentencing court. The Court of Appeal did
not err in entering a verdict of guilty.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

R.J. Poirier, for the appellant.

S. Casey Hill and Kenneth L. Campbell,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The present appeal raises the very
issue this Court considered in Ogg-Moss v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
173, reasons being delivered concurrently herewith, namely, whether a Mental
Retardation Counsellor (M.R.C.) who uses physical force on a mentally retarded
adult under his supervision has the benefit of s. 43 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34.

There is a striking similarity in the factual
situations in both cases. The only noticeable differ-

[Page 198]

ence is in the level of mental development of
the respective victims. The victim in Ogg-Moss was severely handicapped.
The victim in the present case was only moderately retarded and relatively
self-sufficient.

In my view, this difference is of no consequence
to the determination of this appeal and therefore I do not feel it necessary
further to review the facts.

If a severely retarded person is not considered
a “child” under s. 43 (Ogg-Moss, supra) then, a fortiori, a
moderately handicapped person cannot fall within the restricted definition of
“child”.

I would also adopt the analysis in Ogg-Moss as
to why an “M.R.C.” is neither “a person standing in the place of a parent” nor
a “schoolteacher” and why a moderately retarded adult under his or her care is
neither a “child” nor a “pupil” within the meaning of s. 43.

For the reasons given in Ogg-Moss v. The
Queen, s. 43 of the Criminal Code  does not afford a defence to the
accused in the present case. The Court of Appeal did not err in entering a
verdict of guilty.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Presumption of intent to escape
civil and criminal liability—Three elements enumerated in
subsection creating presumption—Whether or not presumption arises on proof
of one element or only on proof of all three—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c.
C-34, s. 233(2), (3).

Respondent backed his vehicle into
complainant’s vehicle, causing considerable damage, made threatening gestures,
and then drove into complainant’s vehicle pushing it some thirty to forty feet.
He finally drove away, without leaving his name and address with anyone. At
issue was whether all three elements in s. 233(3)—(1) failure to stop, (2)
failure to give name and address, and (3) failure to offer assistance in event
of injury—had to be proven to give rise to the presumption of intent to escape
civil and criminal liability, or only one of the three elements.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The presumption in s. 233(3), which was
to faciliate proof of intent to escape civil or criminal liability, applies on
proof of any one of the elements. The Crown, otherwise, would have to rely on
the failure to do one of the three things mentioned to establish the intent
beyond a reasonable doubt, and if all three elements were proved, the inference
of intent would probably be irresistible. Therefore, if Parliament intended
that the accused could commit the offence by failing to do any one of the
things specified in subs. 2, Parliament also intended that the presumption would
apply in any case where the accused failed to do any of the elements specified.

Catherine Ryan, for the appellant.

Brian Coleman, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Douglas John Roche was charged in Vancouver in the Provincial
 Court and was found guilty of the following charge:

That at the City of Vancouver, Province of
British Columbia, on the 15th day of April, A.D. 1979, having the care, charge
or control of a vehicle that was involved in an accident with a vehicle to wit,
British Columbia license number 7102GC, unlawfully with intent to escape civil
or criminal liability, did fail to give his name and address, contrary to the
form of the statute in such case made and provided.

He appealed his conviction to the County Court
and a new trial was ordered.

The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. That appeal was
dismissed. The Crown is now appealing to this Court.

THE FACTS

On April 15, 1979, at approximately 1:45 a.m., Roche was involved in an automobile
accident with a vehicle in a laneway in Vancouver. The accused had backed his vehicle into that of the complainant
while attempting to park his vehicle, causing considerable damage.

The complainant’s vehicle was carrying two
passengers.

After the accident, the accused took a pool cue
from his vehicle and approached the complainant.

[Page 493]

As the two passengers left the complainant’s
vehicle, the accused returned to his vehicle, made a U-turn, then drove into
the complainant’s vehicle and pushed it thirty to forty feet down the lane. The
accused then drove away without leaving his name and address with anyone who
had witnessed the accident.

The sole issue raised and considered throughout
the appeals in the courts below and to be determined in this Court is a narrow
one and is the following:

Does the presumption created by
section 233(3)  of the Criminal Code  apply on proof of any one of the
events:

(1) failure to stop;

(2) failure to give name and address;

(3) failure to offer assistance (where any
person has been injured);

or does that presumption apply only on
proof of all of those events (or on the first two of them where there is no
personal injury)?

Section 233(3)  should be read with
s. 233(2)

233. …

(2) Every one who, having the care, charge
or control of a vehicle that is involved in an accident with a person, vehicle
or cattle in the charge of a person, with intent to escape civil or criminal
liability fails to stop his vehicle, give his name and address and, where any
person has been injured, offer assitance, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

(3) In proceedings under
subsection (2), evidence that an accused failed to stop his vehicle, offer
assistance where any person has been injured and give his name and address is,
in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof of an intent to escape
civil and criminal liability.

Of importance is the fact that most if not all
courts in the land have held (and I agree rightly so) the enumeration of
s. 233(2) to be disjunctive (R. v. Steere (1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 403
(B.C.C.A.); R. v. Simard (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 306 (N.S.C.A.); R. v.
Kipling (1957), 119 C.C.C.

[Page 494]

171 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Chitty (1958), 124
C.C.C. 45 (N.B.C.A); R. v. Laing (1945), 85 C.C.C. 249 (Ont. H.C.); R.
v. Parks (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 172 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Adler, [1981]
4 W.W.R. 379 (Sask. C.A.)).

In answering this question regarding the
application of subs. 3, the courts throughout Canada are divided, as was the
Court of Appeal in this case. McFarlane and Carrothers JJ.A. would require
proof of all the events. Craig J.A., dissenting, was of the view that the
presumption would arise upon proof of any one of the events.

The views of the majority of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal are shared by the Court of Appeal of Ontario (see R.
v. Wills (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 520), whilst those of Craig J.A. are shared
by the Courts of Appeal of Alberta (see R. v. Parks, supra) and of
Saskatchewan (see R. v. Adler, supra).

In Wills, supra, Arnup J.A., writing for
the Court, did not give any reasons for the position he took and merely stated,
at p. 521:

In our view the presumption of s-s.(3) of
s. 233 does not apply in the circumstances of this case, in that the
appellant did not both fail to stop his vehicle and failed to give his name and
address. Accordingly, the prima facie proof of intent to escape civil or
criminal liability was not brought into play through that subsection.

As for the Parks and Adler decisions,
they were both predicated upon R. v. Steere, supra, a decision of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia. In that case, the issue was whether a case
is made out under s. 233(2) if it be proved that the accused failed to
perform any one of the three duties imposed, namely: (1) to stop his vehicle;
(2) to give his name and address; and (3) where any person has been injured, to
offer assistance.

McFarlane J.A., writing for the Court, had found
in the affirmative.

The Alberta and Saskatchewan Courts of Appeal,
apart from alluding to the Steere decision, gave little or no reasons,
(as did the Ontario Court of Appeal to find conversely) in support of their
findings.

[Page 495]

Such is not the case here. Both McFarlane J.A.
for the Court and Craig J.A. gave thorough reasons, and I must admit, both very
convincing reasons supporting their views.

The essence of McFarlane J.A.’s reasons is found
in the following passage of his judgment:

It may seem, prima facie, inconsistent
and illogical to apply the word “and” disjunctively in subsection (2) but
conjunctively in subsection (3). This prima facie inconsistency
disappears, however, in my opinion, on a comparison of the syntax of the two
subsections. I think the correct meaning of subsection (2) is that
Parliament intended an accused should be guilty of an offence unless all of the
described statutory duties be performed, provided, of course, intent to escape
liability be proved. On the other hand, I find no absurd, unintelligible or
meaningless result when the word “and” in subsection (3) is read
conjunctively as prima facie it should be in accord with its usual
normal meaning.

It would appear from this passage that McFarlane
J.A. was of the view that, since a literal reading of s. 233(3)  does not
lead to an “absurd, unintelligible or meaningless result”, the enumeration
contained therein should be construed as being conjunctive and the word “and”
given its primary meaning.

This, in my view, is the proper approach when a
section is not open to more than one interpretation. Indeed, when such is
the case, the courts need not interpret the section and should not seek
out the object of the section in order to ascertain whether it has been
frustrated by the draftsmen and then give the words of the section an
unusual meaning. But when the section is capable of more than one
interpretation, then the approach taken by Craig J.A. is, in my view, the correct
one.

It might be said that s. 233(3)  read in
isolation is clear. But this is not the type of section that should be
treated in that way, as it is ancillary to s. 233(2). It is when one reads
s. 233(2) that one sees that the enumeration in s. 233(3)  may be
conjunctive or disjunctive and therefore open to interpreta-

[Page 496]

tion. I fail to see why the courts may find
s. 233(3)  any less open to interpretation as to whether it was disjunctive
or conjunctive than s. 233(2), a fact as regards the latter all courts,
including the British Columbia and Ontario Courts of Appeal, have acknowledged
(see R. v. Kipling, supra, R. v. Steere, supra).

There is no peremptory argument, as the courts
seem to have found in Parks and Adler, to be drawn from the fact
that the enumeration in s. 233(2) is disjunctive. Section 233(2) can be
disjunctive whilst its supportive s. 233(3)  still be conjunctive, one
creating the offence, the other determining when a presumption will be
triggered. Indeed, it is not because the purpose sought by s. 233(2) is
best served by a disjunctive reading of that section that the purpose will
of necessity be best furthered through a disjunctive reading of s. 233(3) .
But, if given a choice of interpretation, and if such is the case, the disjunctive
reading is the one the Court should choose.

Let us then look to the purpose sought to be
served by both sections.

With respect, I am of the view that the
interpretation that will best serve the object of the Act is the disjunctive
one. On this point, I cannot express my views any better than by quoting Craig
J.A. in his reasons where he said:

Should subsection (3) be interpreted
conjunctively, or disjunctively? The answer to this question depends on the
intention of the Legislature. While the question is a vexing one, I tend to the
view that s-s. (3) should be interpreted to mean that presumption arises
if the accused fails to do any one of the three things mentioned. Obviously,
the purpose of the presumption is to facilitate proof of the gravamen of the
offence, namely, the intent to escape civil or criminal liability. Without a
presumption provision, the Crown would in most cases have to rely solely on the
failure to do one of the three things mentioned to prove the intent. A judge
might, or might not, infer that the intent had been established beyond
reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if an accused failed to do all of these
three things, the inference of intent would, probably, be irresistible. In
those circumstances, the Crown would not have to rely on any

[Page 497]

presumption of intent. The need to rely on
a presumption would appear to be necessary only in a case where the inference
of intent is not irresistible. I think, therefore, that if Parliament intended
that the accused could commit the offence by failing to do any one of the three
things specified in s-s. (2), Parliament intended, also, that the
presumption provision would be applicable in any case where the accused failed
to do any of the things specified. The presumption provision does not place any
onus on the accused to establish his lack of intent. The onus remains on the
Crown to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption provision
simply assists the Crown in achieving that standard of proof and is applicable
only in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction entered by the trial judge.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Attempted
rape—Evidence—Complainant’s post-offence sexual conduct ruled inadmissible at
trial after s. 142 hearing—Whether or not evidence should have been
admitted—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34,s. 142.

This is a Crown appeal from a Court of Appeal
judgment setting aside respondent’s conviction of attempted rape and ordering a
new trial.

At respondent’s trial the judge, following an
in camera hearing held pursuant to s. 142(1)  of the Criminal
Code , ruled that the evidence relating to the complainant’s pre-offence
sexual conduct was admissible. Evidence of complainant’s post-offence sexual
conduct was not admitted, however, because the trial judge considered it
irrelevant. Section 142(2)  gave the trial judge a discretion to include
evidence if he were satisfied that it was necessary to a just determination of
an issue of fact, and to exclude it if not so satisfied. The issue here was the
admissibility of evidence relating to complainant’s post-offence sexual conduct
with persons other than the accused and the trial judge’s treatment of this
evidence.

Held (Beetz,
Chouinard and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson and Lamer JJ.: The trial judge’s ruling erroneously
affirmed his previous assertion that post-offence sexual conduct was irrelevant
in principle and he therefore did not consider the requirements of
s. 142(1) . Although the trial judge might be said to have asked himself
whether the defence on a balance of probabilities had established the necessity
of asking questions relating to complainant’s post-offence sexual conduct, a
conviction cannot properly be founded on what was at best speculation as to the
trial

[Page 389]

judge’s intention. There was too tenuous a
basis in what the trial judge said to extend it to include the post-offence
conduct in his assessment required under s. 142(1) .

Per Beetz,
Chouinard and Wilson JJ., dissenting: The trial judge properly
excluded evidence of complainant’s post-offence sexual conduct, not as a matter
of principle, but because it was not relevant on the facts before him. He
believed that the complainant’s post‑offence sexual conduct was
occasioned by the trauma of the rape and therefore would not permit a
humiliating and devastating inquiry into it at trial. The admission of such
evidence, inadmissible prior to the enactment of s. 142, would not effect
a balancing of the interests of the complainant and the accused.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court
of Appeal, [1981] 6 W.W.R. 632, 31 A.R. 518, 63 C.C.C. (2d) 193, setting aside
a conviction of respondent of attempted rape and ordering a new trial. Appeal
dismissed, Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson JJ. dissenting.

Ian Kirkpatrick, for the appellant.

William R. Pieschel, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson
and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is a Crown appeal from a
majority judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal, delivered by McGillivray
C.J.A., Harradence J.A. concurring, setting aside a conviction of the accused
of attempted rape and ordering a new trial. Prowse J.A., dissenting, would have
dismissed the accused’s appeal.

The main issue before this Court and, indeed
before the Alberta Court of Appeal, was the admissibility of evidence of
post-offence sexual misconduct of the complainant with persons other than the
accused and the trial judge’s treatment of this evidence. At the trial, there
was an in camera hearing in the absence of the jury under Criminal
Code , s. 142(1)  to enable counsel for the accused

[Page 390]

to put questions to the complainant as to her
conduct with persons other than the accused. A proper basis for putting these
questions was established as required by s. 142(1) (a). The
complainant admitted at the in camera hearing post-offence sexual
misconduct with persons other than the accused, including intercourse with five
men on a single occasion, about three months after the offence charged against
the accused and after the preliminary inquiry. Questions were also asked about
pre-offence misconduct with persons other than the accused, and although this
evidence related to incidents which occurred as long as two years before, this
evidence was admitted at the trial proper but the evidence respecting
post-offence misconduct was not allowed to be adduced.

It was conceded by the Crown that an enquiry
could be made into post-offence misconduct pursuant to s. 142(1)  as
relevant to the complainant’s credibility, provided the misconduct was not too
remote. In the present case, remoteness itself was not a bar. What then was the
trial judge’s reason for denying resort to this post-offence evidence? Criminal
Code  s. 142(1) (b) gives the trial judge a discretion if, after the in
camera hearing “[he] is satisfied that the weight of the evidence is such
that to exclude it would prevent the making of a just determination of an issue
of fact in the proceedings, including the credibility of the complainant”.
Correspondingly, if he is not so satisfied, he may exclude the evidence.

In my opinion, the record in this case indicates
that the trial judge excluded the proferred evidence because he held it to be
irrelevant. During the course of argument on the issues raised under
s. 142(1) , when accused’s counsel was urging that the post-offence
misconduct should be admitted at trial, the trial judge asked: “How would that
go to her credibility if she admits that?”; and then, further, “She says I did
it. She says she did it”. To

[Page 391]

which counsel replied, “Well, it goes to
character and general reputation”. The trial judge ended the matter by saying
“That is irrelevant after the event”. It may be that he was replying to
counsel’s answers and did not rule out all post-offence misconduct, but this is
far from clear.

There is no doubt that there is evidence in the
record before the trial judge which appears to diminish any ruling on the
exclusion of post-offence misconduct. For example, he said, in the course of an
argument of admissibility:

Section 142 speaks of sexual conduct
without saying prior or subsequent or anything so it seems to give the judge
sitting at a hearing, such as we are in now, the right, or maybe the duty to
hear the whole story, he then has to decide which is relevant to the issues in
fact in the trial.

And, again:

Very good. I am of the view that at this
in-camera hearing I can hear evidence about her work as a stripper in 1980 and
I will allow defence counsel to continue. This is to enable me to make a just
determination as to what should be allowed at the trial.

And further:

It may be that you’re right, that
nonetheless, a jury weighing the issue of credibility should be able to know
about her entire sexual history and can argue backward from subsequent events
to say, well, she’s more likely being such and such, I don’t know.

On the other hand, there are contrary
observations which cast considerable doubt on his recognition of the relevancy
of post-offence misconduct. The following are illustrative. When counsel for
the accused said he was calling evidence to show that since the charged
misconduct the complainant had on at least two occasions had sexual intercourse
with men, not only one man on one occasion

[Page 392]

but on another occasion a number of men at once,
the trial judge said:

I’m having a little trouble following—just
seeing what the relevance of sexual intercourse after the event is.

And again:

… but she didn’t say I haven’t had sexual
relations since the incident, and it seems to me her sexual conduct since the
incident is nobody’s business.

Further, in the course of proceedings:

I really have difficulty following your
reasoning there, Mr. Pieschel. Let’s try it once more. What has her sexual
conduct after the event got to do with credibility? I mean, are you saying that
people that have a lot of sex are dishonest?

And again:

… what she did after the incident is surely
nobody’s business in her sex life. What has that got to do with it?

Subsequently, the trial judge made a ruling
before the jury was brought in. I reproduce the ruling which in its entirety is
as follows:

Thank you. I will give judgment now in this
matter. It is my duty to insure that the accused is given a fair trial. It is
equally my duty to afford to the complainant the protection provided by Section
142  of the Criminal Code , that is to say, she must be protected from
harrassment with respect to her sexual conduct with persons other than the
accused. I will only permit questions to be put that I am satisfied are
necessary in order to enable the jury to make a just determination of issues of
consent and the credibility of the complainant.

In considering this application, I have
asked myself this question, has the defence on a balance of probabilities
established that it is necessary that it be allowed to question the complainant
on matters mentioned in the amended notice in order to permit the making of a
just determination of the issues of credibility and consent.

In the particular circumstances of this
case including the important factor that evidence as to the sexual conduct of
the complainant was led in her direct examination, I am persuaded that the
application must be allowed in part. The defence will be allowed to question
the complainant concerning her sexual conduct with persons other than the
accused under all five headings

[Page 393]

set out in the amended notice as it was
clarified in discussion with counsel for the defence. However, those questions
can only cover the conduct of the complainant up to and including March 31st,
1979. That is to say, no questions will be permitted as to her sexual conduct
with persons other than the accused which occurred after March 31st, 1979.

I regard this as an affirmation of the previous
assertion that post-offence misconduct is irrelevant. That, of course, is error
and removes any consideration by him of the requirements of s. 142(1) . It
is said, however, that the trial judge, in his ruling had said that he asked
himself the question whether the defence on a balance of probabilities
established that it is necessary that it be allowed to question the matters
mentioned in the amended notice, that is, the notice under s. 142(1)(a)
of the accused’s intention to ask the complainant as to sexual conduct with
persons other than the accused. The following paragraph of the ruling makes it
clear to me that the trial judge was concerned here with the pre-offence
misconduct. When he came to the post-offence misconduct, he excluded it in
principle.

There is too tenuous a basis in what the trial
judge said to extend it to include the post‑offence misconduct into his
assessment of s. 142(1) . A conviction cannot properly be founded on what
is at best speculation as to what he intended. It was simple enough to speak
plainly if irrelevancy was not the excluding consideration.

For these reasons, as well as those of the
majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal, I would dismiss the appeal and affirm
the order for a new trial.

The reasons of Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson JJ.,
were delivered by

WILSON J. (dissenting)—The broad issue
raised by this appeal is the extent to which s. 142  of the Criminal
Code  changed the common law respect-

[Page 394]

ing the admissibility of evidence of sexual
conduct of the complainant in a rape case with persons other than the accused.
Section 142  replaced an earlier section requiring judges to warn juries of
the danger of convicting persons accused of rape in the absence of
corroboration of the complainant’s testimony.

The decision of this Court in Laliberté v.
The Queen (1877), 1 S.C.R. 117, provides a convenient entrée into the law
as it stood prior to the enactment of the section. It was held in that case
that while the complainant could be asked questions about her prior sexual
conduct, i.e. conduct prior to the offence being tried, she was not
obliged to answer them. It was for the judge to decide whether she must answer
them or not. In that case the Court engaged in an extensive review of English
authorities and English texts on the law of evidence and concluded:

1. that the accused could not be deprived of the
right to ask the question because the complainant might answer it in a way
favourable to him;

2. the complainant was not obliged to answer it
unless directed by the judge to do so inasmuch as

(a) it did not go directly to a fact in issue;

(b) it could open up a wide range of inquiry
into collateral matters;

(c) it went only to the complainant’s character
or credibility; and

(d) the character and credibility of the
complainant could be impeached only by general evidence and not by evidence of
particular facts not in issue in the case;

3. that if the complainant denied the sexual
conduct with other men, the accused was

[Page 395]

bound by her answer and could not cross-examine
or lead evidence to contradict her.

A more succinct statement of the common law is
found in Gross v. Brodrecht (1897), 24 O.A.R. 687, where Osler J.A.
says, at p. 689:

… evidence of specific acts of lewdness and
unchastity with men other than the prisoner is not [admissible]. She may be
asked as to them, but cannot be compelled to answer, and if she denies them
cannot be contradicted … such evidence is rejected because it is not relevant
to the issue, going merely to the credit of the prosecutrix, since the mere
fact of her having had connection with other men can be no defence to the
charge of rape…

The Law Reform Commission of Canada, having
concluded that the common law did not afford sufficient protection to
complainants and that because of this many rapes were not being reported and
prosecuted, recommended in 1971 that questioning of the complainant with
respect to her sexual conduct with other men be prohibited and the legislature
responded by enacting s. 142. Subsection (1) of s. 142  provides
as follows:

142. (1)
Where an accused is charged with an offence under section 144 or 145 or
subsection 146(1) or 149(1), no question shall be asked by or on behalf of
the accused as to the sexual conduct of the complainant with a person other
than the accused unless

(a) reasonable notice in
writing has been given to the prosecutor by or on behalf of the accused of his
intention to ask such question together with particulars of the evidence sought
to be adduced by such question and a copy of such notice has been filed with
the clerk of the court; and

(b) the judge, magistrate or
justice, after holding a hearing in camera in the absence of the jury,
if any, is satisfied that the weight of the evidence is such that to exclude it
would prevent the making of a just determination of an issue of fact in the
proceedings, including the credibility of the complainant.

This Court had its first opportunity to discuss
the effect of s. 142  in Forsythe v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 268.
In that case s. 142  was raised at the preliminary hearing stage and the
presiding judge declined to compel the complainant to give

[Page 396]

evidence in camera although the notice
requirements were apparently met. This Court held that she was compellable at
the in camera hearing. It reasoned that the judge had to hear her
evidence in order to assess its weight with a view to exercising his discretion
under the section. How could he satisfy himself as to whether or not the
exclusion of the evidence would “prevent the making of a just determination of
an issue of fact in the proceedings, including the credibility of the complainant”
if he had not first heard the evidence?

It seems to be implicit in the Court’s judgment
that the complainant must answer all questions put to her in order that the
determination under the section can be made. This is, of course, a
substantial departure from the common law. The Supreme Court held, however,
that it was mandated by the section which by its terms makes the
credibility of the complainant “an issue of fact in the proceedings”.
Accordingly, not only must the complainant answer the question at the in
camera hearing but her answers can be contradicted by evidence led by the
accused. The judge will then assess the weight of the evidence and decide
whether or not it should be admitted at trial. In effect s. 142 , instead
of minimizing the embarrassment to complainants, increased it. Chief Justice
Laskin, in commenting on its purpose in Forsythe, said at p. 276:

Section 142  may, therefore, be regarded as
balancing the interests of both the complainant and the accused through this
change in the law of evidence.

At the in camera hearing in the present
case the complainant was questioned about pre‑offence sexual conduct with
persons other than the accused and, although this evidence related to incidents
which occurred as long as two years earlier, the evidence was admitted at the
trial. The complainant was also questioned at the in camera hearing
about post-offence sexual conduct with persons other than the accused,
including intercourse with five men on a single occasion about three months
after the offence charged against the accused and after the preliminary
inquiry. The

[Page 397]

evidence respecting her post-offence conduct was
not allowed to be adduced at the trial.

The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal,
Prowse J.A. dissenting, found that the trial judge erred in not admitting the
evidence of her post-offence sexual conduct. They viewed the evidence of the
post-offence sexual conduct as relevant to the complainant’s credibility. The
Chief Justice, whose reasons I have had the benefit of reading, concludes that
the learned trial judge failed to consider the evidence of post-offence sexual
conduct when exercising his discretion under s. 142  because he thought it
was irrelevant per se. This was error. The Chief Justice points out
that, even if the evidence was relevant, the trial judge could still in his
discretion exclude it at trial unless in the words of the section “the
weight of the evidence is such that to exclude it would prevent the making of a
just determination of an issue of fact in the proceedings, including the
credibility of the complainant”. What the trial judge cannot do, the Chief
Justice finds, is exclude it from his consideration under s. 142  on the
erroneous ground that it is irrelevant per se. He shares the view of the
majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal that this is what the trial judge did
in this case.

With respect I disagree. The trial judge did not
on my reading of the transcript refuse to admit the evidence of the
post-offence sexual conduct simply because it occurred after the offence and
therefore was irrelevant per se. He excluded it because he found it was
not relevant on the facts of the case before him and I agree with him. Section
142  does not require the judge to consider irrelevant evidence in making his
determination under the section. Nor does it make all evidence of sexual
conduct with other men which might be sought to be adduced in order to impugn
the credibility of the complainant relevant. I think it is implicit in

[Page 398]

the section that what the judge is to weigh
in making his determination is the relevant evidence. If he finds that a
particular piece of evidence is relevant to a fact in issue including the
credibility of the complainant, then he must consider whether its weight is
such “that to exclude it would prevent the making of a just determination of an
issue of fact in the proceedings” including her credibility. If he so concludes
then he will let it in. If he doesn’t, he will keep it out. But the first
prerequisite either way is, in my view, that it be relevant evidence, that it
have some probative value in relation to a fact in issue in the case.

I believe it is clear from the transcript that
during the in camera hearing a very open dialogue was taking place
between the judge and counsel. The judge’s thinking seems to progress through
three stages. In the first stage he challenges the accused’s counsel to
persuade him of the relevance of the evidence of post-offence sexual conduct on
the part of the complainant. In the second stage he hears all the evidence with
a view to making his ruling and at the third stage, after all the evidence has
been heard, he advises counsel of the conclusion he has reached which is then
reflected in his official ruling.

At the first stage it is clear that the trial
judge was acknowledging frankly to counsel that he was having difficulty in
seeing the relevance of post-offence sexual conduct of the complainant. It is
at this point of time that he makes some of the observations quoted by the
learned Chief Justice in support of his conclusion that the trial judge erred
in the exercise of his discretion under s. 142 . There is no doubt that at
this stage the trial judge was in effect saying to counsel: Why is post-offence
sexual conduct relevant? Prima facie it doesn’t appear to me to be so.
How can sexual conduct the complainant engaged in after the offence tell us
anything about her credibility as a witness or whether she consented to have
intercourse with this particular accused in relation to this particular

[Page 399]

offence? At the end of this dialogue with
counsel the trial judge says at p. 347, lines 6-9:

Well, the purpose of the hearing under 142
are [sic] to see what limits are going to be placed on you.
That’s what we are trying to thrash out. Parliament says you can be limited.

The second phase of the trial judge’s thinking
is reflected in two passages in the transcript (pp. 352-55 and pp. 370-75)
which culminated in the trial judge’s ruling that he would hear in camera evidence
about the complainant’s work as a stripper over Crown counsel’s objection. I
note two things about these passages. The first is that in the earlier passage
in his dialogue with defence counsel, Mr. Pieschel, the judge presses
Mr. Pieschel for his arguments but also concedes that he is open to be
swayed. He notes for example at p. 353, lines 12-17 that there may be an
argument that moral character should be presumed to remain unchanged so that
pre- and post-offence conduct might be equally relevant. At the conclusion of
this exchange he also suggests that perhaps the jury should be allowed to argue
backward from subsequent events. He says at p. 355, lines 34-41:

Well, the question or the matter as to what
you’re going to be allowed to ask will have to be resolved at the end of this
hearing as part of my decision when the hearing is concluded.

…

I’m really just considering what you have
to say now.

The second and more telling point, it seems to
me, is that in his dialogue with Crown counsel in the second passage it is the
judge who points out that s. 142  speaks of sexual conduct without
differentiating between prior and subsequent. He says at p. 371, lines
3-8:

Section 142  speaks of sexual conduct
without saying prior or subsequent or anything so it seems to give the judge
sitting at a hearing, such as we are in now, the right, or maybe the duty to
hear the whole story, he then

[Page 400]

has to decide which is relevant to the
issues in fact in the trial.

He points out that the issue of post-offence
sexual conduct did not arise in the authorities put forward by Crown counsel.
This is a new issue under s. 142 . He concludes that he ought to hear the
post-offence conduct with relation to the complainant’s being a stripper. This
seems to me to make it very clear that at this stage he is certainly not ruling
out post-offence conduct as a matter of principle.

The third stage in the progression of the trial
judge’s thinking comes, I believe, during argument after he has heard all the
evidence. At pp. 406-07 of the transcript he has the following dialogue with
Mr. Pieschel, a passage which is set out in full in the Court of Appeal’s
judgment:

THE COURT: HOW would that go to her
credibility if she admits that?

MR. PIESCHEL: Well, sir, I’m saying—

THE COURT: She says I did it. She says she
did it.

MR. PIESCHEL: Well, it goes to character
and general reputation then.

THE COURT: That is irrelevant after the
event.

MR. PIESCHEL: Sir, with the greatest of
respect and I would submit it’s not irrelevant after the event, what can be
more relevant when this girl comes before the Court and tells us that she’s,
for all intents and purposes, a virgin before this offence? Then she tells us
that she never said anything to anyone that she had been raped, yet we have
witnesses to say that she had, in fact, told them that she was raped before.
She also tells us that she didn’t pet with anybody for a year, yet on two
occasions prior to this offence, she knows two men for a few hours and she’s in
bed with them. You know, she doesn’t have intercourse but—

THE COURT: Oh, that’s before the event and
that’s certainly relevant, but what she did after—the

[Page 401]

traumatic affect of the rape on her is
certainly not relevant. We are not going to lead this girl into a psychiatric
of psychological inquiry. [Emphasis added]

The Court of Appeal used this passage as
confirmation of the judge’s error but in my view it indicates the very
opposite. The Court has now heard all the evidence and is satisfied that with
respect to this accused the post-offence sexual conduct had no probative value
because it was occasioned by the trauma of the rape. The evidence, therefore,
had to be excluded. It would merely be a “psychiatric or psychological
inquiry”. In face of this assessment of the evidence by the trial judge, I find
it hard to believe that he rejected the evidence as a matter of principle when
he made his formal ruling. He started out, it is true, by querying the
relevance of post-offence sexual conduct. I see nothing wrong with this.
(Indeed, I think it would be a matter of concern to trial judges if they felt
they cannot disclose to counsel during the hearing the aspects of the case
which trouble them for fear that their concerns will be imported into their
reasons at the end of the day.) Then he heard the evidence. He obviously
believed the complainant and the other witnesses that the offence caused a
traumatic change in her personality and he excluded evidence of post-offence
conduct on that basis. I think that he did everything he was called upon to do
by s. 142 of the Code. I would respectfully adopt the view
expressed by Mr. Justice Prowse, dissenting, in the Court of Appeal to the
effect that:

… where the evidence is to the effect that
the complainant’s subsequent sexual conduct was related to the traumatic effect
of what had occurred and that her sexual pattern had changed materially
following the event, it was open to the trial judge to be satisfied that the
exclusion of such evidence would not prevent the making of a just determination
of an issue of fact, including the credibility of the complainant.

Coming back to the purpose of s. 142  as
explained in Forsythe, supra, it would not in my view effect a
“balancing” of the interests of the

[Page 402]

complainant and the accused to permit him to
lead a humiliating and devastating inquiry at trial into post-offence sexual
conduct of the complainant that would clearly have been inadmissible prior to
the enactment of the section. Accordingly, while post-offence sexual conduct is
not inadmissible per se, it should only in my view be admitted where its
relevance to a fact in issue has been established. The trial judge himself gave
an example of how this might be done, namely if it were shown that pre- and
post-offence sexual conduct formed a continuous pattern. He did not exclude the
post-offence conduct per se. He excluded it because it did not cross the
first hurdle of being relevant to a fact in issue in the case.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Possession of stolen
goods—Motor vehicles—Passenger charged—Meaning of the word “possession” in s.
3(4)(b) of the Code—Whether possession imported control as an essential
element—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended, ss. 3(4), 313.

Respondent, the passenger in a stolen car,
was charged with its possession contrary to s. 313  of the Criminal Code . At
trial, respondent’s testimony—(1) that he had accepted an invitation from one
of his friends to go for a ride in his “brother-in-law’s car” and (2) that he
did not know the car to be stolen property—was not contradicted by any direct
evidence. The judge disbelieved him, however, and proceeded on the assumption
that the respondent’s knowledge of the stolen character of the vehicle was a
proven fact and found him guilty. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction
holding that some evidence of control on the accused’s part was necessary to
establish possession under s. 3(4) (b). This appeal is to determine
whether the word “possession” used in s. 3(4)(b) of the Code imports
control as essential element.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

A measure of control on the part of the
person deemed to be in possession is a constituent and essential element of
possession under s. 3(4) (b) of the Criminal Code . The “knowledge
and consent” required cannot exist without some measure of control over the
subject-matter.

[Page 358]

quashing his conviction on a charge of
possession of stolen goods. Appeal dismissed.

S. Casey Hill, for the appellant.

Mark L. Kerbel, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court at the instance of the Attorney General of Ontario, pursuant to
s. 621(1) (b) of the Criminal Code , from a judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Ontario (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 183, 17 C.R. (3d) 390, whereby
that Court allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction of the accused entered
at trial before Judge P.H. Megginson in the Ontario Provincial Court (Criminal
Division) for the County of Frontenac, Ontario, on a charge that he:

…on or about the 30th day of January, 1980
at the Township of Kingston and elsewhere in the County of Frontenac,
unlawfully did have in his possession one 1980 Chevrolet automobile, of a value
exceeding $200.00, the property of Trudeau Motors, Belleville, Ontario which
had been theretofore obtained by a person unknown by an offence committed in
Canada punishable on indictment, to wit: theft, the said Kelly Brett Terrence,
then knowing the said automobile to have been so obtained and did thereby
commit an indictable offence, contrary to section 313 (a) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

The important question raised by this appeal
relates to the true meaning to be attached to the word “possession” as the same
occurs in the context of s. 3(4) (b) of the Criminal Code  and more
particularly whether “possession” as there employed imports control as an
essential element. Section 3(4) (b) reads as follows:

(4) For the purposes of this Act,

…

(b) where one of two or more
persons, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his
custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession
of each and all of them.

The only evidence in the record of this appeal
which is in any way descriptive of the manner in which the respondent first
became aware of the

[Page 359]

existence of the automobile in question is the
evidence of the respondent himself which is, in my view, accurately summarized
in the judgment of Mr. Justice MacKinnon at p. 64 of the case on appeal
herein as follows:

The 17-year old appellant testified at his
trial. His evidence was that Bill Rorback, Rorback’s brother and one Rick Hayes
lived across the street from him in Belleville. He often went across to visit after dinner and he had done so on
the evening of January 29th, 1980. When he arrived Rick Hayes was not present
and the appellant and the two Rorbacks watched television. At about midnight
Hayes drove up to the front of the house in a new Camaro automobile and asked
if anybody wanted to go for a ride in his ‘brother-in-law’s new car.’ The appellant
said ‘sure’ and went with Hayes.

According to the appellant’s evidence,
Hayes and the appellant drove around town for three quarters of an hour or so
and then started east along the 401 towards Kingston. It was established that the Camaro had in fact been recently
stolen and the licence plates it carried had recently been stolen from another
Camaro in Belleville. The
appellant knew that Hayes did not own his own motor vehicle but Hayes had, on
previous occasions, borrowed his brother-in-law’s car which the appellant
described as ‘an old junker.’ He thought that it was probably time for Hayes’
brother-in-law to acquire a new car and as Hayes had the keys to the car, he
had no suspicion at the time that the car was stolen.

Hayes turned onto Highway 2 around Napanee
and shortly thereafter an O.P.P. cruiser gave chase. Constable Mallock
testified that the stolen vehicle, on being pursued, increased its speed to 150
kilometres per hour, although the appellant’s evidence was that the vehicle did
not speed up but rather continued at a constant pace. The car was finally
stopped by an O.P.P. road-block some time shortly after 2:30 a.m. The Camaro pulled over to the shoulder
and was apparently slowing down to a stop when the appellant jumped from the
moving vehicle, rolled onto the shoulder and ran into the adjoining field. The
Camaro collided with a cruiser and then came to a stop,…

As I have indicated, this was the account given
by the respondent and it remains uncontradicted by any direct evidence; it
accordingly appears to me that the only basis for doubting the accuracy of this
account was the repeated assertion by the trial judge that he “utterly”
disbelieved it.

[Page 360]

There is no doubt about the fact that the
vehicle had been stolen from a garage in Belleville and indeed there was evidence to the effect that the theft occurred
on the very night when the respondent accepted the invitation from Hayes to go
for a ride “in his brother-in-law’s car”. It was this latter circumstance which
permitted the trial judge to say:

…this car was as hot as a car could be,
having been taken by someone during the same night.

There was, as I have said, no direct evidence to
contradict the respondent’s version of what occurred, but it is evident from
his somewhat acid comments that the judge’s finding of “possession” is in great
measure based on his disbelief of the respondent and it is apparent that the
judge proceeded on the assumption that the respondent’s knowledge of the stolen
character of the vehicle was a proven fact.

Based on the assumption that the respondent knew
the car to be stolen property, the trial judge went on to find that:

Even if the accused was not the operator of
the vehicle and in that sense had the control of it, if the person who had
control of the vehicle had it with his knowledge and consent and he is in the
vehicle as well, in my view, that is sufficient to found the necessary
conditions to constitute constructive possession under section 3 ,
subsection 4 (b) of the Criminal Code  as defined.

In allowing the appeal and quashing the
conviction entered at trial, the Court of Appeal for Ontario declined to follow
the reasoning of the trial judge and it is their disagreement as to “the
constituent and essential elements of ‘possession’ ” under s. 3(4) (b)
that has given rise to this appeal as can be seen from the grounds upon
which application was made to this Court for leave to appeal:

(1) That the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario erred in law in holding
that a constituent and essential element of possession under
section 3(4) (b) of the Criminal Code  is a measure of control on the part
of the person deemed to be in possession by that provision of the Criminal
Code .

[Page 361]

(2) That the Court of Appeal for the
Province of Ontario erred in law in holding that a passenger in a stolen
automobile which he knows to be stolen is not pursuant to section 3(4) (b)
of the Criminal Code  in possession of that vehicle where the Crown proves:

(a) possession of an object by another
person;

(b) the accused’s knowledge of this other
person’s possession of the object; and

(c) the accused’s consent to the other
person’s possession of the object.

It will be seen that the second ground of appeal
is predicated on it having been proved that the “passenger” knew the automobile
to have been stolen and in this connection I think it well to reiterate the
fact that there is absolutely no direct evidence to support such an assumption
which is denied by the respondent who also states that he first knew of the
theft when the O.P.P. chase began on the highway and the stolen car was finally
being brought to a halt, although the respondent had jumped to the highway
while it was still moving.

The ratio decidendi of the trial judge’s
decision is to be found in the following excerpt:

I utterly disbelieved the explanation for
recent possession of stolen goods, having found the accused in possession in
the other case. I utterly disbelieve the explanation tendered and on the
authority of the Proudlock case that leaves me in the position where there
simply is no evidence before me to explain the possession. That leaves you with
the doctrine of recent possession which says that from the fact of the
accused’s possession of recently stolen goods the Court may infer at the lower
level that he was in possession with the knowledge of their stolen origin; at
the higher level where the recency of possession in the circumstances warrant
that he was the thief or one of the thieves. In this case on all of the
evidence and utterly having disbelieved the defence evidence adduced, I am left
with the operation of the fact of possession of recently stolen goods and the
inferences fairly to be drawn therefrom and I infer beyond any reasonable doubt
in my mind that Mr. Terrence was a knowing participant in the events of
that night relating to the vehicle and its licence plates from the beginning.
There will be a finding of guilt.

[Page 362]

The Proudlock case, which is reported in
[1979] 1 S.C.R. 525, is authority for the proposition that evidence which is
disbelieved by the trier of fact is not “evidence to the contrary” within the
meaning of subs. 2(a) of s. 306  of the Criminal Code  and
it has little bearing on the central question raised by this appeal namely,
whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent was
in fact in “possession” of the car within the meaning of s. 3(4) (b).

In the course of his reasons for judgment
rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice MacKinnon reviewed
the relevant cases concerning the ingredients of possession under s. 3 (4) (b)
of the Criminal Code  and concluded that in order to establish
“possession” under that section it was necessary that there should be
evidence of control on the part of the accused. In the course of these reasons
he said:

In my view, on the proven facts the
necessary measure of control was not established beyond a reasonable doubt by
the Crown, nor do those facts allow for the invocation of s. 21. If, by way of
example only, it were established that the appellant had directed Hayes to
drive to Kingston, that, in
light of all the other proven facts, would in my view satisfy the requirement
of some measure of control over the car. If, by way of further example, he had
been seen handing the stolen licence plates to Hayes for them to be placed on
the motor vehicle that, once again in my view, would be sufficient to warrant
the application of s. 21 and to establish constructive possession of the car by
the appellant.

Section 21  of the Criminal Code  defines
the meaning of “parties” to an offence and involves the question of common
intention. It will be remembered that in the present case there is no
suggestion that the respondent participated in any way in the actual theft of
the car by an unknown person which took place some time before he was invited
to drive in it and there is nothing to support a finding of common intention in
relation to the offence of “possession” with which the respondent is here
charged.

The Court of Appeal had reference to the case of
R. v. Lou Hay Hung (1946), 85 C.C.C. 308, which was a decision of
its own court concerned with a charge under the Opium and Narcotic Drug

[Page 363]

Act, 1929 (Can.),
c. 49 and in which Mr. Justice Roach in the course of his reasons for
judgment, referred to and quoted s. 5(2)  of the Criminal Code , the
predecessor of s. 3(4) (b), in the following terms at p. 321:

Under s. 5(2), both ‘knowledge’ and
‘consent’ are necessary. I have already stated that, in my opinion, there is no
doubt that the appellant knew that the accused Watson had opium in the
premises. I have been more than a little concerned with the question whether or
not, on the evidence, it should be held that he also consented.

In the same set of reasons, Mr. Justice
Roach referred to the judgment of O’Halloran J.A. in R. v. Colvin and
Gladue, [1943] 1 D.L.R. 20, where he said at p. 25:

“Knowledge and consent” which is an
integral element of joint possession in s. 5(2) must be related to and read
with the definition of “possession” in the previous s. 5(1)(b). It
follows that “knowledge and consent” cannot exist without the co-existence of
some measure of control over the subject-matter. If there is the power to
consent there is equally the power to refuse and vice versa. They each signify
the existence of some power or authority which is here called control, without
which the need for their exercise could not arise or be invoked.

In the course of the reasons for judgment
rendered by Mr. Justice MacKinnon on behalf of the Court of Appeal in the
present case, he had occasion to say of the above passage from Mr. Justice
O’Halloran’s judgment:

The judgment of O’Halloran, J.A. in Colvin
and Gladue, the relevant passage of which for our purposes being the
one quoted by Roach J.A. (supra) to the effect that ‘knowledge and
consent cannot exist without the co-existence of some measure of control over
the subject-matter’, has been followed by British Columbia Courts in subsequent
decisions: Rex v. Sherman 62 B.C.R. 241, 1 C.R. 153, 1946 1 W.W.R. 479; Regina
v. Bunyon (1954), 110 C.C.C. 119; Regina v. Dick and
Malley (1969), 7 C.R.N.S. 75, 68 W.W.R. 437; R. v. Baker—May
21, 1976, (B.C.C.A.) (unreported as yet).

The courts in Quebec have adopted the same reasoning as will be seen by reference to R.
v. Sigouin, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 235, and R. v. Fournier
(1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 468.

[Page 364]

As I have indicated, I agree with the Court of
Appeal that a constituent and essential element of possession under s. 3(4) (b)
of the Criminal Code  is a measure of control on the part of the
person deemed to be in possession by that provision of the Criminal Code  and
accordingly I do not consider that the Court of Appeal for the Province of
Ontario erred in this regard.

As to the second ground of appeal, it appears to
me to be implicit in the manner in which it is stated that the respondent knew
the automobile to be stolen and as I do not find any evidence to justify this
conclusion, I do not think that the question arises in the present case.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Crown immunity—Broadcast of an
obscene film—Criminal charges—CBC acting unlawfully—Whether CBC subject to
prosecution—Broadcasting Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.B‑11, ss. 3, 38, 39,
40—Radio (T.V.) Broadcasting Regulations, SOR/64-50, ss. 3, 5(1)(a),
(c)—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 2, 159(1)(a).

Appellant, a Crown corporation established
under the Broadcasting Act , was charged with the unlawful broadcast of
an obscene film. A provincial court judge, on a preliminary point of law, ruled
that the appellant could not be charged under the Code and that he had
no jurisdiction to hear such charges. The Ontario Supreme Court reversed the
judgment and the Court of Appeal upheld its decision. This appeal is to
determine whether the appellant is subject, by reason of its broadcast, to
prosecution under the Criminal Code .

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

There is no reason in law why a law
enforcement agency should not bring before a criminal court a corporation,
however established, or any other person, where the conduct of that person,
natural or legal, offends the Criminal Code  and is not expressly
authorized by Act of Parliament. Here, the broadcast was contrary to s. 159(a)
of the Code and prohibited by a regulation promulgated under the Broadcasting
Act . Further, the CBC was subject—like all the other, broadcasters—to
generally applicable statutes and regulations including the Criminal Code . The
CBC, in exercising its powers in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the
Broadcasting Act , did not act as an agent for the Crown; therefore the
attribution of Crown immunity to the appellant was not in issue in this case.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

ESTEY J.—The appellant is a corporation
established under the Broadcasting Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-11 and is
charged under s. 159 (1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34 that it “unlawfully did publish an obscene moving picture, to wit, “J’irai
comme un cheval fou”…” in the City of Ottawa through the Corporation’s television
station, C.B.O.F.T. The provincial court judge, on a preliminary point of law,
stated a case to the High Court of Ontario after determining that the appellant
could not be charged under the Criminal Code  and that he had no
jurisdiction to hear such charges. Donohue J. found that the learned provincial
court judge had erred and remitted the matter to him for trial on the charges
laid under the Criminal Code  of Canada. The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the decision
of Donohue J.

[Page 341]

The Broadcasting Act , supra, regulates
broadcasting generally throughout Canada and the appellant is expressly made
subject to its provisions at least as regards the discharge of its mandate
under the Broadcasting Act  to provide “the national broadcasting service
contemplated by section 3 ” of the Act. By section 3(c)
Parliament declared:

(c) all persons licensed to
carry on broadcasting undertakings have a responsibility for programs they
broadcast but the right to freedom of expression and the right of persons to
receive programs, subject only to generally applicable statutes and
regulations, is unquestioned;

(Emphasis added.)

While the appellant may enjoy a status as a
public corporation, to which I will refer in more detail, it is, as regards the
discharge of its parliamentary mandate as a broadcaster, in precisely the same
position as other broadcasters who form part of the “Canadian broadcasting
system” (s. 3 (b), Broadcasting Act , supra).

In the course of its broadcasting operations the
appellant broadcast a film which for the purposes of these proceedings is
admitted to have been obscene. It is also acknowledged that such conduct is
subject to specific regulation under the regulations promulgated under the Broadcasting
Act , specifically the Radio (T.V.) Broadcasting Regulations, SOR/64-50,
s. 5(1) (a) and (c) which is set out later in these
reasons. The issue in these proceedings, however, is whether the appellant is
subject, by reason of this broadcast, to prosecution under the Criminal
Code .

Part III of the Broadcasting Act  makes
provision for the establishment of the appellant, the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. Section 39(1) of Part III provides in part:

39. (1) The
Corporation [the appellant] is established for the purpose of providing the
national broadcasting service contemplated by section 3 , in accordance
with the conditions of any licence or licences issued to it by the Commission
and subject to any applicable regulations of the Commission, and for that
purpose the Corporation has power to

…

[Page 342]

(c) originate programs, and
secure programs from within or outside Canada by purchase, exchange or otherwise, and make arrangements necessary
for their transmission;

The relationship of the appellant and the Crown
is described in s. 40(1):

40. (1)
Except as provided in subsection 38(3), the Corporation is, for all
purposes of this Act, an agent of Her Majesty, and its powers under this Act
may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

Subsection (3) below relates to the
property of the appellant:

(3) Property acquired by the Corporation is
the property of Her Majesty and title thereto may be vested in the name of Her
Majesty or in the name of the Corporation.

At the same time note must be taken of the
definition of “person” and “every one” under s. 2  of the Criminal Code  (s.
159 of the Code under which these charges were laid reads: “Every one
commits an offence who…”):

“every one”, “person”, “owner”, and similar
expressions include Her Majesty and public bodies, bodies corporate, societies,
companies and inhabitants of counties, parishes, municipalities or other
districts in relation to the acts and things that they are capable of doing and
owning respectively.

The appellant made the submission in this Court
that, “for all purposes”, it acts as the agent of Her Majesty in the
performance of its duties under the Broadcasting Act , and by reason of
the judgment of this Court in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Attorney-General
for Ontario, [1959] S.C.R. 188 was immune from prosecution under the Criminal
Code . I will return to that case shortly.

A similar argument was made in this Court by
counsel for the Crown corporation in Conseil des Ports Nationaux v. Langelier,
[1969] S.C.R. 60. The issue in those proceedings, concerning as they did the
National Harbours Board established under the National Harbours Board Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 187, was framed by Martland J., at p. 70:

[Page 343]

What is in issue here is the responsibility
of a person, whether individual or corporate, who, though a Crown agent, and
purporting to act as such, commits an act which is unlawful.

The parent statute in that instance provided in
part:

3. (1)…

(2) The Board is a body corporate and
politic and shall be and be deemed to be, for all purposes of this Act, the
agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada.

(3) The Board has the capacity to contract
and to sue and be sued in the name of the Board.

(National Harbours Board Act, supra.)

At page 64 Martland J. states:

It was also argued that the National
Harbours Board, as such, was incapable of acting in any way, save as an agent
of the Crown, and that if, in fact, its powers were exceeded, any such act
could not be that of the Board, but would be only the act of the individuals
involved.

There is no doubt that in the existing state of
the law employees of the Crown are responsible for their own acts done in their
official character but in excess of their lawful authority. There is also no
doubt that their superiors also in the service of the Crown, while not
vicariously liable for the unlawful activities of their fellow employees, are
personally responsible where such unlawful activities are at the behest of the
superior official. In Conseil des Ports Nationaux, supra, this Court
found that responsibility in law is not affected by the interposition of a
Crown corporation established by statute. The Court concluded (at p. 72):

Is the position any different because the
agent in this case is not an individual, but a corporation? I think not, and I
agree with the reasoning of Atkin L.J. in the MacKenzie‑Kennedy case
[[1927] 2 K.B. 517 (Eng. C.A.)].

As Choquette J. has pointed out, in the
reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, s. 3(2) of the National
Harbours Board Act declares that the Board “shall be and be deemed to be, for
all the purposes of this Act, the agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada”. (The italicizing is my own.) It is
only when the Board is

[Page 344]

lawfully executing the powers entrusted to
it by the Act that it is deemed to be a Crown agent.

I am not prepared to accept the proposition
enunciated in Wheeler v. Public Works Commissioners, [1903] 2
I.R. 202, that a corporation constituted for the sole purpose of doing acts for
the Crown is not capable of doing a wrongful act in its corporate capacity,
unless that statement is to be limited in its meaning to say that such a
wrongful act is not authorized by its corporate powers. Otherwise the statement
subscribes to the theory that a corporation cannot be made liable in tort
because its corporate powers do not authorize it to commit a wrong. In my
opinion, if a corporation, in the purported carrying out of its corporate
purposes, commits a wrongful act, it is liable therefor and it cannot escape
liability by alleging that it is not responsible for anything done outside its
corporate powers. This is true whether it is purporting to act as a Crown
agent, or not.

Those proceedings were, of course, concerned
with tortious liability by reason of works undertaken by the Crown corporation
in the discharge of its parliamentary mandate to establish and operate harbours
and related facilities. The analogy is helpful here nonetheless.

The same problem was dealt with by Duff J., as
he then was, in Quebec Liquor Commission v. Moore, [1924] S.C.R.
540, where his Lordship stated (at p. 552):

It is now recognized also that there is
nothing to prevent the Crown being served by a corporation, and nothing to
prevent such a corporation claiming the same immunity as an individual.

Conversely, of course, the liability of the
Crown corporation is the same as that of an individual acting as a servant of
the Crown.

It was said in argument that s. 40, supra, of
the Broadcasting Act  finds its roots in the desire by Parliament to
establish a national broadcasting service free from influences of the political
world, including perhaps both the executive and legislative branches of the
government, to the extent that such influences might impinge upon the proper
functioning of such a national broadcasting service on a non-political basis.
This may indeed have

[Page 345]

been the explanation for the establishment of a
Crown corporation acting as an agent of the Crown particularly in the light of
the comments of the House of Lords in MacKenzie-Kennedy v. Air
Council, [1927] 2 K.B. 517, where Atkin L.J., at p. 532 stated: “If,
however, the Air Council were incorporated different considerations might
apply”. His Lordship was there dealing with the representative responsibility
of members of the unincorporated Air Council, a circumstance with which we are
not here concerned.

I turn then to the question as to the position
in law of the appellant as a result of the obscene broadcast which forms the
basis of the criminal charges here. After establishing the Corporation, its
governing body and its principal officers, the Act provides in s. 38, subss.
(1) and (3):

38. (1) The
Corporation, on the recommendation of the President and with the approval of
the Governor in Council, shall appoint an Executive Vice-President of the
Corporation who shall be responsible to the President for the management of
broadcasting operations in accordance with policies prescribed by the
Corporation and for such other duties as the President may assign to him from
time to time.

…

(3) The Executive Vice-President and the
officers and employees employed by the Corporation pursuant to
subsection (2) shall, subject to section 44, be employed on such
terms and conditions and at such rates or remuneration as the Corporation deems
fit and the Executive Vice-President and such officers and employees are not
officers or servants of Her Majesty.

The broadcasting operations of which the
challenged broadcast formed a part are those under the direct responsibility of
the Executive Vice-President who is not a servant of Her Majesty but only an
employee of the appellant. There is no question raised in these proceedings but
that this broadcast formed a part of the regular broadcasting schedules of the
appellant, broadcast to the Canadian public in the course of its performance of
its duties under the Broadcasting Act .

I turn back then to the decision of this Court
in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Attorney-

[Page 346]

General for Ontario, supra. In those proceedings the
appellant was charged with carrying on “its ordinary calling by operating a
broadcasting station contrary to the Lord’s Day Act”, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.
Taschereau J. summed up the issue at p. 190:

The only question which has to be resolved
now is: Does s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act apply to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation which is by statute an agent of Her Majesty?

Section 4 of the Lord’s Day Act, supra, provided
as follows:

4. It is not
lawful for any person on the Lord’s Day, except as provided herein, or in any
provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force, to sell or offer for sale or
purchase any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate,
or to carry on or transact any business of his ordinary calling, or in
connection with such calling, or for gain to do, or employ any other person to
do, on that day, any work, business, or labour.

By s. 2(d) of that Act the word
‘person’ “has the meaning that it has in the Criminal Code ”. The Criminal
Code  at the time of those proceedings had the same definition for ‘person’
as quoted above. The comparable provision in the Canadian Broadcasting Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 32, to s. 40(1), supra, then read:

4. (1)…

(2) The Corporation is for all purposes of
this Act an agent of Her Majesty and its powers under this Act may be exercised
only as an agent of Her Majesty.

In the result, this Court, reversing the Ontario
Court of Appeal, found that the appellant was immune from prosecution under the
Lord’s Day Act. In all such proceedings a court must of course begin
with the proposition that at common law the Crown is not bound by any statute
unless expressly or by necessary implication the Crown is brought within the
statute. Rand J. put it: “At common law admittedly the Sovereign could not be
impleaded in his courts…” (p. 196). Section 16 of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158 provided:

[Page 347]

16. No
provision or enactment in any Act affects, in any manner whatsoever, the rights
of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated therein
that Her Majesty is bound thereby.

which provision is in a similar form today. Rand
J. concluded that the Lord’s Day Act did not extend to the Crown,
observing at p. 198:

To say that it intends and has effect to
include the Crown as an ordinary subject of the prohibitory or the penal
provisions of the Code is repugnant to the principle of immunity in both
aspects. If such a fundamental change had been intended it would not have been
effected by a clause of general definition. There is ample matter for
legitimate application to Her Majesty, the obvious one being that of a “person”
who is the victim of criminality, not its perpetrator: in such and other
instances it is used in the description of a factual situation.

and concluded at p. 199:

The situation of the Crown, then, is this:
by the Canadian Broadcasting Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 32, ss. 4 and 8, the
appellant, as agent of Her Majesty “shall carry on a national broadcasting
service within Canada.” No
limit or restriction of time is prescribed for furnishing that service; and in
the absence of an express and contrary enactment by Parliament, that time is
unlimited. The effect of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act is to render
the Crown under the Broadcasting Act  as unrestricted as if the Lord’s
Day Act had not been passed. If the Sovereign is free to broadcast on
Sunday, those who do the acts necessary to that service are immune from
prosecution because the act they do is the lawful act of the Sovereign,
attributable to him and untainted with criminal character.

Locke J., influenced by the importance of
broadcasting to the general public including on Sundays, placed the Act in a
pre-eminent position requiring a narrower interpretation of the Lord’s Day
Act to accommodate the two statutes and the continuance of national
broadcasting service on Sunday. His Lordship construed the definition in s.
2(15)  of the Criminal Code  (at p. 205):

Rather, should it be construed as meaning
that “person” includes the Sovereign as one of those against whose

[Page 348]

person and property various criminal
offences may be committed by others. In The King v. Bishop of
Salisbury, [1901] 1 Q.B. 573 at 577, Wills J. said that, where an
affirmative statute is open to two constructions, that construction ought to be
preferred which is consonant with the common law.

His Lordship in enunciating this proposition cited
River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson (1877), 2 App. Cas. 743. The
House of Lords in that case was faced with the broad wording in the statute
which imposed liability on:

every vessel… for any damage done to… a
pier; and… the person having the charge of such vessel… through whose wilful
act or negligence any such damage is done shall also be liable___

Only one Law Lord in dissent applied what might
be said to be the ordinary meaning of the words used by Parliament and found
liability without restriction. The balance of the majority of the Court,
through a variety of approaches, found that the Act must be deemed to include
an exception in circumstances where it was not possible to keep the vessel
under control. If there be such a rule of statutory interpretation now
available to the courts, it would be difficult to see how it had any
application in connection with the broadcasting activities of the appellant in
the circumstances raised in this appeal.

Taschereau J., as he then was, for himself and
two other judges in dissent, made a fundamental distinction between proceedings
under the Criminal Code  and those brought under the Lord’s Day Act. The
minority declined to interpret the Lord’s Day Act as excluding the Crown
by reason only of the definition of ‘person’ incorporated by reference from the
Criminal Code . His Lordship observed (at p. 195):

I am quite satisfied that it never entered
the mind of Parliament that C.B.C. could not be reached by the statute, while
all the other private stations, not agents of the Crown, and which are now on
an equal footing with the appellant, would be amenable to the law.

In those proceedings the Court was concerned
with the opposing objectives of the Canadian

[Page 349]

Broadcasting Act  and
the Lord’s Day Act. The former authorized, without limitation as to time
or region, the establishment and operation of a national broadcasting service.
The latter statute concerned itself with limitations imposed on the conduct of
business on Sundays. The majority of the Court, for different reasons, found
that the Lord’s Day Act could not be interpreted as placing limitations
on the mandated broadcasting service under the Canadian Broadcasting Act, and
particularly where this result would have followed because of the incorporation
by reference of the definition of the word ‘person’. It must be borne in mind
when examining the several judgments of this Court in the 1959 decision that
the Canadian Broadcasting Act expressly and beyond any debate authorized
the broadcasting there challenged. Here the Broadcasting Act  not only
did not authorize the broadcasting of this film but, by a regulation
promulgated under the Act, such broadcasting was prohibited. Thus we do not
have a situation where there is a statute-authorized event on the one hand and a
consequential offence under another statute (the Criminal Code ) on
the other hand. Section 159  of the Criminal Code  expressly
prohibits the broadcasting of obscene matter, as do the Radio (T.V.)
Broadcasting Regulations, s. 5 of which provides:

5. (1) No station or network operator shall
broadcast 

(a) anything
contrary to law;

…

(c) any obscene, indecent or
profane language or pictorial presentation;

In disposing of this appeal it is not necessary
to delve into the origins and present reach of the doctrine of Crown immunity.
Nor is it necessary to revisit the question of the meaning of s. 2  of the Criminal
Code  which was the subject of discussion in the 1959 CBC case, supra. Nothing
herein stated, therefore, should be read as a commentary upon the majority
concurring and dissenting opinions in this Court in that case. This may one day
be necessary but, in my view, this appeal does not call for a review of the
role and status of the Crown in criminal law in circumstances where its

[Page 350]

agent was acting (as it was not here) within its
constituting Act of Parliament.

We are not, therefore, called upon in these
proceedings to review or comment upon the effect of the definition of “person”
in s. 2  with reference to the Crown. What has to be determined is the character
of the actions allegedly taken by the appellant-Corporation in the course of
the discharge of its parliamentary mandate. It is the characterization of those
actions in law which now concerns the Court. If the Corporation is at the
critical time the beneficiary of the doctrine of Crown immunity, the burden on
this appeal would be quite different. On the other hand, if at the critical
time the appellant-Corporation was not acting as an agent of the Crown, then
the definitions of “person” and “every one” as presently in s. 2  of the Criminal
Code  are of no relevance because it cannot be said that a court lacks the
jurisdiction to try a charge where such immunity has been withdrawn.

The question before the Court therefore is
whether or not the Corporation, in acting as it did, has exposed itself to
prosecution under s. 159 . No defence has been raised on the basis that the
Corporation would not, were it a private broadcaster, be liable to prosecution
under the Code, nor is any defence raised on the basis that the action
taken by the employees of the Corporation are not actions for which the
Corporation would otherwise be criminally responsible. We are solely concerned
with whether the broadcasting of an admittedly obscene program by the appellant
in its status under s. 40(1) of the Act is amenable to prosecution under the Criminal
Code . As Professor Maitland said in The Constitutional History of
England (1919), at p. 484:

We can hardly lay too much stress on the
principle that though the king cannot be prosecuted or sued, his ministers can
be both prosecuted and sued, even for what they do by the king’s express
command… Law, especially modern statute law, has endowed them with many great
powers, but the question whether they have overstepped those powers can be
brought before a court of law, and the plea ‘this is an official act, an act of
state’ will not serve them.

[Page 351]

The appellant is certainly in no better position
than a minister of the Crown. It is difficult to believe that after the great
constitutional struggles through which we and our forebears have gone to bring
to an end the concept of the absolute monarchy we are still faced with the
defence of absolute immunity by the monarch’s administration. Borrowing the
words of Martland J. in Conseil des Ports Nationaux, supra: “It is only
when the [Corporation] is lawfully executing the powers entrusted to it by the
Act that it is deemed to be the Crown agent” (p. 72). When so acting and
thereby enjoying the status of Crown agent the immunities of the Crown flow
through to the agent for its benefit. Where, however, the Corporation is not
acting “for all purposes of this Act” or with reference to “its powers under
this Act” the status and the benefits of Crown agency disappear.

The attribution of Crown immunity to the
appellant may be an issue in circumstances not here before the Court and hence
need not, for the disposition of this appeal, be determined. However, even if
Crown immunity may be attributed to the appellant in some circumstances, and the
actions of the appellant in such circumstances attributed to the Crown, it does
not necessarily follow that the immunities attendant upon the status of Crown
agency will flow through to the benefit and protection of the appellant in all
circumstances. Here we have the Attorney General of the Province of Ontario prosecuting charges
under the federal Criminal Code  against a corporation established by the
Parliament of Canada. The former brings the charges in the course of its duty
to enforce the criminal law in the province and the latter is called upon to
answer those charges by reason of its corporate existence and responsibilities
under the Broadcasting Act . There is no authorization given by
Parliament in its parent statute for the conduct of the appellant. The law
reveals no reason why Her Majesty as the fountainhead of justice should not
invoke the powers of the criminal courts to enforce a statute which expressly
makes Her Majesty’s agents subject to its terms. But even that is not the case
before us. There certainly can be no

[Page 352]

reason in law why the law enforcement agencies
should not bring before the criminal court a corporation, however established,
or any other person, where the conduct of that person, natural or legal,
offends the Criminal Code  and is not expressly authorized by Act of
Parliament. We are not here concerned with whether the same principle would
apply to conduct expressly authorized by another legislature acting within its
plenary competence.

This same line of reasoning has been applied by
our courts in the past. In R. v. Stradiotto (1973), 11 C.C.C.
(2d) 257, Evans J.A., as he then was, speaking for the Court of Appeal of
Ontario, found a soldier guilty of breach of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O.
1970, c. 202, and said this with reference to the defence of Crown immunity (at
p. 261):

In my view, a distinction must be drawn
between a breach of the Highway Traffic Act which is required to be
committed by a soldier in order to carry out a military order and a breach of
the statute which a soldier commits during the course of carrying out his
duties which duties, however, can be properly discharged without committing a
breach of the statute. Applied in that way, the “rights of Her Majesty” are not
“affected” by applying the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act to a
member of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces.

It was argued by counsel for the appellant that
to differentiate between acts of the appellant within “the purposes of the Act”
and other actions taken by the appellant in effect creates two corporations; or
would provide in effect no basis in law at all for such “extra-statutory”
activities. It is clear from s. 39  and s. 3  of the Broadcasting Act  that
the appellant was established by Parliament to provide a national broadcasting
service, including the origination and distribution by broadcast of programs,
and to do so as part of the “Canadian broadcasting system” and consistent with
the terms of the licences granted to the appellant in connection with this
undertaking. It is equally clear that the Broadcasting Act  is a statute
of general application to an industry throughout

[Page 353]

Canada and for the
regulation in every particular of that industry and all its components and
affiliated organizations. Regulation 5, supra, recognizes indeed that
there may be activities by the appellant and other broadcasters which are
beyond their licence and beyond the statutory authorization. In this respect
the appellant was in the same position—no better, no worse—than broadcasters
who are not established as Crown corporations under the Broadcasting Act . Section 3
of the above-mentioned Regulations states:

3. These Regulations apply to all stations
and networks in Canada and to
all matter broadcast by such stations and networks.

It is inconceivable that Parliament, by adopting
the Broadcasting Act  and by authorizing the Regulations thereunder
including those cited above, would have intended to establish a regime whereby
one class of broadcasters is made subject to the general laws of the land
including the criminal laws, whereas the other class of broadcasters is not.
Such a result is rendered the more indefensible by the concluding paragraph in
s. 3 (c) of the Broadcasting Act  whereby all persons licenced to
carry on broadcasting in Canada
are “subject… to generally applicable statutes and regulations”. This surely
must include the Criminal Code  of Canada unless there is some other express exclusionary provision in the Code
or in the Broadcasting Act  or other enactment of Parliament. We have
been referred to no such exclusion. Brooke J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court
of Appeal in these proceedings, stated:

In my view, when the Corporation exercises
its powers with a view to carrying out the purposes of the Broadcasting Act ,
it acts as agent of Her Majesty and only as agent of Her Majesty. But, when
it exercises its powers in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the Act,
it steps outside its agency role. That role subsists only so long as the
Corporation’s broadcasts are implementing the policy laid down in the Act. This
seems to me to be the effect of s. 40(1) .

((1981) 30 O.R. (2d) 239, at p. 244)

[Page 354]

With respect I am in agreement. If such is not
the law, then it must follow that the appellant is immune from any charge under
the Criminal Code  and thereby could not be called to account even for
the commission of the most serious offences against the criminal law. Such a
drastic result is said to flow from s. 40(1) , supra, and the expression
therein employed: “…and its powers under this Act may be exercised only as an
agent of Her Majesty”. In my view, Parliament would express itself much more
clearly in the implementation of such an intention.

Other matters are raised by the appellants
including a reference to those provisions in the Broadcasting Act  which
provide that any property acquired by the Corporation shall be the property of
Her Majesty. The Act does, however, provide that title thereto may be vested in
the name of Her Majesty or in the name of the Corporation. Property may be
acquired by the Corporation but subject to approval by Governor-in-Council
where the consideration involved exceeds $250,000. By other provisions in the
statute the appellant shall maintain in its own name bank accounts into which
all moneys received by the appellant “through the conduct of its operations or
otherwise” shall be deposited. Some of these provisions indicate a status not
unlike that of a government department and others are more consistent with the
establishment and operation of an independent legal entity. In any event, I see
no relationship between those financial or property matters and the
determination of the question as to the status in criminal law of the
appellant.

It is said, however, that because all property
including money vests in the Crown, a court of criminal jurisdiction may not
impose upon or recover from the appellant a fine. This problem was adverted to
in the MacKenzie-Kennedy case, supra, but no consequence in
substantive law flowed. It was said: “It may be true that the Corporation in
such a case will have no private assets available to meet execution, but that
may also be true of the individual” (p. 533). Brooke J.A., in the Court of
Appeal below, stated on this point (at p. 246):

[Page 355]

I was concerned that the Corporation has no
money or assets to pay or satisfy a fine having regard to sections 165 ,
722 , and 735  of the Criminal Code , but the Corporation may still be
convicted and incur the liability to be sentenced. The important thing is that
the Corporation does not escape the same public condemnation as that which
would be incurred by any other broadcaster for criminal conduct. Perhaps this
is achieved to a great extent by public trial and attendant notoriety and
without necessity for a large fine.

A court duly established under the appropriate
laws and given jurisdiction which includes the trial of charges laid under the Criminal
Code  of Canada, must assume
that an entity brought into being by an Act of Parliament will, when made the
subject of a judgment, respond to that judgment and the directions therein
including the payment of any fine imposed. It is not part of the court’s
function to speculate upon what would transpire in court or elsewhere should a
creature of Parliament otherwise behave.

I therefore would dismiss this appeal and it
follows that the matter will be remitted to the trial court for the trial of
the appellants on the charges which have been laid. Mention should be made of
the status of the other two appellants. The record reveals no such entity as
C.B.O.F.T., and counsel in this Court acknowledged that it was simply the
designation in the licence issued to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
under the Broadcasting Act  of the frequency and call-letters of the
transmitter employed by the Corporation in broadcasting the programs of its
French-language network in the Ottawa region. Consequently, no order need be made with reference to the
words “Television Station C.B.O.F.T.” in the style of cause. The appellant,
René Boissay, is an employee of the Corporation, and issues may arise with
reference to that appellant at trial. Therefore nothing has been said
concerning his status in these proceedings. Therefore, as regards the appellant
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the appeal would be dismissed with costs and
no award as to costs is made with reference to the appellant, Boissay.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE NOVA SCOTIA SUPREME
COURT, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Weapon—Use of firearm while
committing an indictable offence—Meaning of “firearm”—Whether inoperable air
pistol constitutes a “firearm”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (as amended
by 1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, s. 3), ss. 82(1), 83(1),(2).

The respondents were convicted of armed
robbery (s. 302  Cr.C .) and of using a firearm while committing an
indictable offence (s. 83  Cr.C ). The weapon used was an air pistol from
which fourteen parts were missing or damaged, seven of which were essential to
its operation. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction for the offence under
s. 83(1)  finding that, although the air pistol constituted a weapon for
the purposes of the robbery count, it was not a firearm within the meaning of
s. 83 . Hence these appeals to determine whether the Court of Appeal erred
in so finding.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

The purpose of s. 83  is to protect the
victim of an offence from serious injury or death by discouraging through
mandatory consecutive imprisonment the use of a firearm that is capable of
being fired by the person committing the offence. Therefore, whatever is used
on the scene of the crime must be proven by the Crown as capable, either at the
outset or through adaptation or assembly, of being loaded, fired and thereby of
having the potential of causing serious bodily harm during the commission of
the offence or during the flight after the commission of that offence. Here,
the weapon used by the respondents was not a firearm within the meaning of

[Page 726]

s. 83 . The air pistol was inoperable and
could not be repaired or adapted to be capable of firing and of causing serious
injury during the commission of the offence or during the flight thereafter.

Robert E. Lutes, for the appellant.

David A. Grant, for the respondent
Douglas Roy Covin.

Wayne Joseph Covin, in person.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—These reasons relate to two appeals by
the Crown from an acquittal by the Court of Appeal of Nova
 Scotia. The appeals were dismissed on June 8, 1983, sedia sedente, at which time
the Court informed the parties that reasons would follow.

The two respondents, the Covin brothers,
committed a hold-up in a credit union using a CO2 pistol. They were
charged and convicted of robbery, but also under s. 83  of the Criminal
Code , for use of a firearm during the commission of an offence, punishable
in the case of a first offence by a minimum sentence of imprisonment of not
less than one year to be served consecutively to any other punishment imposed
for an offence arising out of the same event. The Court of Appeal quashed their
conviction for this latter offence, finding that although the CO2
pistol did constitute a weapon or imitation thereof for the purposes of the
robbery count, a jury could not on the evidence have reasonably concluded that
it was a firearm

[Page 727]

within the definition in s. 82(1), as used
in s. 83(1).

The sole issue before this Court is whether the
Court of Appeal erred in so finding. The factual setting of the issue is found
in the testimony of a forensic firearm examiner for the R.C.M.P. who testified
at trial that the weapon was an air pistol, in damaged and incomplete
condition; there were fourteen parts of the gun missing or damaged, and seven
of those missing parts were essential to its operation. The witness said
further that an experienced person could replace the missing parts in ten to
fifteen minutes.

There are two relevant sections in this
appeal:

83. (1)
Every one who uses a firearm

(a) while committing or
attempting to commit an indictable offence, or

(b) during his flight after
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,

whether or not he causes or means to cause
bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment

(c) in the case of a first
offence under this subsection, except as provided in paragraph (d), for
not more than fourteen years and not less than one year; and

(d)…

(2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).

82. (1) For
the purpose of this Part,

…

“firearm” means any barrelled weapon from
which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged and that is capable
of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and includes any frame
or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can be adapted for use
as a firearm;

[Page 728]

When reading the definition of firearm it first
appears that what is being principally considered is a barrelled weapon that is
actually “capable of causing serious bodily injury or death”, because it can be
loaded and fired. This to me includes unloaded guns, for reasons I will give
shortly.

It is apparent that the section extends the
definition of “firearm” to include anything that has the potential of becoming
a firearm through adaptation. The section goes on to extend that category
to include “frames and receivers”, and by reason thereof, the section when
read literally, (at least in its English version) includes these frames and
receivers irrespective of their adaptability. This would mean that even
firearms inoperative because beyond repair would still be firearms inasmuch as
there was a frame or receiver. One might then wonder, if such is the case, why
inoperative firearms needed any qualification in the section inasmuch as
the frame or the receiver was present. In the French version of the definition
it is apparent that frames and receivers are mentioned as considered
illustrative of those things adaptable for use as a firearm. I have for the
benefit of those whose understanding of French is limited, translated more or
less literally the French version of the definition:

“arme à feu” désigne toute arme, y compris
une carcasse ou chambre d’une telle arme ainsi que toute chose pouvant être
adapté pour être utilisé comme tel, susceptible, grâce à un canon qui permet de
tirer du plomb, des balles ou tout autre projectile, d’infliger des lésions
corporelles graves ou la mort à une personne;

[Page 729]

“firearm” means any weapon, including the
frame or chamber of such a weapon and anything that can be adapted to be used
as such, that is capable, because of a barrel from which shot, bullets or any
other missile can be discharged, of causing serious bodily injury or death to a
person.

The French version is not without its own
difficulties, but, as I said, I believe the central idea is more easily
perceived and frames and receivers must eventually meet the test of
adaptability to becoming dangerous weapons.

Another difficulty is that of remoteness. Indeed
most pieces of metal, pipe or wood can, given time, tools and expertise, be
said to be adaptable for use as a firearm, that is, becoming capable of being
loaded and fired in such a way as to cause bodily injury.

In my view the acceptable amount of adaptation
and the time required therefore for something to still remain within the
definition is dependent upon the nature of the offence where the definition is
involved. The purpose of each section should be identified and the amount,
nature and the time span for adaptation determined so as to support
Parliament’s endeavour when enacting that given section.

The offence we are considering in this case is
the use of a firearm during the commission of another offence. The purpose of
s. 83  is to protect the victim of the commission of an offence from
serious injury or death by discouraging, through mandatory consecutive
imprisonment, the use, by him who commits the offence, of a firearm that is
capable of being fired. It has been said that s. 83  is not only aimed at
preventing physical injury but also to prevent the cause of alarm. (See R.
v. Belair (1982), 24 C.R. (3d) 133). With respect, I do not agree.
Had that been the section’s purpose, Parliament would have included imitations
of firearms, as it did in s. 85 or again in s. 302 of the Code.

Therefore whatever is used on the scene of the
crime must in my view be proven by the Crown as

[Page 730]

capable, either at the outset or through
adaptation or assembly, of being loaded, fired and thereby of having the
potential of causing serious bodily harm during the commission of the
offence, or during the flight after the commission of that main offence,
the hold-up.

An operable but unloaded pistol or revolver or
air pistol is a firearm, because it is capable during the commission of the
offence when loaded and fired of causing bodily injury. (See R. v.
Brouillard (1980), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 80 per Montgomery J.A.). If
inoperable, then, as regards s. 83 , it is a firearm if, given the nature
of the repairs or modifications required and the availability of the parts on
the scene, whatever was used could, during the commission of the offence, have
been adapted by an ordinary person or by the accused if possessing special
skills so as to be capable of firing and of causing serious injury.

The burden is upon the Crown to prove this.
Because the section does not require that the accused be in possession of
ammunition at the time of the offence, a weapon falling within the definition
in s. 82(1) is, for the purposes of s. 83(1), a weapon whether or not
the accused has the necessary ammunition to fire it. Parliament has relaxed
that burden as regards proof of the presence of ammunition at the time of the
offence. Indeed, except in cases where the gun was actually fired, the Crown
would practically never have been able to meet proof of that fact. But to this
extent only has Parliament relaxed the burden of proof. I am not unmindful of
the burden of proof placed on the Crown. But one must not lose sight of the
fact that Parliament is penalizing additionally the use of a firearm, even in
cases where its use was, qua an offensive weapon, an essential component
of the main offence. The fact that the Crown has to meet this burden is
understandable when considering that there is a mandatory jail sentence of at
least one year added to the sentence imposed for the main offence.

[Page 731]

In the present appeals, there is no evidence
that there were at the time and place of the offence or during the flight
thereafter, to use the words of Hart J.A. in R. v. Haines (1981), 45
N.S.R. (2d) 428 at p. 436, “…the necessary ingredients for an operable
firearm together with the ability to place it in operable form”.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Theft—Monies deposited in trust
with respect to real property transactions—Colour of right defence—Charge to
jury—Misdirection—New trial ordered—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss.
283, 294 (rep & sub. 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s. 25).

Appellant, a licensed real estate broker, was
convicted of theft of $26,759.58, being sums deposited “in trust” with respect
to real property transactions. The appellant relied, for 18 of the 21
transactions involved in the count on which he was found guilty, on the defence
of colour of right alleging he thought he could lawfully transfer the amounts
from the “in trust” account to the agency’s general account once the offer to
purchase the property had been accepted. As to the other transactions involving
a total of $13,500 he relied on an alleged lack of knowledge of the transfers.
The Court of Appeal dismissed appellant’s appeal. This appeal is to determine
whether the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the meaning of the phrase
“colour of right”.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

In his charge, the trial judge misdirected
the jury. The fate of the appellant’s defence of colour of right was not
dependent upon the jury determining when the commissions were payable. Rather,
the defence was dependent upon whether the jurors were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant had not, at the time of the transfers, an
honest belief that he had the right to that money, and not, as they were told,
dependent upon what they thought his rights were. Further, the conviction
cannot stand for it was impossible to know whether the conviction stood solely
on those transactions that did not raise the defence of colour of right.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a
charge of theft. Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

Peter Foley, for the appellant.

Audrey S. Brent, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—William Robert Lilly, a licensed real
estate broker, was convicted by a Saskatoon jury of theft of $26,759.58, monies
that had been deposited in trust with Lilly Agencies Ltd. with respect to various
real estate transactions. He appealed his conviction without success to the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and was thereafter granted leave at large to
appeal to this Court.

As I am of the view that he should succeed on
one of the grounds argued by him in this Court, I need not refer to those other
grounds and will limit reference to facts and procedures to those relevant to
that ground of appeal and its determination.

Charged with two counts of theft he was
acquitted of one and found guilty of the following:

That he, the said William Robert Lilly,
between the 1st day of October, A.D. 1977, and the 2nd day of March, A.D. 1978,
at the City of Saskatoon, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did steal
approximately Twenty Six Thousand, Seven Hundred and Fifty Nine Dollars and
Fifty Eight Cents ($26,759.58), more or less, being sums deposited in trust
with Lilly Agencies Ltd. with respect to real property transactions involving
the sale or lease of various real property, contrary to Section 294 (a) of the
Criminal Code .

This amount of $26,759.58 is the amount of money
the Deputy Superintendent of Insurance for Saskatchewan felt, following an audit of the agency’s books, had been
misappropriated by the accused. This conclusion was based on the view that the
deposit on a real estate transaction must remain in trust until the transaction
is completed. This view is not in dispute before this Court.

[Page 796]

The aggregate amount of deposits given the
accused’s agency by clients in some twenty-one transactions was $28,851.10. As
there remained at the time of the audit in the trust account an amount of
$2,091.52, the indictment was for the difference.

Appellant does not pretend that he was entitled
in law to the amounts transferred from the “in trust” to the agency’s general
account. He says that he either was not aware of some of the transfers, or, in
the case of others, says that, whilst aware of them he thought he was in law
entitled to so transfer the amounts as he was of the belief at the time that he
could lawfully do so once the offers to purchase the property had been
accepted.

Of the twenty-one transactions involved in the
count for which he was found guilty, there are three, for an aggregate amount
of $13,500, where, in the course of his being cross-examined by the Crown, he
does not plead “colour of right” but only ignorance of the fact that the
amounts had been transferred.

The ground upon which appellant should succeed
in this Court is stated as follows:

The learned trial judge erred in law in
misdirecting the jury as to the meaning of the phrase ‘colour of right’.

The trial judge, in his charge to the jury on
that aspect of the law relevant to this case, first said:

The phrase ‘colour of right’ simply means a
bona fide belief or an honest belief. And a bona fide belief or an honest
belief may arise from a genuine mistake or in some cases even from ignorance.
Therefore the phrase in the definition of theft, ‘without colour of right’,
simply means the lack of a bona fide or honest belief. It is up to you to determine
from the evidence whether the accused, in regard to Count No. 1 acted
dishonestly and without colour of right when monies were taken, as is alleged,
from the trust account of the company to the general account. You will note
that the definition reads ‘fraudulently and without colour of right’ takes, not
‘fraudulently or [without] colour of right’ takes. If you find that the accused
did take the monies and the actions of the accused were fraudulent and without
colour of right, and that he took the said monies from the trust account with
intent to deprive the owner, you

[Page 797]

must—you, in that case, would find the
accused guilty of Count No. 1.

He then dealt very fairly and accurately with
appellant’s defence of lack of awareness of any shortage in the “in trust”
account, and then referred again to the accused’s defence of colour of right as
follows:

The accused appears to me to take a second
position and that is if you find that the accused was aware of lump sums
withdrawals from the trust account not related to commissions earned, that is
knew the trust account to be overdrawn, the accused says that such withdrawals
were not fraudulent and that there was a colour of right to make those
transfers. You will have Exhibit P-21 before you and the shortages alleged by
Mr. Childs together with the files… The accused’s position appears to
me to be that the company was entitled to apply these deposits on commissions
when the vendor accepted the Offer to Purchase. As I recall, in all cases
listed by Mr. Childs, except the Suburban Golf Course, the deposit was
less than the company’s total commission, providing of course that the sale did
go through. And certainly the evidence was that the vast majority of these
sales did go through.

The real question insofar as this
defence is concerned is when was the commission, or a portion thereof, payable
to the company. There is evidence before you which
suggests that a sale is completed on the date of possession. There is evidence,
I believe, that if there be no conditions set out in the Offer, commission is
payable on the date the vendor accepts the purchaser’s offer. There is some
evidence to suggest that commission is not payable until the lawyer handling
the sale advises the agent that all matters in connection with the sale have
been completed.

(Emphasis added.)

He told the jury that the time of payment was
primarily a question of fact to be determined by them and then referred again
to the accused’s defence:

As I understand the accused’s position, he
says the company had a colour of right to transfer money to trust which
represented commissions, or a portion thereof, when the Offer to Purchase was
accepted by the pur-

[Page 798]

chaser. In other words the accused had a
bona fide or honest belief when the Offer was accepted that he could, as
President and Manager, remove monies representing a portion of the company’s
commission to the company’s general account, as the money represented earnings
of the company. The Crown, however, as I understand their position, take the position
that a sale must be completed prior to any commission being earned. If, for
example, you have an Offer with no conditions attached, such as subject to
arranging finances, the commission would be, I believe, payable, according to
the Crown’s proposition, on the date of possession. Or, for example, if a
lawyer representing the vendor advised the agent that the sale was completed,
then the commission becomes payable.

There is in Mr. Childs’ list of
shortages in the trust account sales involving D & K Construction and Symak
Construction. It appears to me, and this is only my recollection, you look at
the files and determine for yourself, but it appears to me that when the Offer
in these cases was accepted by the vendor the residence was either then under construction
or construction had not commenced. Possession in some of these cases was
available, as I recollect, and you will examine the facts, six or eight months
after the Offer was accepted by the vendor. The question is does the agent
have to wait six or eight months for his commission or is it payable on
acceptance of the Offer. That is a question for you to resolve. If you find
commission to be payable on completion of the transaction, for example,
possession being given, it appears to me that no monies representing the
commission should be transferred until the agent has been so advised. However, it
is up to you to determine if the company, through the accused, had the right to
transfer the commission from the trust account to office at the time such
transfer was made.

(Emphasis added.)

With respect, this is clearly, in my view,
misdirection in law. The fate of the accused’s defence of colour of right was
not dependent upon the jury determining when the commissions were payable. That
question was indeed important as relevant to whether the monies were his or
those of his clients. The fact that they still be the property of the client
was a prerequisite to his having to raise a defence to the taking or
conversion. Rather, the accused’s

[Page 799]

defence was dependent upon whether they, the
jury, were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he, the accused, had not,
at the time of the transfers, an honest belief that he had the right to that
money, and not, as they were told, dependent upon what they, the jurors,
thought his rights were.

Respondent Crown, whilst supporting the judge’s
charge on colour of right, argues that, if this Court were of a different view,
the conviction should still stand, as this defence did not arise for $13,500 of
the $26,759.58, as the appellant had admitted that for the three transactions
comprising that amount he relied only on his lack of knowledge of the transfers
from the “in trust” account to the general account. This argument is at first
sight appealing and in fact was the basis for the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal’s decision, but cannot resist closer consideration. Indeed this
reasoning seems to me to be overlooking three facts. First, the Crown chose not
to identify the transactions into separate counts. That is the right of the
Crown and was understandable given the fact the transfers were for sums that
did not correspond to identified deposits. However, after cross-examining the
accused, it had become apparent through his answers that there were, as of
then, two groups of transactions to be considered, one raising and the other
not the defence of colour of right. It would have been preferable to sever the
count at that stage. Indeed, had the trial been before a judge sitting without
a jury, the matter would have been dealt with by him in the reasons for
judgment, or again the verdict might well have been one of guilt for the lesser
amount of $13,500, the implication being clearly that the defence of colour of
right had succeeded when applicable and that of “lack of knowledge” failed when
standing alone. But we are here dealing with a jury, which is the second fact I
refer to.

[Page 800]

Juries do not give reasons. Furthermore, they
were not told they could find the accused guilty for a lesser amount if
satisfied that for some of the transactions the defence of colour of right had
been successful. Rather, and this brings us to the third fact I wish to allude
to, they were told by the trial judge, in the course of his charge to them,
that “you are not required to find the exact amount stolen but you are required
to find that in this case the amount stolen exceeds $200.00 under each charge”
(by “each charge” he was referring to each of the two counts in the
indictment). This, I hasten to say, is not misdirection. However, when there
is, as in this case, a defence of colour of right applicable only to some of
the transactions, this direction in conjunction to a misdirection as to that
defence has the following effect: not knowing whether the jury’s verdict of
guilty was for one, or more, or all of the transactions, the verdict could well
be resting on one of those transactions where the defence of colour of right
was available and concerning which I have found clear misdirection.

I would therefore allow this appeal, quash the
conviction and order a new trial. At first, I had thought of severing the count
before returning the file to the Court below. After some reflection upon the
matter, I think it preferable to leave the matter to the trial judge in the
light of what the Crown might choose to do or the defence request be done to
the charge.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Commencement of
sentence—Warrants of committal—Consecutive rather than concurrent sentences of
imprisonment—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 649(3), (4).

On December 17, 1979, in the Court of
Sessions of the Peace, District of Montreal, appellant was ordered to pay a
fine of $200 within 120 days or to serve a three month term of imprisonment.
The 120 days expired on April 15, 1980, and a warrant of committal was only issued against him on July 4,
1980. This warrant was not executed until August 13, 1980. However, between June 10
and August 10, 1980, appellant had served terms of imprisonment pursuant to
other warrants of committal. Appellant maintained that it was illegal to hold
him under the warrant executed on August 13, because the effect of executing
warrants of committal in succession was to make sentences, which would
otherwise have been concurrent, consecutive. Relying on s. 649(4)  of the Criminal
Code , the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal dismissed his application
for a writ of habeas corpus.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Sentence—Imposition of
consecutive sentences—Meaning of “before the same court at the same
sittings”—Power to sentence consecutively—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
ss. 645(4)(a), 645(4)(c), 649(1).

Interpretation—Construction of penal
statute—Cumulative punishments—Legislative history—Exceptional
construction—Avoidance of absurd results—No meaning given to the words “at the
same sittings”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 645(4)(a), 645(4)(c).

Appellant pleaded guilty on three different
occasions before the same judge to a total of nine criminal charges. That
judge, at sentencing for all charges, ordered the sentences in each of the
three files to be served consecutively. Appellant’s appeal to the Court of
Appeal was dismissed. Hence, the appeal to this Court on the ground that the
trial judge had no power under the Criminal Code  to impose the
consecutive sentences as the appellant had been convicted at different
sittings.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

A judge may order that a sentence be served
consecutively to another sentence he has previously imposed or is at the same
time imposing (s. 645(4) (c) Cr.C.). He cannot, however,
order that a sentence be made consecutive to one imposed by another judge in
another case unless that other judge had already sentenced the accused at the
time of the conviction in the case under consideration (s. 645(4) (a) Cr.C .).
The words “at the same sittings” in s. 645(4) (c) were given no
meaning since they refer to a time span of judicial activity that practically
no longer exists for most courts or cause absurd differences in the sentencing
powers of the judges on the basis of distinctions that resist any kind of
possible rationalization.

[Page 622]

The general power to sentence consecutively
was codified by Parliament in 1892. Such power must now be found in existing
federal legislation (s. 649(1)  Cr.C .).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec affirming the consecutive sentences imposed by Longtin J. of the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace.

Ivan Lerner, for the appellant.

René Domingue, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—This appeal raises questions as to the
powers conferred by Parliament on a judge, when passing sentence of
imprisonment, to direct that the sentence be served consecutively to another.
The sections of the Code relevant to this appeal are the following:

649. (1) A
sentence commences when it is imposed, except where a relevant enactment
otherwise provides.

…

[Page 623]

645. …

(4) Where an accused

(a) is convicted while
under sentence for an offence, and a term of imprisonment, whether in
default of payment of a fine or otherwise, is imposed;

(b) is convicted of an
offence punishable with both fine and imprisonment, and both are imposed with a
direction that, in default of payment of the fine, the accused shall be
imprisoned for a term certain; or

(c) is convicted of more offences
than one before the same court at the same sittings, and

…

(ii) terms of imprisonment for the
respective offences are imposed,

…

the court that convicts the accused may
direct that the terms of imprisonment shall be served one after the other.

(My
emphasis.)

The position taken by respondent requires a
determination of whether there exists a general power to order that a sentence
be served consecutively, notwithstanding s. 649(1) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, or whether that power must be found in existing
federal legislation; that taken by appellant requires us to determine what is
meant by the words “before the same court at the same sittings” used by
Parliament in s. 645(4) (c) of the Criminal Code .

THE FACTS

The appellant pleaded guilty before a judge of
the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, sitting in the judicial district of
Montreal, on three different days to nine charges under the Criminal Code  and,
then on June 21, 1978, he was sentenced to a series of concurrent and
consecutive sentences of imprisonment which, when computed, amounted to an
incarceration of six years. For an easier understanding of these facts, I have
identified as A, B, C and D the court appearances and numbered the offences.

Appellant appeared three times before the same
judge to plead guilty to offences and finally, on a fourth occasion, was
sentenced by that judge for all offences.

The sentences of Group B were to be served
concurrently the total amounting to two years.

The sentences of Group C were to be served
concurrently also for a total of two years.

The aggregate two-year imprisonment of Group B
was to be served consecutively to the two years of Group A, and the aggregate
two years of Group C was made consecutive to the serving of A and B, for a sum
total of six years.

POSITION TAKEN BY APPELLANT

The appellant says that, in view of
s. 645(4) (a) and (c), the court could not make the
respective aggregate times of Groups B and C consecutive to Group A because he
was not under sentence for Group A when he pleaded guilty to B or C, and that,
though before the same court for all groups, he was convicted for each group at
different “sittings”. The appellant acknowledges that the judge could have
ordered consecutive sentences for offences within each group but says that he
could not under the circumstances do so from one group to another.

In support of his contention, appellant relies
on two cases: Yeltatzie v. R. (1979), 12 C.R. (3d) 8 and
Ex Parte Risby (1975), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 211.

Yeltatzie had been convicted by a court on May
12, 1978 of a certain number of offences and then, on May 26, 1978, by the same
court for escaping legal custody. The court then sentenced him to imprisonment
for all the offences and ordered that

[Page 625]

the imprisonment for the escape, the “May 26”
conviction, be served consecutively to the serving of the imprisonment he
imposed for the “May 12” convictions. The British Columbia Court of Appeal held
that that could not be done for “It is plain here” said Bull J.A., orally for
the Court, “that the other convictions were not at the same sitting of the
court, because they were made earlier, although it was the same court.
Consequently, it follows that para. (c) is not applicable to this
particular situation, because the sentence for the escape was based on a
conviction which was not made at the same sitting as the other court”.

It was common ground that, though the latter
sentence was for an escape, s. 137  of the Criminal Code , which
deals specifically with consecutive sentences for an escape did not, on the
facts of that case, apply.

In Ex Parte Risby, McKenzie J., of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia, commenting on the powers of a judge under
s. 645(4)(c)(ii) of the Code, was of the view that he “only
has power to impose a consecutive sentence if there is unity of time and place
in the making of the convictions and the sentencing”. The case was one where a
probation order pursuant to a conviction was breached by the subsequent
commission of other offences and the judge who had made the order revoked it
and imposed a sentence of imprisonment to be served consecutively to that
imposed for the offences giving rise to the revocation. It should be noted
that, in such a case, special provisions come into play and comments as to the
interpretation of s. 645(4)  of the Criminal Code  should be read in
the light of that fact. Indeed, the powers of a judge in that situation, though
still determined by s. 645(4) , are limited by virtue of s. 664(4) (d)
to imposing “any sentence that could have been imposed if the passing of
sentence had not been suspended”. So any reliance on cases where
s. 664(4) (d) applies must be put with that in mind.

[Page 626]

This is the extent of appellant’s argument.

POSITION TAKEN BY RESPONDENT

Respondent argues essentially that a judge has a
general power to impose consecutive sentences and that this power need not be
found in the provisions of s. 645(4)  or any other provisions. In
respondent’s view, s. 645(4) , as would also be, I suppose, s. 137  or
any other federal legislative enactment dealing with consecutive sentencing,
are but specific illustrations of that power and in no way restrictive of it. In
support of that position, the Crown relied mainly on two decisions of the Court
of Appeal for Nova Scotia, on three others of the Court of Appeal for Quebec,
and on one decision by a Superior Court judge of Quebec (R. v. Reddick (1974),
9 N.S.R. (2d) 425; R. v. Muise (No. 3) (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 440; Paquette
v. La Reine, C.A. Mtl., No. 10-00003-80, March 12, 1981; R. v. Corbeil, C.A.
Mtl., No. 10‑000163‑72, October 17, 1972; R. v. Snell, C.A.
Mtl., No. 10-000100-73, August 2, 1973; R. v. Pearson (1979), 11
C.R. (3d) 313).

In R. v. Reddick, Macdonald J.A., in his
dissenting reasons, had said, speaking of s. 645(4)  (at p. 428):
“that this section is the only authority for the imposition of consecutive
sentences and it provides the circumstances under which the Court ‘may direct
that the terms of imprisonment shall be served one after the other’.” As the
consecutive sentences imposed on the same day were for convictions before the
same judge but on different dates he found that contrary to s. 645(4) (c)
as they were not convictions “at the same sittings”.

Chief Justice MacKeigan, orally, for the
majority said (at p. 426):

In respectful disagreement with my brother,
Mr. Justice Macdonald, I question whether s. 645(4)  of the Criminal
Code  restricts consecutive sentences exclusively to the situations listed
in that section. I also doubt if that section in any event restricts an
appeal court in varying sentences under s. 614  ‘with [sic] the
limits prescribed by law’.

[Page 627]

This might suggest that the majority of the
Court was of the view that there might exist a general power. This assumption
is confirmed by what that court said a few months later in R. v. Muise
(No. 3) where MacKeigan C.J.N.S., speaking for the Court (Macdonald J.A.,
concurring in the result, as he felt he was bound by the majority decision in Reddick)
said (at pp. 443-44):

…the law, in conferring the power and
imposing the duty on a Judge of sentencing a convicted person to a term of
imprisonment, should not be construed as forcing the Judge in any case to make
a term of imprisonment on a second offence concurrent with the term imposed by
him or some other Judge for another offence. A so-called concurrent sentence
does not sentence the convicted person to a term of any imprisonment at all since
it does not require him to serve a single day of imprisonment; a person cannot
serve in jail the same day twice any more than he can be successfully hanged
twice. A Judge in imposing a concurrent sentence is therefore not carrying out
his duty unless he can find in the Code or the general criminal law
authority so to do.

I am encouraged to find support for my
general view in the general powers of the Courts in 1867, in the light of which
s. 645(4)  must be considered. In Nova Scotia on the eve of Confederation a
Judge in the position of Mr. Justice MacIntosh in the present case would
have had undoubted power (and I suggest, also, duty) to impose a consecutive
sentence by virtue of s. 47 of the Administration of Criminal Justice
Act, R.S.N.S., Third Series, c. 171, as follows:

47. Wherever sentence shall be passed for
felony on a person already imprisoned under sentence for another crime, it
shall be lawful for the court to award imprisonment for the subsequent offence,
to commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which such person shall
have been previously sentenced; and where such person shall be already under
sentence of imprisonment, the court may award such sentence for the subsequent
offence, to commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which such person
shall have been previously sentenced, although the aggregate term of
imprisonment may exceed the term for which punishments could be otherwise

[Page 628]

awarded.

This section, enacted many years earlier,
and having a counterpart in at least the Province of Upper Canada, was almost
word for word s. 10 of the English Criminal Law Act, 1827 (U.K.),
c. 28.

The general power thus conferred (and it
may be argued that the 1827 statute merely codified the English law) has not
been removed or restricted by the federal Parliament. On the contrary, a
confirmatory provision to the same effect was enacted by the federal Parliament
in 1869 by s. 92 of 32-33 Vic., c. 29, and was continued without change in
the various Criminal Codes from 1892 until the revision and
consolidation of the Criminal Code  made by 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, which
by s. 621 enacted what is now s. 645(4) . (I cannot help but
suspect that the parliamentary draftsman, in seeking consistency of wording in
the various paras. of s. 645(4) , overlooked the fact that a person is
often not sentenced on the same day as he is convicted and that another
conviction may, as here, intervene.)

The position taken by the Court in the Paquette
case is said by respondent to be that adopted in Muise. In that
case, Owen J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal for Quebec, after listing a
number of cases submitted by the Crown in support of the proposition advanced
here by respondent, including Muise and Reddick, did say that the
judge had the power to impose a consecutive sentence. However, as this was a
case where a probation order had been revoked, the main thrust of his remarks
was in support of the desirability of giving a judge on such a revocation the
power of sentencing a person on the basis of the situation as it had developed
since the probation order was made and not limiting him to the circumstances at
the time at which the order was made. The Corbeil and Snell cases
offer even less help than Paquette; they are cases where the
courts in fact did impose consecutive sentences while the facts in those cases
did not put the case within the parameters of s. 645(4) ; as for Pearson
support for the existence of a general power was only obiter. Respondent
would have us infer from this a recognition on

[Page 629]

their part of a general power to impose
consecutive sentences.

SAME COURT—SAME SITTINGS

Neither side could offer much help in
determining what is meant by the words convictions “before the same court at
the same sittings” resorted to by Parliament in s. 645(4) (c). As I
said, the Crown did not really attempt to and preferred resting its case on the
existence of a general power to impose consecutive sentences, while the
appellant argued that, whatever those words meant, they could not mean
convictions on different dates, even though by the same judge. That is also the
extent to which the meaning was defined in Yeltatzie. Support for
appellant’s proposition can also be found in Ex Parte Risby since
McKenzie J. went even further by requiring “unity of time and place in the
making of the convictions and the sentencing”.

In the case of Primeau v. The Queen (1962),
42 C.R. 228, the Court of Appeal for Quebec denied a judge the right to impose
a consecutive sentence to that which had already been imposed as Primeau had
not been, said Taschereau J.A. for the Court, “found guilty of a crime by the
same Court during the same session.” (Emphasis added.) One might be
tempted to find there some indication as to the meaning of the word “sittings”.
However, that decision was written in French and Taschereau J.A. merely made
his own the wording of s. 621(4)(c) of the Code (now
s. 645(4) (c)) where “same sittings” is put in French by resorting
to the words “pendant la même session”. The translation of the judgment
rendered “pendant la même session” (the French version in the Code of
“at the same sittings”) by “during the same session”, instead of “the same
sittings” the words used in the English version. That decision is therefore of
little help in our query, all the more so since it appears from the facts as
stated in the decision that Primeau had been convicted by different

[Page 630]

judges of different courts. Therefore, not only
does Primeau not help in determining what is meant by “same sittings”,
neither is it, in my view, authority to support the proposition that a
conviction on different days is not “at the same sittings”, for the conclusion
of the court in that case could well have been arrived at because of the
convictions having been made by different judges or even courts.

There are cases dealing with the meaning of
“sittings of a court” but in a context quite different from the one here under
consideration. They concern mainly the computation of time to do certain things
that the law requires be done with reference to a sitting or sittings (See: R.
v. Caswell (1873), 33 U.C.Q.B. 303; R. v. Bombardier (1905), 11
C.C.C. 216; R. v. Johnston (1908), 13 C.C.C. 179; R. v. Korman (1923),
49 C.C.C. 405; R. v. The Justices of Sussex (1864), 4 B. & S. 966).
Some Law Dictionaries equate the sitting or sittings of a court with a session
or term of that court. Ballentine’s Law Dictionary, 3rd ed., 1969, at
p. 1185 says:

sitting of court. A session of court. A term of court.

‘The district judges in their sittings in
the several counties, for the trial of issues of fact, attended as they were by
clerks, sheriffs, juries, and all the paraphernalia of courts of record, were
holding district courts, and the duration of each of those sittings was a term
of court.’ See Gird v State, 1 Or 308, 311.

Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law, 2nd ed., vol. 2, London, Sweet & Maxwell Limited, 1977, at pp.
1664-65:

Sittings.
The sittings of the Supreme Court are four in number: the Hilary Sittings,
commencing on January 11, and ending on the Wednesday before Easter Sunday; the
Easter Sittings, commencing on the second Tuesday after Easter Sunday and
ending on the Friday before Whit Sunday; the Trinity Sittings commencing on the
second Tuesday after Whit Sunday and ending on July 31, and the Michaelmas Sittings
commencing on Octo-

[Page 631]

ber 1, and ending on December 21 (R.S.C.,
Ord. 64, r. 1; Long Vacation Order, dated February 3, 1950).

Formerly the sittings of the Courts of
Chancery and common law were regulated by the terms (q.v.), and hence were distinguished
as sittings in and sittings after term. Terms were abolished and sittings
substituted for them by the Judicature Act, 1873, s. 26.

The sittings of the officers of the Supreme
Court extend over the whole year (R.S.C., Ord. 64, r. 7), with the exception of
Saturdays and Sundays, Good Friday, the Tuesday after Easter Sunday, Christmas
Day, bank holidays and such other days as the Lord Chancellor may direct
(R.S.C., Ord. 64, r. 7). As to the hours during which the offices of the
Supreme Court are open, see the Supreme Court Offices (Hours of Business)
Order, 1963.

Sittings of the High Court may be held, and
any other business of the High Court may be conducted at any place in England
or Wales. The places at which the High Court sits outside the Royal Courts of
Justice and the days and times when the High Court sits outside the Royal
Courts of Justice are determined by directions given by the Lord Chancellor
(Courts Act, 1971, s. 2).

Sittings at the Royal Courts of Justice
include sittings in chambers as well as in court (Petty v. Daniel (1886)
34 Ch. D. 172).

Sittings in banc, sittings of the judges on the benches of their respective courts at
Westminster, at which they decided matters of law and transacted other judicial
business, as distinguished from nisi prius sittings, at which matters of
fact were tried. See Divisional Courts.

See also Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th ed.,
St. Paul, Minnesota, West Publishing Co., 1979, at p. 1244.

The word sitting or sittings takes on slightly
different meanings dependent upon the context in which it is used. Its meaning
is also somewhat different when relating to courts in general than when
relating to superior courts of first instance or of appellate jurisdiction;
again, “next sittings” of a court has been said to refer to the opening day of
a sittings (R. v. Tronson, [1932] 1 W.W.R. 537), to a sitting actually
held and not to a sitting appointed to be held but adjourned, (McLeod v.
Waterman (1903), 9 B.C.R. 370), to the nearest sittings

[Page 632]

and not just a subsequent sittings (Hogaboom
v. Lunt (1892), 14 P.R. 480). Generally speaking a sitting of a court is
said to refer to a time during which judicial business is transacted before
that court; in that sense, it could mean a day, a succession of uninterrupted
days or again different days within a given time span for transacting that
court’s business.

The word “court” when used in Part XX of the Code,
where s. 645 is found, bears a particular meaning. Section 644 reads
as follows:

644. In this
Part, except as provided in section 667, “court” means a court, judge,
justice or magistrate and includes a person who is authorized to exercise the
powers of a court, judge, justice or magistrate to impose punishment.

Now when we couple the expression “the same
court” with the words “same sittings” the possible meanings that can, at first
glance, be given to “same sittings” are narrowed down from the meaning of
“term” or “session”. Indeed, most criminal cases are now dealt with by
provincial or county court judges sitting without a jury who sit continuously
and do not operate within terms or sittings as still do some assize courts,
though many of the latter are in effect sitting continuously. This should
naturally lead to the conclusion that what those words are intended to mean is
something other than convictions by the same judge during the same term or
session. The natural, and, I must agree, tempting conclusion, when one adopts
this literal approach to the matter with the context rule in aid, is to say
that “convicted by the same court at the same sittings” means convicted by the
same judge at the same time. But this still leaves us with many unanswered and
very serious questions. Must the court have proceeded with the offences at the
same time? Is it material that the offences be counts of a charge or same
indictment or can they be in different charges or in different indictments
proceeded with jointly? What if the court proceeds with the first count or
charge, makes a finding of guilt, and then the evidence is read into the subsequent
counts or charges? What happens

[Page 633]

if having proceeded on all counts at the same
time, the judge convicts the accused for the various offences on different
dates? There are many more such possible combinations demonstrating that there
are still then many meanings that can be given to those words. Saying that they
cannot mean a session and that they simply mean on the same day far from ends
the matter.

The ordinary rules of interpretation would have
us then look to discover Parliament’s purpose and give those words whatever
meaning within reasonable limits that would best serve the object Parliament
set out to attain. But when dealing with a penal statute the rule is that, if
in construing a statute there appears any reasonable ambiguity, it be resolved
by giving the statute the meaning most favourable to the persons liable to
penalty.

This should at first glance lead to the
conclusion that the meaning most favourable to persons subject to sentences
will be that which will have the effect of restricting the judge’s powers to
impose consecutive sentences; in the light of this conclusion the words of the
section “convicted… before the same court at the same sittings” should
then be given the meaning “convicted on the same day, for offences proceeded on
at the same time by the same judge or judge and jury”. But I am far from sure
that giving those words the meaning that restricts the power to impose
consecutive sentences will as a matter of practice result in a meaning that
will have the section operate favourably to accused persons.

Indeed, if a judge, when imposing sentences of
imprisonment for many offences, is of the view that a person should in the
interest of society be incarcerated for a given period of time, he will within
the limits permitted by the law arrange the sentences to achieve what he
considers that just and fair result. This he will do through consecutive
sentencing if permitted by the law. If consecutive sentencing is not available,
for what he justifiably

[Page 634]

might consider shortcomings of the law for
technical reasons, he will achieve the imposition of that no less just and
desirable period of incarceration through other means, all equally legal.
Considering the high level at which sentences are set out in the Code all
he then need do is to impose for the latter conviction a sentence, the length
of which will correspond to the time he thinks the accused should serve for his
offences. Not being able to fulfil what he rightly considers to be his duty
through the imposition of consecutive sentences for reasons he considers purely
technical (and justifiably so in my view) he will do so in that way. At the
same time, however, the judge will be imposing for the latter offence, in order
to achieve the desirable and just aggregate result, a sentence the severity of
which is, even in his own view, much more than that required for that offence
when considering that offence in isolation. This is undesirable as each offence
should at the outset be punished individually and in proportion to its
seriousness. If each offence is deserving of its own period of imprisonment,
the proper method for achieving this when sentencing the accused is not by
sentencing one of the offences out of proportion to its gravity but through the
imposition of consecutive sentences.

Undesirable as a method, there is also danger in
proceeding by higher concurrent sentences for, if the conviction for the first
offence is subsequently quashed on appeal, the accused will still in effect
serve a sentence for that offence by serving the longer latter concurrent
sentence. These two reasons might, to some, seem far fetched. But it was
precisely for these concerns and upon those rationales that their Lordships in
the House of Lords in 1770 in the Wilkes case (19 How. St. Tr.
1075; 4 Burr. 2527; 98 E.R. 327) rested and developed the very power for judges
to impose imprisonment to be served consecutively. Construing the
section in favour of accused does not of necessity support restricting the
discretion given judges to resort to consecutive sentencing; it is not
paradoxical to say that accused persons in general might well be more
favourably treated by giving

[Page 635]

the words of the section a meaning that
favours the exercise of the power.

Now, when looking at s. 645(4)  one can
easily see, at least in s. 645(4) (a), that Parliament did curtail
the power. This raises the following question: was the power curtailed for
policy considerations that supersede those that command that judges have the
power, or is the curtailment of the general power in fact for the furtherance
of those latter considerations?

All of the foregoing is simply to say that
before applying mechanically and somewhat blindly any rule of construction to
the words of the section it is imperative that we closely scrutinize the
origin of the rule, its evolution over the years, the evolution of the context
in which it had been originally developed, and hopefully discover the reasons
why it is today with us in its present formulation.

THE HISTORY OF SECTION 645(4)

Section 645(4)  has, like s. 649(1), been
with us since the Code’s very beginning in 1892 and has undergone little
change. In fact, the words “the same court at the same sittings” were first
used in this country in a statute which predates Codification, An Act
respecting Punishments, Pardons and the Commutation of Sentences, R.S.C.
1886, c. 181, s. 27. That expression, in fact a whole portion of
s. 27, was simply taken from the English Draft Code of 1879, at
s. 17. Commenting in a marginal note their proposed section, the English
Commissioners said they were merely codifying “the common law as to
misdemeanours and the statute law as to felonies”.

The first statute dealing with cumulative
imprisonment was 1827 (U.K.), 7 & 8 Geo. IV, c. 28. The last pronouncements
of the House of Lords, on cumulative imprisonment before the enactment of that
statute were in 1770 in the Wilkes case. Though it is an old decision I
think that it should

[Page 636]

be closely analysed as it will, in my view, be
very revealing as to the purpose of the rules we find in ss. 645(4) and 649(1)
of today’s Criminal Code , and help in giving those words a meaning in
harmony with that purpose. I should also, for convenience, as it is an old
decision and therefore not easily available, quote from the reports rather more
extensively than is usual.

THE WILKES CASE

John Wilkes was tried at the one and same time
on two informations for libel. Verdicts were found against him upon each
information. Those verdicts were upheld subsequent to proceedings on writs of
error, and sentence was at a later date passed by the Court of Queen’s Bench.
Wilkes was brought to Court and sentenced to ten months and to a fine on the
first information known as “The North Briton, N° 45” libel, and then on the
same day to a further consecutive twelve months in the following terms (at pp.
1125-26):

The defendant being brought here into
court, in custody of the Marshal of the Marshalsea of this Court, by virtue of
a rule of this Court; and being convicted of certain trespasses contempts
and grand misdemeanours, in printing and publishing an obscene and impious
libel, intitled ‘An Essay on Woman,’ and other impious libels in the
information in that behalf specified, whereof he is impeached; and having
also been convicted of certain other trespasses contempts and
misdemeanours, for printing and publishing a certain other libel, intitled ‘The
North Briton, N° 45,’ for which he hath this day been sentenced, and
ordered by this Court to pay a fine of five hundred pounds, and to be imprisoned
in the custody of the said marshal for the space of ten calendar months; it is
now ordered by this Court, that the said defendant, for his trespasses
contempts and misdemeanours first abovementioned, in printing and publishing
the said obscene and impious libels, do pay a further fine to our sovereign
lord the king, of five hundred pounds of lawful money of Great Britain; and
that the said defendant be further imprisoned in the custody of the said
marshal, for the space of twelve calendar months, to be computed from and
after the determination of his aforesaid imprisonment for printing and
publishing the said other libel intitled The North

[Page 637]

Briton, N° 45’.

(My
emphasis.)

On a writ of error returnable in Parliament, the
House of Lords addressed (there were other issues, but they are of no relevance
to this appeal) the following question (at p. 1127):

Whether a judgment of imprisonment against
a defendant, to commence from and after the determination of an imprisonment to
which he was before sentenced for another offence, is good in law?

The unanimous decision of the House was
delivered by the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, Sir John
Eardley Wilmot. His comments should be reproduced here extensively as they are
very revealing as regards the thinking of the very judges who developed the
rules governing the imposition and serving of multiple sentences of
imprisonment (at p. 1133):

In treasons and felonies—a certain known
judgment, which cannot be departed from, viz. in the present tense of the
subjunctive passive: but in misdemeanors, where punishment is discretionary,
the limitation, as to time, seems only to be, that the punishment shall take
place before a total dismission of the party: a punishment shall not hang over
a man’s head when he has been once discharged; that is properly a punishment
‘in futuro’. But whilst he remains under a state of punishment, whilst he
is suffering one part of his punishment, he is very properly the object of a
different kind of punishment to take place during the continuance of the
former, or immediately after the end of it. And every case of this kind must
depend upon the peculiar circumstances which attend it.

In this case, it must be assumed, that fine
and imprisonment were the proper kind of punishment to be inflicted for these
offences; …

…

The punishment might have been inflicted
different ways.

1st, By imprisonment for twelve months; but
as he was already sentenced to ten months, it would have been only an
imprisonment for two.

2d, By imprisonment for twenty-two months;
which would, in effect, have been for twelve.

[Page 638]

But this would have been most grossly
unjust, because if the first judgment should be reversed, or he had been
pardoned, he would have been imprisoned twenty-two months, when the Court only
intended an imprisonment of twelve.

3d, The Court might have laid a fine of
1,000l. with a short imprisonment for one offence; and a small fine,
with an imprisonment for twenty-two months for the other.

This would have been equally unjust—for the
offences are different, and have no relation to one another. The prosecutions
are distinct, and the records as separate from one another as if there had been
two separate delinquents; and the offences on each record, must be as
separately and distinctly estimated; and though judgment happened to be
passed at the same time for both offences, yet the rule of admeasuring must be
the same as if the judgment had been pronounced at different times.

The punishment must be proportioned to the
specific offence contained in the record, upon which the judgment is then to be
pronounced; and must be neither longer nor shorter, wider nor narrower, than
that specific offence deserves. The balance is to be held with a steady
even hand; and the crime and the punishment are to counterpoise each other; and
a judgment given, or to be given against the same person for a distinct
offence, is not to be thrown into either scale, to add an atom to either.

To lay a fine of 1,000l. for one
offence, and twenty-two months imprisonment for the other, when the Court
thought a fine of 500l. and an imprisonment of ten months, was the
proper and adequate punishment for one offence, and a fine of 500l. and
an imprisonment of twelve months for the other, would have been twisting the two
offences and their punishments together, and a departure from the first
principle of distributive justice, which commands all judges to inflict that
punishment, and that punishment only, which they think commensurate to the
specific crime before them; and it might have been productive of the same
injustice I have already mentioned, viz. the judgment in one might be reversed
or pardoned; and the delinquent would then be subject to a larger fine or a
longer imprisonment, than the Court intended to subject him to for one of the
offences only.

We cannot explore any mode of sentencing
a man to imprisonment, who is imprisoned already, but by tacking one
imprisonment to the other, as is done in the present case.

[Page 639]

It is not letting the judgment for the first
offence vary the punishment, or influence the quantum of it in the other; but
only providing, from the situation of the delinquent, to effectuate the
punishment the Court thought his crime deserved. It is shaping the judgment
to the peculiar circumstances of the case; and the necessity of postponing the
commencement of the imprisonment, under the second judgment, arises from the
party’s own guilt, which had subjected him to a present imprisonment; and
therefore the question really is, Whether a man under a sentence of
imprisonment for one offence, can be sentenced to be imprisoned again for
another offence? If he can, this is the only form by which it can be done
consistent with justice. If it cannot be done, then in all offences which are
punishable only by fine and imprisonment, if a man has committed twenty, and
has been sentenced to imprisonment for one of them, he must be fined for all
the rest, which will amount to perpetual imprisonment with nine parts in ten of
the people most likely to commit such offences: or an imprisonment must be
directed for every offence after the first, inadequate and disproportionate to
it.

For suppose twenty offences of the same
malignity, and meriting exactly the same punishments—if six months imprisonment
were the punishment directed for the first offence; the second must be twelve
months: and, proceeding progressively, the twentieth must be ten years: and
thus six months and ten years will be the punishment for offences which ought
to have been punished exactly alike. Or, if it be an offence where whipping or
pillory might be inflicted, the alternative of a moderate imprisonment will not
be in the power of the Court to inflict; but they will be under the necessity
of laying a large fine, or directing one of the other severe corporal
punishments.

(My
emphasis.)

As a preliminary observation, it is to be noted
that the question put to the House did not make any distinction as to whether
the convictions were for treasons, felonies or misdemeanours, nor did the
House’s formal answer. Mention, however, is made by Lord Wilmot, in a passing
remark, to his comments being addressed to misdemeanours. This is so because,
as regards felonies or treasons, the problem of consecutive sentences did not
arise for two reasons. In the first place, there were very few subsequent
convictions after a first one for a non-

[Page 640]

clergiable felony. Indeed, prior to 1827 a
person already sentenced for a felony could plead to a subsequent indictment autrefois
attaint, a bar to the proceedings until and unless the attainder was
for some reason reversed. Chitty describes this defence as follows (J. Chitty, Criminal
Law, vol. 1, 2nd ed., 1826, at p. 464):

…once a felon is attainted he is dead in
law, his whole possessions are forfeited, his blood is corrupted, and nothing
remains but to put in execution the sentence of death under which he continues,
so that any second attainder would be superfluous.

As for the few non-clergiable felonies where a
second attainder would not be superfluous, the penalty was seldom one of
imprisonment to be added to a previous term of imprisonment, for at that time
(1770) very few, if any, non-clergiable felonies were punished by imprisonment,
as banishment or transportation were the usual substitutes for the death penalty.
Therefore imprisonment and the problems surrounding the imposition of
consecutive sentences for felonies came into the picture only a few years later
and gradually. But, I should add, one may reasonably assume that what their
Lordships had to say for misdemeanours would have been equally said by them at
the time as regards felonies had punishment imposed for those offences given
rise to the problem they were addressing in regard to misdemeanours.

Now what did they say? At the outset they stated
a principle: that a punishment should “not hang over a man’s head when he has
been once discharged”. That principle resulted in their formulating a rule:
that a “punishment shall take place before a total dismission of the party” and
that punishment “in futuro” is prohibited. In passing, this is the
origin of s. 649(1) of the present Canadian Criminal Code.

They then stated a second principle: that the
punishment inflicted for an offence when there is

[Page 641]

imposition of one or more sentences, whether at
the same or at different times, should in the result be “neither longer nor
shorter, wider nor narrower, than that specific offence deserves”. It is on
that second principle that they predicated the judge’s power to impose
consecutive sentences and to that end formulated two other rules: (1) that the
fact that a person be under sentence of imprisonment for one offence is not a
bar to his being “sentenced to be imprisoned again for another offence… by
tacking one imprisonment to the other”; (2) that the rule is to apply whether
the judgment “happened to be passed” for the different offences “at the same
time” or “at different times”. Then applying those rules to the particular
facts of the appeal, they being that Wilkes had been found guilty at the same
time on two informations charging libel, they answered the stated question
affirmatively and affirmed the judgments of the Court of Queen’s Bench.

In 1827, by 7 & 8 Geo. IV, c. 28, benefit of
clergy was abolished (s. VI) as was also attainder in bar of an indictment (s.
IV). As multiplicitous terms of imprisonment would thereafter be more often
susceptible of being imposed as regards felonies, the matter was dealt with in
section X:

X. AND be it
enacted, that wherever sentence shall be passed for felony on a person already
imprisoned under sentence for another crime, it shall be lawful for the court
to award imprisonment for the subsequent offence, to commence at the expiration
of the imprisonment to which such person shall have been previously sentenced;
and where such person shall be already under sentence either of imprisonment or
of transportation, the court, if empowered to pass sentence of transportation,
may award such sentence for the subsequent offence, to commence at the
expiration of the imprisonment or transportation to which such person shall
have been previously sentenced, although the aggregate term of imprisonment or
transportation respectively may exceed the term for which either of those
punishments could be otherwise awarded.

[Page 642]

In the Province of Canada, in 1841, a virtually
identical section was enacted by 4 & 5 Vict., c. 24, s. XXIX.

XXIX. And be
it enacted, that whenever sentence shall be passed for Felony on a person
already imprisoned under sentence for another crime, it shall be lawful for the
Court to award imprisonment for the subsequent offence, to commence at the
expiration of the imprisonment to which such person shall have been previously
sentenced; and where such person shall be already under sentence of
imprisonment, the Court may award such sentence for the subsequent offence to
commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which such person shall have
been previously sentenced, although the aggregate term of imprisonment may
exceed the term for which such punishment could be otherwise awarded.

In 1848, in England, 11 & 12 Vict., c. 43,
s. 25 extended to justices of the peace the power to impose consecutive
sentences on a defendant who was “…then… in prison undergoing imprisonment upon
a conviction for any other offence”.

In the Province of Canada in 1859, s. 109
of 22 Vict., c. 99, Consolidated Statutes of Canada, An Act respecting the
Procedure in Criminal cases, is an exact replica of s. XXIX of 4 &
5 Vict., c. 24. Finally, and only for the purpose of being thorough, I should
mention that in 1869 the Canadian Parliament replaced 22 Vict., c. 99 by 32-33
Vict., c. 29. Section 92 of the latter Act is, save some reference to
penitentiaries, an exact reenactment of s. 109.

I should pause here to underline that in all of
these statutes, and in both countries, no reference whatsoever is made to the
time of the convictions for the offences. The requirement is precisely related
to the passing of the sentence in that the sentence to be susceptible of being
ordered to be served consecutively must be passed upon a person “already
imprisoned under sentence for another crime”, whether convicted on the same day
or at different times, by the same or different judges or courts; neither did
their Lordships in the Wilkes case refer to the time of the convictions.

[Page 643]

THE CUTBUSH CASE

In 1867 the Cutbush decision (R. v.
Cutbush (1867), 10 Cox C.C. 489) dealt with consecutive sentences imposed
by justices in petty sessions. The question was whether the justices, on
convicting a man under The Vagrant Act, 1824 (U.K.), 5 Geo. IV, c. 83,
s. 4, for several distinct offences, in respect of each of which the
maximum punishment is three months’ imprisonment only, had power to award two
or more sentences of three months’ imprisonment and make one to commence at the
expiration of the others.

It was argued that the language in s. 25 of
1848 (U.K.), 11 & 12 Vict., c. 43 was different from that of s. 10 of
1827 (U.K.), 7 & 8 Geo. IV, c. 28, as it was impossible to say that, as
soon as a man had been sentenced, but not yet in prison physically, he was “in
prison undergoing imprisonment upon a conviction for any other offence” as is
required by the section (1848 (U.K.), 11-12 Vict, c. 43, s. 25).

But the Court of Queen’s Bench gave precisely
that wide interpretation to those words of the section and found that the
rule applied to those sentenced to imprisonment but not yet physically
imprisoned. In the course of deciding the issue, reference was made to the
power of judges as regards felonies. Cockburn C.J., speaking for the Court,
said this (at p. 492):

The question being whether that was within
their power, we thought it right, inasmuch as the 25th section of 11 &
12 Vict. c. 43, on which the question turns, is an enactment in substance
similar to the enactment of 7 & 8 Geo. 4, c. 28, s. 10, which gives a
similar power in cases of felony, to ascertain from our brother judges what had
been, so far as living judicial memory goes back, the practice of the judges
under the Act of 7 & 8 Geo. 4, c. 28. We have just had a consultation with
the rest of the Bench, and the result of that consultation is, that as far back
as living judicial memory goes the practice of judges has been, acting, of
course, under the powers given in the enactment to which I have referred, where
more than one case of felony was established against a man, and he was
convicted thereof, to make the sentence of imprisonment for the two or
three

[Page 644]

offences, as the case might be, commence at
the expiration of the sentence first awarded.

(My emphasis.)

This is how the matter is reported in 10 Cox
C.C. 489. However, in The Law Reports, Court of Queens Bench, (1867)
L.R. 2 Q.B. 379 et seq., Cockburn C.J.’s words are reported as being,
when he refers to the convictions for the felonies, “and he was convicted of
them at one and the same time”, instead of “and he was convicted thereof”, as
reported in Cox C.C.

Now this reference to the convictions being made
at “one and the same time” should, in my view, be read in the light of what was
said right after. Cockburn C.J. went on to say, in The Law Reports, Court of
Queen’s Bench, at pp. 382-83:

Now, inasmuch as that appears to have been
for so long a series of years the practice of the judges at the Central
Criminal Court and upon the circuits, we must take it as affording a
contemporaneous exposition of the effect of the 10th section of 7 & 8
Geo. 4, c. 28; and inasmuch as the 25th section of 11 & 12 Vict. c.
43, is, although it varies somewhat in its language, substantially the same as
that of the former act, and, no doubt, was intended to give justices the same
power to make the sentence of imprisonment given upon a summary conviction for
a second offence commence at the expiration of the first, and inasmuch as
(though, it is true, by some degree of technical straining) the words are
capable of that interpretation, and imprisonment may be said to commence, and
the man may be said to be imprisoned from the moment he is convicted of the
first offence and sentenced to imprisonment under it, and also as right and
justice require, when a man has been guilty of separate offences, for each of
which a separate term of imprisonment is a proper form of punishment, that he
should not escape from the punishment due to the additional offence, merely
because he is already sentenced to be imprisoned for another offence, and as it
would be contrary to public policy and expediency that he should so escape with
but one punishment; looking at it, I say, on the whole, in the first place,
with reference to what is the fairly possible construction of the 25th
section of 11 & 12 Vict. c. 43; secondly, to what justice and
expediency require; and then to the light which is thrown on what ought to be
the construction of the

[Page 645]

statute by the long practice that has
prevailed under the similar and corresponding enactment of the former
statute—looking at all the matters in all these different points of view, it
appears to us that we shall be putting the right and proper construction on the
section of the act of parliament we have to construe, by holding that the
justices in making the second sentence commence at the expiration of the first
acted within their jurisdiction; and the jurisdiction having been properly
exercised, the rule for discharging the defendant out of custody must be
discharged.

(My
emphasis.)

His rationale for the rule is precisely part of
that of their Lordships in Wilkes (the other part being avoiding
unwarranted long sentences for offences) and he does in no way make any further
reference to the convictions being of necessity made at the one and same time
when expounding upon the rationale for this rule. This is all the more
revealing when one scrutinizes the facts set out in the report (at
p. 380):

It appeared from the affidavits that Paine
was charged before the justices, on the 10th of December, 1866, with having
obscenely exposed his person on the 6th of December, 1866; to this charge he
pleaded guilty, and he was remanded; and on the 15th of December he was charged
with, and pleaded guilty to, three other similar offences, committed on the
22nd of November, 27th of November, and on the 30th of November, 1866,
respectively. The justices adjudged him to be imprisoned in Maidstone house of
correction on each of the four charges for three calendar months, with hard
labour, under the Vagrant Act, 5 Geo. 4, c. 83, s. 4, that being the
maximum punishment for the offence. The warrants of commitment, as to the
offences on the 22nd and 27th of November and 6th of December, simply awarded
three months’ imprisonment, but the warrant, as to the offence on the 30th of
November, awarded imprisonment for the space of three calendar months, ‘to
commence at the expiration of the first term of three calendar months
imprisonment to which he has this day been adjudged by us the said justices’.

Note should be taken of the fact that the plea
of guilty to the first offence was taken on a date prior to the pleas of guilty
to the other three which were taken subsequently but all three on the same day.

[Page 646]

True, even if the rule were to require that the
convictions be at the same time, that expression meaning on the same day, the
consecutive sentence imposed for the fourth offence would still have been valid
because the sentences imposed for the second and third offences were for
convictions on the same day as the fourth; but it would seem to me somewhat
strange that, if that were essential to the right to impose consecutive
sentences given the particular facts of the case, the Chief Justice would not
have made some reference to those facts or that the parties did not in the
least raise the matter in argument. The answer probably lies in the use by the
House of Lords in Wilkes of the word “happened” when they said:

…and though judgment happened to be passed
at the same time for both offences, yet the rule of admeasuring must be the
same as if the judgment had been pronounced at different times.

A further observation is very revealing. The
House of Lords in Wilkes when referring to judgment happening to
be passed at the same time for both offences was referring to the sentences
being imposed at the same time, not the convictions, At that time and still at
the time of the Cutbush case, sentences were adjudged after verdicts. As
an illustration of this, see Gregory v. The Queen (1850), 15 Q.B. 974;
see also Leverson v. The Queen, (1869) L.R. 4 Q.B. 394.

THE ORTON alias CASTRO CASE

This interpretation of Wilkes finds
support in the comments of the judges of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Orton,
alias Castro (1880), 14 Cox C.C. 436, stating the law in the matter and
referring to what it had been since the Wilkes case and still was. Per
James L.J. (at pp. 456‑57):

The law is, and always has been, that
counts for several misdemeanours may be joined in one indictment as it is
called—that is to say, may be the subject of several distinct counts or
charges, put together in one piece of

[Page 647]

parchment, but each count being in law a
distinct charge or indictment, upon which the party ought to be tried and
convicted or acquitted as the case may be. A practice has prevailed in cases of
felonies, by which the judges, in the exercise of their power of regulating the
proceedings before them, thought it right in capital cases—in times when nearly
all crimes were capital—that a party should not be tried for more than one
felony at the same time, in order that he might not be embarrassed or
prejudiced by evidence as to other offences. (e) No such rule (e)
prevailed with regard to trials for misdemeanour, though in a proper case,
if the judge saw that there would be prejudice to the prisoner, he could call
on the prosecutor to elect on which count to proceed. But these were mere
matters of judicial discretion, for the exercise of which in no case could a
writ of error be brought. Such being the law that a party might be tried at the
same time, for several misdemeanours, the subject of several charges on several
distinct counts, there is in my mind no possible or reasonable distinction to
be drawn between a trial and conviction on several counts or charges in one
indictment, and several trials and convictions on several indictments one after
another. In the case of Rex. v. Wilkes (a) it
was certainly settled distinctly that for several misdemeanours, the subject no
doubt of several indictments, one tried after the other, and on which the
sentences were pronounced immediately, one after the other by the House of
Lords, on the advice of all the Judges that one sentence of imprisonment could
be passed to take effect after the expiration of imprisonment for another. So
the law was laid down and from that time to the present it has remained
unquestioned, and no judge has ever in this country expressed the slightest
doubt of that being the common law of England.

(e) That is (it is presumed)
the rule against joinder of counts. (See R. v. Gough (1 M. & R.
74)).

(a) 4 Brown’s Parliamentary
Cases, 360; 4 Burr. 2527.

(My
emphasis.)

Per Brett L.J.
(at p. 462):

Then on an indictment containing more than
one count, can the punishment on one of them be postponed until the expiration
of the punishment on the other? That seems to have been decided in Wilkes’
case and other

[Page 648]

cases that have been cited. The judges in Wilkes’
case were asked whether a judgment of imprisonment, to commence after the
termination of an imprisonment to which he is already subjected, is good in
law, a question which, it will be observed, had no reference to whether there
was one indictment or two, but was quite general in its terms, and the judges
answered it in terms quite as general, for their answer was ‘that a judgment of
imprisonment against a defendant may commence after the expiration of an
imprisonment to which he has been before sentenced for another offence.’ Ever
since then that has been taken to be the law, and that quite irrespective of
the question whether the charges are in one indictment or two. Not only was
that the answer of the judges, but it has been so interpreted ever since. It is
not a question of ‘cumulative’ punishments—the use of that expression is
incorrect. It is not so put in the answer of the judges in the case of Wilkes.
The question was, whether the operation of a sentence could be postponed
until after the expiration of a previous sentence. The judges gave indeed one
limitation; they limited the postponement of the second sentence to the case of
another sentence in existence up to the time to which the second is
postponed—that is, that the second sentence must take effect before the final
dismissal of the party, but that, with that limitation, it may be postponed. The
cases of Robinson and Gregory are to the same effect. There are,
therefore, authorities to show that it may be done, either on one indictment or
several.

In the House of Lords (Castro, alias Orion v.
The Queen (1881), 14 Cox C.C. 546), the Lord Chancellor (Lord Selborne)
reviewed the Wilkes case extensively and agreed with the reasoning of
Wilmot C.J. and then said (at p. 552):

To the reasons given for that by Wilmot,
C.J., and apparently adopted by this House, I will shortly refer. I will first,
however, state the question which was raised and put to the Judges, which was
this: ‘Whether a judgment of imprisonment against a defendant to commence from
and after the determination of an imprisonment to which he was before sentenced
for another offence is good in law?’ to which the learned Judges returned an
affirmative answer in the terms of the question; and thereupon this House
affirmed the judgment which had been in fact so pronounced.

He then went on to say (at p. 553):

[Page 649]

So far, therefore, as relates to
misdemeanours, and subject to the question whether this authority would apply
when the aggregate of the two punishments exceeds in point of time that which
there would have been power to award for either offence alone, subject to that,
the case of Rex v. Wilkes (ubi sup.) in this House is a
clear and distinct authority in favour of the proposition that when a man is
found guilty of two distinct misdemeanours, being distinct and separate
offences, and not the same (I apprehend that it makes no kind of difference
whether it be by two indictments simultaneously tried and found against him, or
upon two counts in one and the same indictment), there, not only a competent,
but the proper course independent of any statutory legislation, was and is to
pronounce a second sentence of imprisonment, within the power of the court as
to duration, to begin after the expiration of the first.

Now would that mean that the Lord Chancellor
limited the House’s statement of principle in Wilkes to cases where the
convictions were simultaneous or was this only a restatement of the fact
that the rule applied even in those cases where the convictions were pronounced
at the same time?

After having quoted Cockburn C.J., in Cutbush,
where he had said “and he was convicted of them at one and the same time”,
he then continued (at p. 555):

The learned Chief Justice, although
admitting that there was some technical difficulty, not in any other part of
the matter, but in the particular words I have read, which seemed to
contemplate that the man should be actually in prison, yet thought the reason
and substance of the case to be so clear, in addition to the authority to be
derived from the exposition based upon the earlier statute by the uniform
practice, as to make it right to hold that cumulative sentences might be
awarded under those statutes even though the man had not already found his way
to prison; and in point of fact one sentence was passed practically at the same
time as the other. The practice, therefore, as far as can be ascertained
from any of the authorities or from any of the books, has been uniform in
favour of consecutive cumulative sentences of this kind; and if it were not so
it would be difficult to see how it would be possible that any punishment at
all could be inflicted for more than

[Page 650]

one offence, if the convictions took
place at the same time.

(My
emphasis.)

As he recognized that the overall approach is
one of making possible the imposition of consecutive sentences when the ends of
justice so require, that could hardly be reconciled with his denying that power
to the judges when convictions were “one after the other” as said James L.J. in
the same case in the Court of Appeal.

Most eloquent, in support of the fact that that
was not the effect initially intended by referring to simultaneous convictions,
is the reasoning of Lord Blackburn with which the Lord Chancellor did not take
issue. Lord Blackburn, analysing what would have been the effect on the issues
had the judge granted an application for separate trials, said (at
p. 559):

It is clear that, if the Court had pleased
to grant the application, these two counts might have been tried—the one in
London before a London jury, and the other in Middlesex before a Middlesex
jury; and, but for the Act relating to the Central Criminal Court, which gives
that court jurisdiction over both, they must have been so tried. But, even now,
they might have been so tried, and, if they had been so tried, and if each jury
had found a verdict of guilty on the counts brought before it separately, Rex
v. Wilkes (ubi sup.) would have been an authority absolutely
in point as to the sentence, and there would not have been a pretext for saying
there was the least difference. But then it is put in the argument in this way,
that, when they are both tried before one jury, and when the party has not been
put to his election, but the trial for both offences has taken place together,
the consequence must be that he is not to be punished in the same way as he
would have been if he had been tried for each before a separate jury, and he is
therefore entitled to get off with less punishment. Why, I am sure I cannot
conceive; nor can I see that any authority has been cited for that—at any rate,
in English law; nor does it proceed on any reason.

The essence of Lord Watson’s reasoning on the
point is contained in his concluding remarks (at p. 562):

But then in England it is not necessary to
bring these two separate proceedings in order to try one criminal for a
misdemeanour, and I see no reason whatever, even if I

[Page 651]

accept that decision as law, for holding
that if you can tack together two periods of the full amount, one for each
offence, when you try by separate indictments, the same may not be done when
two offences are tried upon the same indictment. And still further, it appears
to me among the cases cited at the bar there is to be found, not only
sufficient authority, but ample authority for the proposition that such a
sentence is sustainable, and is good according to the law of England.

It therefore seems clear to me that in 1869 the
law in England and in Canada as regards all offences was still what the House
of Lords had said it was in Wilkes as regards misdemeanours; that a
sentence of imprisonment, be it for a felony, a misdemeanour or an offence
punishable summarily, be it imposed by an assize court, a court of quarter
sessions or a petty sessions court, could be ordered to be served consecutively
to a sentence already imposed notwithstanding the fact that the former sentence
had been imposed at the same time, immediately before the latter; that the sole
restriction was that the sentence be tacked on to a previous sentence not yet
completely served; and there was no requirement that the first sentence be
already “adjudged” at the time of the conviction for the second offence but
only that the first sentence be “adjudged” at the time of the imposition of the
second sentence. It is therefore equally clear that the judges’ reference to
judgments, sentences, or convictions at the same time, was only to ensure that
the fact of imposing more than one sentence of imprisonment at the same time
would not be a bar to a judiciary power to order that they be served
consecutively; and it was immaterial to the judges whether the sentences were
imposed following a trial on several counts in one indictment, or several
indictments, and whether they were tried at the same time or one after the
other. The latter portion of the rule was to extend the power, not limit it;
the problem they had addressed was the simultaneity of the imposition of the
sentences, (the judgments or adjudgments) not that of the convictions (the
determinations or verdicts).

[Page 652]

THE ENGLISH DRAFT CODE

This interpretation of what the law was in 1869
and still was at the time of the English Draft Code of 1878, that of
1879, and our own Code of 1892, is borne out by what Sir James Stephen
said in a memorandum “Showing the alterations proposed to be made in the
existing law by the Criminal Code  (indictable offences) Bill, if
amended, as proposed by the Attorney General”. The Bill there referred to is
Bill 178, (41 Vict.), and its proposed Code is not to be confused with
the Code proposed by the Royal Commissioners who were appointed to
examine that Code and reported to Parliament on the matter with their
own version of what the Code should be. (Stephen, in his History of
the Criminal Law of England, vol. 1, 1883, at p. vi of the Preface,
refers to the former as the 1878 Draft Code and to the latter as the
1879 Draft Code). In the course of commenting on Clause 15 of
Bill 178 which dealt with cumulative sentences, Stephen said:

As the law now stands, if a man is
convicted of more offences than one, he may in all cases be sentenced to any
punishment to which he may be sentenced for any such offence, and each sentence
may be made to begin at the expiration of the preceding one. Thus a man
convicted of aiding three separate persons to escape from prison might be
sentenced to three successive terms of two years’ imprisonment and hard labour;
in other words, to six years’ imprisonment with hard labour. By Clause 15 a
scale is provided according to which a sentence of penal servitude might be
passed in such cases.

That this was so is further borne out in his
Fourth and Fifth Edition of his Digest of the Criminal Law. In his
Fourth Edition (1887), he describes the law as follows (at pp. 18-19):

CUMULATIVE
PUNISHMENTS

Wherever sentence is passed for felony
on a person already imprisoned under sentence for another crime, the Court may award imprisonment for the subsequent offence to
commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which such person was
previously sentenced. When such a person is already under sentence either of
imprisonment or transportation, the Court, if empow-

[Page 653]

ered to pass sentence of penal servitude,
may award such sentence for the subsequent offence, to commence at the
expiration of the imprisonment or penal servitude to which such person was
previously sentenced, although the aggregate term of imprisonment or penal servitude
respectively may exceed the term for which either of those punishments could be
otherwise awarded.

When an offender is convicted of more
misdemeanors than one, he may be sentenced to a separate punishment for each
offence, and the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct that the one punishment
shall not begin until the other has been undergone.

(My
emphasis.)

There is no mention whatsoever of a requirement
for the convictions being at one and the same time; the only reference is
inferentially to the fact that the sentences are being imposed by the same
court presumably at the same time. Neither is there a requirement that at the
time of the second conviction the sentence for the former conviction be already
imposed.

The four Royal Commissioners, one of whom was
Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, in their Draft Code of 1879 proposed the
adoption of the following section:


 
  
   
  
  
  Section
  17.
  
 
 
  
  This expresses the common law as to
  misdemeanours, and the statute law as to felonies. See 7 & 8 Geo. IV, c.
  28, s. 10 (England), and 9 Geo. IV, c. 54, s. 20 (Ireland). See the
  Report, p. 17. This proviso is new.
  
  
  Sentences
  may be cumulative.
  When an offender is convicted of more
  offences than one before the same Court at the same sitting, or when any
  offender undergoing punishment for one offence is convicted of any other
  offence, the Court may on the last conviction direct that the sentences
  passed upon him for his several offences shall take effect one after the
  other, or after the expiration of the punishment which he is undergoing at
  the time of his last conviction:
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  Provided that no cumulative sentence of
  imprisonment shall be passed on any offender so as to subject him to any
  continuous period of imprisonment exceeding two years; …
  
 


(My
emphasis.)

As I have already mentioned earlier, the
Commissioners were the first to speak of convictions “before the same court at
the same sitting” and to resort to “a conviction-to-sentence” relation in the
stead of a “sentence-to-sentence” relation, which at first glance would appear
to be a departure

[Page 654]

from what the law was at the time. Could the
marginal note be an illustration of the underlined portion of what Lord Chief
Justice Cockburn meant in his letter to the Attorney General of June 12, 1879
commenting on the Code:

Not only is there much room for improvement
as regards arrangement and classification, but the language used is not always
perspicuous, or happily chosen, while the use of provisoes, an objectionable
mode of legislation, is carried to an unusual excess, nor is the intention
always clear; and, what is still more important, the law is, in many instances,
left in doubt, and I am bound to say, in my opinion, not always correctly
stated. As to this, however, I ought to add that I am often left in doubt
whether particular passages are intended to be a statement of the existing law
or a proposed alteration of it.

(Emphasis
added.)

Indeed the law, as it then stood, would have
been accurately stated had the section read “… or when any offender
undergoing punishment for one offence is sentenced for any other
offence… ”. Clearly, a curtailment of the judges’ sentencing powers was made
through the requirement for the existence of the previous sentence at the time
of the conviction for the other offence and not only at the time of the
imposition of the sentence, if the two or more sentences were not imposed by
the same court at the same sitting. If the sentence was imposed by a different
court, or, if by the same court, not at the same sitting, it could still be
made consecutive to a previous sentence but only if it had been adjudged at the
time of the conviction for the second offence. Why this change?

I have searched, to no avail, trying to discover
some pronouncement by the Commissioners or their contemporaries which might
shed some light on the matter. Wilkes, Cutbush, Castro, and all the
statutes were clear on the matter: a judge could “tack on” a sentence of
imprisonment to one already imposed. One cannot discard that fact and see a
mere Commissioners’ oversight in their referring to the time of conviction in
their proposed section.

[Page 655]

My best surmise is that this curtailment of the
consecutive sentencing power was suggested in order to protect better the
accused from sentences of unwarranted length, which I should like to recall is
one of the two rationales upon which the very power of consecutive sentencing
rests in the first place. Indeed, I suggest they wanted to avoid the imposition
of a consecutive sentence by a judge to previous sentence in which another
judge had taken the second conviction “into account” in determining its
duration. One must recall that, at the time, the English practice of “taking
into account” was only beginning to develop and really started to be regulated
through practice directives only at the turn of the century. It must have
appeared to the Commissioners that the way best to preclude the two sentencing
judges from each in turn taking into account the two convictions was to deny
the second sentencing judge the power to impose a consecutive sentence if there
was a danger that the first sentencing judge had taken the two convictions into
account. Now this could only happen if the first sentencing judge had not yet
sentenced at the time of the other conviction; by requiring that he have, the
danger no longer existed as he could not take into account a conviction that
did not yet exist. If I am right as to the Commissioners’ purpose, we must then
assume that they did not intend to change the law when the sentences were being
adjudged by the same judge or “sitting” of judges. Indeed the mischief they
sought to avoid could not happen when the sentencing judge or judges were the
same person(s) who sat at the trial or different trials resulting in the
convictions.

This still would require explaining why the
rule, had this been their purpose, was not framed by saying so and by using
language referring to the passing of the sentences by the same judge, in the
stead of framing it in terms of conviction “before the same court at the same
sitting”.

[Page 656]

One must not overlook the context in which the
framing of the rule took place. At the time, even though terms had been
abolished since 1873 by 36 & 37 Vict., c. 66, s. 26, the sittings of
assizes and quarter sessions courts (be they county or borough) were during
given periods of time. Notwithstanding the establishment of a superior court of
judicature in 1873 and the special provisions that were made for sittings in
Middlesex and London, the following description of how assizes and quarter
sessions were held was still reasonably accurate in 1879. In Leverson v. The
Queen, (1869) L.R. 4 Q.B. 394, the comments of Chief Justice Cockburn shed
light on the meaning of the words “same court” and “same sitting” and possibly
even more so on the conjunctional use of those words in the Draft Code’s proposed
section. In addressing one of the issues in the case he felt it necessary to
describe how commissions of “oyer and terminer” were carried out (at
p. 403):

Now, from the earliest period, commissions
of oyer and terminer have been framed in the same terms as are employed in the
statute in question. In these commissions a certain specified number of the
persons, some of whom are named, are always constituted a quorum. Yet, for
centuries the trials of offences under such commissions upon the circuits of
the judges, have been held before a single judge, and the proceedings are
nevertheless represented on the record as taking place not before one judge but
before the other judges sitting under the commission. Now, this, we apprehend,
must have proceeded on the ground that, while the whole body of the justices
named in the commission constituted the Court of oyer and terminer, each judge
sitting under it represented the Court; so that whatever took place before
the single judge was considered as done, constructively, before the whole
Court. Hence, at the assizes, every trial on the criminal side of the Court,
even when the trial takes place not before a judge but before a serjeant or
Queen’s counsel, is represented on the record (as is also the case on trials at
nisi prius) as taking place before both the judges of the superior courts ‘and
other justices their fellows’.

…

(at pp. 403-04)

All this seems to us to shew that, under a
commission of oyer and terminer, not only may the general Court be

[Page 657]

divided into as many courts as convenience
may require, but that each separate Court is to be considered as held not only
before the judge actually sitting, but also, constructively, before all
the members of the commission then acting under it.

…

(at p. 404)

Applying, therefore, the inveterate
practice of the criminal courts of this country to the proceedings of the
Central Criminal Court it appears to us that, while there were other judges
under the same commission, sitting at the then sessions, the presence of
a second member of the commission in the Court presided over by
Mr. Commissioner Kerr on the trial of this indictment was unnecessary. It
would have been in our judgment sufficient and perfectly proper, in accordance
with the general practice of criminal courts, to state on the record that the
proceedings were heard before Mr. Commissioner Kerr and any other judge
actually sitting under the commission in one of the other courts; or, indeed,
before any two judges actually sitting in the principal Court.

(at p. 406)

According to the practice of centuries, the
judges acting under the latter commissions, as well as those acting under the
commissions of nisi prius, have been in the habit of dividing their courts, and
of sitting, when business required it, in two or more courts for the dispatch
of business at the same time.

(My
emphasis.)

Added to this is the fact that, at the time,
sentences were of necessity pronounced (adjudged) before the end of the assize
or the session otherwise, save certain exceptions, the court lost jurisdiction
over the convict. This was at least certainly the case for courts of quarter
sessions. As a result the only cases where a “same court” could pronounce more
than one sentence at the same time on the same person would be for convictions
determined during the current sittings of that assize or quarter session.
Indeed, the later of two convictions during different assizes or sessions would
of

[Page 658]

necessity have been determined whilst the person
was already under sentence for the previous conviction.

Assuming that they were codifying without any
modification that part of the consecutive sentencing common law rule, this
construction of those words is the only one that results in the rule applying
as would have the common law.

By reference to “the same court at the same
sitting” the Commissioners were in effect ensuring that the sentences were
being imposed by the same judge or panel of judges. That was their purpose.
Those words were chosen to effect that purpose given the judicial structures
and procedures of the time and in that country. As I said, this construction of
their purpose (codifying the common law whilst avoiding double sentencing) and
of their reasons for resorting to the words “the same court at the same
sitting” is the only way to explain what they did; the only other alternative
is to recognize that they misread Wilkes and considered the words of the
Lord Chancellor in Castro and those of the Lord Chief Justice in Cutbush
completely out of context and gave them a purely literal meaning. That
approach, I must admit, is tempting as it could make this case much more
simple. But, I cannot for a moment believe that those jurists had misread the
law. I find in subsequent events confirmation of this opinion as regards the
purpose for referring to “same court” and “same sitting”. Indeed as long as
there were in England and in Wales assizes and quarter sessions the law was
stated in various publications by referring to convictions “on the same indictment
or at the same assizes” (J.F. Stephen, A Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th
ed., by L.F. Sturge, 1950, at p. 51) or at the same quarter sessions. But
when courts of assizes and of quarter sessions and the practice of issuing
commissions to hold court were abolished in 1971 (Courts Act 1971;
Halsbury’s Statutes of England, 3rd ed., vol. 41, at p. 285 et seq.),
the law no longer required the convictions being made at the “same sitting”
as is illustrated by what the law is said today to be in The English

[Page 659]

and Empire Digest, Vol. 14(2), at p. 690[1], case
5768:

The power to pass a sentence of
imprisonment to commence at the expiration of a previous sentence has always
existed at common law where the offences for which the sentences were passed
are misdemeanours, &, since the enactment of Criminal Law Act 1827,
s. 10 (repealed), in the cases of felonies, & it is immaterial whether
the two sentences are passed in respect of charges made by separate indictments
or separate counts in one indictment & tried at the same assizes or session
or in respect of charges tried at separate assizes or sessions, or whether the
offence for which sentence was last passed was committed before or after the
offence for which sentence was first passed.

Therefore, I feel that I am not taking
unreasonable liberty with the Commissioners’ words and that I am justified in
making the assumption I have as to their purpose for resorting to those words.

CANADIAN LAW

In 1886, the Canadian Parliament adopted the
first paragraph of s. 17 of the 1879 English Draft Code. Section 27
of R.S.C. 1886, c. 181, An Act respecting Punishments, Pardons and the
Commutation of Sentences, reads as follows:

27. When an
offender is convicted of more offences than one, before the same court or
person at the same sitting, or when any offender, under sentence or
undergoing punishment for one offence, is convicted of any other offence, the
court or person passing sentence may, on the last conviction, direct that the
sentences passed upon the offender for his several offences shall take effect
one after another. 32-33 V., c. 29, s. 92.

(My
emphasis.)

That is exactly what came into our first Code
in 1892 (s. 954).

[Page 660]

I assume that Parliament when enacting that
section in the statute in 1886 and later on in the Code intended to
enact the common law to the extent and with the limitation intended by the
Commissioners in the English Draft Code. Though the same purpose could
have been achieved more simply, the relevance of referring to “same court” and
“same sitting” was still present. The word “court” when used at the time in the
Code or when defined referred not to the trier of fact (as in
s. 644 of the present Code), but to the court system such
as, assizes, quarter, general, or petty sessions, county court, or superior
courts, or courts of criminal jurisdiction. The expression the “same court” did
not, without some special context or further precision, necessarily mean the
same judge. Terms and sessions of courts were held at regular periods during
the year and certain judges could sit alone and constitute the court whilst
others had to sit together (see as an illustration R.S.O. 1887, c. 48; or
R.S.Q. 1888, ss. 2464 to 2474). The conjunctional use of “same court” with
“same sitting” did therefore still make sense. But not for long. The court
system evolved and courts were presided over by one judge. The context changed
but, alas, not the words of the section.

In 1927 the word “sitting” was changed to
“sittings”. I do not think that much turns upon this and I believe that it is
merely semantic; if anything, it could indicate on the part of Parliament an
intent not to limit “the same sitting” to meaning a conviction for many
offences on the same day.

The last change to the section occurred in
1953 where the words “or person” were deleted. This is explained by the
introduction in the Code (s. 620) of a definition of the word “court”
specific to that part of the Code (Part XX, Punishments, Fines,
Forfeitures, Costs and Restitution of Property) that I have reproduced
at the beginning of this opinion now being s. 644. Whatever relevance to
the purpose sought a conjunctional resort to the

[Page 661]

words “same court” and “same sittings” still had
in 1953, it practically disappeared by virtue of the introduction of that
definition (save the reference to “court” in the definition).

The traditional rules of construction of
statutes would suggest that Parliament intended those words to mean more than
“the same judge” given the fact that the definition of court would already give
the words “same court’, used in the section that very meaning, at least
most of the time. Now to give the word “sittings” the meaning it had at the
time of its introduction into our Code would make no sense. We would not
know how to apply it to a court that has no “sessions” or “terms” such as is
the case for our provincial courts and most if not all of our other courts. One
way of interpreting those words would be to have them mean cases that were
heard by the same trial judge and proceeded upon at the same time and
convictions pronounced the same day. But this is far from satisfactory. There
could be no useful purpose for Parliament having wanted to restrict the
sentencing power in that way. Indeed, what difference does it make if a judge
proceeds on various counts one after the other and decides them as he goes
along instead of reserving judgment on each one and convicting on the same day?
Equally puzzling would be for Parliament to have intended that “the same
sittings” mean judgments on the same day in cases heard at different times? One
could imagine a multiplicity of unsatisfactory scenarios. I do not think it
necessary to belabour the point. Whatever meaning one tries to give today to
“the same sittings” either results in a reference to a time span of judicial
activity that practically no longer exists (sessions) for most courts, or else
results in the granting of different sentencing powers to judges on the basis
of distinctions that resist any kind of possible rationalization and, in fact,
simply do not make any sense.

Now the principles that brought about the
elaboration of the rules regarding cumulative sentences have not changed. Nor
the purpose for referring to “the same court at the same sittings”;

[Page 662]

we still want to avoid double sentencing without
however taking away the power to impose consecutive sentences from the judge
when the danger is no longer there because he is the same sentencing judge in
the two or more convictions. But because the context in which that reference to
“the same court at the same sittings” has drastically changed, if we give those
words the same meaning they had, they will make no sense, and, in the
alternative, whatever sense we could in this day and age manage to give them,
they are then counterproductive of the very purpose they were intended to
serve. One sure thing, they result in anything but a codification of what the
common law was in the days of Wilkes and of what it is today in England.

EXCEPTIONAL CONSTRUCTION

Courts have always been reluctant to giving
statutes exceptional construction. This is well illustrated in the reported
cases on the subject. But this reluctance did not stop courts from departing
from the ordinary rules of construction if through their application the law
were to become what Dickens’ Mr. Bumble said it sometimes could be, “a
ass, a idiot” (Dickens, Oliver Twist).

On the point, Maxwell has this to say (Maxwell
on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed., by P. St. J. Langan, 1969, at
p. 228):

1. Modification of the Language to Meet the
Intention

Where the language of a statute, in its
ordinary meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest
contradiction of the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some
inconvenience or absurdity which can hardly have been intended, a construction
may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words and even the
structure of the sentence. This may be done by departing from the rules of
grammar, by giving an unusual meaning to particular words, or by rejecting them
altogether, on the ground that the legislature could not possibly have intended
what its words signify, and that the modifications made are mere corrections of
careless language and really give the true meaning. Where the main object and
intention of a statute are clear, it must not be reduced to a nullity by the
draftsman’s unskilful-

[Page 663]

ness or ignorance of the law, except in a
case of necessity, or the absolute intractability of the language used. Lord
Reid has said that he prefers to see a mistake on the part of the draftsman in
doing his revision rather than a deliberate attempt to introduce an irrational
rule: “the canons of construction are not so rigid as to prevent a realistic
solution”.

Baron Alderson in Attorney-General v.
Lockwood (1842), 9 M. & W. 377, 152 E.R. 160 interpreting a penal
statute said (at p. 397):

The rule of law, I take it, upon the
construction of all statutes, and therefore applicable to the construction of
this, is, whether they be penal or remedial, to construe them according to the
plain, literal, and grammatical meaning of the words in which they are
expressed, unless that construction leads to a plain and clear contradiction of
the apparent purpose of the act, or to some palpable and evident absurdity.

Baron Parke, in Becke v. Smith (1836), 2
M. & W. 191, 150 E.R. 724, had expressed essentially the same principle,
adding however a caveat as to the extent to which a court should go (at
p. 195):

It is a very useful rule, (b) in
the construction of a statute, to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the words
used, and to the grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the
intention of the legislature, to be collected from the statute itself, or leads
to any manifest absurdity or repugnance, in which case the language may be varied
or modified, so as to avoid such inconvenience, but no further.

(b) Per Burton, J., in
Warburton v. Loveland, 1 Hudson & Brooke’s Irish Reports, 648.

The two pronouncements are typical of the
numerous others on the subject that set out either the prerequisite for the
resort to the exceptional construction or the limits of its exercise.

The requirement in s. 645(4) (a) that
a sentence be already imposed at the time of the subsequent conviction is, as I
have said, in my opinion, a clear and unambiguous departure from the common law
as the law was in 1886 and is still today, and surely, Parliament’s will cannot
and should not be defeated through exceptional construction. I am not
personally convinced that the policy considerations which I think brought about
that change to the common law justify importing into the sentenc-

[Page 664]

ing process the artificiality s. 645(4)(a)
of necessity does. But that is for Parliament to decide and change, and is
not the province of this Court. Were we to do so we would then, as Baron Parke
said in Becke v. Smith, be going further than what is required to
suppress the “absurdity” and usurping Parliament’s privileges. But when
addressing s. 645(4) (c), which from its origin in 1886 and
throughout its existence to this day has purported to express the common law on
that aspect of consecutive sentencing, as stated in Wilkes, and as that
law is today, the only meaning I find the words “the same court at the same
sittings” can be given, lest the purpose of Parliament be defeated, is that the
convictions be made by or before the same judge. In sum, expressed otherwise,
and more with a view to the functional purpose for which these words were
resorted to in the section in 1886, s. 645(4) (c) means that
sentences imposed by the same judge may be made consecutive. This in turn
qualifies s. 645(4) (a) and restricts its application to sentences
imposed by different judges.

In the result, a judge may order that a sentence
be served consecutively to another sentence he has previously or is at the same
time imposing (s. 645(4) (c)); but he cannot order that a sentence be
made consecutive to that imposed by another judge in another case unless that
sentence had already been imposed by the other judge at the time of the
conviction in the case in which he is sentencing (s. 645(4) (a)).

I am not unmindful of the stress I am suggesting
we put on Parliament’s words and the fact that little or no meaning is being
given to the words “at the same sittings”; but I am encouraged in this
endeavour when considering the absurd results we are led into by the
alternative.

[Page 665]

Before concluding, I should add, with regard to
respondent’s suggestion that there is a general power to sentence
consecutively, that in my view Parliament codified in 1892 the powers to
sentence consecutively. Indeed, s. 649(1) requires that the power be found
in some (federal) enactment. Section 645 is one such enactment, so are other
sections such as ss. 83(2), 137(1).

With respect, I cannot agree with the reasoning
of the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia in Muise (No 3) for the reasons
given on that point by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Oakes (1977),
37 C.C.C. (2d) 84.

I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Common law
conspiracy—Conspiracy to cause persons to come into the United States
unlawfully—Offence known to Canadian law—Presumption of territoriality under
s. 423(3)  of the Criminal Code —Information meets requirements of Criminal
Code —Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 423(2)(a), 423(3) [as amended by
1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s. 36], 463, 510, 512.

Mandamus—Preliminary inquiry—Motion to quash
indictment allowed by the justice of the Peace—Error of law amounting to
refusal to exercise jurisdiction—Basis for mandamus.

Appellant was charged with conspiring to
cause persons to enter the United States unlawfully. At the preliminary inquiry, he moved immediately to
quash the indictment on the ground that the information did not allege an
offence known to Canadian law. This motion was allowed, but the Superior Court
reversed the decision and ordered that a writ of mandamus be issued directing
the judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace to go forward with the
preliminary inquiry. The appeal by appellant to the Court of Appeal was
dismissed.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The prerequisite for applying the presumption
of s. 423(3)  Cr.C ., in light of s. 423(2) (a) Cr.C .,
is that the object of the conspiracy should constitute an unlawful purpose both
in Canada and in the country
where the conspirators intend to carry it out. The essence of the

[Page 574]

crime in the case at bar is conspiracy to
effect unlawful entry, a crime which exists both in Canada and in the United States. As a consequence of the presumption of s. 423(3) , the
conspirators are deemed to have conspired to commit the offence in Canada. As regards the validity of the
information, its wording meets the requirements of the law in this area (ss.
510 , 512  Cr.C .).

Under s. 463 Cr.C ., the justice
before whom an accused is charged must inquire into the charge. When, as in the
case at bar, he quashes the information by making a fundamental error of law,
this amounts to refusing to exercise his jurisdiction and will be a basis for
mandamus.

that a writ of mandamus be issued. Appeal dismissed.

Attorney General of Quebec.

English version of the judgment of the Court
delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—The information which is the object
of this appeal is based on subs. (3) of s. 423  of the Criminal Code .

Subsection (3) was added by s. 36 of
the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93. Subsections (4), (5) and
(6) were added at the same time. These new provisions became effective by
proclamation on April 26, 1976. For purposes of clarification it is best that
they be reproduced in full:

[Page 575]

423. (1) …

(2) …

(3) Every one who, while in Canada, conspires with any one to do
anything referred to in subsection (1) or (2) in a place outside Canada that is an offence under the laws of
that place shall be deemed to have conspired to do in Canada that thing.

(4) Every one who, while in a place outside
Canada, conspires with any one
to do anything referred to in subsection (1) or (2) in Canada shall be deemed to have conspired in
Canada to do that thing.

(5) Where a person has conspired to do
anything that is an offence by virtue of subsection (3) or (4), the
offence is within the competence of and may be tried and punished by the court
having similar jurisdiction in respect of similar offences in the territorial division
where he is found in the same manner as if the offence had been committed in
that territorial division.

(6) Where, as a result of a conspiracy that
is an offence by virtue of subsection (3) or (4), a person has been tried
and convicted or acquitted outside Canada, he shall be deemed to have been tried and convicted or acquitted,
as the case may be, in Canada.

The information of July 5, 1978 reads:

[TRANSLATION] Between 29-4-78 and 17-6-78
Mr. Gérard BOLDUC conspired with Jagdat BABOOLAL and other persons as yet
unknown to commit in the United States of America an unlawful act, to wit,
causing persons to come into the United States of America unlawfully, the whole
contrary to the American Immigration and Naturalization Act and the Canadian
Criminal Code, in particular ss. 423(2) (a) and 423(3)  of the Criminal Code .

Appellant elected trial by a judge and jury.

On the day fixed for the preliminary inquiry,
appellant immediately made a motion to quash, on the ground that the
information did not allege an offence known to Canadian law.

In a very detailed judgment dated December 12,
1978, [1979] C.S.P. 1001, a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace allowed
the motion and quashed the “indictment”.

The Attorney General of Quebec, who is the
respondent for the purposes of this appeal, filed in the Superior Court
(criminal side) a motion asking that this decision be reversed and a writ of
mandamus be issued.

[Page 576]

In his judgment of May 16, 1979 the Superior Court judge first
ruled that mandamus is the correct remedy. He went on to find that a motion to
quash the information could not be made at the stage of the preliminary
inquiry: it should wait until the trial of the issue. He accordingly ruled in
favour of respondent on this ground. Although it was not then necessary for him
to do so, the judge nevertheless ruled on the question of substance and
expressed the view that the offence charged is an offence known to Canadian
law. He proceeded to quash the decision of the judge of the Court of Sessions
of the Peace and ordered that a writ of mandamus be issued directing the judge
to go forward with the preliminary inquiry.

The appeal to the Court of Appeal of Quebec was dismissed unanimously.

In support of his appeal to this Court,
appellant put forward three arguments which may be summarized as follows:

1. The information neither sets forth an offence
known to Canadian law nor an offence contemplated by subs. (3) of s. 423  Cr.C .;

2. The information is void in that it does not
meet the requirements of s. 510  Cr.C .;

3. There is no basis for a mandamus against a
decision of the judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace to quash the
information.

1. The information does not set forth an
offence known to Canadian law nor an offence contemplated by subs. (3) of
s. 423  Cr.C .

On this point appellant submitted, if I
understood correctly, two propositions:

(a) The information does not set forth an
offence known to Canadian law;

(b) The offence described in the information is
not the type of offence contemplated by subs. (3) of s. 423  Cr.C .

At the hearing counsel for the appellant
presented these two propositions as two separate arguments. As however
appellant dealt with them under the same heading in his factum, and if either
is allowed the result is the same, namely to quash

[Page 577]

the information, I will deal with them as two
propositions in support of the same argument, though I will treat the second
proposition as an alternative to the first.

The offence charged here is the so-called
“common law” conspiracy referred to in s. 423(2) (a) Cr.C : “Every
one who conspires with any one (a) to effect an unlawful purpose”.

In Gralewicz et al. v. The Queen, [1980]
2 S.C.R. 493, a majority of this Court held that “in 423(2)(a) unlawful
purpose means contrary to law, that is prohibited by federal or provincial
legislation”.

In the case at bar, the unlawful act stated in
the information is [TRANSLATION] “causing persons to come into the United
States of America unlawfully…”. The information adds “the whole contrary to the
American Immigration and Naturalization Act and the Canadian Criminal Code, in
particular ss. 423(2) (a) and 423(3)  of the Criminal Code .” [sic]

This is where the new subs. 423(3), comes in,
and it needs to be reproduced again:

(3) Every one who, while in Canada, conspires
with any one to do anything referred to in sub- section (1) or (2) in a
place outside Canada that is an offence under the laws of that place shall be
deemed to have conspired to do in Canada that thing.

It is apparent on its face that this
subsection does not create an offence. It creates a presumption of
territoriality so as to make the conspiracy an offence punishable in Canada.
Where, as in the case at bar, persons conspire in Canada to effect an unlawful
purpose in the United States, which would not in itself be an offence
punishable in Canada, they “shall be deemed to have conspired to do in
Canada that thing”. The result is to introduce the essential aspect which would
otherwise be absent, and to make the offence punishable in Canada.

Subsection (2) of s. 5  Cr.C . provides
as follows:

[Page 578]

(2) Subject to this Act or any other Act of
the Parliament of Canada, no person shall be convicted in Canada for an offence
committed outside of Canada.

In principle, therefore, a crime committed
abroad is not punishable in Canada. A crime committed abroad will be punishable
in Canada only in exceptional cases and as a result of the reservation
contained in s. 5(2) above.

There are a number of these exceptions in the Criminal
Code . Thus, in the case of piracy under s. 75 :

75. (1)
Every one commits piracy who does any act that, by the law of nations, is
piracy.

(2) Every one who commits piracy while in
or out of Canada is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for life.

The same is true of offences committed on
aircraft (s. 6(1.1) , 6(3) , 6(7)  Cr.C .), certain offences committed
abroad by public service employees (s. 6(2)  Cr.C .), treason (s. 46(3)  Cr.C .),
the obtaining of passports (s. 58  Cr.C .), bigamy (s. 254  Cr.C .)
and possession of stolen property (s. 312  Cr.C .).

A conspiracy in Canada to commit one of the
listed offences abroad would be punishable in Canada. So would a conspiracy to
commit murder or to cause another person to be murdered abroad, in view of
s. 423(1) (a) Cr.C ., which provides for this specific case.
However, appellant submitted that this is not true for conspiracy to commit
abroad an offence which is not the subject of an exception. Appellant relied on
the decision of the House of Lords on October 2, 1956 in Board of Trade v.
Owen and Seth-Smith (1957), 41 Cr. App.R. 11 , and he cited the following
passage from the Lord Chief Justice at pp. 19 and 20:

Now, clearly if two Englishmen commit a
burglary in France, they cannot be indicted for that crime in England. It would
certainly seem illogical to hold that by agreeing to go to France to commit the
offence they are guilty of a crime against our laws. But there are certain acts
which by statute are crimes punishable in England

[Page 579]

wherever committed. Instances are murder, bigamy,
offences against the Foreign Enlistment Act , 1870, the Official Secrets Acts
and the Merchant Shipping Acts. The statutory exceptions are all collected on
pp. 29 et seq. of Archbold, 33rd ed. In our opinion, the true rule is
that a conspiracy to commit a crime abroad is not indictable in this country
unless the contemplated crime is one for which an indictment would lie here.

However, this decision preceded the adoption of
s. 423(3) , and assuming that it was in keeping with Canadian law at the
time, it cannot be used to interpret the new provision of the Code.

The parties admitted that the prerequisite for
applying the presumption of s. 423(3)  in light of s. 423(2) (a)
is that the object of the conspiracy should constitute an unlawful purpose
both in Canada and in the country where the conspirators intend to carry it
out. The lower courts are unanimous on this point.

It is common ground that the unlawful entry of
persons into Canada constitutes an offence under the Immigration Act, 1976, 1976-77
(Can.), c. 52, s. 95. Although there is as yet no evidence of this, since
no evidence has yet been presented at the preliminary inquiry, appellant
admitted for the purposes of the appeal that the unlawful entry of persons into
the United States constitutes an offence under the American “Immigration and
Naturalization Act”.

The difference between the parties lies in the
fact that, in the submission of appellant, for there to be what counsel for the
respondent called identity of offences, unlawful entry into the United States
itself would have to constitute an offence in Canada. In other words, there
would have to be a Canadian statutory provision specifically providing that
unlawful entry into the United States constitutes an offence in Canada.
Respondent argued, on the contrary, that the essence of the offence is unlawful
entry, regardless of the country. Thus, in his submission, unlawful entry into
the United States constitutes an offence in the United States and the
corresponding offence in Canada is unlawful entry into Canada.

[Page 580]

For my part, I favour the interpretation of
respondent, but I would point out that the comparison must be not so much
between the names of the offences, which may vary, but more between their
essential elements. It is possible, for example, that what constitutes the
unlawful sale of alcoholic beverages in a given country will not necessarily
constitute unlawful sale in Canada. The identity of offences must be understood
as identity of their essential elements, so that the act, if committed in
Canada, would constitute an offence in Canada. There is no problem in this
respect in the case at bar, as for the purposes of this appeal, but for the
purposes of this appeal only, the identity of the offences is admitted.

In my opinion, respondent’s interpretation
represents precisely what was intended by the presumption of subs. (3) of
s. 423 . The persons are deemed to have conspired to commit the offences in
Canada. When applied to the circumstances here, this means that persons who have
conspired to cause others to come into the United States unlawfully are deemed
to have conspired to cause persons to come into Canada unlawfully.

Appellant submitted in this regard that a
distinction should be made between an offence like that before the Court and an
offence like, for example, robbery, which constitutes an offence in itself
without it being in any way necessary to relate it to a particular country. He
argued that robbery is still an offence, whether in New York or Toronto, in the
United States or in Canada: whereas unlawful entry must be related to the
country, and thus unlawful entry under American law is unlawful entry into the
United States.

In my view this distinction is in error. It is
only the nature of the offence which requires that it be described in terms of
the country, and apart from the exceptions which we have seen such as piracy,
in which an offence committed in another country constitutes an offence
punishable in Canada, an offence is always created in Canada in terms of its
territory. When the Criminal Code  makes robbery an offence it refers to
robbery committed in Canada, and not robbery committed in New York: however, it
is not necessary to say this in every case, because it is self-evident and is
in keeping

[Page 581]

with subs. (2) of s. 5 of the Code. It
is more difficult to describe unlawful entry without reference to the country,
but even at that and although it is not necessary to decide the point, if
s. 95 of the Immigration Act, 1976 (supra) contained only
the word “comes” without adding “into Canada”, it would read badly, but I am
inclined to think that as a consequence of subs. (2) of s. 5  it would
nonetheless mean “comes into Canada”. Section 95(a) reads:

95. Every
person who

(a) comes into Canada at any
place other than a port of entry and fails to report to an immigration officer
for examination as required by subsection 12(1),

Appellant further argued that the information
itself states the offence as “causing persons to come into the United States of
America unlawfully…”. To this, respondent replied that this statement is not an
essential component of the offence: it is only a detail, a statement of fact.
The offence charged is common law conspiracy committed in Canada, to effect an
unlawful purpose. Causing persons to enter the United States unlawfully
constitutes an offence under American law, just as causing persons to come into
Canada unlawfully constitutes an offence under Canadian law. As a consequence
of the presumption of s. 423(3) , the conspirators are deemed to have
conspired to commit the offence in Canada. It is as if they had conspired to
cause persons to come into Canada unlawfully.

To conclude discussion of this point, I adopt
the following passage from Bisson J. of the Superior Court, as he then was,
cited with approval in the reasons of Owen J.A. of the Court of Appeal:

[TRANSLATION]Does the information disclose
a crime which is known, in the sense that it contains the essential elements of
a criminal offence in Canada as well as in the United States of America?

It is admitted for these purposes that
unlawful entry of persons into the U.S.A. is an offence.

[Page 582]

The essential elements of the information
under consideration are conspiracy in Canada to effect this unlawful purpose of
causing persons to come into another country unlawfully.

It is clear that unlawful entry into the
U.S.A. is not a crime in Canada, any more than the crime of kidnapping a
citizen in New York could be tried in Canada.

However, if a person conspires in Canada to
kidnap someone in New York, a crime is committed here, since kidnapping is as
much an offence in Canada as in the United States, and the essence of the crime
is the conspiracy to kidnap.

In the same way, a conspiracy in Canada to
cause persons to enter the U.S.A. unlawfully may be prosecuted as a crime in
Canada, since the essence of the crime is conspiracy to effect unlawful entry,
a crime which exists both in Canada and in the U.S.A.

Alternatively, appellant submitted, as his
second proposition, that the offence charged is not the type of offence
contemplated by s. 423(3) .

I do not think it is necessary to go into all
the details of the argument made in support of this proposition. In short, in
the appellant’s submission what the legislator had in mind was offences which
constitute a malum in se, and not a malum prohibitum; these are
serious international crimes, inter alia crimes such as skyjacking,
international terrorism and kidnapping. Appellant relied primarily on the
following extract which he said was from the “codifier’s report” on the bill
which introduced s. 423(3) , (4) , (5)  and (6) :

In light of the ever increasing
international nature of criminal activity, it is desirable and in the interest
of Comity of Nations, that Canada should discourage International criminals
from using its territory as a basis for planning criminal acts in other
Countries. Conversely, it is desirable that Canada should deter International
criminals from conspiring abroad to commit offences in Canada.

The proposed amendments are designed to
achieve these twin objectives. In the first case where persons conspiring in
Canada to commit crimes in another State, the amendment proposes as a basis for
the assertion of jurisdiction that the acts agreed to be done must constitute
an offence both by the law of the State in which they are agreed to be done and
by the law of Canada.

[Page 583]

Nothing in this passage has the effect of
categorizing the type of offence contemplated. Further, without ruling on the
merits, because that is not at issue here, creating a system in Canada for
bringing persons into the United States unlawfully would seem to me to
constitute a definite manifestation of international activities of dubious
legality. In any case, nothing in the wording of s. 423(3)  or in the other
subsections adopted at the same time justifies the proposition submitted
by appellant, which in my opinion is without foundation.

2. The validity of the information

In his factum, appellant argued that the
information was insufficient in light of s. 510  Cr.C ., and asked
that it be quashed on this ground.

This argument was not made in any of the lower
courts, and their judgments are consequently silent on the point.

It should also be noted that counsel for the
appellant did not deal with this argument at the hearing; but it must be
disposed of nevertheless.

In opposition to this argument, respondent
submitted that the judge at the preliminary inquiry had no jurisdiction to
quash an information, because it was not in accordance with s. 510  Cr.C .
Alternatively, respondent submitted that the information as worded met the
requirements of the Code.

On the first point, respondent acknowledged that
a judge at a preliminary inquiry has the power to determine whether the
information [TRANSLATION] “charges the accused with committing an indictable
offence, because the mention of an indictable offence in an information is a
condition precedent to the exercise of his jurisdiction”. Respondent agreed in
this respect with the Court of Appeal, which so held.

[TRANSLATION] “But”, the respondent went on, “we
submit that acknowledgment of this jurisdiction does not at the same time imply
acknowledging a power to quash an information the wording of which is not in
accordance with the provisions of ss. 510  and 512  of the Criminal Code ”. As I
mentioned, this question was not submitted to the

[Page 584]

Court of Appeal, since the sufficiency of the
information was only raised in this Court.

Can the relevant provisions of Part XVII of the Code
be in any way applied to the preliminary inquiry (Part XV), or can a motion
to quash of this type only be admitted at trial? This question has not been
finally resolved, but I do not think that the case at bar is a suitable context
in which to resolve it. The question is not directly presented: the judge of
Sessions of the Peace did not quash the information for insufficiency. He was
not even asked to do so. In my view it would be better to wait for a case in
which the question was raised at the outset, not simply once it had got as far
as the Supreme Court. Support is lent to this view by the fact that even if the
information could be quashed at the preliminary inquiry by applying ss. 510 ,
512 , and 529 , in the case at bar the information is not defective.

More specifically, in his submission appellant
argued that the information should contain a reference to the specific
section or sections of the American “Immigration and
Naturalization Act”, a reference to the specific section or
sections of the Canadian Immigration Act, 1976 (supra) which
would have been infringed if the offence had been committed in Canada, and a
mention of the names of the other co-conspirators.

Counsel for the respondent based his opposing
argument primarily on a decision of this Court in R. v. Côté, [1978] 1
S.C.R. 8, in which, speaking for the Court, de Grandpré J. said at p. 13:

…the golden rule is for the accused to be
reasonably informed of the transaction alleged against him, thus giving him the
possibility of a full defence and a fair trial. When, as in the present case, the
information recites all the facts and relates them to a definite offence
identified by the relevant section of the Code, it is impossible
for the accused to be misled. To hold otherwise would be to revert to the
extreme technicality of the old procedure.

Reference may also be made to the decision of
this Court in Brodie and Barrett v. The King, [1936] S.C.R. 188, in
which Rinfret J., as he then was, speaking for the Court, analysed s. 852  Cr.C .,
which later became s. 510  without substantial

[Page 585]

alteration. Rinfret J. observed, inter alia, at
pp. 193-94:

If section 852 be analysed, it will be
noticed the imperative requirement (“shall contain”) is that there must be a
statement that the accused has committed an indictable offence; and such
offence must be “specified”. It will be sufficient if the substance of the
offence is stated; but every count must contain such statement “in substance”.
In our view, this does not mean merely classifying or characterizing the
offence; it calls for the necessity of specifying time, place and matter
(Compare dictum of Channel, J., in Smith v. Moody, [1903] 1 K.B. 56, at
63), of stating the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence.

The manner of stating the matter is of no
absolute importance, in view of subsections 2 and 3. The statement may be
made in popular language, without any technical averments or allegations; or it
may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the
matter charged to be an indictable offence; but we think the latter parts of
subsections 2 and 3 are indicative of the intention of Parliament: the
statement must contain the allegations of matter “essential to be proved”, and
must be in “words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with
which he is charged.” Those are the very words of the section; and they were
put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its main objects
being that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that the
indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable precision the act or acts
with which he is charged, in order that he may be advised of the particular
offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.

In the case at bar, the offence charged is the
so-called “common law” conspiracy, and the information refers to the specific
provision of the Criminal Code , s. 423(2) (a). The offence is
described in the actual wording of the Code and the circumstances
relating to its commission are stated. The information indicates the substance
of the offence and the time, place and facts constituting the offence. I
therefore agree with the contention of respondent:

[TRANSLATION] …that in specifying the place
of the conspiracy, the date of that conspiracy, the name of a co-conspirator,
the place of the unlawful purpose, the nature of the unlawful purpose, the
reference to the section creating the offence and even a reference to the

[Page 586]

section creating the presumption as to
extra-territoriality, respondent met the requirements of the law in this matter
by reasonably informing appellant of the offence with which he was charged and
so affording him an opportunity for a complete defence.

Counsel for the respondent further stated with
regard to the names of the co-conspirators that one of them is mentioned in the
information and [TRANSLATION] “if the others are not mentioned, this is because
they are not known”.

Moreover, the decisions cited by appellant are
not conclusive, in my opinion. In R. v. Giguère (1963), 41 C.R. 308, the
accused was acquitted after trial for lack of evidence of conspiracy with the
only co-conspirator named. In the case at bar, we are not yet even at the stage
of hearing evidence. In R. v. Tremblay et al (1961), 40 C.R. 382, the
accused were acquitted after trial because there was no evidence that the
offence had been committed in Calgary as alleged, or even near that city. In R.
v. Uvery, [1969] 2 C.C.C. 305, the accused was acquitted on appeal because
evidence was not presented of commission of the offence at the place alleged,
Prince Albert, or even anywhere in Saskatchewan. In R. v. McNab (1945),
83 C.C.C. 76, the accused, who was charged with uttering a forged cheque,
was acquitted on appeal because the evidence showed that the cheque was good
and it was the endorsement which was forged.

3. The mandamus

Finally, appellant submitted that the quashing
of the information by the trial judge cannot be a basis for a writ of mandamus.

It was common ground that the trial judge’s
decision is not appealable, but counsel for the appellant submitted that “The
fact that the Justice’s decision was not appealable, does not necessarily mean
that a writ of mandamus should or must lie.”

Respondent relied on the majority decision of
this Court in Kipp v. Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario, [1965]
S.C.R. 57, which in my opinion is conclusive. Appellant sought to show that
this case does not apply in the circumstances

[Page 587]

of the case at bar, but with respect this
proposition cannot be supported, and I will discuss this below.

In Kipp the accused, after the indictment
was read at the trial, but before a plea had been entered, made a motion to
quash on the ground that the indictment applied to more than one case. The
judge allowed the motion. On a motion by the Crown, Grant J. of the High Court
of Ontario reversed the decision of the county court judge and by mandamus
ordered him to proceed. The Court of Appeal of Ontario and this Court affirmed
the judgment of the High Court.

Judson J., speaking for the majority, commenting
on the cases cited by the accused, in particular R. v. Justices of Middlesex
(1877), 2 Q.B.D. 516, on which appellant relied in the case at bar, wrote
at pp. 60-61:

The cases merely hold that such decisions
are not reviewable by way of mandamus. They do not touch the problem in the
present case where an indictment is quashed before plea and no trial is held.
All that the Crown is seeking is an order directing the County Court Judge to
proceed with the trial. If he proceeds with the trial and gives a decision,
that decision is open to appeal and is not reviewable on mandamus. But he can
be compelled to give a decision on the merits and it is no answer to such an
application to say that he has exercised his jurisdiction in quashing the
indictment and that such a decision cannot be reviewed.

The use of the word “jurisdiction” in this
context does not help one towards a solution. There is no dispute that the
judge had the power to deal with the form of the indictment and that he was
acting within his jurisdiction when he quashed the indictment. But he made an
error in quashing this indictment. He was there to try the charge. As the
matter stands now, unless the order of mandamus issues, the case as framed
cannot be tried and it should be so tried. It is proper, in the circumstances,
to issue the writ of mandamus.

The only distinction suggested by appellant
between Kipp and the case at bar is that in the first case the
proceeding was at the trial stage, whereas here it was only at the stage of a
preliminary inquiry.

[Page 588]

I do not see how this changes the position.
Under s. 463 Cr.C . the justice before whom an accused is charged
must inquire into the charge. When, as in the case at bar, he quashes the
information by making a fundamental error of law, this amounts to refusing to
exercise his jurisdiction and will be a basis for mandamus.

Appellant cited the decision of this Court in R.
v. Sheets, [1971] S.C.R. 614, which is in no way relevant. That case
concerned not mandamus but an appeal. This Court held that in the circumstances
the trial judgment constituted a judgment on the merits and the provisions
relating to appeal applied.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Voluntariness and admissibility
of a confession—Accused making two statements two months apart—First statement
ruled inadmissible—Whether second statement admissible.

At a trial by judge and jury, appellant was
convicted of arson. On the voir dire, the trial judge ruled that the
appellant’s statement, made to persons in authority on January 18, 1978, was
admissible and had not been tainted by the prior inadmissible statement of
November 24, 1977—one whose voluntary nature had not been established
beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge also rejected appellant’s
contentions that the statements were obtained in an oppressive atmosphere or through
any inducement or threats. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

While accused’s state of mind is relevant to
the admissibility of a statement made by him to persons in authority, his own
timidity or subjective fear of the police will not render a statement
inadmissible unless there are external circumstances brought about by the
conduct of the police to justify doubt as to voluntariness. In addition, there
is no presumption of tainting merely because a prior statement had been ruled
inadmissible. Factual considerations must govern, including similarity of
circumstances, police conduct and the lapse of time between the obtaining of
the two statements. There was no reason to interfere with the decision of the
trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal admitting the second
statement.

Appeal dismissed.

Gerald R. Kluwak, for the appellant.

Murray D. Segal, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is an appeal by the
accused from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal which by a majority (MacKinnon A.C.J.O., Howland
C.J.O. concurring) affirmed a conviction of arson after trial by a judge and
jury. Brooke J.A., dissenting, would have ordered a new trial. The accused was
sixteen years old at the time of the offence charged against him. Without
enlarging on his criminal record, it is enough to say that the present case was
not his first encounter with the police.

Despite the dissent of Brooke J.A., leave to
appeal was sought and given, apparently because there was no specification or
certainty of the point of law on which the dissent proceeded. In his majority
reasons, MacKinnon A.C.J.O. said that the sole issue in appeal was whether a
second statement made by the accused to the police on January 18, 1978 was
wrongly admitted. The ground of objection to admissibility was that the
statement was tainted because an earlier statement made on November 24, 1977 was ruled inadmissible because
in the circumstances recited by the trial judge, the Crown failed to satisfy
him that it had proved voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt. It was alleged
here that there was a continuing taint which, notwithstanding the lapse of time
between the two statements, adversely affected the admissibility of the second
statement. I shall come to this submission shortly.

[Page 555]

The trial judge had held on the voir dire on
admissibility that neither statement was obtained through any inducement or
threats or worse and these findings were confirmed in the majority reasons and,
indeed, were not challenged in the dissent. The dissent proceeded on another
ground which, to put it generally, was oppressive treatment of the accused or
police conduct which had that effect upon him. The accused testified at the voir
dire but did not give evidence at his trial proper.

Although MacKinnon A.C.J.O. specified a i single
issue only as being involved in the appeal, counsel for the accused argued
another point in this Court. It was that the trial judge had failed on the voir
dire to address the question, said to be raised by the evidence, whether
the accused subjectively was not in a state of fear indicated, inter alia, by
his expressed unwillingness to accompany the police officers for interrogation
in respect of the second statement. The accused had been convicted of another
charge before being tried for arson, and it was when he was in gaol on that
charge that the police (the same two who had taken his first statement) removed
him to the central police station pursuant to a so-called warrant of
deliverance, issued improperly by a justice of the peace but in accordance with
a practice followed at the time but now discontinued. Brooke J.A. in his
dissent dwelt on this impropriety.

I have nothing to add to the comprehensive
reasons of MacKinnon A.C.J.O. which, in my opinion, are dispositive of the
appeal, limited as it is in this Court to questions of law. Brooke J.A.
asserted that there was “a fundamental factual issue in evidence relating to
the taking of the second statement” and that this made it wrong to say that the
Crown had met the onus of proof of voluntariness. Although it was open to the
Court of Appeal to dispute a factual consideration, this Court does not have
that leeway. What affected

[Page 556]

Brooke J.A. was that the accused had been put in
a locked room on the occasion of the taking of each of the two statements; that
he had not been charged until the second statement was taken. He did not wish
to go with the police on either occasion. His rights were consequently ignored
and there was oppression or coercion in this which should have persuaded the
trial judge not to admit the second statement.

The trial judge dealt with this matter adversely
to the accused as did MacKinnon A.C.J.O., and I do not find any reason to
quarrel with their determination, even if it be considered to involve a
question of law alone. However, factual differences are evident in the two
situations and it was for the courts below to assess and weigh the facts.

I should like, however, to consider briefly the
two points raised here as to subjectivity and tainting. The subjectivity point
is based on a contention of counsel for the accused that the trial judge
fastened on the propriety of the conduct of the police rather than on the
effect that their conduct and, indeed, the entire surrounding circumstances had
on the mind of the accused. The contention, in short, was that the first
confession was held to be inadmissible not because there was an inducement or
threat, but rather because obtained in an atmosphere of oppression or coercion.
The tainting point is simply that the circumstances surrounding the second
confession were similar to those surrounding the first and the oppression
continued to operate upon the accused so as to taint that confession.

There is no doubt that the state of mind of the
accused is relevant to the admissibility of a statement made by him to the
police after interrogation, and even if he has been cautioned, as was the case
here in respect of the second statement. An atmosphere of oppression may be
created in the

[Page 557]

circumstances surrounding the taking of a
statement, although there be no inducement held out of hope of advantage or
fear of prejudice, and absent any threats of violence or actual violence.
However, and counsel for the appellant accused conceded this, an accused’s own
timidity or subjective fear of the police will not avail to avoid the
admissibility of a statement or confession unless there are external
circumstances brought about by the conduct of the police that can be said to
cast doubt on the voluntariness of a statement or confession by the accused or
there are considerations affecting the accused, as in the Ward case,
infra, which would justify doubt as to voluntariness. In this respect, it
does not, of course, matter that the police did not commit any illegality if
the circumstances of the interrogation, including time and place and length of
interrogation, raise or should raise doubt in the trial judge whether the
statement or confession was freely and voluntarily given.

There is no need to canvass any of the numerous
authorities which were put before us, most of which were canvassed by the Court
of Appeal. Mention may be made of R. v. Precourt (1976), 39 C.C.C. (2d)
311 which the trial judge considered and distinguished; Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Ping Lin, [1975] 3 All E.R. 175; Ward v. The Queen, [1979]
2 S.C.R. 30; Horvath v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 376 and Rothman
v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640. The trial judge rejected contentions on
behalf of the accused and the evidence of the accused on the voir dire designed
to show oppressiveness and coercion, and the careful canvass of the issue by
MacKinnon A.C.J.O. makes it clear that there was no factual foundation to
support the challenge to the admissibility of the second statement.

The tainting contention advanced here has been
but peripherally considered in this Court. Estey J. adverted to it in Boudreau
v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262, at pp. 285-86 and his observations were
referred to by Beetz J. in Horvath v. The

[Page 558]

Queen, supra, at
p. 429. The latter emphasized the prime importance of the time interval between
the two statements. Certainly here there was a considerable time lag, enough to
dissipate any lingering effect of the first statement, and the circumstances in
which and under which it was made, upon the second statement. There was no
advertence to the first statement when the second one was taken. The accused
knew at the time that the police had additional evidence which prompted the
interrogation of January 18. I am not prepared in such a case as the present
one to declare that there is a presumption of tainting merely because the prior
statement had been ruled inadmissible, a ruling based on failure of
satisfactory proof by the Crown. In any event, since the Crown has the burden
of proof in respect of the admissibility of any statement taken by the police
from the accused, the suggested presumption could only go to the convincing
nature of the proof.

There can be no hard and fast rule that merely
because a prior statement is ruled inadmissible a second statement taken by the
same interrogating officers must be equally vulnerable. Factual considerations
must govern, including similarity of circumstances and of police conduct and
the lapse of time between the obtaining of the two statements. Here the trial
judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal found that different conclusions
were proper as to the admissibility of the two statements. I would not
interfere with their determination that the second statement was properly admitted.

I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Conspiracy to breach foreign
law—Indictment without reference to foreign law—Amendment refused—Non-suit for
want of evidence supporting indictment—Whether or not the Court of Appeal could
set acquittal aside, and direct trial to continue to enable defence to call
evidence or to close—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 423(1)(d), (3),
613(4).

The Crown wished to prove a conspiracy in Canada to engage in illegal arms shipments
out of the United States. The
indictment alleged conspiracies in violation of the Export and Import
Permits Act  and of s. 423(1) (d) of the Criminal Code ,
but made no mention of the alleged violation of U.S. law governing imports
from that country. The trial began May 9, 1979. On May 29, the Crown moved to
amend the indictment by adding a reference to the alleged breach of U.S. law and an alleged conspiracy in
respect of that breach so as to permit it to bring in s. 423(3)  which
provided for the extraterritorial reach of the offences created by
s. 423(1) (d). The trial judge dismissed this motion, and at
the close of the Crown’s case, allowed the accused’s motion for dismissal for
want of evidence supporting the indictment. The Court of Appeal set aside the
acquittal and directed that the trial continue to enable the defence to call
evidence or to close the case, and for final disposition.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz and Chouinard JJ.: The Court of Appeal is
without authority to amend an indictment by substituting a different offence
for the one charged in the indictment, especially

[Page 523]

where that was one of the grounds upon which
the trial judge refused to amend.

An order for a new trial under
s. 613(4)(b)(i) means an order for a full new trial, especially if
it is to proceed upon an amended indictment. Even if the Court of Appeal had
the power to substitute a new charge for the one laid, it is wrong for it to
force an accused to accept the Crown’s case as made under the unamended charge
and to direct the accused to put in its evidence. No court can predict the
possible course of cross-examination by accused’s counsel if the indictment
were in the form directed by the Court of Appeal.

Accused’s alleged co-conspirator was deported
prior to the appeal hearing. No court could guess how this would affect
appellant’s position, even at a full new trial on the amended indictment.

Per Mclntyre
and Lamer JJ.: The acquittal should be restored, because of the Crown having
deported the co-accused and because, considering the cumulation of unfortunate
procedural events, ordering a new trial would amount to a miscarriage of
justice.

[Page 524]

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie,
Dickson, Beetz and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—There are oddities about this
case that persuade me that the order of the Manitoba Court of Appeal should be
set aside and that the acquittal directed by the trial judge should be
restored. An agreed statement of facts highlighted the basis of the criminal
proceedings taken against the appellant and other alleged co-conspirators.

What the Crown wished to prove was that there
was a conspiracy in Canada to engage in illegal arms shipments out of the
United States, it being also an offence under Canadian law to export arms from
Canada without an export permit. A then newly enacted provision of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 423(3), which came into force in 1976,
provided the basis for the extraterritorial reach of the offences created by Criminal
Code , s. 423(1) (d). The charges laid here were (the Court was
told) the first to invoke s. 423(3) . This provision is also involved, in
association with s. 423(2) , in another appeal recently heard in this
Court, Bolduc v. The Queen, in which judgment was reserved on February
16, 1982.

The Crown began proceedings in the present case
by laying two informations for conspiracy against the accused and two named
co-conspirators, also naming a number of unindicted co‑conspirators.
Nothing turns on these informations which appeared to be in conformity with ss.
423(1) (d) and 423(3). There was a committal for trial after a
preliminary hearing and then an indictment was preferred against the accused
and one of the two alleged co-conspirators named in the informations. The
indictment alleged conspiracies in violation of the Export and Import
Permits Act , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 27, contrary to Criminal Code , s.
423(1) (d). No mention was made of the alleged violation of United
States law governing export of arms from that country.

[Page 525]

Criminal Code , ss.
423(1) (d) and 423(3)  read as follows:

423. (1)
Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the following provisions
apply in respect of conspiracy, namely,

…

(d) every one who conspires
with any one to commit an indictable offence not provided for in paragraph (a),
(b) or (c) is guilty of an indictable offence and
is liable to the same punishment as that to which an accused who is guilty of
that offence would, upon conviction, be liable.

(3) Every one who, while in Canada,
conspires with any one to do anything referred to in subsection (1) or (2)
in a place outside Canada that is an offence under the laws of that place shall
be deemed to have conspired to do in Canada that thing.

The informations had been laid on March 22, 1978
and the indictments were preferred on February 15, 1979. A motion to quash the
indictment was made on the ground, inter alia, that no preliminary
hearing had been held on the charges now contained in the indictment, as
contrasted with those in the information. Kennedy Co. Ct. J., refused to quash,
saying this in his reasons:

The indictment before me presumes a breach
of Canadian law, and I have no difficulty in finding that the evidence adduced
at the preliminary hearing meets the requirements of Section 496. The
indictment relates to offences disclosed by that evidence, and are in substitution
for the offence for which the accused was committed for trial.

…

I have no doubt, either, that, from
reviewing the preliminary evidence, as I was invited, indeed, urged to do by
defence counsel, that the accused have not suffered any prejudice, or are
unable to meet the allegations contained in the indictment by claiming to have
been surprised or in any way misled.

On May 29, 1979, the Crown moved to amend the
indictment by adding a reference to an alleged violation of United States law
and an alleged conspiracy in respect thereof so as to permit it to

[Page 526]

bring in s. 423(3) . Leave to amend was
refused after a consideration of the amending power given by Criminal Code , s.
529 . The trial judge said this, in the course of his reasons for refusing to
amend:

I am of the view that the amendment is not
to cure a variance between the evidence at trial and the charge. If anything
the amendment seeks once again in my view to restore the original Information,
although in somewhat different terminology. In that respect I have already
ruled that the two charges were different and the Indictment before me is in
substitution for the original Information laid prior to the preliminary hearing
and upon which the accused were indicted. To include reference at this stage of
the trial to the U.S. as being the place in which the substantive offence was
committed and to allege a breach of American law, which I might add could only
refer to Title 22, being a derivative of the American U.S. Neutrality Act is to
add in my view a new dimension and component. This is not to suggest that the
accused would be taken by surprise. Given the position of the Crown and the
earlier argument the proposed amendment contains an averment that the Crown had
every opportunity from the preliminary to the present to consider and it
apparently chose not to introduce it until this late hour.

And, again, after referring to s. 529(2),
(3) and (4):

(a) the evidence at the preliminary hearing
did not disclose anything materially different than the trial evidence, and on
the basis of the preliminary evidence the Crown sought to substitute this
Indictment.

(b) the trial evidence could not be said to
have occasioned the amendment since there was no new disclosures upon which the
Crown might argue warranted the amendment.

(c) I have already commented that given the
various intervening rulings on the Indictment this case is not one where new
facts or evidence urge what may amount to a review, if not res judicata, on the
preliminary motion.

(d) given the Crown’s position as to the
sufficiency of the Indictment and my earlier ruling, I am of the view

[Page 527]

that the accused has been misled and
perhaps prejudiced.

At the close of the Crown’s case, counsel for
the accused moved, on June 4, 1979, for a dismissal on the ground that there
was no evidence to support the indictment. The motion was granted, the trial
judge holding that the deeming provisions of s. 423(3)  did not apply. The
Crown appealed and, in reasons of the Manitoba Court of Appeal delivered by
Monnin J.A., it was held that the trial judge ought to have allowed the
amendment sought by the Crown “in order to comply with the evidence which was
on the record and to conform to the charges as originally laid”. (The formal
order of the Court of Appeal restored the charges as they were originally set
out in the informations.) The acquittal was set aside and the Court of Appeal
further directed that the trial continue before Kennedy Co. Ct. J. to enable
the defence to call evidence or close the case and for final disposition.
Monnin J.A. rejected the contention of prejudice to the accused when the trial
judge had refused the amendment, saying that nothing had happened between May
2, 1979 (when the accused moved unsuccessfully to quash the indictment) and May
29, 1979 when the trial judge refused to allow the Crown to amend. This,
however, ignores the fact, as forcibly pointed out by counsel for the appellant
in this Court, that the trial had begun on May 9, 1979 and the Crown had been
presenting evidence under the indictment as then framed.

Nowhere in the reasons of the Court of Appeal is
any reference made to any power that it has to amend an indictment by
substituting a different offence for the one charged in the indictment,
especially where that was one of the grounds upon which the trial judge refused
to amend. The weight of authority is against any such power: see, for example, R.
v. Kerr et al. (1922), 53 O.L.R. 228, at p. 231; Dupont v. The
Queen (1958), 123

[Page 528]

C.C.C. 386, at p. 390; R. v. Elliott, [1970]
3 C.C.C. 233, at p. 237. This Court considered the matter in Elliott v.
The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 393, where the same position against any power
in a court of appeal to substitute a new offence by amendment was asserted in
the dissenting judgment at p. 401 and implicitly approved in the majority
judgment, at pp. 426-27. The difference in the judgments was whether a new
offence was substituted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal (as the
dissenting reasons stated) or whether there was merely specification of a
particular of an offence already charged (as the majority reasons stated).

This aside, however, there is another defect in
the judgment appealed from. Criminal Code , s. 613(4)  deals with the
powers of a court of appeal upon an appeal from an acquittal. An order for a
new trial under s. 613(4) (b)(i) means an order for a full new
trial, especially if it is to proceed upon an amended indictment. In the
present case, even if the Court of Appeal has the power (and I do not think it
has) to substitute a new charge for the one laid, it is wrong for it to force
an accused to accept the Crown’s case as made under the unamended charge and to
direct the accused to put in its evidence. It is not for this Court or any
court to say what course counsel for the accused would have taken in the
cross-examination of Crown witnesses if the indictment had been in the form
directed by the Court of Appeal. There is a further problem here. The accused’s
alleged co-conspirator was deported from Canada some days before the appeal
hearing. Again, it is not for this or any court to guess how this would or
could affect the appellant’s position, even at a full new trial on the amended
indictment.

For all these reasons, the acquittal is
restored. This is not a case where this Court finds it neces-

[Page 529]

sary to give any direction in detail as to how a
charge of conspiracy involving breach of foreign criminal law, as envisaged by Criminal
Code , s. 423(3) , should be framed. It is enough to say that the statutory
fiction of a conspiracy in Canada in violation of foreign law can only become
operative if a breach of the foreign law is charged.

The reasons of Mclntyre and Lamer JJ. were
delivered by

LAMER J.—I have had the advantage of reading the
reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. I also would allow this appeal and
quash the order of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba directing that the trial
continue before Kennedy Co. Ct. J. to enable the defence to call evidence, if
it so wishes, and then determine the issue of guilt. Indeed, the Court of
Appeal was not empowered by law to make such an order as set out in the reasons
of the Chief Justice.

I also would order that the acquittal be
restored, but would predicate this finding on the fact that, in all
probability, considering the cumulation of unfortunate procedural events and
the fact that the Crown has since deported the alleged co-conspirator, to order
a new trial would amount to a miscarriage of justice. I therefore need not make
any comment as to the trial judge’s decision not to amend the indictment.
Furthermore, as s. 423(3)  is being considered by this Court in Bolduc
v. The Queen, I should prefer reserving for that decision any comment as to
how a charge of conspiracy involving a breach of foreign criminal law should be
framed.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Powers of Court of
Appeal—Information—Conviction of possession of goods obtained by crime—Crown
seeking to amend information at appellate level to conform to
evidence—Distinction between “obtained by the commission of an indictable
offence” and “derived directly or indirectly from the commission of an
indictable offence”—Conviction quashed and new trial ordered on the amended information—Whether
criminal appeal court can amend the information—Criminal Code , ss. 312(1) (a),
610(3) , 613(8) .

Accused was convicted of having in his
possession an outboard motor knowing it to have been “obtained by the
commission of an indictable offence”. On the accused’s appeal, the Crown sought
to have the information amended—to read “derived indirectly from” rather than
“obtained by”—to conform to the evidence and to affirm the conviction. As the
evidence did not support the charge, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal,
quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial on the amended information.

Held (McIntyre
and Lamer JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Chouinard JJ.: An
appellate court would require the clearest statutory basis to materially amend
the information and uphold a conviction based on the information as amended.
There was no such clear statutory basis in this case, but justice could be done
by following the course adopted by the Court of Appeal, i.e. to allow
the appeal (s. 613(1)(a)), order a new trial (s. 613(2)(b)) and
make any order that justice requires (s. 613(8) ), including an order directing
a new trial on the amended information. This procedure ensured that

[Page 486]

the accused is informed of the charge against
him before his trial commenced and provided him with a continuing opportunity
to meet the amended charge as the trial progresses.

Per McIntyre
and Lamer JJ., dissenting in part: While appellate courts may order a
new trial on an amended charge, they should not use their discretion to assist
the Crown in overcoming the effect of its prosecutorial shortcomings to the
detriment of the accused by ordering a second trial where the first has failed
solely through Crown’s error. The Crown’s failure to seek to cure the defect in
its information at trial should inure to the benefit of the accused.

trial on an amended information. Appeal dismissed, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.

W.J. Blacklock, for the appellant.

Marc Rosenberg, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought as of right
by the Attorney General for the Province of Ontario from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for that Province pursuant to the provisions of s. 621(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code  which read as follows:

621. (1)
Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an
appeal taken under section 603 or 604 or dismisses an appeal taken
pursuant to paragraph 605(1)(a) or subsection 605(3), the Attorney
General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question of law on
which a judge of the court of appeal dissents,…

The respondent was convicted at trial of the
offence that he

[Page 487]

…did have in his possession a 150
horsepower mercury outboard motor, of a value exceeding two hundred dollars,
knowing it to have been obtained by the commission in Canada of an indictable offence

CONTRARY TO SECTION 312
Subsection (a) OF THE CRIMINAL CODE.

(Emphasis is mine.)

The judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing the respondent’s appeal
from this conviction provided as follows:

THIS COURT DID ORDER that the said appeal
should be and the same was thereby allowed and that the Information should be
and the same was thereby amended, the conviction quashed and a new trial
directed on the amended Information.

The question of law upon which Mr. Justice
Jessup founded his dissent is expressed in the Notice of Appeal in the
following terms:

Did the majority of the Court of Appeal for
the Province of Ontario err in law in holding that it had no power, where there was a
variance between the evidence led at trial and the allegation contained in the
information, to amend the information to conform to the evidence, to affirm the
conviction and to dismiss the appeal?

The “variance between the evidence led at trial
and the allegation contained in the information” is founded on the conclusion
unanimously reached by the Court of Appeal that the evidence at trial did not
support a finding that the outboard motor which was found in the respondent’s
possession had been obtained by the commission of an indictable offence
but rather that it could, at worst, be said to have been “derived directly
or indirectly” from the commission in Canada of such an offence.

The distinction to be drawn between having
possession of something knowing it to have been obtained by the commission of an
indictable offence and having such possession knowing that the article was
derived directly or indirectly from the commission of such an offence is
illustrated by the following passage from the reasons for judgment rendered by
Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the case of R.v. MacKenzie

[Page 488]

released October 15, 1975. Mr. Justice
Martin there said:

We are all of the view that the word
‘obtained’ in the section, refers to things that constitute the subject-matter
of the crime by which they were obtained. For example, things obtained by
theft, false pretences or extortion. The offence must be committed in respect
of the thing obtained. Money, of course, constitutes ‘anything’ within the
meaning of section 312. Money, however, which has been knowingly and
voluntarily paid by a purchaser to a vendor, with respect to an illegal
transaction, which constitutes an indictable offence, is not ‘obtained’ by such
indictable offence within the meaning of section 312. The offence
committed in the offence of trafficking in a narcotic drug, or a controlled
drug, is not in respect of the property transferred as the consideration for
the illegal transaction, but against the public welfare, in the interests of
which the transaction is made criminal. The fact that money was derived from
the commission of a crime does not necessarily constitute an ‘obtaining’ of the
money by the crime, within the meaning of section 312.

This case was followed by the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93, s. 29 which reads:

312. (1)
Every one commits an offence who has in his possession any property or thing or
any proceeds of any property or thing knowing that all or part of the property
or thing or of the proceeds was obtained by or derived directly or indirectly
from

(a) the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by
indictment;…

The facts of this case are not seriously in
dispute and they are concisely summarized in the dissenting reasons for
judgment of Mr. Justice Jessup which were in this regard adopted by the
majority of the Court of Appeal. Mr. Justice Jessup there said [at p. 78]:

Three men entered into a conspiracy for two
of them to take the outboard motor from the third who was its owner and the
owner then falsely claimed against his insurer for loss by theft. The two who
had taken the motor sold it to the appellant and the learned trial Judge found
that the appellant knew of the scheme at the time of the sale.

[Page 489]

In fact the trial judge found that Geauvreau
knew how the outboard motor had been acquired at the time when he made the
purchase and moreover that he knew “exactly what the deal was”.

It was the submission of the Crown before the
Court of Appeal and before this Court that the information should be amended
“to allege that the appellant was in possession of an outboard motor knowing
that it was derived indirectly from the commission in Canada of an indictable
offence”, and it was further submitted that the Court of Appeal should affirm
the conviction based on the amended information. It is this submission which
gave rise to the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Jessup and it must in
my view be examined in light of the proposition stated by Mr. Justice
Zuber on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal [at p. 84]:

It is part of our law of criminal procedure
that a person accused of crime is entitled to know the charge against him,
whether contained in an information or an indictment, in reasonably specific
terms and he is tried on that charge. This principle retains its vitality even
though the formalism of an earlier era has been diminished and trial Courts now
possess reasonably wide powers of amendment. However, even though criminal
procedure has become less technical and more flexible, the concept of an
amendment at an appellate stage involves difficult considerations. An amendment
at trial contemplates a continuing ability by the accused to meet an amended
charge; the appellate stage occurs long after the evidence has been led,
arguments made and facts found. In my view, it would be an extraordinary step
for an appellate Court to materially amend the charge and uphold a conviction
based on the charge as amended. I would think that such an extraordinary step
would require the clearest statutory basis.

It is however further contended on behalf of the
Crown that the amendment sought in the present case is a mere alteration in a
particular of the offence and as to this contention I agree that the source of
the property and the manner by which it was acquired relate only to the mode of
the commission of the offence, but, as Mr. Justice Zuber has observed [at
p. 85]:

[Page 490]

…the possession of property by itself is
not an offence. The Crown must allege as a necessary element of its case the
unlawful source of the goods. In the information as drawn in this case the
allegation that the motor was ‘obtained by the commission in Canada of an indictable offence’ is an
essential averment. The Crown now seeks to delete that essential averment and
substitute another, i.e. ‘derived indirectly from the commission of an
indictable offence’.

In this latter regard the Crown seeks to rely on
the provisions of s. 610(3)  of the Criminal Code  and this also forms the
basis of the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Jessup. That
section reads:

(3) A court of appeal may exercise in
relation to proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in
subsection (1) that may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil
matters, and may issue any process that is necessary to enforce the orders or
sentences of the court but no costs shall be allowed to the appellant or
respondent…

Section 610  of the Criminal Code  is
primarily concerned with evidentiary questions and the following passage taken
from the dissenting judgment of Chief Justice Laskin in Elliott v. The Queen,
[1978] 2 S.C.R. 393 at p. 409 reads as follows:

I am unable to accept the view that s.
610(3)  confers any power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment. That
subsection takes its context from the preceding provisions of s. 610  which
concern evidentiary questions. The opening words of s. 610(3)  show its limited
range; they provide that ‘A court of appeal may exercise…any powers not
mentioned in subsection (1) that may be exercised…on appeals in civil
matters’. The subsection cannot, therefore, be read as if it was a
detached and separate provision. Although Wilson J.A. purported to find support
for his view in this Court’s judgment in Kissick v. The King [1952] 1
S.C.R. 343, that case was concerned with an issue as to admissibility of
evidence and thus related to the very subject-matter of s. 610 . Still less can
s. 610(3)  be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a
different charge from the one on which the case came before it.

While the above quotation is taken from a
dissenting opinion, it constitutes a thorough and authoritative statement of
the true meaning to be attached to the provisions of s. 610(3)  of the Criminal
Code  and it is to be noted that it covers a

[Page 491]

facet of the appeal in the case there in
question which was expressly left open in the reasons for judgment of the
majority of this Court.

I am further in agreement with the reasons for
judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal in holding that the present
circumstances fall to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of s. 613 
of the Criminal Code , and like Mr. Justice Zuber, I find it
desirable to reproduce hereunder the relevant portions of that
section which reads as follows:

613. (1) On
the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the
appellant is unfit, on account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a
special verdict of not guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal
where it is of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage
of justice;

…

(2) Where a court of appeal allows an
appeal under paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and

(a) direct a judgment or verdict of
acquittal to be entered, or

(b) order a new trial.

…

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any
of the powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make
any order, in addition, that justice requires.

The Crown sought to have the information amended
to conform to the evidence and thereafter to affirm the conviction and, as I
have indicated, the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Jessup is to the
same effect. To follow this course would be to take what Mr. Justice Zuber
in my opinion properly referred to as “an extraordinary step” which “would
require the clearest statutory basis”.

I can find no such clear statutory basis in this
case but I am satisfied that justice can be done by

[Page 492]

following the course adopted by the majority of
the Court of Appeal which was to quash the conviction, allow the appeal and
order a new trial pursuant to the authority contained in s. 613(1)(a)
and s. 613(2)(b) and thereafter, pursuant to the authority
contained in s. 613(8)  to make any order that justice requires including in the
present case an order directing a new trial on the amended information. This
procedure ensures that the accused is informed of the charge against him before
his trial commences and provides him with a continuing opportunity to meet the
amended charge as the trial progresses.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

The reasons of McIntyre and Lamer JJ. were
delivered by

LAMER J. (dissenting in part)—I have had
the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Ritchie. I am
in agreement with his comments as regards ss. 312(1)  and 610(3)  of the Criminal
Code . I also agree with the Court of Appeal for Ontario and with the reasons given by that Court set out in my brother
Ritchie’s opinion that the conviction should be quashed. I would, however,
allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal for a new trial
and enter a verdict of acquittal. I would have agreed to the ordering of a new
trial on an amended information had the trial judge denied a Crown’s motion to
that effect. However such did not occur as the Crown did not seek an amendment
from the trial court.

The trial judge’s error was in convicting the
accused as charged since the evidence could not support the essential averment
that the outboard motor had “been obtained by the commission in Canada of an indictable offence”. (My
underlining). The Crown’s failure to seek to cure the defect in its information
at trial should in my view inure to the benefit of the accused. While appellate
courts should correct judicial errors on appeal it is not generally their
function to assist the Crown in overcoming the effect of its prosecutorial
short-

[Page 493]

comings to the detriment of accused by ordering
a second trial where the first has failed solely through error of the Crown.
While this Court’s decision in Elliott v. The Queen, [1978] 2
S.C.R. 393, has recognized that appellate courts may order a new trial on
an amended charge, provided that it not be tantamount to charging a different
offence, it is a matter of discretion which, for the aforementioned reasons, I
should choose to exercise by entering a verdict of acquittal in the stead of a
new trial on the amended information.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Sentence—Driving
offences—Severer penalty for second or subsequent offences—Previous convictions
for two offences arising out of the same incident—Whether second or third
offence—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended, ss. 236(1), 236.1.

Respondent was convicted of impaired driving
(s. 234 Cr. C.) and of refusal to provide a breath sample (s. 235 Cr.
C); both convictions arose out of the same drinking and driving incident.
Three years later, he was convicted of driving while legally intoxicated (s.
236(1) Cr. C.) and given the sentence prescribed for a third
offence. The District Court Judge confirmed the sentence but the Ontario Court of
Appeal found this to be respondent’s second offence and imposed sentence
accordingly. Hence this appeal to determine whether the mandatory minimum
penalty prescribed by s. 236(1)(c) Cr. C. for a third offence
applies to an accused who has previously been convicted of and sentenced at the
same time for two offences arising out of the same incident.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

According to Coke principle, a person cannot
be convicted of a third offence before he has been convicted of the second nor
of the second before he has been convicted of the first; and the second offence
must be commited after the first conviction and the third after the second
conviction. That common law principle has been too long embedded in our law to
be ousted except by clear statutory provision. Moreover, where two offences
arising out of the same incident are tried together and convictions are entered
on both after trial, they are to be treated as one for the purpose of
determining whether a severer penalty applies, either because of a previous
conviction or because of a subsequent conviction. The same rule operates where
two offences

[Page 48]

arising out of separate incidents are tried
together and convictions are entered at the same time.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 286, 9 M.V.R. 316, allowing respondent’s
appeal from the sentence imposed following his conviction on a charge under s.
236(1)  of the Criminal Code . Appeal dismissed.

Hugh J. Campbell, for the appellant.

L.T. Feldman, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The issue in this appeal, on
its particular facts, is a narrow one but it has ramifications which require
consideration of different but related circumstances. Specifically, it involves
the question whether the mandatory minimum penalty prescribed by Criminal
Code , s. 236(1) (c) for a third offence applies to an accused who has
previously been convicted of and sentenced at the same time for two offences
arising out of the same incident. The trial judge imposed the mandatory minimum
of three months’ imprisonment as for a third offence and this was affirmed on
appeal to the District Court Judge. The Ontario Court of Appeal reversed and
imposed the minimum fourteen day sentence as for a second offence.

[Page 49]

The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are
ss. 236(1)  and 236.1  and they are as follows:

236. (1)
Every one who drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor
vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, having consumed alcohol in such a
quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of
alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, is guilty of an indictable offence or an
offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a
fine of not more than two thousand dollars and not less than fifty dollars or
to imprisonment for six months or to both;

(b) for a second offence, to
imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than fourteen days; and

(c) for each subsequent
offence, to imprisonment for not more than two years and not less than three
months.

…

236.1 Where
a person who is guilty of an offence under section 234, 234.1, 235 or 236 has
previously been convicted of an offence under any of those sections, that
conviction or those convictions shall be deemed to be, for the purpose of
determining the punishment to which the person is subject under any of those
sections, a first or second offence, as the case may be.

On May 4, 1976, the accused was convicted of impaired driving, contrary to Criminal
Code , s. 234 , and of failure or refusal to provide a breath sample,
contrary to Criminal Code , s. 235 . Both convictions arose out of the
same drinking and driving incident. Although the record of proceedings does not
mention the sentence imposed in respect of these convictions, it appeared to be
common ground that the accused was not sentenced on the second conviction as
for a second offence. On November 21, 1979, the accused was convicted of
driving an automobile while having consumed alcohol beyond the lawful quantity
contrary to Criminal Code , s. 236(1) . This offence was committed on or
about July 8, 1979, long after
the earlier offences.

The trial judge (who was followed in this by the
District Court Judge without any elaboration)

[Page 50]

took the position that the number of previous
convictions was the decisive consideration on whether a subsequent offence was
a third one. The Ontario Court of Appeal, applying R. v. Negridge (1980),
54 C.C.C. (2d) 304 and Jack v. Registrar of Motor Vehicles, [1972]
4 W.W.R. 602, was of the opinion that because there was no progression of
sentences on the facts of the case, there was no element of more than one
warning being involved in the first two convictions which, for the purposes of
s. 236(1) , should be treated as one conviction.

Although the short reasons of the Ontario Court
of Appeal did not mention the common law principle derived from Coke’s
Institutes, vol. 2, at p. 468, where increased penalties are imposed for
second and subsequent offences, it is evident that the Court had it in mind.
That principle was applied by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Cheetham
(1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 109 and in R. v. Negridge, supra, and
canvassed at some length in Christie v. Britnell (1895), 21
V.L.R. 71. What Coke said literally was that a person cannot be convicted (and,
presumably, if I follow him, sentenced) of a third offence before he has been
convicted of the second nor of the second before he has been convicted of the
first; and the second offence must be committed after the first conviction and
the third after the second conviction. As subsequently understood, the
principle, or perhaps, better, policy was that an accused does not face the
jeopardy of an increased penalty for a third offence unless he has previously
been convicted and sentenced for a second offence. Counsel for the accused
relies on this in the present case.

The Crown’s position, simply put, is that there
were in fact two previous convictions before the one now before this Court and
that the common law rule relied upon does not go so far as to allow the courts
to treat them as one even if they arose out of the same incident and were
entered at the same time.

[Page 51]

I turn to a consideration of the cases which
touch the issue here, beginning with the Australian decision in Christie v.
Britnell, supra. Before doing so, I may mention Jack v. Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, supra, referred to by the Ontario Court of Appeal in the
present case, and note that it offers an exact parallel in that there were two
convictions there on the same day and of offences arising out of the same
incident. They followed an earlier conviction of a similar offence, and the
question before Matas J. (now J.A.) was whether the statutory disqualification
from driving following a conviction of a third offence applied. The learned
judge held, coming to the same result in principle as that reached here by the
Ontario Court of Appeal, that for the disqualification to operate there must be
three sequential occurrences and three convictions arising out of three
separate occasions.

The facts in Christie v. Britnell differed
from those here in that there the accused was convicted on the same day of
unlawfully selling beer on two separate occasions. The question was whether he
was subject to being sentenced for a second offence. Madden C.J. held he could
not be so sentenced and embarked on an assessment of the principle of statutory
interpretation based on Coke’s observations above-mentioned. He said this, at
p. 73:

The words “subsequent offence”, together
with the larger measure of punishment to be awarded, would seem to indicate
that the second offence should be one which followed after conviction and
punishment of the first offence. I find that there is a general principle which
governs these matters. It is said in Coke (b):—“Et si tertio deliquerit et
super hoc convicti fuerint. Convicti fuerint is here taken for adjudicati
fuerint. Though this branch saith et super hoc convicti fuer, and
may seem to refer to the third offence, yet cannot he be convicted of the third
before he be convicted of the second, nor of the second before he be convicted
of the first; and the second offence must be committed after the first
conviction, and the third after the second conviction, and severall judgments
thereupon given: for so it is to be understood in other Acts of Parliament
where there be degrees of punishment inflicted for the first, second and third
offence, etc., there must be severall convictions,

[Page 52]

that is to say, judgments given upon legall
proceeding for every severall offence, for it appeareth to be no offence untill
judgment by proceeding of law be given against him.” Therefore, while Coke distinguishes
the actual language of Westm. Second., which would be less difficult,
he, nevertheless, points out the general principle governing offences of this
kind. That view of Coke has never been departed from, and in Maxwell
on Interpretation of Statutes (2nd ed.), p. 427, it is said, quoting Coke:—“When
a second offence is the subject of distinct punishment it is an offence
committed after conviction of a first.”

He observed, further, at p. 74, that

The principle involved there is that to be
an offence there must be a conviction and also that the meaning of the Legislature
in imposing grades of punishment for a second, as contrasted with a first
offence, really was that the liability to a higher degree of punishment is to
be a warning not to be again convicted. [Emphasis added.]

A more recent Australian case, also from
Victoria, is Farrington v. Thomson and Bridgland, [1959] V.R. 286
where the facts were that although the accused had been convicted on three
separate occasions of Licensing Act offences, the second offence had
been committed prior to the first conviction. The question at issue was whether
he could be sentenced as for a third offence which attracted a mandatory
additional penalty of forfeiture of his licence. Christie v. Britnell
and other cases were relied on for the conclusion that the second of the
three convictions was not a conviction for a second offence. This is what Smith
J. said on the issue, at p. 288:

These cases show, I consider, that in
sections like s. 177, which impose increased penalties for second and
subsequent offences, an offence is not ordinarily to be considered a “second
offence” unless at the time when it was committed the offender had a prior
conviction. They, therefore, support the view that an offence is not a “third
offence” unless the offender had two prior convictions when he committed it.
They do not deal, however, with the question whether that is all that is
necessary to constitute a “third offence” or whether it is necessary, in

[Page 53]

addition, that one of the two prior
convictions should have been for a “second offence” within the meaning of the
section.

It appears to me that s. 177 does make this
additional requirement. The decisions in the cases cited are derived from a
rule of construction stated in Coke’s Institutes, vol. 2, p. 468 in
language which, as I read it, makes that requirement.

The same view was taken in O’Hara v. Harrington,
[1962] Tas. S.R. 165 where Burbury C.J. said this, at p. 169:

It may be thought to be anomalous that if a
man commits the offence of drunken driving and then repeats the offence before
being convicted of the first offence he escapes the increased minimum statutory
penalty in respect of his second offence. But Lord Coke, the great 17th
Century judicial defender of the rights of the individual, said over three
centuries ago that a man may not lawfully be subjected to an increased
statutory penalty as for a second offence unless he had deliberately broken the
law again after being convicted and receiving punishment for a first breach of
it. The law has been taken to be so settled ever since.

This three century old canon of
construction of penal provisions of this kind is broadly based on principle and
does not depend upon the precise language used in a statute. It ought not to be
excluded unless the legislature has plainly said so.

This Tasmanian case was among the authorities
relied on by Blair J.A. who delivered the majority judgment (Arnup J.A.
concurring and Jessup J.A. dissenting) in R. v. Cheetham, supra.

The Cheetham case was not concerned with
driving offences but with robbery involving the use of a firearm. The relevant Criminal
Code  provision, s. 83(1) , provides for increased penalties and an increased
minimum for second and subsequent offences. The accused was convicted on three
counts of robbery and on three counts of using a firearm while committing an
offence contrary to s. 83 . He had a rifle with him during each robbery which
was of the same store over a two month period. What concerned the Court of
Appeal was whether the trial judge was right in sentencing the

[Page 54]

accused on the firearm convictions to
consecutive three year minimum terms as for a second and subsequent offence.
For Jessup J.A. in dissent it was enough that the offences were subsequent to
each other at the time they were committed. The majority judgment of Blair J.A.
proceeded on what I may call the Coke principle that (in his words) “unless the
statute otherwise clearly provides, an offender cannot be convicted as for a
second or subsequent offence, unless that offence is committed after a previous
conviction for a first or earlier offence” (at p. 113). He concluded
therefore that the trial judge was in error in his sentencing and that the
three counts should have been treated as first offences subject to a minimum
sentence of one year each.

Two other observations of Blair J.A. must be
mentioned. He said this, at p. 114, followed by quoting from O’Hara v. Harrington,
supra:

However it may be expressed, the rationale
for the rule is plain. It is expected that the conviction and penalty for
the initial offence and the peril of a more severe penalty for a subsequent
offence will be present in the mind of the offender and guide his future
conduct.

And further, at p. 117:

In a case like the present where a statute
may be open to two interpretations, it is still the rule, in the absence of
compelling reasons to the contrary, that an interpretation should be chosen
which favours the liberty of the subject.

One of the points made by Blair J.A. in his
extensive canvass of the issue was that “the principle that increased penalties
only apply to subsequent offences committed after conviction for a first
offence was accepted in the Criminal Code  upon its enactment in 1892”
(at p. 114). He referred to and quoted provisions carried into the

[Page 55]

1927 statute revision (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36) as
ss. 851 and 963. Those sections provided for particulars of a previous
conviction to be given in an indictment where punishment for a subsequent
offence was greater than for a first offence and for the method of proving the
previous conviction. Because of their likely prejudice to an accused before a
jury, these provisions for disclosure of previous convictions in an indictment
were removed in the 1953‑1954 revision of the Criminal Code  and
replaced by what are now ss. 591  and 592 . The former forbids any reference to
previous convictions in an indictment for which a greater punishment may be
imposed by reason thereof, and the latter requires the prosecutor to establish
that the accused was notified before plea that a greater punishment would be
sought because of a previous conviction. This was done in the Cheetham case.

The Negridge case, supra, is
important on two counts. First it elaborates s. 236.1, enacted by 1974-75-76
(Can.), c. 93, s. 17 which came into force on April 26, 1976, pointing out that
its effect is to designate a group of related offences as being each capable of
being first or second offences for the purposes of determining prescribed
punishment. Thus, it overcomes the previous need of showing that the subsequent
offence was the same one for which there was a previous conviction. Second, and
more significant here, it affirms the rule of construction in the Cheetham case.
Martin J.A., who spoke for the Court in Negridge, rejected Crown
counsel’s contention that the use of the word “previously” in s. 236.1
indicated a designed departure from the Coke principle. The word simply
indicated that convictions under the former section were embraced. Justice
Martin made the following point (at p. 314):

…Parliament, had it wished s. 236.1 to have
the effect contended for by the Crown, could readily have provided that where a
person had been previously convicted under

[Page 56]

any of the four sections mentioned, that
conviction or those convictions, whether registered before or after the commission
of a second of subsequent offence, should be deemed to be a first or second
offence, as the case might be. Parliament is presumed to know the existing
state of the law and if it had wished to alter such a well established rule it
would have expressly so stated. It would take much clearer language than that
contained in s. 236.1 to satisfy me that Parliament intended to alter the
accepted meaning of the terms “second” or “subsequent” offence found in s.
234(1)(b) and (c). Even if the language of s. 236.1 were equally
open to the interpretation contended for by the Crown, which I think it is not,
there being an ambiguity, the section should be interpreted according to the
universal principle that if a penal provision is reasonably capable of two
interpretations, that interpretation which is most favourable to the accused
must be adopted:…

The facts in Negridge differed from those
in the present case. There the accused was first convicted on July 10, 1974 for
driving with an excessive percentage of alcohol in his blood contrary to s.
236. On July 28, 1977 he was
convicted of impaired driving under s. 234 , the offence having been committed
on May 16, 1976. On August 15, 1977 he was again convicted under s. 234 , the offence having been
committed on May 28, 1976 and hence before his conviction on July 28. It was
held that the conviction of July 10, 1974 was, by virtue of s. 236.1, a first
offence for punishment purposes although s. 236.1 was not then in force. The
real issue here concerned the offence committed on May 28, 1977. Should the accused be liable
to be sentenced as for a third offence when convicted on August 15, 1977 or for
a second offence because it was committed before he was convicted a second time
on July 28, 1977? The Coke
principle would require that the accused be liable to sentence as a second
offender only because when the May 28 offence was committed, he had been only
convicted once before. In accordance with the rule expressed in the Cheetham
case, a second or subsequent offence means a second or subsequent offence
committed after a previous conviction or convictions.

[Page 57]

Martin J.A. hence held that the conviction on
August 15, 1977 could only be as for a second offence, that of July 28 to be
disregarded in that connection. He brought in aid Criminal Code , s.
5(1) (a) which provides that where an enactment creates an offence and
authorizes a punishment to be imposed in respect thereof, a person shall not be
deemed to be guilty of that offence until he is convicted thereof.

Finally, I wish to refer to the judgment of the
Northwest Territories Court of Appeal (in fact, the Alberta Court of Appeal) in
R. v. Bohnet, [1976] 6 W.W.R. 176 which was relied on by the
appellant Crown. There the accused was convicted on three successive occasions
of offences against s. 236(1)  (then s. 234 ). The first conviction was in
February, 1971, the second in August, 1971 and the third in November, 1974. He
was convicted a fourth time of an offence committed in September, 1975. These
were all summary convictions but the Crown did not comply with s. 740 (similar
to s. 592, applicable to indictable offences, referred to earlier) either in
respect of the August, 1971 or the November, 1974 convictions, requiring notice
to the accused that a greater punishment would be sought by reason of a
previous conviction. However, the Crown did give a s. 740 notice in respect of
the fourth offence. The trial judge held that there had to be progressive
sentences and until the accused was sentenced for the second or third offences
the Crown could not invoke what is now s. 236(1) (c) to
punish as for a third offence or subsequent offence.

Clement J.A. for the Court disagreed that the
failure to comply with s. 740 in respect of the second and third offences
affected resort to s. 236(1) (c) in respect of the fourth offence.
In his view, s. 236(1)  provided its own punishment code,

[Page 58]

and it was the number of convictions not the
progression of penalties that governed. On its facts, the Bohnet case
presents no difficulties, apart from whether s. 740 (or s. 592, as the case may
be) are mandatory prerequisites to invocation of s. 236(1) . There were there,
four offences, each occurring on a different occasion and for which there were
separate convictions. The case is, in this respect, unlike the present case,
unlike Cheetham and unlike Negridge.

The conclusion that I draw from the canvass of
the authorities is that the Coke rule or, if I may say so, the policy it
reflects, has been too long embedded in our law to be ousted except by clear
statutory provision or, at the most, by necessary implication. This is not
evident here. I note that among the authorities canvassed in the Cheetham case
were two New Brunswick
judgments, one in the last century and the other in the early part of this
century, both supporting the approach taken here by the Ontario Court of
Appeal: see R. v. The Justices of Queens, Ex parte Miller (1875),
15 N.B.R. 485, at p. 488; R. v. O’Brien, Ex parte Chamberlain (1908),
38 N.B.R. 381, at p. 383.

I should add that no question was raised in the
present case as to the obligation of the Crown to give the notice prescribed by
either Criminal Code  s. 592  or s. 740 , as the case may be, if it would
seek a greater punishment by reason of a previous conviction or convictions.
This issue may be left for determination in a case which calls for this
consideration.

The following summary is in order:

(1) The number of convictions per se does
not govern in determining whether the Coke rule applies.

(2) The general rule is that before a severer
penalty can be imposed for a second or subsequent offence, the second or
subsequent offence must have been committed after the first or second
conviction, as the case may be, and the second or subsequent

[Page 59]

conviction must have been made after the first
or second conviction, as the case may be.

(3) Where two offences arising out of the same
incident are tried together and convictions are entered on both after trial,
they are to be treated as one for the purpose of determining whether a severer
penalty applies, either because of a previous conviction or because of a
subsequent conviction.

(4) The rule operates even where two offences
arising out of separate incidents are tried together and convictions are
entered at the same time.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Defence of insanity —
Hypomania — Accused knew actions to be wrong — Delusion that immune from
punishment if caught — Whether or not accused rendered incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of his act — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, s. 16.

Evidence — Hearsay — Whether or not trial
judge erred in treating as factual the hearsay evidence on which expert opinion
based.

Respondent was found not guilty on account of
insanity, of importing cocaine into Canada and of unlawful possession of
cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. A hypomaniac, respondent knew he was
doing wrong but believed that, if caught, he would not be punished. The trial judge
found that respondent's incapacity to appreciate the nature and quality of his
acts met the test of s. 16(2), and more particularly, that he did not
""appreciate"" the consequences of punishment associated with the
commission of the offence. This appeal is from a judgment of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal upholding the verdict reached by the trial judge.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The defence of insanity was not open to
respondent. Accused's failure, because of his delusions, to appreciate the
penal sanctions attaching to the crime did not bring him within the ambit of
the first arm of the insanity defence. The requirement that the accused be able
to perceive the consequences of the physical act is a restatement, specific to
the defence of insanity, of the principle of mens rea as a requisite
element in the commission of a crime. The mental element must be proved with
respect to all circumstances, and consequences, that form part of the actus
reus. Punishment is not an element of the crime itself, but may be
the result of the commission of the criminal act. ""Wrong"",
used in the second half of s. 16(2), means wrong according to

[page 25]

law, and as it has
been established that respondent's act was
forbidden by law, respondent's inability to ""appreciate"" the penal consequences was irrelevant to
the question of legal sanity.

Irresistible impulse does not exist as a
defence but may be symptomatic of a disease
of the mind giving rise to a defence of insanity. The trial judge's
comments were made in the context of his consideration of the insanity defence
and specifically rejected a defence of diminished responsibility.

The trial judge
erred in accepting as factual much of the hearsay
evidence related by an expert in the course of
giving his opinion. The expert's opinion, however, was admissible even
if based on second-hand evidence, for that opinion is not determinative of an
issue but a question of fact to be accepted or rejected as the judge or jury
see fit.

The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON
J.—Robert Mark Abbey was tried
by a judge sitting alone on two charges (i) importing

[page 26]

cocaine into Canada and (ii) unlawful possession
of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. His sole defence was that he was
insane at the material time. The trial judge gave effect to that defence. He
found Abbey not guilty on account of insanity and the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia dismissed a Crown appeal. The matter has now, by leave,
reached this Court.

I

The Facts and History of the Case

The facts surrounding the commission of the
offence are not in dispute. Pursuant to s. 582  of the Criminal Code  Abbey
admitted, amongst others, the following facts alleged against him, for the
purpose of dispensing with proof. On Sunday, May 13, 1979, Abbey arrived at the
Vancouver International Airport on C.P. Air Flight No. 421 from Lima, Peru. He
entered Canada carrying a brown shoulder bag containing two clear plastic bags
the contents of which weighed 5.5 ounces and analyzed to be approximately 50
per cent pure cocaine. After disembarkation, Abbey proceeded directly to the
Canada Customs primary counter where he presented his passport and a signed
customs declaration. He then obtained his suitcase from a baggage carousel and
proceeded to the Customs secondary counter. Abbey placed the suitcase and
shoulder bag on the counter. The Customs Inspector looked into the shoulder bag
and observed a camera case and underneath it two plastic bags of white powder,
the cocaine. The following conversation ensued between the Customs Inspector,
Jung, and Abbey:

Jung: (holding the two plastic bags of white
powder). ""What is it?""

Abbey: ""You got me.""

Jung: ""What is it?""

Abbey: ""It's coke.""

R.C.M.P. Constable Giesbrecht arrived on the
scene:

[page 27]

Giesbrecht: (indicating the brown shoulder
bag). ""What's in here?""

Abbey: ""Naturally
cocaine."" Giesbrecht: ""How much?""

Abbey: ""130 to 150 grams.""

Giesbrecht: ""You need not say anything,
however, anything you do say may be given in evidence. You understand this?""

Giesbrecht:
""What's the white powder?"" 

Abbey: ""Cocaine.""

Giesbrecht: ""You brought the cocaine
into the country?""

Abbey: ""Yes.""

Giesbrecht: (indicating the brown shoulder
bag). ""Did you bring this suitcase into the country?""

Abbey: ""Yes.""

Later
in the day Abbey gave the police a signed statement in which he said that in
the last two weeks of April, 1979, while still in Canada, he had received $900
from three individuals on the express understanding that he would purchase 13
grams of cocaine for them in Peru. The two plastic bags contained 158.7 grams
of cocaine, the ""street value"" of which was $76,320, if cut to 13 per
cent purity, or $18,150 if sold, uncut, by the ounce. It was a profit venture.
In his statement to police which was submitted in evidence, Abbey was asked if
there were anything he would like to say with respect to the importation of
cocaine. He replied:

It was just there. I've been down there many
times and when you see it for five dollars. I was going to school and [sic] the Philippines and it was the
perfect way to have a perfect year. 1 can't believe 1 did it.

As
I have said, the only defence raised was s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , insanity. Section 16 of
the Code reads:

16. (1) No person
shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act
or omission on his part while he was insane.

[page 28]

(2) For the purposes of this section a person
is insane when he is in a state of natural
imbecility or has disease of the mind to an extent that renders him
incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is
wrong.

(3) A person who has specific delusions, but
is in other respects sane, shall not be
acquitted on the ground of insanity
unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of things that, if it existed, would have
justified or excused his act or omission.

(4) Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.

As
witnesses, the Crown called the customs inspectors and R.C.M.P. officers who
searched and questioned Abbey at the airport. They said that Abbey appeared
""normal"" in their dealings with him. Abbey did not testify. The
defence called only one witness, Dr. Vallance, a psychiatrist. In rebuttal the
Crown called another psychiatrist, Dr. Eaves. No other witnesses gave
testimony.

Dr.
Vallance testified that he first saw Abbey approximately 10 weeks after the
commission of the offence. Dr. Vallance's testimony was based on his interviews
with Abbey, his interviews with Abbey's mother, his review of a medical report
prepared by another psychiatrist, and his discussions with other doctors who
were involved in treating Abbey. In particular, Dr. Vallance relied on Abbey's
description of the events surrounding his trip to South America as indicative
of his mental state at the material time. Dr. Vallance's opinion was that
Abbey, at all material times, was suffering from a disease of the mind, a manic
illness, known as hypomania. While Abbey appreciated that he was bringing cocaine
into Canada and knew that what he was doing was wrong, he believed that, if
caught, he would not be punished. Dr. Vallance said:

He had a considerable disturbance of mood. He
had delusional ideas. He had hallucinatory
experiences. It's difficult under circumstances like that to fully
appreciate what you are doing, particularly when the feelings and delusional
ideas are tangled up with what you are doing.
If you feel that you are for some delusional idea inordinately powerful
or safe then that impairs good

[page 29]

judgment. I am sure he had some appreciation
of what he was doing.

Dr Vallance further
testified that, while Abbey was not rendered totally incapable of appreciating
the nature and quality of his acts by reason of the disease of mind from which
he suffered, there was a degree of impairment of judgment. He had the feeling
that he was being looked after by some outside force that was feeding him
strength and that no harm would come to him and even if he did get caught it
did not matter because somehow he would be looked after. Dr. Vallance made
reference to Abbey's delusional belief that he was committed to a particular
path of action which he could not change and his further delusional idea, while
in Lima, Peru, that he had ""astro-travelled"" back to Vancouver
already and that in getting on the plane in Lima to fly home he was simply
having the body follow where the ""rest"" had already gone.

Dr. Eaves, in
rebuttal, was of the opinion that the disease of the mind experienced by Abbey,
hypomania, would ""not be substantially enough to render him incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of his actions ... not to know that his
actions were wrong"".

The trial judge
found that Abbey suffered from a disease of the mind. This was common ground.
Both doctors agreed, however, that Abbey knew what he was doing and he knew
that it was wrong. They disagreed on their assessment of the degree of Abbey's
capability as of May 13, 1979. The judge found that disease of the mind
incapacitated his ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts to
the degree required to meet the test of s. 16(2) . More particularly, Abbey did
not ""appreciate"" the consequences of punishment associated with the
commission of the offence. After referring to the decision of this Court in Cooper v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1149, the trial judge
did find that Abbey ""had the capacity to appreciate the nature of the act
of importing and of possessing the Cocaine"". He continued:

As I understand
the evidence and the submissions of counsel, the Accused had the capacity to
appreciate the nature of the act of importing and of possessing the

[page 30]

Cocaine. He also had the capacity to
appreciate the immediate consequences of those acts. That is to say that they
were illegal; that he should not commit them overtly;
that if he succeeded he must then deliver some of the Cocaine to his
friends who gave him the money for it, and find someone through another friend
who would buy the rest at a large profit to himself. He had the capability, in that sense, of analysing the
knowledge of what he was about, and he—in using the word
""analysing"" I adopt the definition given by Mr. Justice Estey in the Supreme Court of Canada decision,
Regina v. Barnier (1980)
2 W.W.R. 659.

The trial judge,
however, did not stop there. He went on to consider ""whether the law
requires that an accused also be able to appreciate, in the sense of which I
have read from Mr. Justice Estey's decision, the consequences that may be
personal to him. That is to say, the consequence of punishment.""

In finding Abbey
not guilty by reason of insanity the judge concluded that ""one, who like
Abbey suffers from the delusion that he is protected from punishment by some
mysterious external force which comes to him, as described in the evidence of
Dr. Vallance, has his ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts
incapacitated to the degree required to meet the test of Section 16 , Subsection
2 . He is, by disease of the mind, deprived of the ability to assess an
important consequence of his act. He is deprived of the effect of the penal
sanctions ....""

The Crown appealed,
contending that the trial judge had erred in law in directing himself to the
law applicable to the defence of insanity. The appeal was dismissed.

The Crown has now appealed
to this Court, on the grounds raised in the British Columbia Court of Appeal:

1) The trial judge erred in holding that a
person who by reason of a disease of the
mind does not ""appreciate"" the personal penal consequences of
his actions is insane within the meaning of
Section 16(2)  of the Criminal Code .

[page 31]

2) The trial judge erred in giving effect to
a defence of ""irresistible impulse"".

3) The trial judge misdirected himself with
respect to the use which could be made of ""hearsay"" evidence introduced during the testimony of the
psychiatrists who were called as witnesses.

II

Consequences

The First Arm of
Section 16(2) 

The question raised
in the first ground of appeal is therefore whether ""appreciation of the
nature and quality of an act"" is limited to appreciation of the physical
consequences of the act or also includes appreciation of the penal consequences
to the accused. Taggart J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, said that Cooper v. The Queen, supra, and R. v. Barnier, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1124 made it clear that there is a
distinction between ""know"" and ""appreciate"" and that the
words ""appreciate the nature and quality of his acts"" connote more
than a mere knowledge of the physical nature of the acts being committed. With
respect, I agree. The British Columbia Court failed, however, to deal with the
question of what it is an accused must fail to ""appreciate"" before he
can be found to be legally insane. The Court simply accepted the trial judge's
conclusion that somebody who, because of a disease of the mind, has the
delusion that he is protected from punishment by some mysterious external
force, is incapacitated from appreciating the nature and quality of his acts.

The defence of
insanity in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code  has
received lengthy consideration by this Court in several recent judgments: Cooper v. The Queen, supra, R. v.
Barnier, supra, and,
most recently, Kjeldsen
v. The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 617. As stated in Cooper
v. The Queen, at p.
1152, s. 16(2)  of the Criminal
Code  ""does not set
out a test of insanity but, rather the criteria to be taken into account in
determining criminal responsibility."" With some hesitation the trial judge
came to the conclusion that:

[page 32]

... one, who like Abbey suffers from the
delusion that he is protected from punishment by some mysterious external force which comes to him, as described in
the evidence of Dr. Valiance, has his
ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts incapacitated
to the degree required to meet the test of
Section 16 , Subsection 2 . He is, by disease of the mind, deprived of the
ability to assess an important consequence
of his act. He is deprived of the effect of the penal sanctions in
restraining him from the commission of a crime as it should restrain us all.

With respect, the trial judge has confused the
""ability to perceive the consequences, impact and results of a physical
act"" (Cooper v. The Queen, at
p. 1162) with a belief, however unjustified, that the legal sanction imposed
for the commission of the prohibited act, the ""legal consequences"",
was somehow inapplicable to him. The delusion under which Abbey was supposedly
labouring was that he would not get caught, or, if caught, would benefit from
some undefined immunity to prosecution. Such a delusion by no means brings him
under the first arm of the insanity test in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code  as developed in the recent
cases.

According to s. 16(2)  a person is insane when he
has a disease of the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of

i) appreciating the nature and quality of an
act, 

or

ii) knowing that an act is wrong.

As the recent decisions dealing with s. 16(2) 
have noted, the wording in the Criminal
Code is slightly different than in the English M'Naghten rules
which are the inspiration for the section. The concern of the recent cases has
been to set the limits for the defence, limits which are broader than those in
the M'Naghten rules. The M'Naghten rules, under what is termed the
first arm of the test, require the accused to be incapable of knowing
the nature and quality of his act. As has been pointed out by the commentators,
a narrow literal interpretation of this test is such that ""nobody is
hardly ever really mad enough to be within it""

[page 33]

(Baron
Bramwell quoted by GA. Martin in ""Insanity as a Defence"" (1966), 8
Crim. L.Q. 240, at p. 243).

As
the Court said in Cooper v. The Queen at p. 1161:

To ""know"" the nature and quality of
an act may mean merely to be aware of the physical act, while to
""appreciate"" may involve estimation and understanding of the
consequences of that act. In the case of the appellant,
as an example, in using his hands to choke the deceased, he may well
have known the nature and quality of that physical act of choking. It is
entirely different to suggest, however, that in performing the physical act of
choking, he was able to appreciate its nature and quality in the sense of being
aware that it could lead to or result in her death.

It
is the use of the word ""consequences"" in this context which,
unfortunately, led the trial judge astray. ""Consequences"" in Cooper v. The Queen, R. v. Barnier and Kjeldsen
v. The Queen refer to the physical consequences of the act. All three cases were
murder cases, violent crimes in which there was a victim who suffered the
""consequences"" of the accused's actions.

The requirement, unique to Canada, is that of
perception, an ability to perceive the consequences, impact, and results of a
physical act. An accused may be aware of the physical character of his action
(i.e., in choking) without necessarily having the capacity to appreciate that,
in nature and quality, that act will result in the death of a human being. This
is simply a restatement, specific to the defence of insanity, of the principle
that mens rea, or intention as to the consequences of an act, is a
requisite element in the commission of a crime [Cooper v. The Queen, at
pp. 1162-63].

In Schwartz v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 673, Mr. Justice Martland said at p.
700:

The Codere case, in my opinion
correctly, decided that ""nature and quality"" dealt with the physical
character of the act. If, therefore, a person who has committed a crime did
not, by reason of disease of the mind, know what he was doing, he is not to be
convicted, because it really was not his act.

[page 34]

In Codere (1916), 12 Cr. App. R. 21 (C.C.A.), Reading L.C.J.
considered the application of the M'Naghten rules
at pp. 26-27 and in particular the expression
""nature and quality of the act"":

It is said that ""quality"" is to be
regarded as characterising the moral, as contrasted with the physical, aspect
of the deed. The Court cannot agree with that view of the meaning of the words
""nature and quality."" The Court is of opinion that in using the
language ""nature and quality"" the judges were only dealing with the
physical character of the act, and were not intending to distinguish between
the physical and moral aspects of the act. That is the law as it has been laid
down by judges in many
directions to juries, and as the Court understands it to be at the present
time.

See also R. v. Harrop (1940), 74 C.C.C. 228 (Man. C.A.), at p. 230; R. v. Crook (1979), 1 Sask. R. 273 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 303.

Although there is
some controversy in academic circles, I adopt the more traditional view
espoused by Glanville Williams (Criminal Law, The General Part, 2nd ed. (1961), para. 166, at p. 525) that a delusion falling under the ""first
arm"" of the insanity defence negatives an element of the crime, the mens rea. It may also, as Martin J.A. pointed out in R. v. Rabey (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 461, notwithstanding
the existence of mens
rea in the formal sense
of intention, foresight, or knowledge with respect to the actus reus, exempt from liability if the criteria of insanity
are met. As the Court observed in Cooper the
requirement that the accused be able to perceive the consequences of a physical
act is a restatement, specific to the defence of insanity, of the principle of mens rea, or intention as to the consequences of an act, as a
requisite element in the commission of a crime. The mental element must be
proved with respect to all circumstances, and consequences, that form part of
the actus reus. As the Crown in this case correctly
points out, ""While punishment may be a result of the commission of
a criminal act it is not an element of the crime itself"". A
delusion which renders an accused ""incapable of appreciating the nature
and quality of his act"" goes to the mens rea of the offence and brings into operation the
""first arm"" of s. 16(2) : he is not guilty by reason of insanity. A
delusion which renders an accused

[page 35]

incapable of
appreciating that the penal sanctions attaching to the commission of the crime
are applicable to him does not go to the mens rea of the offence, does not render him incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of the act, and does not bring into
operation the ""first arm"" of the insanity defence.

Abbey was charged
with importing and trafficking in cocaine. There is no dispute as to the fact
that he carried cocaine into the country. In his statement to police, it was
his admitted intention to import cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. In
other words, Abbey appreciated that the actus reus of each of the offences charged was being committed.
Both the psychiatrist called for the defence, and the psychiatrist who
testified on behalf of the Crown, stated that Abbey appreciated the nature and
quality of his act. The judge erred, in my view, in going on to say that a
failure to appreciate the penal sanctions (""consequence of punishment"") brought the accused within the
ambit of the ""first arm"" of the insanity defence of s. 16(2) .

The Second Arm of
Section 16(2) 

Should the question
of ""personal penal consequences"" be relevant at all, it is more
appropriately discussed within the context of the second arm of s. 16(2)  i.e. ""knowing that an act ... is wrong"". Glanville Williams
in his Criminal Law, The General
Part, supra, at p. 478 says:

It has been determined that this phrase
[nature and quality] refers to the physical character of the act, not its legal
quality; legal right and wrong are cared for by the second question ... [citing
Codere, supra, at p. 27].

This Court having
decided in Schwartz v.
The Queen, supra, that
""wrong"" means wrong according to law, and it being established that
Abbey

[page 36]

knew his act was ""wrong"",
his inability to ""appreciate"" the penal consequences is really
irrelevant to the question of legal insanity. There seems to be no doubt on the
evidence, and on the judge's findings, that Abbey knew that he was doing an act
forbidden by law.

With respect, the
trial judge homogenized the first and second arms of s. 16(2) , collapsing the
one into the other in, for example, the following passage from his judgment:

As I understood
the evidence and the submission of counsel, the Accused had the capacity to
appreciate the nature of the act of importing and of possessing the
Cocaine. He also had the capacity to appreciate the immediate consequences of
those acts. That is to say that they were illegal; that he should not commit
them overtly....

The second arm of s.
16(2)  is concerned with cognitive capabilities, with knowledge, and not with
appreciation of consequences. Section 16(2)  speaks in terms of knowledge of
wrongness, not appreciation of wrongness. One must, I think, draw a distinction
between what might be termed ""result"" crimes and what might be termed
""knowledge"" crimes. In respect of the former it is correct to speak
of appreciation of consequences. The capacity to appreciate the nature and
quality of his act refers to the physical character of the act. It requires
both an appreciation of the factors involved, and sufficient mental capacity to
measure and foresee the consequences of the conduct.

With respect,
however, to the second arm of s. 16(2) , knowledge that it is wrong, Martland J.
set out the test in the Schwartz case at p. 701:

In brief, it is my opinion that the effect of
s. 16(2)  is to provide protection to a person suffering from disease of the mind who has committed a crime if,
in committing the crime, he did not appreciate what he was doing, or, if
he did have that appreciation, he did not know that he was committing a crime.

In a note on Schwartz v. The Queen, supra, entitled ""Section 16 and 'Wrong' "", 18
Cr.L.Q. 413, Professor Mewett submits that the question that

[page 37]

ought to be asked is
""whether the accused, because of a disease of the mind (first hurdle) was
rendered incapable (second hurdle) of knowing that this act was something that
he ought not to do (third hurdle)"" (at p. 415). If he was capable of
knowing that an act was contrary to law, and that he ought not to do an act
contrary to law, then, in the opinion of Professor Mewett, the defence should
not apply.

When one is
considering the legal aspects of a crime such as the importation of a narcotic
the principal inquiry should be directed not to appreciation of physical
consequences but to knowledge of wrongness. The trial judge said, ""This
man knew it was a crime, knew there was penalty, but by delusion believed
himself protected."" Counsel for Abbey said in argument that he had to
accept the fact that he could not bring Abbey's state of mind into the second
half of s. 16(2) . On these findings, in my opinion, the defence of insanity was
not open to Abbey.

I agree with the
submission of counsel for the Crown that s. 16(3) of the Code can be of
no assistance to Abbey as his delusion could not in any way ""justify""
or ""excuse"" his actions. In any event, any defence which could be
raised under subsection (3) could also be raised under subsection (2). See the McRuer
Report [Report of the Royal Commission on the Law of Insanity as a Defence in
Criminal Cases, (1956)], p. 36.

I am of the view
that the trial judge erred in law in holding that a person who by reason of
disease of the mind does not ""appreciate"" the penal consequences of his
actions is insane within the meaning of s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code .

III Irresistible
Impulse

The second ground of
appeal is the submission that the trial judge erred in giving effect to a
defence of ""irresistible impulse"". The submission rests upon the
following passage from the judgment

[page 38]

at trial, and in
particular the words ""he believed himself irrevocably committed"":

I must also note a
second question closely connected with the delusion I have already discussed.
It involves the delusion
which I find existed with Abbey and which also satisfies the test of Section 16 , Subsection
2 , that while he was in Peru he thought he should not go through with the
importing and possession of Cocaine, but he believed himself irrevocably
committed to it. That was not in the sense that having arranged with his friends he was bound to honour the
arrangement, but in the
sense that he was committed to a path of action which he was, by reason of a
force acting upon him, powerless to change.

The Crown maintains
that the trial judge found that this ""second delusion"" independently
of any other delusions, rendered Abbey legally insane. Such a finding, the
Crown contends, gives effect to a defence not recognized in Canadian law, that
of irresistible impulse. What was said by Cartwright C.J. in R. v. Borg, [1969] S.C.R. 551, is cited in support of this proposition.

There is no issue
here at all. Both the majority and minority opinions in R. v. Borg deny
the existence of a defence, as such, of irresistible impulse. Both the majority
and minority opinions in Borg,
however, recognize
that irresistible impulse may be a symptom or manifestation of a disease of the
mind which may give rise to a defence of insanity.

When an accused pleads insanity there is a
sense in which it is true to say that
irresistible impulse of itself is not
a defence. However, there are two senses in which it is not true to say
that irresistible impulse of itself is not a defence.

There is no
legal presumption of insanity merely from the existence
of an irresistible impulse. If an accused presents
no medical evidence of disease of the mind but merely pleads that he was
acting under an irresistible impulse, a jury is not entitled to infer that the
man was insane. In that sense irresistible
impulse is not of itself a defence.
However, if there is medical evidence of disease of the mind as there was here and yet the only symptoms of that
disease of the mind are irresistible impulses, the

[page 39]

jury may conclude that the accused is insane [per Hall J., at p. 570].

There is no error in
the trial judgment in this respect. The trial judge did not give effect to an
independent defence of irresistible impulse. His comments with respect to the
""second delusion"" were made in the context of his consideration of the
insanity defence. He specifically rejected the existence of a defence of
diminished responsibility in Canada.

I agree with the
British Columbia Court of Appeal that the reasons of the trial judge should be
understood in the sense that Abbey suffered from a disease of the mind which
resulted in two delusions; the first was that some mysterious external force
would protect him from punishment; the second that he believed himself
irrevocably committed to the course of action of importing cocaine; and that these
delusions taken together rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of his acts. The trial judge did not equate the ""delusion""
with a defence of irresistible impulse and, that being the case, such
authorities as R. v.
Borg, supra, R. v. Creighton (1908), 14 C.C.C. 349
and other authorities to a similar effect cited by Crown counsel have no
application to the case at bar.

IV Hearsay
Evidence

As a third ground of
appeal the Crown contends that the trial judge misdirected himself with respect
to the use which could be made of hearsay evidence introduced during the
testimony of the psychiatrists who were called as witnesses.

Dr. Vallance
testified that during the course of his interviews Abbey told him of various
delusions, visions, hallucinations and sensations which he had experienced in
the six months preceding his arrest. Dr. Vallance also testified that Abbey had
described certain symptoms of the disease to his mother several months prior to
the commission of the offence. In his testimony, Dr. Vallance recounted several
incidents of bizarre and unstable conduct by Abbey both before his departure
for

[page 40]

Peru and during his
stay. Abbey had told him, Dr. Vallance testified, that four days prior to his
actual departure for Peru he had missed a flight and, in a rage, kicked in a
window at Vancouver airport. Dr. Vallance was also told by Abbey of certain
experiences in Peru: ""he could see lights and follow the lights and would
interpret those phenomenon with ideas that there was some power outside of him
that was communicating with him. He would do strange things, like run out into
the fields. He was licking the wetness from trees"". The Crown submits that
the trial judge accepted and treated as factual much of this hearsay evidence
related by Dr. Vallance in the course of giving his opinion. The point is well
taken.

A general principle
of evidence is that all relevant evidence is admissible. The law of evidence,
however, reposes on a few general principles riddled by innumerable exceptions.
Two major exceptions to this general principle are hearsay evidence and opinion
evidence. There are also exceptions to the exceptions. ""Expert witnesses
may testify to their opinion on matters involving their expertise"" (Cross on Evidence, 5th ed. (1979), at p. 20) and may also,
incidentally, base their opinions upon hearsay.

A major difficulty
encountered by counsel and the courts alike has been identifying hearsay. There
exists a ""superstitious awe . . . about having any truck with evidence
which involves A's telling the court what B said to him"" (Cross,
""What should be done about the Rule Against Hearsay"", [1965] Crim.
L.R. 68, at p. 82). Phipson suggests three reasons for this:

(1) Failure to appreciate that the hallmark
of a hearsay statement is not only the
nature and the source of the statement but also the purpose for which it
is tendered.

[page 41]

(2) The absence of any comprehensive judicial
formulation of the rule—no doubt because ""it is difficult to make any
general statement about the law of hearsay which is entirely accurate.""

(3) The multiplicity of formulations found in
textbooks upon the subject. [Phipson on Evidence 12th ed. (1976), Supplemented to 1980,
para. 625 at pp. 263-64.]

The main concern of
the hearsay rule is the veracity of the statements made. The principal
justification for the exclusion of hearsay evidence is the abhorrence of the
common law to proof which is unsworn and has not been subjected to the trial by
fire of cross-examination. Testimony under oath, and cross-examination, have
been considered to be the best assurances of the truth of the statements of
facts presented. Not all statements by a witness of that which he heard someone
else say are, however, necessarily hearsay. A felicitous formulation of the
distinction between hearsay and non-hearsay evidence is found in the Privy
Council decision in Subramaniam
v. Public Prosecutor, [1956]
1 W.L.R. 965 at p. 970:

Evidence of a statement made to a witness by
a person who is not himself called as a
witness may or may not be hearsay. It is hearsay and inadmissible when
the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in
the statement. It is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to
establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it
was made.

What is sometimes
loosely and erroneously referred to as hearsay evidence may in fact be
""original evidence"" as Cross terms it:

When a witness is asked to narrate another's
statement for some purpose other than
that of inducing the court to accept it as true, his evidence is
said to be ""original"". Original evidence may therefore be defined as
evidence of the fact that a statement was made, tendered without reference to
the truth of anything alleged in the statement [Cross
on Evidence, 5th ed. (1979), at p. 8, emphasis added].

[page 42]

Opinion Evidence

Witnesses testify as
to facts. The judge or jury draws inferences from the facts. ""In the law
of evidence 'opinion' means any inference from observed fact, and the law on
the subject derives from the general rule that witnesses must speak only to
that which was directly observed by them"" (Cross on Evidence, supra, at
p. 442). Where it is possible to separate fact from inference the witness may
only testify as to fact. It is not always possible, however, to do so and the
""law makes allowances for these borderline cases by permitting witnesses
to state their opinion with regard to matters not calling for special knowledge
whenever it would be virtually impossible for them to separate their inferences
from the facts on which those inferences are based"" (ibid.)

With respect to
matters calling for special knowledge, an expert in the field may draw
inferences and state his opinion. An expert's function is precisely this: to
provide the judge and jury with a ready-made inference which the judge and
jury, due to the technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate.
""An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the Court with scientific
information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a
judge or jury. If on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own
conclusions without help, then the opinion of the expert is unnecessary"" (Turner
(1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 80, at p. 83, per Lawton L.J.)

An expert witness,
like any other witness, may testify as to the veracity of facts of which he has
first-hand experience, but this is not the main purpose of his or her
testimony. An expert is there to give an opinion. And the opinion more often
than not will be based on second-hand evidence. This is especially true of the
opinions of psychiatrists.

As stated by Fauteux
J. in Wilband v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 14 at p. 21:

[page 43]

The value of psychiatrist's opinion may be
affected to the extent to which it may rest on second-hand source material; but
that goes to the weight and not to the receivability
in evidence of the opinion, which opinion is no evidence of the truth of the information but evidence of the opinion formed on the
basis of that information.

In the Wilband
case counsel for Wilband had attempted to have declared inadmissible
as hear-say opinion evidence because it was based in part on prison records,
material not proved in open court. Fauteux J. found in fact the prison records
were not relied upon to any significant extent by the psychiatrists in the
formation of their opinion but the decision does stand for the proposition that
the second-hand nature of the basis of the opinion does not
""contaminate"" the opinion. This is consistent with the acceptance of
expert evidence based, as it often is, upon hypothetical questions. For the
judge or jury the expert's opinion is a question of fact which may be accepted
or rejected as seen fit. The opinion, even if uncontradicted, is not
determinative of an issue.

Thus an expert opinion based on second-hand
evidence is admissible, if relevant. The problem arose in R. v. Dietrich (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d)
49 (Ont. C.A.), as to second-hand evidence itself which formed the basis of the
opinion. Gale C.J.O. reached the conclusion that ""Put shortly, if an
expert is permitted to give his opinion, he ought to be permitted to give the
circumstances upon which that opinion is based"" (at p. 65). Testimony as
to circumstances upon which the opinion is based is not introduced, and cannot
be introduced, in order to establish the veracity of the second-hand evidence.
It is thus not hearsay evidence. Jessup J.A. correctly stated the law in R. v. Rosik, [1971] 2 O.R. 47:

1. In my view, a psychiatrist expressing an
opinion as to a mental or emotional condition of an accused can relate in evidence, as Dr. Gray did, what he has been
told by the accused when such information is a basis of his opinion
.... The hearsay rule does not operate to exclude such evidence because it is
not admitted to

[page 44]

prove the fact of what the expert has been
told: see Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd
ed.; vol. VI, s. 1720, p. 70, approved by
Gale C.J.O., in the Dietrich case.
The trial Judge should have so instructed the jury and it would have been proper for him also to point out that
there was no sworn evidence that the accused ingested drugs or consumed
the quantity of alcohol integral to Dr. Gray's opinion ... [at p. 84-85,
emphasis added].

Jessup J.A.'s view
was recently confirmed by this Court in Phillion v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 18. After citing the excerpt from Subramaniam v. Public Prosecutor which is quoted above with respect to hearsay
evidence, Ritchie J. went on to say, at p. 24:

Statements made to psychiatrists and
psychologists are sometimes admitted in criminal
cases and when this is so it is because they have qualified as experts
in diagnosing the behavioural symptoms of
individuals and have formed an opinion which the trial judge deems to be relevant to the case, but the statements on
which such opinions are based are not admissible in proof of their truth
but rather as indicating the basis upon which the medical opinion was formed in
accordance with recognized professional procedures.

The danger, of
course, in admitting such testimony is the ever present possibility, here
exemplified, that the judge or jury, without more, will accept the evidence as
going to the truth of the facts stated in it. The danger is real and lies at
the heart of this case. Once such testimony is admitted, a careful charge to
the jury by the judge or direction to himself is essential. The problem,
however, as pointed out by Fauteux J. in Wilband resides not in the admissibility of the testimony
but rather the weight to be accorded to the opinion. Although admissible in the
context of his opinion, to the extent that it is second-hand his testimony is
not proof of the facts stated. Lawton L.J. in Turner, supra, spoke of this ""elementary principle"" which
is ""frequently overlooked"":

[page 45]

Thereupon the judge commented that the report
contained ""hearsay character evidence"" which was inadmissible. He
could have said that all the facts upon which
the psychiatrist based his opinion were hearsay save for those which he observed for himself during his examination of the appellant such as his
appearance of depression and his
becoming emotional when discussing the deceased girl and his own family.
It is not for this Court to instruct
psychiatrists how to draft their reports, but those who call
psychiatrists as witnesses should remember that the facts upon which they base
their opinions must be proved by admissible
evidence. This elementary principle is frequently overlooked [at p. 82, emphasis added].

In the present case Abbey did not testify. Dr.
Valiance testified, in the course of his opinion, as to many events and
experiences related to him during several interviews. This testimony, while
admissible in the context of the opinion, was not in any way evidence of the
factual basis of these events and experiences. The trial judge in his decision
fell into the error of accepting as evidence of these facts, testimony which if
taken to be evidence of their existence would violate the hear-say rule. There
was no admissible evidence properly before the Court with respect to: the
delusions experienced by the accused; the accused having described the symptoms
of his disease to his mother some six months prior to the commission of the
offence; the accused having seen a psychiatrist before leaving for Peru; the
accused's unstable conduct at the airport some days prior to leaving for Peru
or his bizarre behaviour in Peru.

In my view the trial judge erred in law in
treating as factual the hearsay evidence upon which the opinions of the
psychiatrist were based.

Counsel for Abbey said that the passages in
which the trial judge seemed to take symptoms as findings of fact were merely
""unfortunate language"". But it goes further than that. As Woods J.A.
said in R. v. Perras (1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 209, at p.
213, ""The evidence of a physician stating what a patient told him about
his symptoms is not evidence as to the existence of the symptoms. To accept it
as such would be to

[page 46]

infringe the rule
against hearsay."" It was appropriate for the doctors to state the basis
for their opinions and in the course of doing so, to refer to what they were
told not only by Abbey but by others, but it was error for the judge to accept
as having been proved the facts upon which the doctors had relied informing
their opinions. While it is not questioned that medical experts are entitled to
take into consideration all possible information in forming their opinions,
this in no way removes from the party tendering such evidence the obligation of
establishing, through properly admissible evidence, the factual basis on which
such opinions are based. Before any weight can be given to an expert's opinion,
the facts upon which the opinion is based must be found to exist.

V Conclusion

Thus the trial judge
erred in two respects. There was no admissible evidence of important facts
regarding Abbey's conduct upon which the medical opinions were based. And the
judge misconstrued the recent cases dealing with the interpretation of the
insanity defence in s. 16(2) . A failure to ""appreciate"" the penal
sanctions attaching to an offence does not render the accused ""incapable
of appreciating the nature and quality"" of his act so as to bring the
insanity defence into play.

The appeal should be
allowed. The judgments at trial and on appeal should be set aside, and a new
trial ordered on both counts.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT FOR APPEAL FOR ALBERTA

Criminal
law—Murder—Defences—Justification—Whether or not “qualified” defence of use of
excessive force in preventing commission of indictable offence a recognized
defence—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 27, 34.

Criminal law—Charge to jury—Whether or not
errors made in charge warranting retrial.

Respondent was charged with second degree
murder. The defence maintained that the victim had assaulted one of
respondent’s associates and that respondent and his co-accused killed the
victim while trying to prevent that offence. The question arose in respect of
s. 27  of the Criminal Code  as to whether there exists in Canada a “qualified” defence of use of
excessive force in preventing the commission of an offence which would have the
effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter.

Held (Martland,
Ritchie and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Dickson,
Beetz, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: In Canada there is no “qualified” defence of
use of excessive force in the prevention of the commission of an offence which
would have the effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to
manslaughter. The effect of s. 27  is to justify the accused in committing
what would otherwise be an unlawful act. If in the opinion of the jury the
force used in preventing the commission of an offence was reasonable in all the
circumstances, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. If the s. 27 
defence fails, the jury should render the verdict which would have been
rendered, absent s. 27 . That will be murder if the accused had the
required intent. The proper verdict may be manslaughter not because of a
partial justification under s. 27  but because the special mental element
required for guilt of murder has not been proven. The

[Page 287]

half-way house is not to be found in
s. 27  but, if at all, in s. 212.

The trial judge’s charge to the jury was in
error. Firstly, the judge erred by charging the jury on self-defence under
s. 34 when there was no evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer
that the accused assisted in killing the victim under a reasonable apprehension
of death or grievous bodily harm. The judge charged the jury that if the
accused used more force than was reasonably necessary for self-defence, they
must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. In
devoting so much attention to self-defence the judge failed to direct attention
to the only possible ground of justification, namely s. 27  and the use of
force to prevent the commission of an offence.

Secondly, the charge on s. 27  was
inadequate. The judge failed to make clear that if justification under
s. 27  did not succeed, the verdict would be murder or manslaughter
depending upon the presence or absence of intent. There was evidence which put
the question of intent and the possibility of a manslaughter verdict in issue.

The jury were confused as to the distinction
between murder and manslaughter, twice asking for redirection. Only in the
second redirection did the judge state that “the difference between murder and
manslaughter is one of intent”. It is not clear that at this point in the
deliberations this statement was sufficient to overcome the confusion caused by
the other deficiencies in the charge.

Per Laskin
C.J. and McIntyre J.: The potential for confusion in the charge to the jury
warranted an order for a new trial. The trial judge erred in charging the jury
on s. 34 of the Code for the facts did not support the defence of self-defence.
The charge did not adequately deal with the s. 27  defence and did not
leave it clearly open to the jury that the verdict of manslaughter could be
returned in the absence of an intent to kill, despite the use of excessive
force.

Per Martland, Ritchie
and Estey JJ., dissenting: There is no “qualified” defence of the use of
excessive force in the prevention of an offence having the effect of reducing
what would otherwise be murder to man-

[Page 288]

slaughter. The charge to the jury contained
no errors sufficient to warrant the granting of a new trial. The respondent
could not properly complain of placing the issue of self-defence before the
jury for it was not prejudicial to him. The trial judge properly dealt with the
application of s. 27  for the factual background of the case did not
require the jury to be charged with respect to s. 21(b). The charge
adequately explained the difference between murder and manslaughter.

[R. v. McKay, [1957] V.R. 560; Brisson

APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court
of Appeal (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 525, 19 C.R. (3d) 222, 26 A.R. 212, allowing
respondent’s appeal from his conviction for murder and ordering a new trial.
Appeal dismissed, Martland, Ritchie and Estey JJ. dissenting.

B.R. Fraser, for the appellant.

Noel O’Brien, for the respondent.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and McIntyre J. were
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is a Crown appeal by
leave against a unanimous judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal, setting
aside but for different reasons in that Court, a conviction of murder. The
grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown are set out in the reasons herein
delivered by Dickson J. and I need not repeat them but to say only that they
relate to errors of the trial judge in directing the jury that excessive force
in preventing the commission of a crime against another will reduce a charge of
murder against an accused to manslaughter and that honest but mistaken belief
that no more force is being used than is necessary will likewise reduce murder
to manslaughter. Although there were other issues raised by the Crown
respecting self-defence, I am in agreement with Dickson J. that there was no
basis for self-defence and hence error of the trial judge in charging the jury
on Criminal Code , s. 34  which applies only where self-defence is an
issue.

[Page 289]

The members of the Alberta Court of Appeal,
McDermid, Moir and Prowse JJ.A., based themselves wholly on the issues noted
above respecting the reduction of murder to manslaughter and on justification
as it arises under Criminal Code , s. 27 . Error of the trial judge in
some of those respects was held to be sufficient to support an order for a new
trial. In view of the positions taken by the respondent in the appeal here, I
find it unnecessary to explore the different views upon which the members of
the Court of Appeal proceeded.

It is a well-established principle of our
criminal law that a respondent to an appeal here is entitled to hold a judgment
in his favour on any grounds available to that respondent which were raised
below and are accepted by this Court, notwithstanding that those grounds were
not supported below and the appellant has based the appeal here on completely
different grounds.

In the appeal to this Court, the respondent
relied on the trial judge’s failure to direct the jury properly on
justification, an issue which apparently influenced the order of the Alberta
Court of Appeal for a new trial.

More telling, however, for the accused
respondent was the error of the trial judge in charging on self-defence, which
was a non-issue, and in failing to deal adequately with the defence under
s. 27 of the Code, which was the only defence open to the accused.
She did not leave it clearly open to the jury that a manslaughter verdict could
be returned, even where excessive force had been used, if the jury doubted the
existence of an intent to kill. This omission, coupled with the misplaced
emphasis on self-defence under s. 34 of the Code, created
confusion, and I agree with Mr. Justice Dickson that, cumulatively, as a
result of the errors, there was such a potential for confusion as to warrant
the order for a new trial. In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 290]

The reasons of Martland, Ritchie and Estey JJ.
were delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—I am in
agreement with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Dickson that, in
relation to s. 27  of the Criminal Code , there does not exist a
“qualified” defence of the use of excessive force in the prevention of the commission
of an offence which would have the effect of reducing what would otherwise be
murder to manslaughter. I do not agree that, accepting that view of the law,
there were errors in the charge to the jury sufficient to warrant the granting
of a new trial.

It is said that there was error on the part of
the trial judge in charging the jury with respect to self-defence under
s. 34 of the Code. I agree that there was no evidence from which
the jury could reasonably infer that the respondent, when he assisted in
killing Powley, did so under a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous
bodily harm, or that he reasonably believed he could not otherwise save himself
from bodily injury. However, the issue of self-defence was raised when it was
suggested that the respondent acted after Powley had lunged at him with a
broken bottle. The trial judge felt that the respondent was entitled to have
that defence put before the jury.

The charge in relation to s. 34  was not
prejudicial to the respondent and it was favourable to him in that the jury was
directed that if more force was used than was reasonably necessary for the
respondent to defend himself, the jury should find the accused not guilty of
murder, but guilty of manslaughter. In my opinion the placing before the jury
of the issue of self-defence was not something about which the respondent can
properly complain and it was not an error which should result in a new trial.

The only defence upon which the respondent
sought to rely which has real substance is that which is provided in s. 27
of the Code:

27. Every
one is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary

(a) to prevent the commission
of an offence

[Page 291]

(i) for which, if it were committed, the
person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and

(ii) that would be likely to cause
immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone; or

(b) to prevent anything being
done that, on reasonable and probable grounds he believes would, if it were
done be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).

In my opinion this defence was properly placed
before the jury in the charge. The trial judge said:

The second defence of justification raised
by the accused is that of preventing the commission of an offence. The Criminal
Code  provides that “Everyone is justified in using as much force as is
reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence for which, if it
were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant
and that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or
property of anyone”. The offence of assault causing bodily harm is one for
which a person may be arrested without a warrant, so that you need not concern
yourselves with this aspect of the defence. You must consider whether the
accused acted to prevent the commission of an offence, the offence of assault
causing bodily harm, and whether this offence was likely to cause immediate and
serious injury to the person of Paul Racz. If you are satisfied that they did
not, then, you should reject this defence. If you are satisfied or if you have
a reasonable doubt that the accused acted in this manner, then, you must
consider whether they used no more force than was reasonably necessary under
the circumstances.

The evidence in the statements of the
accused and in the testimony of the accused Gee indicates that when the fight
broke out initially they ran. When they returned to the bedroom, they found
Racz and Powley in the struggle that you have heard described and both were
covered with blood. They have indicated repeatedly,—I don’t think I need to
review the evidence in this regard. It runs throughout the statements and
through the evidence of Gee and you will have the statements with you so that
you can examine them. The theme runs throughout the statements and in the
evidence of the accused Gee that they were afraid that Powley was

[Page 292]

going to cause serious harm to Racz or to
kill him. Again, you should consider that they had some knowledge of Powley’s
background with respect to sadism. You should consider the circumstances in
which they found themselves and their mental condition. Under all of these
circumstances, you must consider whether they acted to prevent Powley from
causing bodily harm by assaulting Racz. You must then consider whether the
force that they used was reasonably necessary.

If you are satisfied that this defence has
been established or if you have a reasonable doubt with respect to it, you must
find the accused not guilty of murder.

The factual background of this case did not
require the trial judge to charge the jury in respect of para. (b)
of s. 27 . The evidence submitted on behalf of the defence was that the
respondent, and his co-accused Susan Fife, inflicted repeated blows on the
deceased, Powley, in order to assist and protect their friend, Racz, with whom
Powley was fighting. Their efforts, according to this evidence, were directed
toward preventing the continuation of an assault by Powley, who was armed with
a broken bottle.

This evidence relates to the prevention of a
crime under para. (a). It relates to the prevention of a
continuing assault on Powley. It does not relate to the prevention of an
assault, which is the situation contemplated by para. (b).

In her recharge to the jury, the trial judge said:

Ladies and gentlemen, I have received a
question from you indicating that you wish described in clear and defined in
clear and concise terms culpable homicide, second degree murder and
manslaughter.

With respect to culpable homicide, a person
commits culpable homicide when he causes the death of a human being by means of
an unlawful act. With respect to murder, culpable homicide is murder—and I
think I advised you previously that you can disregard the phrase second degree,
it is not of significance with respect to your deliberations. Culpable homicide
is murder where the person who causes the death of a human being means to cause
his death or means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause
his death and is reckless whether death ensues or not. With respect to
manslaughter, culpable homicide that is not murder is

[Page 293]

manslaughter. Perhaps, I can assist you
further. There are four circumstances under which you must find the accused not
guilty of murder period. If you have even a reasonable doubt that the accused
committed culpable homicide, you must find them not guilty of murder. If you
have even a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of self-defence, you
must find them not guilty of murder. If you have even a reasonable doubt with
respect to the defence of acting to prevent the commission of an offence, you
should find them not guilty of murder. If you have even a reasonable doubt with
respect to the defence of necessity, you must find them not guilty of murder.

There are three circumstances under which
you must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. If
you have a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of self-defence, but
are satisfied that more force was used than was necessary, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you have even a
reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of provocation, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you are satisfied
that the accused committed culpable homicide, but have a reasonable doubt with
respect to whether they committed murder, then you must find the accused not
guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter.

It is put against the trial judge that, in the
second paragraph of this passage she did not refer to s. 27 . The reason
for this is that, in the first paragraph of the passage, the trial judge lists
four circumstances in which, as she puts it, “you must find the accused not
guilty of murder period”. One of these circumstances was the s. 27  defence
“If you have even a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of acting to
prevent the commission of an offence, you should find them not guilty of
murder”.

The second paragraph deals with those situations
in which the jury may find the accused not guilty of murder, but guilty of
manslaughter. The defence under s. 27  does not appear here because the
trial judge was of the view, which I share, that

[Page 294]

there is no qualified defence of the use of
excessive force to prevent the commission of a crime which would have the
effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter.

The trial judge had already dealt, and in my
opinion properly, with the necessity for proof of intent in order to establish
a charge of murder. In the first paragraph of the passage above quoted she
said: “Culpable homicide is murder where the person who causes the death of a
human being means to cause his death or means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not.
With respect to manslaughter, culpable homicide that is not murder is
manslaughter”.

In a further recharge she said:

Murder can be committed in two ways. First,
a person commits murder when he causes the death of a human being by means of
an unlawful act and means to cause his death. Secondly, a person commits murder
when he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act and means
to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death and is
reckless whether death ensues or not. I will repeat that. A person commits
murder when he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act
and means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death
and is reckless whether death ensues or not. A person commits manslaughter when
he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act. The
difference between murder and manslaughter is one of intent. I can repeat for
you what I said with respect to manslaughter. A person commits manslaughter
when he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act.

In my opinion the trial judge in her charge
dealt properly with the application of s. 27  and with the difference
between murder and manslaughter. Section 27  provides, where applicable, an
absolute defence. If unreasonable force is used to prevent the commission of a
crime, s. 27  is inapplicable

[Page 295]

and, in such a case, the section does not
operate to reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter. On the facts of the
present case the only way in which a verdict of manslaughter could have been
rendered would have been on the basis of lack of intent to commit murder or on
the basis of provocation. Both of those possibilities were, in my opinion,
properly submitted to the jury.

In the result, it is my opinion that there were
no errors in the charge to the jury which were prejudicial to the accused. The
appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set
aside and the verdict at trial should be restored.

The judgment of Dickson, Beetz, Chouinard and
Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question in this case is whether
there exists in Canada a “qualified” defence of use of excessive force in
preventing the commission of an offence which would have the effect of reducing
what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter. The question arises in respect
of s. 27  of the Criminal Code  which reads:

27. Every
one is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary

(a) to prevent the commission of an
offence

(i) for which, if it were committed, the
person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and

(ii) that would be likely to cause
immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone; or

(b) to prevent anything being
done that, on reasonable and probable grounds he believes would, if it were
done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).

I

The Facts

The respondent Gee and one Susan Fife were
charged that they did unlawfully kill David Powley and thereby commit second
degree murder contrary to the Criminal Code . They were tried before a
jury, convicted as charged and sentenced to life

[Page 296]

imprisonment without eligibility for parole for
ten years.

On the evening of November 15, 1978, Gee, a male
prostitute and female impersonator, Fife, a prostitute, and one Paul Racz met
at Gee’s house for drinks before going into the street for the purposes of
prostitution. As the weather was inclement the respondent made arrangements for
the three of them to go to the home of the deceased, David Powley, who was
known to the respondent and described by him as a “kinky trick who had lots of
money”. When they arrived they had some more drinks at the bar and then
proceeded to an upstairs bedroom. What happened thereafter is described in a
statement given by the respondent to the police, a short resumé of which is as
follows. Powley suggested that Racz dress up in women’s lingerie which Racz
hesitatingly agreed to do. Gee and Fife looked for other lingerie. The
statement continues: “The next thing I knew, I heard a smash and we turned
around and David and Paul were wrestling. I think Paul tried to knock him out
by hitting him over the head with a bottle”. Gee and Fife struck Powley over
the head numerous times with objects, including bottles, a frying pan and a
lamp. When they ceased Powley was dead. The theory of the Crown was that the
killing was the result of a planned robbery which Powley had resisted. The
theory of the defence was that Powley attacked Racz and was committing an
assault upon him; the respondent and Fife were attempting to prevent the
commission of that offence and killed Powley in the process.

II

The Alberta Court of Appeal

All three judges of the Alberta Court of Appeal,
for reasons which were by no means concordant, allowed the respondent’s appeal
and directed a new trial. McDermid J.A. accepted the law in Canada to be as in
Australia and that the honest although mistaken belief that no more force is
being used than is necessary is a defence that reduces what would otherwise be murder
to manslaughter and that such defence is applicable by virtue of s. 7(3) 
of the Criminal Code  to the

[Page 297]

defence of self-defence. Mr. Justice
McDermid held that this reduction from murder to manslaughter is applicable
also where the defence is that the force used is to prevent the commission of a
crime. He found the justification for this reduction of murder to manslaughter
in the lesser degree of “moral culpability” of a person who uses more force
than is necessary but not more force than he honestly but mistakenly believes
is necessary, to prevent the commission of a violent crime.

If I understand his judgment correctly,
Mr. Justice Prowse purports to deal with the question on the basis of the mens
rea required for murder; a person who honestly, but erroneously, believes
that the force he is using is reasonable lacks the necessary intent for murder.
Mr. Justice Moir agreed with Justice Prowse’s conclusion but not his
reasoning. He based his judgment upon the fact that “even though there was an
intent to kill or injure it may be excused or forgiven because of the
surrounding mitigating circumstances” and hence the possibility of reducing the
charge of murder to manslaughter should be considered. An accused might apply
force knowing that the result would be death or grievous bodily injury. In this
sense, the accused would fall prima facie within the definition of
murder in s. 212. However, if the accused applied force under the honest
belief that it was necessary, then he could not be guilty of murder. Further,
it does not appear that this belief need be reasonably held. In these
circumstances the jury should ‘reduce’ the charge of murder to one of
manslaughter.

The issue raised by all three justices in the
Court of Appeal is whether murder is reduced to manslaughter when the defence
of justification in preventing the commission of a crime is advanced, and
excessive force is used. This is the first time in Canada, so far as I am
aware, that a partial defence under s. 27 of the Code has been
allowed to reduce what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter. The defence
of justification pursuant to s. 27  has hitherto been regarded as a total

[Page 298]

defence, entitling the accused to acquittal, or
no defence at all. There has been no half-way house.

III

The Crown appellant defined the issues on the
appeal as follows:

[1.] Did the Court of Appeal err in law in
holding that the common law concept of excessive force coupled with
self-defence reducing murder to manslaughter as developed in the law of Australia,
is applicable to a defence of justification in preventing the commission of an
offence and therefore the direction given to the jury constituted error in law
amounting to misdirection?

[2.] Did the Court of Appeal err in law in
holding that the law is the same in Canada as in Australia and that the honest
although mistaken belief that no more force is being used than is necessary is
a defence that reduces what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter and that
such defence is applicable by virtue of section 7(3)  of the Criminal
Code  to the defence of self-defence and therefore the direction given to
the jury constituted error in law amounting to misdirection?

[3.] Did the Court of Appeal err in holding
that excessive force used in self-defence or justification excuses murder and
reduces the crime to one of manslaughter even though the accused had the intent
to kill or injure and therefore the direction given to the jury constituted
error in law amounting to misdirection?

[4.] Did the Court of Appeal err in holding
that if the jury concludes the accused killed the victim and finds against the
accused on the issue of self-defence, then the issue of manslaughter should be
left with the jury with the following direction:

“if you believe the accused was acting
under a reasonable apprehension that another would suffer death or grievous
bodily harm, or if you are left with a reasonable doubt on the issue, then, if
the accused fails on the issue of self‑defence only because you conclude
that he used more force than reasonable in all the circumstances, you should
bring in a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.”

[Page 299]

and failure to do so constituted error in
law amounting to misdirection.

IV

The argument centered on the question of whether
excessive use of force in self-defence could reduce what would otherwise be
murder to manslaughter. The Crown appellant argued for a negative response. The
respondent Gee argued in the affirmative.

Australian, English and Canadian cases were
discussed at some length, in the context of the defence of self-defence,
although we are here concerned, not with a case of self-defence but excessive
force in the prevention of the commission of an indictable offence, that is to
say, to prevent the deceased Powley from continuing an aggravated assault upon
Racz. It is well to note the difference in statutory language between
s. 34 of the Code, self-defence, and s. 27 of the Code which
I have earlier set forth. Section 34  reads:

34. (1)
Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is
justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to
cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable
him to defend himself.

(2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted
and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is
justified if

(a) he causes it under
reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with
which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his
purposes, and

(b) he believes, on
reasonable and probable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from
death or grievous bodily harm.

The qualified defence of excessive force in
self-defence has been developed in some common law criminal jurisdictions and
has been applied by analogy to the defence of prevention of commission of a
crime (see R. v. McKay, [1957] V.R. 560). The gist of the respondent’s
argument is that, should a qualified defence of excessive force in self-defence
exist in Canada, by analogy, a qualified defence of excessive force in the
prevention of an offence should also be admitted. Such

[Page 300]

an analogy, however, may be more difficult to
make in a jurisdiction possessing a criminal code, as in Canada, where the two
defences are contained in two differently worded statutory provisions.

In the case of Brisson v. The Queen, [1982]
2 S.C.R. 227 judgment delivered concurrently herewith, I have expressed the
opinion that excessive force in self-defence, unless related to intent under
s. 212 of the Code or to provocation, does not reduce murder to
manslaughter. As I emphasized in the reasons in Brisson the distinction
between murder or manslaughter is one of intent. Intent is an element of the
offence of murder under s. 212  of the Criminal Code . A
determination with respect to the presence or absence of this intent must
underlie any consideration of the existence of a defence or justification. It
is the nature of the offence which determines what possible defences may be
open to the accused. For example, a “defence” of provocation under s. 215 
of the Criminal Code  is unnecessary where there is a finding of absence
of intent under s. 212 . The offence having been characterized as
manslaughter due to the absence of intent under s. 212 , it is simply
unnecessary to invoke a “defence” such as provocation which reduces murder to
manslaughter. Similarly, it is crucial to have characterized the offence as
murder or manslaughter before turning to s. 27 of the Code, the
defence of prevention of commission of an offence.

The starting point, in my view, is s. 212
of the Code combined with s. 205. According to the Code, s.
205, a person commits homicide, whether directly or indirectly, by any means
when he causes the death of a human being. Homicide is culpable or not
culpable. Homicide that is not culpable is not an offence. Culpable homicide is
murder or manslaughter when he causes the death of a human being in one of four
ways, of which s. 205(5)(a) is, for present purposes, relevant, “by
means of an unlawful act”. The effect of s. 27  is to justify the accused
in committing what would

[Page 301]

otherwise be an unlawful act. It makes lawful
what would otherwise be unlawful.

Turning then to s. 212 . Culpable homicide
is murder when the person who causes the death of a human being means to cause
death or means to cause bodily harm or knows that he will cause bodily harm and
is reckless whether death ensues or not.

Absent that intent, culpable homicide is
manslaughter or infanticide. The killing cannot be murder in the absence of
proof of intent required under s. 212 (a) of the Criminal Code  and
that intent may not be inferred merely from the fact of the killing. If the
Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt a killing with such intent, or an
unlawful killing without such intent, i.e. the ingredients of murder or
manslaughter, respectively, it is then open to the accused to call in aid
s. 27 of the Code which I repeat for ease of reference:

27. Every
one is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary

(a) to prevent the commission of an
offence

(i) for which, if it were committed, the
person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and

(ii) that would be likely to cause
immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone; or

(b) to prevent anything being
done that, on reasonable or probable grounds he believes would, if it were
done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).

This section allows a justification for as
much force as is reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an
indictable offence. The section clearly contemplates the possibility of a
killing and can even extend its justification to killing with intent to kill,
if it is reasonably necessary. The question whether such force was or was not
reasonably necessary is one for the jury. If the force is reasonable in all the
circumstances the accused is entitled to an acquittal; if not, he is in my view

[Page 302]

guilty of murder if he has the required intent.
The jury function in applying the reasonableness test in the administration of
justice is stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed.), vol. 11, at
p. 630 as follows:

In determining whether the force used was
reasonable the court will take into account all the circumstances of the case,
including the nature and degree of force used, the seriousness of the evil to
be prevented and the possibility of preventing it by other means. This
provision is of general application and is not limited to arrestable or any
other class of offences, but it would not be reasonable to use even slight
force to prevent very trivial offences. The circumstances in which it can be
considered reasonable to kill another in the prevention of crime must be of an
extreme kind; they could probably arise only in the case of an attack against
the person which is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury and where
killing the attacker is the only practicable means of preventing the harm. It
cannot be reasonable to kill another merely to prevent a crime which is
directed only against property.

Section 26 of the Code should be read in
conjunction with the passage from Halsbury. Section 26 provides that everyone
who is authorized to use force is criminally responsible for any excess thereof
according to the nature and quality of the act that constitutes the excess.

In my view, it cannot be said that force can be
partially justified. Success under s. 27  leads to acquittal. If the
defence under s. 27  does not succeed, the jury should render the verdict
which would have been rendered, absent s. 27 . This may be a verdict of
manslaughter, not because of partial justification under s. 27  but because
the special mental element required for guilt of murder has not been proven. In
other words, the half-way house is not to be found in s. 27  but, if at
all, in s. 212 .

For the above reasons I am of the opinion that
there does not exist in Canada a “qualified” defence of use of excessive force
in the prevention of the commission of an offence which would have

[Page 303]

the effect of reducing what would otherwise be
murder to manslaughter.

V

Charge to the Jury

Let me say immediately that the task of the
trial judge in charging the jury was by no means an easy one, having regard to
the uncertain state of the law at the time of trial and the generally prevailing
view that the principles applicable to the defences of self-defence and
prevention of the commission of a crime were, despite different statutory
provisions, to be found in the common law and were, to all intents, identical.

In my view the trial judge erred in two
respects, first, in charging on s. 34 of the Code and second, in
the inadequacy of the charge on s. 27 of the Code. There was no
evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably infer that Gee, when
he assisted in killing Powley, did so under a reasonable apprehension of death
or grievous bodily harm or that he reasonably believed that he could not
otherwise save himself from bodily injury. Gee was entitled to have the jury
pass upon all his alternative defences but only where a foundation of fact
would give a reality to the defence. The only evidence to which the trial judge
referred was that both Gee and Racz had testified that Powley lunged at Gee and
kicked Fife. But as the trial judge herself observed, “Now, I think it is quite
clear that he [Powley] was not able to get away from Racz so that he could not
have carried out his purpose at the time in question”. Additionally, Gee
testified that following the lunge by Powley he, Gee, “ran right out of the
room”. The possibility of an encounter endangering Gee had therefore terminated
and with it any basis for a plea of self-defence. It was later, on his way
downstairs, that Gee heard a smash. He ran to the bar, grabbed a bottle, ran
upstairs and “smashed him [Powley] over the head with this bottle”.

[Page 304]

The judge charged at length on self-defence. In
so doing she instructed the jury that if they were of the view that the accused
used more force than was reasonably necessary to enable them to defend
themselves, the jury must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter. To this extent the charge was unduly favourable to the accused.
In devoting so much attention to self-defence the judge failed, however, to
direct adequate attention to the only possible ground of justification, namely
s. 27 , and the use of force to prevent the commission of an offence.

The charge on s. 27  was inadequate.
Reference was made only to s. 27 (a) and not to s. 21(b).
The jury was instructed that if “they were satisfied that the defence had
been established or if they had a reasonable doubt with respect to it they must
find the accused not guilty of murder”. The judge failed to instruct the jury
as to what would be the result if the accused failed in the defence under
s. 27 . On the recharge the judge stated, at p. 967 [of the Case on
Appeal]:

There are three circumstances under which
you must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. If
you have a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of self-defence, but
are satisfied that more force was used than was necessary, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you have even a
reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of provocation, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you are satisfied
that the accused committed culpable homicide, but have a reasonable doubt with
respect to whether they committed murder, then you must find the accused not
guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter.

There is reference in the passage to excessive
force in self-defence and to provocation but no reference to s. 27 . It is
not made clear that if justification under s. 27  did not succeed the
verdict would be murder or manslaughter depending upon the presence or absence
of intent under s. 212 . Gee testified that he told Susan Fife not to stab
Powley and “only to try and knock him out”. The question of intent and the
possibility of a manslaughter

[Page 305]

verdict if s. 27  failed was therefore in
issue. The judge did not at any time relate s. 27  to absence of intent.

The jury were confused as to the distinction
between murder and manslaughter. In the course of their deliberations they
asked twice for a redirection with respect to the distinction. Only in the
second redirection did the trial judge specifically state that “The difference
between murder and manslaughter is one of intent”. I am not convinced that at
this point in the deliberations this statement of the distinction was
sufficient to overcome the deficiencies in the charge as a whole, especially
when, as here, the charge has been complicated by the introduction of the
defence of self-defence and the erroneous concept as to the “qualified” defence
of excessive force reducing murder to manslaughter in that part of the charge.
The result was to introduce a potential for confusion, the full effect of which
no one can assess, and to divert attention from s. 212  and the potentially
broad scope of s. 27 of the Code.

In the result I would dismiss the appeal and confirm
the order for a new trial but for the reasons given above.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Appeal—Criminal law—Supreme Court of Canada
jurisdiction—Whether jurisdiction to entertain appeal against sentence—Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19 as amended, s. 41—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34 as amended, ss. 614, 618.

Criminal law—Indictable offence—Plea of
guilty—Sentencing—Proper standard of proof of disputed aggravating facts.

Following respondent’s guilty plea, the trial judge, in the
course of sentencing, assessed conflicting testimony given by the victim and
the respondent as to the gravity of the offence. He found that the Crown need
only prove the aggravating facts on a balance of probabilities, accepted the
victim’s version and sentenced the respondent. The Court of Appeal allowed
respondent’s appeal holding that the Crown must prove the aggravating facts
beyond a reasonable doubt and reduced the sentence. This appeal raises two
issues: (1) whether the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to entertain
appeals arising out of sentencing and (2) if so, whether the Crown must prove
aggravating facts beyond a reasonable doubt or upon a balance of probabilities.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Estey and McIntyre JJ. dissenting
as to jurisdiction): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Ritchie, Dickson and Chouinard JJ.:
Appeals against sentence are included under s. 41(1) and not excluded by s.
41(3) of the Supreme Court Act. An expansive reading of s. 41(1) enables
this Court to discharge its role better. Although the Court has the
jurisdiction to assess fitness or quantum of sentence, as a matter of policy it
should not do so. The rule against assessing fitness does not, however, exclude
the assessment of important questions of law arising out of sen-

[Page 369]

tencing. The leave granting process is available to screen out
these cases which do not give rise to legal issues of high importance. In this
case the question of the proper standard of proof raises an issue of the
legality, not the fitness of the sentence.

In deciding disputed facts in sentencing, a trial judge should
not depart from the traditional criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. Sentencing is the critical stage of the criminal process. Facts which
justify the sanction are no less important than facts which justify the
conviction. Crime and punishment are inextricably linked. Both the informality
of the sentencing procedure as to the admissibility of evidence and the wide
discretion given to the trial judge in imposing sentence militate in favour of
the retention of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Per Laskin C.J. and Estey and McIntyre JJ. (dissenting):
This Court has no appellate jurisdiction to assess the quantum of a sentence
and cannot acquire it by reason of alleged errors in the courts below in
arriving at or in fixing the quantum. Here, the sentence imposed by the trial
judge and reduced by the Court of Appeal was within the statutory limits of the
offence. There was no question of legality—in the sense of the legal right to
impose the particular sentence—or of constitutionality. This Court is a
statutory court with circumscribed jurisdiction in criminal matters (s. 618 Cr.
C) and s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act should not be opened to
matters outside of the Criminal Code  unless they relate to
constitutionality or legality.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
(1979), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 183, allowing respondent’s appeal from the sentence
imposed following his plea of guilty of a charge of assault causing bodily
harm. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Estey and McIntyre JJ. dissenting on
the question of jurisdiction.

S. Casey Hill, for the appellant.

Clayton C. Ruby, for the respondent.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Estey and McIntyre JJ. were
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This case raises an
important question of jurisdiction, a question that is open notwithstanding
that leave to appeal has been given: R. v. Warner, [1961] S.C.R.
144; R. v. J. Alepin Frères Ltée, [1965] S.C.R. 359; R. v.
MacDonald, [1965] S.C.R. 831. The jurisdictional issue, raised by the
Court suo motu, is simply whether this Court, a statutory Court, is
entitled to entertain an appeal as to the proper standard of proof of disputed
facts in a sentencing proceeding in respect of an indictable offence to which
the accused pleaded guilty.

Counsel for the parties were alerted in advance that jurisdiction
would be put in issue when the appeal came on for hearing, notwithstanding that
the matter was not raised on the application for leave to appeal nor considered
by them in their factums. However, after argument on jurisdiction the Court
reserved judgment and felt it advisable to hear the parties on the merits since
they had prepared their submissions without concern for jurisdiction, relying,
of course, on the fact that leave to appeal had been given. Judgment was also
reserved on the merits but they will only be reached if jurisdiction exists,
and so I turn to consider that question. I should say at the outset that this
is a case which both the Crown appellant and the respondent wish to have
decided on the merits, and they joined in contending that this Court had
jurisdiction to that end.

It has been and is the view of this Court that it has no
jurisdiction to deal with the quantum of a sentence, whether too heavy a
penalty was imposed or too light a penalty, so long as it was within the
statutory limits. This follows from s. 618  of the Criminal Code  in
respect of sentences for indictable offences and from the view taken of s.
41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19 in respect of the
quantum of a sentence imposed upon a summary conviction. Moreover, this Court
has not viewed its general jurisdictional authority in appeals under s. 41(1)
of the Supreme Court Act

[Page 372]

as empowering it to entertain appeals as to the quantum of a
legal sentence, although as Cartwright C.J. noted in R. v. MacDonald,
supra, at p. 842, the words of the subsection are literally wide
enough to embrace such appeals. Section 41(1) in its present formulation
reads as follows:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal
lies to the Supreme Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court
of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had
in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or
not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court,
where, with respect to the particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme
Court is of the opinion that any question involved therein is, by reason of its
public importance or the importance of any issue of law or any issue of mixed
law and fact involved in such question, one that ought to be decided by the
Supreme Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or significance as
to warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from such judgment is
accordingly granted by the Supreme Court.

I would refer also to s. 41(3) which is in these words:

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this
section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting
aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or,
except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other
than an indictable offence.

It is only fair to say that there has been no consistency in this
Court in its approach to sentence questions, whether arising in relation to a
sentence upon a conviction of an indictable offence or arising in relation to a
sentence of preventive detention upon a finding that an accused is an habitual
criminal. I shall come to the authorities shortly, but the important point to
note in respect of what I have called inconsistency is that the issue of
quantum appears to have been suppressed in some instances when it has been
alleged that a question of law has arisen in a sentence proceeding, as it is
alleged to arise here in respect of the proper standard of proof to be met by
the Crown when seeking a heavier sentence because of

[Page 373]

aggravating circumstances which are disputed.

There is a central and, to me, a dominating point to be made. If
this Court, as is conceded, has no appellate jurisdiction to assess the quantum
of a sentence simpliciter, I do not see how it can acquire it by reason
of alleged errors in the courts below in arriving at or in fixing quantum.
There is some analogy here—I do not press it as perfect—with administrative law
cases where, in order to overcome the effect of a privative clause, errors in
the course of a proceeding are raised to the stature of jurisdictional errors
when it is clear that the statutory body had jurisdiction to deal with the
issues before it and was entitled to be wrong without courting review for
errors of law.

A provincial court of appeal has jurisdiction, expressly given,
to entertain an appeal against sentence upon a conviction of an indictable
offence if leave to appeal is given by the court or a judge thereof, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law: see Criminal Code , s. 603(1) (b) and
s. 605(1) (b). Leave is generally sought at the time a sentence appeal
comes on for hearing, and it is rarely refused. That, at least, was my own
experience as a member of the Ontario Court of Appeal for almost five years.
Rules of Court govern the procedure on appeal and the time period within which
leave must be sought, but the time may be extended: see Criminal Code , s.
607(1)  and (2) . Excessive delay may well be a ground for refusing leave or
refusing to extend the time but this, I understand, is not frequent. The courts
of appeal prefer, in the interests of fairness, to dispose of sentence appeals
on their merits. There is no such general appellate authority in respect of
sentence conferred upon the Supreme Court of Canada.

The leading case in this Court on sentence appeals under the
equivalent of our present statu-

[Page 374]

tory authority has been Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960]
S.C.R. 60. It was distinguished, and in my opinion properly so, in Hill v.
The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 827; and on a rehearing, Hill v. The
Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 827, which I will consider in due course. In the Hill
cases, Pigeon J. spoke for the whole Court on the question of its jurisdiction
to entertain an appeal from a determination of the provincial Court of Appeal
that it had the power to increase a sentence imposed upon an accused upon a
motion to that end by the Crown made during the hearing of a sentence appeal by
the accused alone. Although I was in a minority of four on the question of the
Court of Appeal’s power, I subscribed fully to the view expressed by Pigeon J.
that this Court had jurisdiction because it was not called on to deal with a
sentence appeal but with the legal authority of the provincial court of appeal.
In the course of his reasons, Pigeon J. canvassed the cases on the issue now
before us and he has, in so doing, relieved me of the necessity of going
through them as meticulously as he did. Nonetheless, I do wish to review them
to provide perspective for the present case.

Goldhar was an application for leave to appeal heard by a
Bench of five. Fauteux J., as he then was, delivered the judgment of the Court
(Cartwright J., as he then was, alone dissenting) and he held that this Court
had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed on a
conviction of an indictable offence. I disagree with Pigeon J.’s observation in
the Hill cases that Goldhar was not binding and should not be
followed. Although I said in my reasons in the first Hill hearing, at p.
830, that I agreed with Pigeon J. that Goldhar should be overruled, this
was only in the context of the issue in the Hill case and only in so far
as Goldhar might be taken as prohibiting an appeal to this Court on the
legality of a sentence or on the power of a Court to increase a sentence
against which no appeal was taken. I can agree that Goldhar was not
binding (none of our decisions now are, theoretically, binding) but it was
unnecessary to say that it should not be followed when the Hill cases
were of a completely

[Page 375]

different order than Goldhar.

Goldhar was decided at a time when the Supreme Court
Act contained as s. 41(1) a provision which, for present purposes, was
similar to the present section above quoted. It was preceded by Goldhamer
v. The King, [1924] S.C.R. 290, an easier case for rejecting jurisdiction
as to sentence, because when it was decided there was no provision in the Supreme
Court Act conferring jurisdiction on this Court in criminal matters, nor
was the Act even neutral as it now literally is, because it expressly excluded
criminal causes from its conferment of appellate jurisdiction. Reliance had to
be placed therefore on the then equivalent of the present s. 618  which spoke, inter
alia, of appeals by leave from judgments setting aside or affirming a
conviction of an indictable offence. Hence, jurisdiction was denied to
entertain an appeal from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal increasing a
sentence. Goldhamer was, quite clearly, an easier case for refusal of
jurisdiction than Goldhar.

Prior to Goldhar but after the introduction of s. 41(1)
jurisdiction, this Court was called on to deal with an application for leave to
appeal in Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, [1956]
S.C.R. 303, reported on the merits only. Pigeon J.’s research in the Hill cases
disclosed that the question of the Court’s jurisdiction was raised on the
application for leave and, indeed, there was re-argument before leave to appeal
was granted, the Court’s Minute Book carrying a note that the majority of the
Court was of the opinion that it had jurisdiction. What was put in issue in the
Goodyear Tire case was an order of prohibition under the Combines
Investigation Act following a conviction upon an indictment for an offence
under the Act. The Court of Appeal of Ontario

[Page 376]

treated the appeal to it as a sentence appeal, under a relevant
definition, and it is clear that the appeal to this Court was pursuant to s. 41
of the Supreme Court Act. In so far as Pigeon J. intimates in the Hill
cases that this Court was giving leave in a sentence matter, I disagree
with him. The real issue in this Court in the Goodyear Tire case was the
constitutionality of a prohibitory order forbidding the repetition of the
offence of which the corporation had been convicted. That was surely a question
within the competence of this Court, and the granting of leave had nothing to
do with the fact that the prohibitory order was characterized as a sentence for
the purposes of an appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal.

Paul v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 452 was decided
shortly after Goldhar and it affirmed the principle of Goldhar in
relation to a summary conviction matter that cases which fell outside of s. 41(3)
were not on that account brought within s. 41(1), any more than were cases of
indictable offences which fell outside of what is now s. 618  of the Criminal
Code . Paul v. The Queen was not an attempted sentence appeal in the
same sense as Goldhar but was rather a case where the provincial Court
of Appeal refused to hear an appeal in respect of a summary conviction or,
alternatively, refused to hear an appeal from the dismissal of an appeal in the
matter to a County Court Judge. As such, notwithstanding that it was a bare
majority decision, it is squarely within this Court’s plurality decision in Ernewein
v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 639 where
this Court held that it had no jurisdiction to give leave to appeal from a
decision of the Federal Court of Appeal from the latter’s refusal to grant
leave to it where such leave was required to entitle that Court to deal with
the case. Hence, the denial of leave in the Paul case does not, under
our present view, depend on whether a matter of sentence is involved but would
equally result where required leave to appeal on any matter is denied by an
appellate

[Page 377]

Court and it is sought to bring the matter here.

The same ruling, denial of leave, that was made in Paul was
made in R. v. J. Alepin Frères Ltêe, [1965] S.C.R. 359.
This Court affirmed again in the proposition that matters not mentioned in s.
41(3) are not thereby brought within s. 41(1) and thus sentence appeals are
excluded.

Before turning to the latest case on sentence appeals in this
Court, Lees v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 749, a short summation
is in order. The quantum or fitness of a sentence, as such, no other
considerations being involved, does not engage the jurisdiction of this Court.
This was re-affirmed in the Hill cases by Pigeon J. However, quantum or
fitness is not involved where the Court is asked to consider the legality of a
sentence, legality in the sense of the legal right to impose the particular
sentence as contrasted with the imposition of a lawful sentence which is
alleged to have been the result of errors of law in determining its fitness. So
too, quantum is not involved where the constitutionality of a certain type of
sentence is put in issue. Nor is it involved where the Court is asked, in the Hill
cases, whether there is power in a provincial appellate court to increase a
sentence upon a motion by the Crown made during a sentence appeal taken by the
accused alone, there having been no cross-appeal by the Crown. In such cases,
the question is one of judicial or legislative authority to act and not one
whether, there being such authority, it was improperly exercised.

Another type of case which can properly rest on s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act is Smith v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 638 where this
Court granted leave to appeal from the dismissal of an application for certiorari
to quash a finding of delinquency against a child under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. The appeal was allowed and it is

[Page 378]

clear that s. 41(1) was an appropriate base for hearing the
appeal which concerned a substantive matter. Leave could have been refused as a
matter of discretion but jurisdiction to grant it was beyond question.

Since s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act is couched in very
broad terms and it is, in effect, left to this Court to determine the ambit of
its provisions, why should this Court set its face against entertaining
applications for leave to appeal from sentencing considerations? The ordinary
expectation would be that provisions to that end, if thought desirable, would
be found in the Criminal Code . They are not, and I think that Fauteux J.
demonstrated sufficiently in Goldhar why it would be improper to escape
the limitations of what is now s. 618  of the Criminal Code  by resorting
to s. 41(1). The question, in so far as it is one of policy, is answered by the
fact that this Court is a statutory court, with a circumscribed jurisdiction in
criminal matters, and s. 41(1) should not be opened to matters outside of the Criminal
Code  unless they relate to such things as constitutionality or judicial
power or authority.

Lees v. The Queen appears to be out of step with
the authorities that I have canvassed to this point. I was a member of the
Court which delivered a unanimous judgment in that case. The opening line of
the judgment assesses the appeal as one attacking the legality of a sentence
but the narrative of the case shows that it was not legality as I explained
above, but rather an attack on a lawful sentence allegedly imposed by the trial
judge by erroneously taking into account evidence of a potential but untried
charge of an offence other than the robbery to which the accused pleaded
guilty. Although in the result the appeal was dismissed, jurisdiction was
nonetheless taken and, wrongly so, in the light of the cases that I have
examined in these reasons.

[Page 379]

I examined the material filed on the application for leave to
appeal in the Lees case, an application upon which I sat along with
Dickson and Estey JJ. Our jurisdiction to give leave, that is to entertain the
proposed appeal, was not raised either in the application for leave or in the
material or argument presented at the hearing of the appeal. I readily confess
to a lapse in not raising the question from the Bench, either when leave was
sought or when the appeal was heard. In my opinion, we were wrong to have
accepted the case for hearing when we had no jurisdiction to do so.

The present case cannot, any more than the Lees case, be
considered as one where the legality of a sentence is in issue. The trial
judge, in imposing a term of imprisonment of four and one-half years, was
within the sentence limits of the offence, and so was the Court of Appeal in
reducing the sentence to two years. There is no question of legality here as
there was in the Hill cases or of constitutionality as there was in the Goodyear
Tire case. Rather, the question in the present case was whether the trial
judge, in imposing sentence, must be governed by a standard of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt on disputed facts and not merely by a standard of proof on a
balance of probabilities. By thus judicializing the sentencing proceedings, do
we bring a quantum case within the jurisdiction of this Court under s. 41(1) of
the Supreme Court Act? If with respect to the standard of proof as here
or with respect to the error alleged in the Lees case, why not with
respect to other considerations which enter or may enter into the determination
of a fit sentence? The possibilities are various, if not infinite, of charging
the sentencing judge with errors as, for example, applying the wrong
principles, failing to apply correct sentencing principles, taking irrelevant
matters into consideration, failing to admit or exclude certain evidence
offered at the sentencing hearing, and so on.

[Page 380]

All these matters are, of course, significant because they may
affect the quantum of a sentence but they have no effect upon the trial judge’s
power to act. If there is to be a circumscription or enlargement of the range
or character of the considerations that he may weigh or the standards that he
may apply, it falls to the provincial appellate court to give the necessary
directions as part of the sentencing process.

There is a wide discretion in a trial judge on sentence, a
discretion made evident in the latitude he is given where only a maximum
sentence is fixed for an offence or where only a minimum is fixed or a minimum
and a maximum. If he imposes a sentence within the prescribed limits, the
statutory check upon him lies in the Court of Appeal, provided leave is given.
How can this mean that the Supreme Court may still monitor the considerations
that should enter into the fixing of a permissible sentence or set standards
for the exercise of discretion by a sentencing judge? I do not seek to rely on
it here but reference may appropriately be made to s. 44 of the Supreme
Court Act which, to put it generally, excludes any right of appeal from a
discretionary order.

It seems to me that once the lid is lifted for the proper
standard of proof of disputed facts, it must equally be open for the assessment
by this Court of other considerations that may enter into a sentence. To say
that this Court still retains control through its power to refuse leave is to
yield the principle. This is hardly the way to deal with initial jurisdiction
if it does not clearly exist.

I do not doubt the importance of the issue raised by this case on
its merits. But important issues of criminal law, substantive criminal law,
abound without it being contended that this Court can entertain them, as, for
example, where a conviction or an acquittal or a new trial is challenged
because of an alleged error of mixed fact and law or an error of fact alone.
Unless there is a question of law alone (or of jurisdiction) in the courts
below, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain such

[Page 381]

criminal appeals; they stop in the provincial appellate courts.
For the reasons I have given, it cannot be said that what cannot be brought
within s. 618  can be redressed by invoking s. 41(1).

I turn now to consider, for their analogical value, cases in this
Court dealing with dangerous offenders (habitual criminals) and sentences of
preventive detention, now referred to as sentences of detention for an
indeterminate period. Criminal Code , ss. 687  to 695.1 , as Part XXI,
govern the present dangerous offender provisions which, as enacted by 1976-77
(Can.), c. 53, s. 14, came into force on October 16, 1977. Under s. 694 there
is an appeal to the provincial Court of Appeal from a sentence of indeterminate
detention on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact. The Attorney
General is given a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal
of an application for an order for a sentence of indeterminate detention but
only on a question of law. There is no provision in Part XXI which confers any
right of appeal to the Supreme Court. In my opinion, although this Court may be
entitled to entertain an appeal from a finding that an offender is a dangerous
offender where a question of law is raised, I do not think that there is any
jurisdiction in this Court to review a sentence of indeterminate detention.

There have been no cases brought here under the present Part XXI,
but there was a course of decision on predecessor provisions. Preventive
detention for persons found to be habitual criminals was introduced into the Criminal
Code  by 1947 (Can.), c. 55, adding thereto ss. 575A  to 575H . Under
these provisions, an allegation that an accused was an habitual criminal was to
be added to the indictment after the charge of the substantive offence. More
important, under s. 575E  it was provided that a person convicted and sentenced
to preventive detention may appeal

[Page 382]

against his conviction and sentence, and “the provisions of this
Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be
applicable thereto”. In thus combining the finding of habitual criminality and
the sentence of preventive detention in a composite right of appeal to be
treated as an appeal from a conviction of an indictable offence, the Criminal
Code  gave the Supreme Court power to entertain such an appeal where a
question of law was involved: see R. v. Robinson, [1951] S.C.R.
522. However, in Brusch v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373 it was
held that the allegation of being an habitual criminal was not a charge of a
criminal offence for the purpose of entitling the accused to elect as to his
mode of trial but because the sentence of preventive detention attached to the
finding that the accused was an habitual criminal, the case could come here by
reason of a dissent on a question of law in the provincial Court of Appeal.

The 1947 preventive detention provisions were replaced by 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51 and recast as Part XXI of the Criminal Code. A new
procedure was instituted under s. 660  to provide for an application for the
imposition of a sentence of preventive detention, in addition to the sentence
for the substantive offence, if the accused was found to be an habitual
criminal and the Court was thereby of opinion that it was expedient for the
protection of the public so to sentence him. Section 667  provided for an
appeal to the Court of Appeal against a sentence of preventive detention and a
right of appeal was given to the Attorney General against dismissal of an application.
There was no longer any such provision as appeared in the former s. 575E .

Parkes v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 134, came to
this Court under the new procedure. It is a case that presents some difficulty
because my former brother Pigeon in the Hill cases viewed it as
asserting jurisdiction in this Court under s. 41(1) to entertain a conjoint
appeal against a finding of habitual criminality and a consequent sentence of
preventive detention, and as giving jurisdiction to

[Page 383]

quash the sentence of preventive detention alone. On the other
hand, my brother Ritchie in Poole v. The Queen, [1968] S.C.R. 381
(true, in a dissenting judgment, speaking for himself and three other members
of the Court) considered that the Parkes case did not support authority
in this Court to entertain an appeal from the sentence of preventive detention
in insolation from an appeal on the finding of the status of being an habitual
criminal. Ritchie J. pointed out in Poole that there was a change
made by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 33(2) in Criminal Code , s. 660  as it
stood when the Parkes case was decided. The change in the words of the
amended provision was that the sentence of preventive detention could be in
lieu of the sentence for the substantive offence or in addition thereto.
Ritchie J. in Poole did not question this Court’s jurisdiction to invoke
s. 41(1) in appeals from findings as to status and he added these words (at p.
404):

I have read the habitual criminal cases which have come to
this Court since the Parkes case and it appears to me that until the
case of The Queen v. MacDonald,…there was no case of an appeal
against sentence when the question of the finding as to status was not in
issue. In each case the appeal was treated as an appeal from the “habitual
criminal” finding and was decided on that basis.

However, the majority view in the Poole case was
that this Court did have jurisdiction under s. 41(1), particularly because
the matter did not come within s. 41(3), to deal with the sentence of
preventive detention alone. The majority in Poole did not discuss the Parkes
case in detail, saying only in the words of Cartwright C.J.C. (speaking for
himself and for Judson and Hall JJ.) that the jurisprudence of the Court on the
question of its jurisdiction to give leave and to hear an appeal from a
sentence of preventive detention was settled and applied consistently since the
decisions in Brusch and Parkes.

[Page 384]

Parkes v. The Queen is reported on the merits in
[1956] S.C.R. 768. None of the five judges of this Court who sat on the case
made any mention of jurisdiction, that question having been dealt with on the
application for leave, reported in [1956] S.C.R. 134. On the merits, the
sentence of preventive detention was set aside by reason of a procedural error
in violation of the statutory prescriptions governing the hearing of an
application for such detention. Nor was there anything in the hearing on the
merits to indicate that the Court was concerned conjointly with the finding
that the accused was an habitual criminal and with the sentence of preventive
detention. It was perhaps unnecessary to deal with that finding because it fell
away once the sentence of preventive detention was set aside. Yet it is
important to notice that leave to appeal in Parkes was given under s.
41(1) of the Supreme Court Act (in the words of this Court on the
application for leave) “from the affirmation by the Court of Appeal of the
decision of His Honour Judge Grosch that the applicant is an habitual
criminal”. Yet, as I indicated, there is not a word on the hearing of the
appeal about the finding of habitual criminality.

In assessing whether there was jurisdiction in Poole, consideration
had, however, to be given to R. v. MacDonald, [1965] S.C.R. 831
in which the Court majority, including Cartwright J., as he then was, took an
adverse view to jurisdiction.

In R. v. MacDonald, the Court was unanimous in the
view that the Criminal Code  did not support jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal from a sentence of preventive detention. In that case there was a
finding that the accused was an habitual criminal and a sentence of preventive
detention was imposed upon him in lieu of a sentence for the substantive
offence. Although leave to appeal this sentence was granted, the appeal was
quashed, Taschereau C.J.C. and Martland J. dissenting. The majority of the
Court noted that the finding as to status was not in issue but that it was the
conviction of an indictable offence that gave rise to the sentence of
preventive detention. Accordingly,

[Page 385]

the Goldhar case governed to preclude an appeal by the
Crown from an order of the provincial Court of Appeal which had set aside the
order of preventive detention. It would be, said the majority, incongruous if
an appeal as to sentence were allowed under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court
Act. The two dissenting judges said that the Goldhar case was
inapplicable because the punishment by way of a sentence of preventive
detention was not imposed for an indictable offence, but because the accused
had the status of an habitual criminal and it was expedient for the protection
of the public to sentence him. The dissenting judges rejected the contention
that because the Crown was limited to questions of law in appeals to a Court of
Appeal, it could not invoke s. 41(1) here and seek leave thereunder, it being
understood that it would be limited to questions of law. Moreover, it was their
view that since the accused could appeal, there was no valid reason for
precluding the Crown.

Cartwright J., as he then was, in an opinion concurring with the
majority, distinguished an appeal by the accused from a sentence of preventive
detention (which he said has been recognized by this Court, as in the Parkes
case) and an appeal by the Crown from the dismissal of an application for
such a sentence or the setting aside of such a sentence. In this, he relied on
the majority opinion of Ritchie J. He also noted that the question of a right
of appeal to this Court was not discussed in the Brusch case, and that
although the Robinson case was correctly decided under the legislation
then in force, the subsequent changes in wording made the Robinson case
no longer applicable to support a Crown appeal.

The majority decision in the MacDonald case rests on the
following observation of Ritchie J. (at p. 851 of [1965] S.C.R.):

As has been pointed out, the Criminal Code  makes
express provision under s. 667  for appealing to the court

[Page 386]

of appeal of a province from the disposition made by a trial
judge of an application for preventive detention and by s. 667(2)  the Attorney
General is limited to “any ground of law” in appealing from the dismissal of
such an application. If counsel for the appellant were right in his contention
that an appeal can be had to this Court under s. 41(1), at the instance of the
Crown, from an order of the court of appeal setting aside a sentence of
preventive detention, it would mean that although the Crown is restricted to
“any ground of law” when appealing to the Court of Appeal of a province against
the dismissal of an application for preventive detention by a trial judge, it
can obtain access to this Court on unrestricted grounds when appealing from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal which has the same effect. I cannot think that
Parliament intended such an anomaly to result from the provisions of s. 667(2) 
of the Criminal Code  and s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act.

The limitation to “any ground of law” of the right of the
Attorney General to appeal to the Court of Appeal was first enacted by Chapter
43 of the Statutes of Canada, 1960-61, and s. 667(2)  in its present form
has not been previously considered by this Court.

I do not find the cases in this Court on sentence of preventive
detention and on sentence of indeterminate detention of any assistance in
coming to a conclusion on the issue of jurisdiction under consideration. Those
cases would appear to have an acceptable rationale where they invoke s. 41(1)
in connection with a finding of habitual criminality and a consequent sentence
of preventive or indeterminate detention. This follows from the consistent view
of this Court that a finding that a person is an habitual criminal is a finding
of a status and is not to be considered as a finding of guilt of an indictable
offence. Certainly, if the consequent sentence flows from the finding of the
status of being an habitual criminal and is dependent on that finding, the two
matters can be considered as intertwined for the purposes of an appeal to this
Court by leave under s. 41. This was the view of Spence J. and of Pigeon J. in
their separate reasons in Poole. If they are to be considered
separately, I question whether, at least under the present provisions governing
imposition of sentences of indeterminate detention there can be any

[Page 387]

jurisdiction in this Court to entertain an appeal from the
sentence alone.

However, as I have already said, the cases on habitual
criminality and sentences of preventive or indeterminate detention do not
assist on the question in issue here. They rather persuade me, by their special
character, as having no relevance for jurisdiction in sentence proceedings
following a conviction of an indictable offence or a summary conviction
offence.

There is an understandable concern with variations in approach by
provincial courts, both trial courts and appellate courts, if this Court should
decline jurisdiction. There are, however, already well known variations in
sentencing according to the offence and in relation to the same offence and in
relation to the particular offender. There is a large subjective (it may be
called discretionary) element in sentencing which may properly be influenced by
regional or even local considerations. It is worth adding here that s. 614  of
the Criminal Code , respecting the powers of the Court of Appeal on a
sentence appeal, provides that the Court shall consider the fitness of
the sentence appealed against and may, upon such evidence, if any, as it thinks
fit to receive, vary the sentence or dismiss the appeal. If Parliament has
thought fit to leave the quantum of a sentence to be finally determined at the
Court of Appeal level, it should similarly be considered that this carries with
it the final determination of the considerations which enter into the measure
of a sentence.

This Court would enter into a trackless waste if it sought to
separate quantum pure and simple from quantum according to a list of
permissible and impermissible considerations that should govern quantum.
Calling those considerations questions of law does not, in my opinion, take
them outside of the sentencing process which results in a particular level of
punishment.

[Page 388]

For the foregoing reasons, it is my view that this Court should
not accept jurisdiction under s. 41(1) to deal with the question submitted
here. I would, accordingly, quash the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Dickson and Chouinard JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—In the second edition of his text Principles of
Sentencing (1979), Professor D.A. Thomas speaks of an “evolving body of
principle designed to ensure that the version of the facts adopted for the
purpose of sentence is supported by evidence and reached according to
appropriate procedural standards” (at pp. 366-67). One of those evolving
principles, lying at the heart of this appeal, concerns the standard of proof to
be applied for establishing aggravating facts which, while not affecting guilt
or innocence, do have a critical effect on the length of sentence.

Two issues are raised. The first preliminary question: does the
Supreme Court of Canada have jurisdiction to entertain appeals arising out of
sentencing proceedings for indictable offences? The second issue, only reached
if the first question is answered affirmatively, is this: where, on a
sentencing hearing following conviction, the Crown seeks to prove aggravating
facts relating to the offence committed and those facts are controverted, is
the burden on the Crown the traditional criminal onus of proof of beyond a
reasonable doubt or the lesser onus of proof upon a balance of probabilities?

I

How the case arose

The respondent, Obed Ebenezer Gardiner, pleaded guilty on December 13, 1978 to assault causing bodily harm. The victim was his wife. At the
sentencing hearing the victim testified on behalf of the Crown with respect to
the details of the assault. According to her version of the attack,

[Page 389]

the respondent brutally beat and strangled her, tore off her
clothes, threatened her with sexual mutilation and forced her to commit an act
of incest with her paralyzed son who suffered from cerebral palsy. In her
housecoat, nightgown and bare feet she had walked to a service station in the
early morning hours where the police and an ambulance were called. She spent
four days in hospital. In the attack she suffered injuries to her face, a
hairline fracture of the skull and extensive bruising.

The respondent’s version of the attack was very different. His
wife had been drinking heavily and had threatened to commit suicide. She had
hit her head on the head board of the bed. The respondent admitted to having
slapped his wife on the side of the face but claimed to have then blacked out
until his arrest the next morning.

At trial Judge Graburn sentenced the respondent to four years and
six months in penitentiary. The maximum penalty for assault causing bodily harm
is five years imprisonment. In the judge’s opinion this was “one of the worst
cases of assault causing bodily harm to come before this Court”. In assessing
the conflicting testimony respecting the circumstances serving to aggravate the
offence, the judge felt himself bound by the Ontario Court of Appeal decision
in R. v. Cieslak (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 7; the Crown need only
prove such facts on a balance of probabilities following a guilty plea.

The judge preferred the evidence of the victim to that of the
respondent. He went further to say that as the burden of proof was upon a
balance of probabilities it was not necessary to call the victim’s son to
testify in order to satisfy the onus resting on the Crown.

The respondent appealed. In a short unanimous judgment the
Ontario Court of Appeal held that the obiter in R. v. Cieslak,
supra, to the effect that the onus on the Crown was merely that of a
preponderance of credible evidence, was in error:

[Page 390]

…in the case of sentencing where a Judge is faced with
conflicting evidence going to the gravity of the offence the onus on the Crown
is to prove the aggravating facts beyond a reasonable doubt [per Jessup
J.A].

The Court remitted the matter to the trial judge to consider the
evidence in the light of the proper onus and to report whether the aggravating
factors referred to in the trial judge’s Reasons for Sentence in fact obtained.
The trial judge reported. He said that it would be unfair to the Court of
Appeal, to the accused and to the administration of justice for him to
endeavour to apply to the evidence the criminal standard of proof when he had
directed his mind solely to the civil burden of proof when sentencing ten
months earlier.

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and reduced the sentence
of imprisonment to two years.

II

The jurisdictional point

The Crown moved before this Court for leave to appeal the
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, and leave to appeal was granted. When
the matter came on for argument, however, the Court raised the question as to
the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal relating to sentencing.
Counsel for the Crown and counsel for the appellant were both of opinion that
the Court did indeed have the necessary jurisdiction. Following argument as to
jurisdiction and as to the merits the Court reserved decision on both points.

The task of determining the limits of the Court’s criminal
appeals jurisdiction for indictable offences is arduous due in part to the
difficulty in reconciling the statutory language of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. S-19, as amended and Part XVIII of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, as amended, and in part due to earlier decisions of this Court,
which cannot be said to be in harmony. The importance of the jurisdictional
issue need not be stressed, as it is obvious that it radiates far beyond the
bounds of the present appeal.

[Page 391]

The Supreme Court of Canada was created by federal statute in
1875 pursuant to s. 101  of the Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31
Vict., c. 3  (U.K.). Section 101  reads:

101. The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding
anything in this Act, from Time to Time provide for the Constitution,
Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for
the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the
Laws of Canada.

The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act of 1875 (Can.), c. 11
“constituted, and established, a Court of Common Law and Equity, in and for the
Dominion of Canada…called The Supreme Court of Canada’” (s. 1). This newly
created court was given “appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and
throughout the Dominion of Canada” (s. 15). The model chosen for the Supreme
Court of Canada, among several possible options open to the legislators, was
that of a “national appellate court, functioning like an English appellate
court, or like the House of Lords, with a general jurisdiction (be it as of
right or by leave) not limited to any class or classes of cases” (Laskin C.J.,
“The Role and Functions of Final Appellate Courts: The Supreme Court of Canada”
(1975), 53 Can. Bar Rev. 469, at p. 471).

An important factor in the choice of this model for the Supreme
Court of Canada “was and is the fact that many important branches of law, such
as the criminal law, the law of negotiable instruments, the law of bankruptcy,
the law of shipping, railway law, the law of patents and copyright have a
national operation because they fall within exclusive federal competence; and
even though they may interact in some respects with some aspects of the common
law their interpretation and application must necessarily be uniform, and
perhaps all the more so because of the interaction” (Laskin C.J., ibid., at
p. 473).

[Page 392]

In addition to the general appellate jurisdiction conferred by s.
15 of the 1875 Act, s. 49 specifically limited criminal appeals:

49. Any person convicted of treason, felony or
misdemeanor…before any other Superior Court of criminal jurisdiction, whose
conviction has been affirmed by any Court of last resort…may appeal to the
Supreme Court against the affirmation of such conviction… Provided that
no such appeal shall be allowed where the Court affirming the conviction is
unanimous...[Emphasis added]

The limitation on criminal appeals is indicative of the function
envisaged by Parliament for the Supreme Court, that of the resolution of
division of opinion as to questions of law, especially in criminal matters, and
the positing of uniform rules applicable throughout Canada.

Nesbitt J. in Lake Erie and Detroit River Railway Co. v. Marsh
(1904), 35 S.C.R. 197 espoused this view of the role of the Supreme Court
(at p. 200):

We think it was the intention of the framers of the Act
creating this court that a tribunal should be established to speak with
authority for the Dominion as a whole and, as far as possible, to establish a
uniform jurisprudence, especially within matters falling within
section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, where the legislation is for the
Dominion as a whole, or, as I have said, where purely provincial legislation
may be of general interest throughout the Dominion. [Emphasis added]

Although a very broad jurisdiction was given by s. 15, and
undoubtedly it was the intention of the framers of the Act that the Supreme
Court speak with authority for the Dominion as a whole, several factors
compounded the difficulties experienced by the Court in establishing its
general and ultimate appellate jurisdiction.

The first difficulty was the fact that until the year 1933 in
respect of criminal appeals and 1949 in respect of civil appeals, ultimate
appellate jurisdiction lay with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and
not with the Supreme Court of Canada. Not only was the Supreme Court of Canada
an intermediate appellate Court and thus

[Page 393]

not the final arbiter in either civil or criminal matters, but in
certain circumstances appeal could be had directly to the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council.

The second important factor in the development of the appellate
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was the transition from the predominance of
appeal as of right to appeal by leave. It is difficult to overestimate the
significance of this transition. Originally all appeals were by right in both
civil and criminal matters; appeal by right was of course subject to the fulfilment
of the various conditions attaching to the exercise of the right. This was
perfectly consonant with an intermediate appellate function. The legislature
had attempted to predetermine the appropriate cases for appeal; no room was
made for judicial discretion in controlling the Court’s docket. “Thus, the most
significant fact about the statutory basis of the Supreme Court of Canada’s
jurisdiction is that throughout the Court’s history the appeal as of right has
been the predominant mode of appeal” (Russell, “The Jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of Canada: Present Policies and a Programme for Reform” (1968), 6 Osgoode
Hall L.J. 1, at p. 13). The possibility of appeal by special leave as an
alternate means of access to the Court gradually made its appearance over a
number of years in both civil and criminal matters but until the abolition of
the de piano right to appeal in civil cases in 1975, the vast majority
of appeals came by right.

Faced with a burgeoning caseload and inadequate discretionary
means of controlling it, a tendency to read down the jurisdiction of the Court
is discernible in the decisions.

In adjudicating claims to this [statutory right of appeal],
the Supreme Court has found ample opportunity to introduce qualifications to
the right which sometimes reflect the judges’ own view of the Court’s proper
function. Even though all the statutory requirements for a de piano appeal
may appear to have been met, nevertheless the Court has frequently quashed an
appeal on the grounds, for instance, that the case turns on a

[Page 394]

question of provincial procedure [Russell, supra, at
p. 12].

Two qualifying conditions attached to the appeal as of right in
civil cases were that it be from a “final judgment…of the highest court of
final resort in a province” (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, s. 36, as amended by 1949
(Can.), 2nd Sess., c. 37, s. 2). Both these conditions were very narrowly
construed (see United States of America v. Link and Green, [1955]
S.C.R. 183; Ottawa Electric Co. v. Brennan (1901), 31 S.C.R. 311;
Furlan v. City of Montreal, [1947] S.C.R. 216). A further rule of
construction was applied in cases of appeal as of right: if the Court’s
jurisdiction were doubtful it would not be assumed (Chagnon v. Normand
(1889), 16 S.C.R. 661; Cully v. Ferdais (1900), 30
S.C.R. 330; McKenzie v. Hiscock, [1967] S.C.R. 781). As the
appeal as of right predominated appeals to this Court these “rules” originated
and were developed in the context of appeals as of right. They were measures
which were probably justified as a means of controlling the Court’s docket and
reflected the strict constructionist inclinations of members of the Bench. The
applicability of rules with a built-in bias against jurisdiction to issues of
discretionary leave to appeal, however, seems unfounded. The discretionary
element provides the screening mechanism formerly supplied by a narrow
interpretation of jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, with the rising importance of special leave to
appeal, especially after the major revision of the Supreme Court Act in 1949
(1949 (Can.), 2nd Sess., c. 37), it was inevitable that this narrow
interpretation of jurisdiction would spill over, unjustifiably in my view, into
the area of discretionary leave.

The problem of construction was exacerbated by the complexity of
the statutory provisions relating to appeals, especially criminal appeals. The
amending process was both erratic and piece-meal. Between 1892 and 1906, for
example, essentially similar provisions for criminal appeals existed in

[Page 395]

both The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, R.S.C. 1886, c.
135 and the new Criminal Code , 1892 (Can.), c. 29. In 1906 in the
Revised Statutes the duplication was eliminated by s. 36 of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 139 which provided that “there shall be no
appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code ”. At this
time an appeal as of right was the only means of appealing a criminal matter.

An amendment to the Criminal Code  in 1923 precipitated the
troublesome case of Goldhamer v. The King, [1924] S.C.R. 290. The
issue of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to entertain an appeal from
sentence arose. The Court had difficulty reconciling the plain meaning of then
s. 1024  which gave a right of appeal to “any person convicted of any indictable
offence, whose conviction has been affirmed” with the newly amended s. 1013 
which dealt with appeals to the Court of Appeal under a double rubric, appeals
as to “conviction” and appeals as to “sentence”. Idington J. felt that it was
“fairly arguable” that there was a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada from sentence by one convicted under s. 1013 . “I cannot therefore
confidently assert and hold that there is no appeal possible under such
circumstances” (at pp. 292-93). Duff J., in one short paragraph, read s. 1024 
together with s. 1013  and concluded that there was “no right of appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an
appeal under subsection (2)  of section 1013 ” (at p. 293). Mignault J.
said essentially the same thing (at pp. 293-94):

As now amended, article 1013 gives a right of appeal against
a conviction, and against a sentence pronounced by the trial court against a
person convicted on indictment. Article 1024 was not amended by the 1923
statute and under it the right of appeal is restricted to an appeal against the
affirmance of the conviction. Reading it with article 1013, as amended, the
appeal from the sentence under paragraph 2 of article 1013 cannot be brought
before this court.

[Page 396]

Thus the rule against sentence appeals in the Supreme Court of
Canada was born. It would appear that the jurisdiction of this Court to hear
appeals on sentence had formerly not been questioned. Counsel for the appellant
in Goldhamer had been caught by surprise and no submissions were in fact made
on the jurisdictional issue.

Upon said appeal coming on for hearing herein, some members
of our court took the objection that we had no jurisdiction.

I suggested to counsel for appellant, who was thereby taken
by surprise, that he better urge anything he had to say on the merits, and take
a few days to submit a further factum, answering the point of want of
jurisdiction.

A week has elapsed but nothing further submitted, possibly
because I had submitted to him that I could see no merits in the appeal,
including the objection upon which he chiefly relied, that the fine having been
paid there could be no appeal to the Court of King’s Bench [at p. 291 per Idington
J.].

The sections dealing with Supreme Court appeals had not been
amended at the time of the 1923 amendment to the Court of Appeal provisions and
it is unlikely that the legislators directed their minds to the possible effect
their wording of s. 1013 would have on then s. 1024. But the rule against
sentence appeals to the Supreme Court prevailed, despite a statutory basis
which was, at the very least, arguable. This is easily explainable. The case
afforded the opportunity to contain the rising tide of appeals as of right.

The rule, in one of its aspects, was a good one which became
better as the role of the Supreme Court shifted from that of an intermediate
appeal court to final arbiter in issues of national importance. “Fitness” or
“quantum” of sentence is best left to the courts of appeal. The power of the
Court of Appeal to “consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against” is
now contained in s. 614(1)  of the Criminal Code . I have no quarrel with
this. The Supreme Court of Canada should not consider questions of the fitness
of an individual’s sentence. That is not its role:

[Page 397]

Here, the fundamental factor to keep in mind is that most of
the disputes which reach the Supreme Court have first been adjudicated by a
trial court and a provincial appeal court. The litigant has had his “day in
court.” It is not the function of the Supreme Court to give him yet another
day. “Review by the Supreme Court”, to quote Chief Justice Hughes of the United
States Supreme Court, “is thus in the interests of the law, its appropriate
exposition and enforcement, not in the mere interest of the litigants.” The
Canadian Supreme Court, too, should be designed and operated to serve not the
private interests of dissatisfied litigants but the community’s interest in
obtaining an authoritative settlement of questions of law of importance to the
whole nation [Russell, supra, at pp. 28-29].

It is incorrect, however, in my opinion, to characterize our
justifiable reluctance to consider questions of fitness of sentence as lack of
jurisdiction. It is to compound the error to extend the argument of lack of
jurisdiction to what are clearly important questions of law arising out of the
sentencing process. The function of this Court is precisely that, to settle
questions of law of national importance in the interests of promoting
uniformity in the application of the law across the country, especially with
respect to matters of federal competence. To decline jurisdiction is to
renounce the paramount responsibility of an ultimate appellate court with
national authority.

In Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60,
Cartwright J., in his dissenting judgment, sought a construction of the
applicable statutory provisions which would give “effect to the apparent
intention of Parliament that our jurisdiction in criminal matters should be
strictly limited to points of law and yet wide enough to assure uniformity in
the interpretation of the criminal law throughout Canada” (at p. 79). The “pure
point of law” which the appellant sought to have decided in the Goldhar case,
Cartwright remarked, fell “within the literal meaning” of the appeals by leave,
s. 597(1)(b) of the revised Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51.
After distinguishing the Goldhamer decision he found that (at p. 77):

[Page 398]

In my opinion no sufficient reason has been advanced for
interpreting s. 597 so as to refuse a jurisdiction which appears to me to be
conferred upon the Court by the words of that section construed in their
ordinary and literal meaning.

This interpretation, he felt, was buttressed by s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act which he found to be “in pari materia” with s. 597 of the Code.

It is important to remember that between Goldhamer and Goldhar
significant revisions to the Supreme Court Act had intervened in
1949. The Supreme Court had replaced the Privy Council as the ultimate appeal
court for Canada.

The powers of this Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction
are no less in scope than those formerly exercised in relation to Canada by the
Judicial Committee [Re The Farm Products Marketing Act, [1957] S.C.R.
198, at p. 212, per Rand J.].

A narrow interpretation of jurisdiction was not in keeping with
the new function of the Court:

At the apex of the single Canadian System is the Supreme
Court of Canada. Obviously its jurisdiction should be as comprehensive
respecting federal and provincial laws as is that of the lower courts, subject
to the screening of cases for their national importance as indicated [Lederman,
“Thoughts on Reform of The Supreme Court of Canada” (1970), 8 Alta L.R. 1, at
pp. 16-17].

In 1975 appeals as of right in civil matters were abolished and
s. 41(1) governing appeals with leave assumed a major importance in the scheme
of the Act. It was amended and enlarged in order to adapt it to the role which
the Court had assumed and which Nesbitt J. had foreseen in 1904. Sections 41(1)
and 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act now read:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal
lies to the Supreme Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court
of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had
in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or
not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court,
where, with respect to the particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme

[Page 399]

Court is of the opinion that any question involved therein
is, by reason of its public importance or the importance of any issue of law or
any issue of mixed law and fact involved in such question, one that ought to be
decided by the Supreme Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or
significance as to warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from such
judgment is accordingly granted by the Supreme Court.

…

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this
section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting
aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or,
except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other
than an indictable offence.

In the decision, Hill v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R.
827 the repercussions of the s. 41 amendments made themselves felt. The case
was heard by the full court and in my view goes a long way in sustaining the
contentions of both counsel now before us that the Court has jurisdiction to
hear and determine the present appeal. Hill had pleaded guilty to charges of
rape and wounding. He was sentenced to twelve years and appealed against
sentence. The Court of Appeal for Ontario increased the sentence to one of life
imprisonment. The question of law presented to the Court was whether, on an
appeal by an accused against sentence, where there is no cross-appeal by the
Crown to have the sentence increased, the Court of Appeal has the power to
increase the sentence imposed upon the accused. The judgment of Martland, Judson,
Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by Pigeon J. who introduced his
discussion with respect to jurisdiction with these words (at p. 843):

On the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the Crown
objected to the jurisdiction of this Court relying on Goldhar v. The
Queen, a decision rendered on an application for leave to appeal heard by a
court of five judges in which it was held, Cartwright J. dissenting, “that this
Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for
the commission of an indictable offence”. In my view, that decision is not
binding and should not be followed for the following reasons.

Mr. Justice Pigeon then observed that before the 1949
amendments, the Supreme Court Act did not confer jurisdiction on this Court
in criminal cases

[Page 400]

due to the exclusionary clause in s. 36: “except in criminal
cases and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or
prohibition arising out of a criminal charge”; therefore, any jurisdiction in
criminal matters had to be found in the Criminal Code  or other statute.
Mr. Justice Pigeon discussed the line of cases in which the Court had
uniformly adhered to a literal construction of s. 41 and granted leave to
appeal in criminal matters for any judgments not excluded by subs. (3); Goodyear
Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, reported on merits
only at [1956] S.C.R. 303, Parkes v. The Queen [1956] S.C.R. 134, Smith
v. The Queen [1959] S.C.R. 638. He reviewed the decisions in which a
different view had been taken, namely, Goldhar v. The Queen [1960]
S.C.R. 60, Paul v. The Queen [1960] S.C.R. 452, R. v. J.
Alepin Frères Liée [1965] S.C.R. 359, R. v. MacDonald [1965]
S.C.R. 831. The judgment continues (at p. 850):

There is a clear conflict between the four last mentioned
cases and the other judgments adhering explicitly or implicitly to a different
view of s. 41. This means that on any view of the rule of stare decisis the
Court has to choose between the two conflicting views.

In my opinion, the literal construction is preferable not
only because in the absence of ambiguity the literal meaning should always be
adhered to despite any inconsistencies short of absurdity, but also because any
assumption that Parliament did not intend to depart from the previous state of
the law is unjustified. Section 41 was enacted substantially in its
present form at the time when appeals to the Privy Council were being abolished
and this court was being made truly supreme. The Privy Council had enjoyed
unlimited jurisdiction by special leave and it is apparent that the new
provision was intended to effect the change from a limited specific
jurisdiction to a broad general jurisdiction. To hold that the inconsistencies
resulting from this sweeping change indicate the intention of leaving some wide
gaps open is, in my view, entirely unwarranted. On the contrary, the enactment
of a provision that undoubtedly confers some jurisdiction in criminal matters
beyond that existing under the Criminal Code , clearly indicates
Parliament’s will to remedy the omission to extend the jurisdiction of this
Court in criminal cases when the Privy Council’s jurisdiction in such cases was
effectively abolished after

[Page 401]

the Statute of Westminster.

Mr. Justice Pigeon concludes on this point (at p. 851):

For those reasons, it does not appear to me that s. 41(3)
should be construed otherwise that [sic] in accordance with the strict
meaning of “convicting” and “conviction” as established by the Goldhamer decision.
This means that, in my view, the objection to jurisdiction fails. However, I
consider it appropriate to point out that such conclusion implies no departure
from our rule of never entertaining an appeal concerning the fitness of a
sentence.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting as to the
merits but in agreement with Pigeon J. on the jurisdictional point, was
delivered by the Chief Justice. Two passages bear upon the jurisdictional issue
in the present appeal. The first reads (at p. 830):

Like my brother Spence, I am in agreement with my brother
Pigeon in his disposition of the question of jurisdiction, a disposition that
affirms jurisdiction in this case and which consequently involves the
overruling of the Goldhar case, and of other cases which adopted its
approach to deny jurisdiction.

The disposition by Pigeon J. affirming this Court’s jurisdiction
in Hill was perceived as overruling the Goldhar case and the
other cases which adopted its approach to deny jurisdiction. Pigeon J. left no
doubt as to his position. He stated that the Goldhar case was not
binding and should not be followed. Hill adopted the general
proposition, repudiated in Goldhar v. The Queen and Paul v.
The Queen that matters not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be held to be
comprised in s. 41(1) with the consequence that this Court would have
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of a nature similar to the
one here considered. With respect, I cannot find in s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act or in the Criminal Code  any wording which would accord
this Court jurisdiction to hear sentencing matters where the issue was as to
constitutionality or judicial power but not otherwise. I simply cannot find the
basis for such a distinction in the wording.

[Page 402]

The second passage of Laskin C.J. reads (at pp. 831-32):

I take first the preliminary question of jurisdiction. It is
to me unreal to think that literal construction determines the result when in
order to arrive at it a detailed review of legislative history is required (and
properly so) and the purpose of the measure under review is pursued through an
examination of the changes made in the jurisdiction and role of this Court.
Once it is admitted, as it must be here, that reasonable men can differ on the
effect of language directed to a particular end which itself is in issue, we
are in a situation where our conclusion will be influenced by our view of what
this Court’s jurisdiction and role should be. Since I would not exclude cases
from the leave jurisdiction of this Court unless it is quite plain that they
have been excluded by statute, and since I do not regard the present appeal as
plainly excluded I support the conclusion of my brother Pigeon on the question
of jurisdiction.

It is not plain that a case such as that presently before us is
excluded by statute. On the contrary it seems to be common ground that it falls
within the literal, broad and embracing words of s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act. The present appeal is brought (i) from a “final judgment”; (ii) “of
the highest court of final resort in a province…in which judgment can be had in
the particular case”, i.e. from the Court of Appeal of Ontario; (iii)
the “question involved” is “by reason of its public importance”…“one that ought
to be decided by the Supreme Court”—the granting of leave to appeal testifies
to this; (iv) the judgment sought to be appealed is not one falling within the
exclusionary words of s. 41(3), for it is not one acquitting or convicting or
setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence
or of an offence other than an indictable offence. In Hill all nine
judges joined in support of the view that s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act was
intended to confer a broad general jurisdiction, beyond that existing under the
Criminal Code . The Court rejected as “entirely unwarranted” the notion
dominating the Goldhar line of cases that possible inconsistencies
arising from a broad construction of s. 41 indicated Parliamentary intention to
leave some wide gaps open.

[Page 403]

Three later cases should be mentioned. The Court in R. v. Zelensky,
[1978] 2 S.C.R. 940 considered a provision for compensation under s. 653 of
the Code which the Court found to be “tied expressly to the sentencing
process” (at p. 948). The judge of first instance made a composite order at the
time the respondent, Anne Zelensky, was sentenced to imprisonment and to a term
of probation after pleading guilty to theft. The order was made in pursuance of
an application for such relief by T. Eaton Company Limited, the victim of the
theft. This Court held that s. 653 was valid as part of the sentencing process.
The Court went on to provide some guidance to trial judges on the proper
application of s. 653.

In R. v. Skolnick[1]
the Court recently heard argument and reserved judgment on the question whether
the mandatory minimum penalty prescribed by s. 236(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code  for a third offence applies to an accused who has been previously
convicted and sentenced for two offences arising out of the same incident.

In the third case, Lees v. The Queen, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 749 the issue was as to the legality of a sentence of eight years’
imprisonment imposed upon the appellant, it being admitted that the sentencing
judge had acted upon evidence of a potential but untried charge not connected
with the offence to which the plea of guilty had been entered. The judgment of
the Court was delivered by my brother McIntyre and concurred in by the six
other members of the Court.

The lack of jurisdictional challenge in Zelensky, in Skolnick,
in Lees and by the leave granting panel in Gardiner suggests,
to me at least, an acceptance of the view that Hill gave the quietus to Goldhar
and to the abnegation which under-

[Page 404]

pinned that decision and those which followed in its wake. Hill
mandated an expansive reading of s. 41(1), the better to enable this Court
to discharge its role at the apex of the Canadian judicial system, as the court
of last resort for all Canadians.

If policy considerations are to enter the picture, as they often
do, there would appear to me to be every reason why this Court should remain
available to adjudicate upon difficult and important questions of law in the
sentencing process, in particular where there are, as here, conflicting
opinions expressed in the provinces. Indeed we are asked, in effect, in this
appeal to decide between two opinions of the Ontario Court of Appeal which are
in direct conflict. I can see no advantage to litigants or to the orderly
administration of justice in closing doors which do not have to be closed.

The size of the Court’s docket should not determine jurisdiction.
The leave granting process is available to screen out those cases which do not
give rise to legal issues of high importance in the sentencing process. It was
argued at the time of Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada, [1975]
1 S.C.R. 138 and Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, [1976] 2
S.C.R. 265 that a flood of litigation would follow any relaxation of the
rules governing standing in constitutional challenges. Experience has shown
those fears to be groundless. As Cartwright J. observed in passing in Goldhar,
at p. 79, the “cases in which a sentence can be questioned on a pure point
of law are likely to be few and far between”.

Although I am of the view that the Court has jurisdiction to
assess the fitness, i.e. the quantum of a sentence, I am equally of the
view that as a matter of policy we should not do so. It is a rule of our own
making and a good rule. But it does not go to limit the general appellate
jurisdiction of this Court to determine questions of criminal law of national
importance. The sentence here is ques-

[Page 405]

tioned on a point of law. The appeal is against the principle,
not the fitness, of a sentence. The legality of the sentence is at issue.

Questions of burden of proof have traditionally been of concern
to the judiciary and left to the judiciary and not Parliament to resolve. We
are dealing here with a procedure which has evolved at common law and not by
statute. It is not an issue which should take the time of Parliament.

It seems to me that there is a positive collective interest in
having federal law, in particular the criminal law, one and the same for all
Canadians and in knowing that the country’s highest Court is in the background,
in case of need, to illuminate difficult points of law arising in the
sentencing process. Cases calling for the articulation of governing and
intelligible principles bearing upon deprivation of personal liberty would seem
rationally to be the paradigm of the type of case which should find its way to
this Court.

I would hold that the Court has jurisdiction to entertain this
appeal. The statutory language, the historical development of the Court’s
jurisdiction and the role of the Court as ultimate appellate tribunal all lead
to that conclusion.

III

The Burden of Proof

A

Introduction

The question now to be addressed is this: what burden of proof
must the Crown sustain in advancing contested aggravating facts in a sentencing
proceeding, for the purpose of supporting a lengthier sentence; is the standard
that of the criminal law, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or that of the civil
law, proof on a balance of probabilities.

The Crown argues for the acceptance of a lesser onus of proof at
sentencing than the traditional

[Page 406]

criminal onus of beyond a reasonable doubt which applies at trial
to the determination of guilt.

Relying heavily on American authorities the Crown suggests that
there is a sharp demarcation between the trial process and the sentencing
process. Once a plea or finding of guilty is entered the presumption of
innocence no longer operates and the necessity of the full panoply of
procedural protection for the accused ceases. Sentencing is a discretionary and
highly subjective exercise on the part of the trial judge. The primary concern
at a sentencing hearing is the availability of accurate information upon which
the trial judge can rely in determining an appropriate sentence in the
particular circumstances of the offender. For this reason the strict rules on
the admissibility of evidence are relaxed. The trial judge is no longer
confined to the narrow issue of guilt but is engaged in the difficult task of
fitting the punishment to the person convicted. To require that the Crown prove
contested issues beyond a reasonable doubt would be to complicate and extend
sentencing hearings and convert the sentencing process into a second trial with
a resultant loss of economy.

In the event that the essentially civil onus of preponderance of
evidence is rejected, the Crown proposes, in the alternative, an “intermediate”
standard of “clear and convincing” evidence to apply to sentencing hearings.

The respondent, on the other hand, argues for the application of
the reasonable doubt standard to sentencing hearings. The “bifurcation” between
trial and sentencing proposed by the Crown the respondent finds artificial and
against the authorities. From the offender’s point of view, sentencing is the
most critical part of the whole trial process, it is the “gist of the
proceeding” and the standard of proof required with respect to controverted
facts should not be relaxed at this point. To do so is prejudicial to the
accused. Administrative efficiency is insufficient justification for so radical
a

[Page 407]

departure from the traditional criminal onus of beyond a
reasonable doubt.

B

The Authorities relied upon in Cieslak and in Gardiner

As I have indicated, the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Cieslak,
supra, said that it was “up to the Crown to prove the material facts, on a
balance of probabilities” (at p. 9). The question of burden of proof was not
directly in issue in Cieslak. Arnup J.A. recited the facts and then
said:

In our view, the established practice in Ontario following a
guilty plea is that which is also followed in the criminal Courts in England as
expressed in R. v. Campbell (1911), 6 Cr. App. R. 131, adopted by
this Court in R. v. Carey (1951), 102 C.C.C. 25, [1952] O.R. 1,
13 C.R. 333; R. v. Van Pelz (1942), 29 Cr. App. R. 10; R. v.
Benson and Stevenson (1951), 100 C.C.C. 247, 13 C.R. 1, 3 W.W.R. (N.S.)
29. In essence that practice is that it is proper for the facts to be stated by
the investigating officer, or by Crown counsel on information received from the
investigating officer, even though such information may be largely hearsay, but
if the facts as given are challenged by the defence, it is then up to the Crown
to prove the material facts, on a balance of probabilities, for the purpose of
assisting the trial Judge in deciding what is the appropriate sentence.

The Court held that the established practice had not been
followed. The appeal was allowed and sentence reduced. The four cases upon
which the Court relied dealt with the general practice followed at the time of
sentencing rather than with the burden of proof.

In concluding, in the present appeal, that the obiter in Cieslak
as to the onus was in error, the Court, speaking through Jessup J.A. relied
on nine cases to which brief reference must be made.

(a) The first is an unreported decision of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, R. v. Sayer, an appeal heard February 19, 1976. Martin
J.A., speaking for the court, said:

[Page 408]

Dealing with the appeal against sentence. The evidence is
that following the assault, the complainant had an operation to correct a
degenerative disc problem of long standing. It is far from established with
that degree of certainty required in a criminal prosecution, that there was a
causal connection between the assault and the condition which required the
operation, nor can we be sure that the jury found such a causal connection.

(b) R. v. Gortat and Pirog, [1973] Crim. L.R. 648.
The trial judge accepted pleas of guilty to a charge of conspiracy to rob and,
dispensing with a jury, heard evidence from both the prosecution and defence
solely on matters pertinent to the issue of whether the enterprise had been
abandoned at some time prior to arrest. The report notes that the trial judge
had directed himself as he would a jury on matters of burden of proof.

(c) Alberton Fisheries Ltd. v. The King (1944), 17
M.P.R. 457 (P.E.I.S.C.). Campbell C.J. said: “…on the question of the gravity
of the offence, as well as on the question of guilt or innocence, the accused
is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt” (at p. 460).

(d) R. v. Maitland, a decision of the Supreme Court
of South Australia in banco, reported at [1963] S.A.S.R. 332. The court
expressed the view that “…the accused is entitled to have the benefit of any
doubt that there may be” (at p. 335).

(e) Law v. Deed, [1970] S.A.S.R. 374, another
decision of the South Australian courts, judgment being delivered by Bray C.J.
The following passage appears at p. 378 of the report:

I think, as I said in Samuels v. Festa, [1968]
S.A.S.R. 118, that the principle by which the defendant has the benefit of any
reasonable doubt applies all through the criminal law and to matters of penalty
as well as to matters of guilt or innocence except in the case of the defence
of insanity or in the case of any special statutory provision to the contrary.

(f) O’Malley v. French (1971), 2 S.A.S.R. 110
following R. v. Maitland and Law v. Deed. Walters J. said
(at p. 112): “In the absence of evidence

[Page 409]

negating the matters of mitigation put forward by him, the
appellant was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt upon the issue”.

(g) Weaver v. Samuels, [1971] S.A.S.R. 116. This is
another decision of Bray C.J. and the following appears at pp. 119 and 120 of
the report: “The defendant must be given the benefit of any reasonable doubt on
matters of penalty, as well as on matters of guilt or innocence, in the absence
of any statutory provision to the contrary. The plea of guilty admits no more
than the bare legal ingredients of the crime. Any dispute as to anything beyond
this must be resolved on ordinary legal principles, including the presumption
of innocence”. Two other cases from South Australia, cases in which the test of
beyond reasonable doubt was applied are R. v. Thompson (1975), 11
S.A.S.R. 217 and R. v. Stehbens (1976), 14 S.A.S.R. 240. See
commentary on this latter case in (1977), 1 Crim. L.J. 217. The position would
appear to be the same in New South Wales, R. v. O’Neill, [1979] 2
N.S.W. L.R. 582 and in the Australian Capital Territory, Bierkowski v. Pearson
(1971), 18 F.L.R. 110.

(h) Browne v. Smith (1974), 4 A.L.R. 114, a decision
of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory adopting the principles
enunciated in Law v. Deed and R. v. Maitland.

(i) R. v. Browne, [1950] N.I. L.R. 20, a decision
of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Northern Ireland. In passing sentence in a
manslaughter case the trial judge had said that it might well be that the
prisoner had attempted to gas his wife before killing her and he referred to “a
certain element of deliberation” on the part of the prisoner. On the appeal,
Andrews L.C.J. said at p. 28):

While the inference drawn by the learned judge is certainly
a possibility, we do not think that it can be drawn with such a degree of
certainty as to justify it in being taken into account against the accused man
in assessing sentence.

[Page 410]

Another case from Northern Ireland which might have been
mentioned is R. v. McKee, [1947] N.I. L.R. 27 in which the Court
of Criminal Appeal held that if the accused disputes aggravating facts the
Court should either leave the disputed matter out of account or else receive
evidence upon it and reach a finding, the prisoner being given the benefit of
any reasonable doubt. The Court added that the practice in England would appear
to be similar.

C

Other Canadian Cases

To complete the review of the cases, it may be noted that the
Alberta Supreme Court, Appellate Division, in R. v. Pinder (1923),
40 C.C.C. 272 considered that no exception could be taken to giving the benefit
of the doubt to the accused. Some sixty years’ later in R. v. Christopher
(unreported), the same Court applied Cieslak and the balance of
probabilities.

In R. v. Knight (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 343 Morden
J. applied the “moral certainty”, i.e. beyond reasonable doubt, test. In
a recent unreported case of R. v. Wettlaufer[2],
Judge Salhany held that before a judge should sentence an accused on the basis
of the more culpable or aggravating theory advanced by the Crown, he should be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence supports that theory.
This was consistent with the decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.
v. Parenteau (1980), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 188 in which Matas J.A. speaking for
the Court said at p. 190):

In our view, where the facts before the Court are presented
by way of representations of counsel, and the accused denies important facts
which go to the gravity of the offence, it is incumbent on the Crown to prove
those facts beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to call
evidence to refute the statements made by Crown counsel. This is consistent
with the general principle applicable in criminal prosecutions requiring the
Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

[Page 411]

In Quebec, Barrette-Joncas J. in obiter in R. v. Dimora
(1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 96 followed Cieslak. In R. v. Boileau;
R. v. Lepine (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 189 Hugessen J. applied the
standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt.

In the only other Canadian case to which I would refer R. v.
Davis and Fancie (1976), 15 N.S.R. (2d) 461 the Appeal Division of the
Nova Scotia Supreme Court said, at p. 463 of the report: “Giving the
respondents the benefit of all doubt, the fact remains that…”

D

English and Other Cases

Two unreported cases to which we have been referred suggest that
the test of beyond reasonable doubt has been applied in England. In R. v.
Sadler (decided November 22, 1973) Lord Justice Scar-man said:

This Court takes the view that in those circumstances the
benefit of the doubt must be given to the Appellant. Clearly he must be
punished. But, equally clearly, his punishment must take into account the
benefit of the doubt which this Court believes should in these circumstances be
accorded to him.

In R. v. Miller, Vella and Walker (decided December 2, 1974) Lord Justice Lawton said:

We do not agree that the learned Judge was bound to approach
the matter on the basis of what was put before him in mitigation. He was
entitled to assess the probabilities on such information as he had. He had to
bear in mind, of course, that if there was any doubt that doubt had to be
resolved in favour of the accused.

In the later case of R. v. Taggart (1979), 1 Cr.
App. R. (S.) 144, Mr. Justice Gibson, speaking for the Court of Criminal
Appeal, referred to the guilty plea and the sharp difference between the facts
of the wounding as the prosecution put them forward and the basis of the plea
as stated by Taggart. The judge said (at p. 149):

As is well known, there are various methods of dealing with
this difficulty when it arises. The judge is not bound to approach the matter
on the basis of what is put forward before him in mitigation. He is entitled to

[Page 412]

determine the matter on the information before him but he
will resolve any doubt in favour of the accused.

The author of a commentary upon Taggart and Miller in
(1980) Crim. L. Rev. 248, concluded with these words (at p. 249):

Apart from these decisions, it seems to follow from general
principle that an offender should not be held accountable for facts unless they
have been established against him to the same standard of evidence,
irrespective of whether those facts are technically elements of the offence
with which he is charged. A finding of fact which goes only to sentence can
have consequences for the offender as grave as one which goes to guilt, and the
same standard should apply in both cases.

Counsel for the respondent furnished the Court with judgments to
which I need not refer in detail, from the Federal Supreme Court of Nyasaland
(presently Malawi), the Courts of Appeal of East Africa, Hong Kong and New
 Guinea, all to the same effect. The standard to be applied is the criminal
standard, beyond a reasonable doubt.

E

American Authorities

The appellant calls in aid an uneven line of American
jurisprudence, which in my view is neither applicable in the Canadian context
nor in this case. The decision most frequently quoted is Williams v. New
 York, 337 U.S. 241, 93 L ed 1337 (1949) which dealt with the
admissibility of hearsay evidence at a sentencing hearing.

Several comments must be made with respect to this decision.
First, the case and those following it, turned on the applicability of the due
process clause of the American Constitution to sentencing hearings. As counsel
for the respondent submits almost all American judicial pronouncements with
respect to the burden of proof on sentencing are grounded in considerations of
American constitutional protections, particularly those afforded by the “due
process” clause. Due process bears a very different meaning in Canada than that
which has been accorded the phrase in the United States, and

[Page 413]

consequently American jurisprudence with respect to the proper
quantum of proof on sentencing is an inappropriate model for Canadian
emulation, Curr v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 889. The controversy
surrounding the applicability of the due process clause to sentencing hearings
has served to accentuate, in the United States, the division in the trial
process before and after conviction. In Canada, there is no such controversy.
Rights equivalent to those provided under the due process clause in the United
 States are here guaranteed at sentencing by statute. In addition, the Williams
decision has been severely questioned in the United States and there are
signs that the due process clause is finding some applicability in the
sentencing process (see United States v. Fatico, 458 F. Supp. 388
(1978); Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 51 L Ed 2d 393 (1977); Gregg
v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 49 L Ed 2d 859 (1976); “Procedural Due
Process at Judicial Sentencing for Felony” (1968), 81 Harv. L. Rev. 821).

Secondly, the Williams decision dealt with the
admissibility of hearsay evidence at sentencing. Arguments militating for a
relaxation at a sentencing hearing of the rules dealing with the admissibility
of evidence at trial do not necessarily support a reduction of the criminal
standard of proof from beyond a reasonable doubt to a preponderance of credible
evidence.

F

The Principles

Sentencing is part of a fact finding, decision-making process of
the criminal law. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, writing in 1863 said that “the sentence
is the gist of the proceeding. It is to the trial what the bullet is to the
powder” (quoted in Olah, “Sentencing: The Last Frontier of the Criminal Law”
(1980), 16 C.R. (3d) 97, at p. 98). The statement is equally true today.

[Page 414]

One of the hardest tasks confronting a trial judge is sentencing.
The stakes are high for society and for the individual. Sentencing is the
critical stage of the criminal justice system, and it is manifest that the
judge should not be denied an opportunity to obtain relevant information by the
imposition of all the restrictive evidential rules common to a trial. Yet the
obtaining and weighing of such evidence should be fair. A substantial liberty
interest of the offender is involved and the information obtained should be
accurate and reliable.

It is a commonplace that the strict rules which govern at trial
do not apply at a sentencing hearing and it would be undesirable to have the
formalities and technicalities characteristic of the normal adversary
proceeding prevail. The hearsay rule does not govern the sentencing hearing.
Hearsay evidence may be accepted where found to be credible and trustworthy.
The judge traditionally has had wide latitude as to the sources and types of
evidence upon which to base his sentence. He must have the fullest possible
information concerning the background of the accused if he is to fit the
sentence to the offender rather than to the crime.

It is well to recall in any discussion of sentencing procedures
that the vast majority of offenders plead guilty. Canadian figures are not
readily available but American statistics suggest that about 85 percent of the
criminal defendants plead guilty or nolo contendere. The sentencing
judge therefore must get his facts after plea. Sentencing is, in respect of
most offenders, the only significant decision the criminal justice system is
called upon to make.

It should also be recalled that a plea of guilty, in itself,
carries with it an admission of the essential legal ingredients of the offence
admitted by the plea, and no more. Beyond that any facts relied upon by the
Crown in aggravation must be established by the Crown. If undisputed, the
procedure

[Page 415]

can be very informal. If the facts are contested the issue should
be resolved by ordinary legal principles governing criminal proceedings
including resolving relevant doubt in favour of the offender.

To my mind, the facts which justify the sanction are no less
important than the facts which justify the conviction; both should be subject
to the same burden of proof. Crime and punishment are inextricably linked. “It
would appear well established that the sentencing process is merely a phase of
the trial process” (Olah, supra, at p. 107). Upon conviction the accused
is not abruptly deprived of all procedural rights existing at trial: he has a
right to counsel, a right to call evidence and cross-examine prosecution
witnesses, a right to give evidence himself and to address the court.

In S. v. Manchester City Recorder, [1969] 3 All
E.R. 1230 the suggestion was made that a court might be functus officio in
the use of its powers to convict or acquit, as distinct from its powers to
sentence. Lord Reid found this proposition to be both novel and erroneous,
adding at p. 1233:

In my judgment magistrates have only one officium—to carry
the case before them to a conclusion. There is no reason to divide up their
functions and hold that at some stage in the proceedings one officium comes to
an end and another begins.

In my view, both the informality of the sentencing procedure as
to the admissibility of evidence and the wide discretion given to the trial
judge in imposing sentence are factors militating in favour of the
retention of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at
sentencing.

[B]ecause the sentencing process poses the ultimate jeopardy
to an individual enmeshed in the criminal process, it is just and reasonable
that he be granted the protection of the reasonable doubt rule at this vital
juncture of the process [Olah, supra, at p. 121].

[Page 416]

The rationale of the argument of the Crown for the acceptance of
a lesser standard of proof is administrative efficiency. In my view, however,
the administrative efficiency argument is not sufficient to overcome such a
basic tenet suffusing our entire criminal justice system as the standard of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I am by no means convinced that if the
standard of proof were lowered, conservation of judicial resources would be
enhanced. In the event of a serious dispute as to facts, it would be in the
interests of the accused to plead not guilty in order to benefit at trial from
the higher standard of reasonable doubt. This would not only be destructive of
judicial economy but at the same time prejudicial to whatever mitigating effect
might have come from a guilty plea, as evidence of remorse. There would seem in
principle no good reason why the sentencing judge in deciding disputed facts
should not observe the same evidentiary standards as we demand of juries. In R.
v. Proudlock, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525 Pigeon J., dealing with an issue
involving conviction, observed (at p. 550):

In my view, there are in our criminal law only three
standards of evidence:

1. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt which is the standard to
be met by the Crown against the accused;

2. Proof on a preponderance of the evidence or a balance of
probabilities which is the burden of proof on the accused when he has to meet a
presumption requiring him to establish or to prove a fact or an excuse;

3. Evidence raising a reasonable doubt which is what is
required to overcome any other presumption of fact or of law.

The civil test only comes into play when the accused has to meet
a presumption and it operates in favour of the accused.

I can see no good purpose served by the alternate Crown
submission, namely, the adoption of a third standard of proof, “clear and
convincing” evidence, in Canadian law. I agree with the remarks of Lord Tucker
in Dingwall v. J. Wharton (Shipping), Ltd., [1961] 2 Lloyd’s Rep.
213 at p. 216:

…I am quite unable to accede to the proposition that there
is some intermediate onus between that which is

[Page 417]

required in criminal cases and the balance of probability
which is sufficient in timeous civil actions.

In conclusion, I see no justification for the introduction of the
complexity and confusion which would inevitably follow upon the acceptance of
standards of proof varying from trial to sentence.

I would dismiss the appeal.
