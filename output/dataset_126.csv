2766778,NSW Crime Commission v Sean Anthony Smith [2015] NSWSC 688,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission seeks restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“CARA”). It brings its application by summons filed in court this morning supported by a statement of facts and circumstances signed by the solicitor Mr Goh and an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark with a number of associated annexures.
	
	
	The affidavit of Mr Spark sets out his belief that the defendant engaged in serious crime related activity and sets out the grounds for that belief. In particular Mr Spark relies upon a statement of facts prepared by the New South Wales Police Force. That statement of facts sets out the details of this investigation into a drug manufacturing operation and indicates that the defendant was heard on a listening device to be present in, and discussing the processes of, what might be called, a meth lab on a rural property.
	
	
	Based on the material in the facts sheet I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion attested to by Mr Spark and in those circumstances s 10A(5) is in mandatory terms and I must make the restraining order.
	
	
	Accordingly I make the orders which are contained in the short minutes of order. I will date and sign those and have them sealed and order that those orders should take effect forthwith.

2766779,NSW Crime Commission v Jose Maria Garcia [2015] NSWSC 674,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The New South Wales Crime Commission (who I will refer to as the plaintiff) seeks a restraining order under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“CARA”) in respect of property identified in the summons and short minutes of order and the affidavit of Mr Spark.
	
	
	The defendant is Jose Maria Garcia also known as “Pepe”. The plaintiff brings this application by summons filed in court this morning and supports that summons by a statement of facts and circumstances signed by the solicitor Ms Miranda and an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark, an employee of the plaintiff.
	
	
	The affidavit of Mr Spark sets out his belief (and the grounds of that belief) that the defendant engaged in a serious crime related activity and in particular supplying a prohibited drug in an amount greater than a large commercial quantity. The prohibited drug in question is methylamphetamine.
	
	
	In para 6 of his affidavit Mr Spark sets out in point form the basis upon which he holds that belief.
	
	
	The affidavit annexes a number of documents, the most significant of which is a facts sheet prepared by an officer of the New South Wales Police Force. That facts sheet shows that certain surveillance was undertaken by the Police following their suspicions that the defendant was engaged in drug supply.
	
	
	At some stage a search was undertaken of a back pack being carried by the defendant and that back pack was found to contain two kilograms of a substance believed to be methyl amphetamine as well as some cash. Based on the information in that facts sheet the suspicion held by Mr Spark is in my opinion held on reasonable grounds and accordingly pursuant to s 10A(5) CARA. I must make the restraining that is sought.
	
	
	The relevant facts set out in the affidavit of Mr Spark as to his belief as to the nature of that property in relation to which the orders are sought. Accordingly I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order provided by the plaintiff. Orders to be taken out forthwith.

		02 June 2015",2015-05-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766786,"NSW Police Force v McKellar, Nerida; NSW Police Force v Knight, Mark [2015] NSWLC 8","​J​​UDGMENT


	
	On 14 August 2012, a surveillance device warrant for premises at 33 Tudor Street, Bourke, was issued. On 16 August 2012, police installed a listening device and an optical device in those premises.
	
	
	The respondents were subsequently charged with serious drug-related offences to which they pleaded not guilty.  For reasons not relevant to the present application, the hearing of those charges is yet to take place.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondents foreshadowed an intention to challenge the admissibility of the surveillance device product.  The Commissioner of Police made an application for public interest immunity pursuant to s 130 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (""Evidence Act"") to prevent two police officers from having to answer questions in cross-examination which could reasonably be expected to reveal details of surveillance device technology, or methods of installation. 
	
	
	Upon the Court being closed, the application proceeded and the following items were tendered:
	



	
	Statement of Leading Senior Constable T Tenkate (Ex 1)
	
	
	Statement of Senior Sergeant M Hayes (Ex 2)
	
	
	Copy of Surveillance Device Warrant SD12/0502 (Ex 3)
	
	
	Open affidavit of Assistant Commissioner M Lanyon (Ex 4)
	
	
	Confidential Affidavit of Assistant Commissioner M Lanyon (Ex 5) [over objection]
	



	
	The applicant submitted that there is a three stage process in relation to a claim of public interest immunity.  The first step is for the respondents to establish a legitimate forensic purpose, and that it is “on the cards” that cross-examination would materially assist their case. This step is in fact the test from R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86 at [11] which dealt with subpoenas rather than oral evidence, however has application in this type of matter.
	
	
	It was said that if a legitimate forensic purpose is demonstrated, the next step is to establish a claim of immunity.  I note however that a claim of public interest immunity is not limited to the Crown and could be made for example by the Court: see Attorney General for NSW v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 690 per Smart J; Young v Quin & Ors (1985) 59 ALR 225 at 227 per Bowen CJ; Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at [44] per Gibbs ACJ. Accordingly, a court might step in without waiting for a legitimate forensic purpose being demonstrated so as to prevent disclosure. So much is also evident from ss 130(2) and (3) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Finally, the Court must balance the public interest in withholding access to documents or information, against the public interest in ensuring that courts performing the functions of justice should have access to relevant evidence: Sankey v Whitlam (supra) at [37] - [50]. I note that the remarks in Sankey v Whitlam (supra) were confined to the application of principles to documentary evidence, though they “apply in relation to oral as well as to documentary evidence”: at [36].  Section 130(1) of the Evidence Act sets out the relevant test [see below].
	
	
	The statements of police (Exs 1 and 2) did not provide any detail of what happened between the time of attending the premises and the commencement of installation of the surveillance device.  Cross-examination was sought to obtain that detail.  It was submitted that there was subterfuge by police in a manner not contemplated, nor allowed, by legislation, giving rise to a challenge to the admissibility of evidence on grounds of illegality or impropriety under s 138 of the Evidence Act.

proceeding includes:

(a)  a proceeding before a court, tribunal, Royal Commission or special commission of inquiry, or

(b)  a proceeding before any other body or authority having power by law to require the production of documents or the answering of questions.""

Evidence Act


	
	Section 130 of the Evidence Act prescribes the following:
	


""130   Exclusion of evidence of matters of state

(1)  If the public interest in admitting into evidence information or a document that relates to matters of state is outweighed by the public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to the information or document, the court may direct that the information or document not be adduced as evidence.

(2)  The court may give such a direction either on its own initiative or on the application of any person (whether or not the person is a party).

(3)  In deciding whether to give such a direction, the court may inform itself in any way it thinks fit.

(4)  Without limiting the circumstances in which information or a document may be taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to relate to matters of state, the information or document is taken for the purposes of that subsection to relate to matters of state if adducing it as evidence would:

(a)  prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia, or

(b)  damage relations between the Commonwealth and a State or between 2 or more States, or

(c)  prejudice the prevention, investigation or prosecution of an offence, or

(d)  prejudice the prevention or investigation of, or the conduct of proceedings for recovery of civil penalties brought with respect to, other contraventions of the law, or

(e)  disclose, or enable a person to ascertain, the existence or identity of a confidential source of information relating to the enforcement or administration of a law of the Commonwealth or a State, or

(f)  prejudice the proper functioning of the government of the Commonwealth or a State.

(5)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to take into account the following matters:

(b)  if the proceeding is a criminal proceeding—whether the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or document is a defendant or the prosecutor,

(c)  the nature of the offence, cause of action or defence to which the information or document relates, and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding,

(d)  the likely effect of adducing evidence of the information or document, and the means available to limit its publication,

(e)  whether the substance of the information or document has already been published,

(f)  if the proceeding is a criminal proceeding and the party seeking to adduce evidence of the information or document is a defendant—whether the direction is to be made subject to the condition that the prosecution be stayed.

(6)  A reference in this section to a State includes a reference to a Territory.""


	
	Section 138 prescribes the following:
	


""138   Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence

(1)  Evidence that was obtained:

(a)  improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b)  in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:

(a)  did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or

(b)  made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.

(3)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:

(a)  the probative value of the evidence, and

(b)  the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(c)  the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

(d)  the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

(e)  whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

(f)  whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and

(g)  whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

(h)  the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.

Note. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is set out in Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 of the Commonwealth.""


	
	Mr Thompson properly indicated that no challenge was made to the validity of the surveillance device warrant.  He noted that s 21(2) of the Act contemplates the use of force if necessary for the purpose of the installation of a surveillance device.  Further, that s 21(3)(c) authorises specific actions, including the use of an assumed identity for the purpose of the installation of a surveillance device, though it does not allow for conduct amounting to subterfuge.  He submitted that the Act must be read narrowly as it is a draconian piece of legislation giving significant powers to police and the ability to rely upon confidential affidavit material in support of public interest immunity arguments, which placed the defence (here, the respondents) at a significant disadvantage.
	
	
	Mr Thompson submitted that, in any event, the purpose of cross-examination was not aimed at s 42(1) of the Act as it was not at all concerned with “methods of installation”.  It was said that if s 42 was not enlivened, then the application must necessarily fail.  It was further submitted that s 42 was concerned with technology rather than the methodology.  The heading above s 42 is instructive in answering the submission that s 42 was concerned with disclosure of information in relation to technology – “Protection of surveillance device technologies and methods”. [Emphasis added].
	
	
	It is necessary to examine whether the method used by police to enter premises and what occurred inside the premises formed part of the “methods of installation” or whether installation had a restricted meaning limited to the installation of the physical device.
	
	
	Section 21(2) of the Act authorizes the installation of the device. Section 21(3)(c) authorizes the “use of an assumed identity for the purpose of the installation…”. ""Purpose of the installation"" is not mentioned in s 42. Given its ordinary meaning, purpose in this context means ""an intended or desired result"".  It would be absurd to interpret the “use of an assumed identity” as being limited to, by way of hypothetical example, dressing in a particular way or adopting an identity that might assist in gaining entry to premises but having no ability to role play consistent with the assumed identity.  The vast range of powers set out in s 23(3) make it abundantly clear that police can act covertly or use an assumed identity – i.e. to conceal the fact of intended or actual installation.  The word “use” should be given a broad interpretation.
	
	
	""Method"" means a procedure, technique or way of doing something. The methods of installation should be read as including the methods used to gain entry to premises, the use of assumed identity if applicable, and all relevant steps taken for the purpose of, and in the process of, installation. The method to be used may differ depending on, for example, the degree of difficulty in installing the device without being detected. The steps taken by police in the installation of a surveillance device, or the maintenance, retrieval of, or enhancement of equipment are part of the methodology that police wish to protect – they do so by raising objection under s 42(1) of the Act.  Sections 21(3), 21(5) and 42(1) demonstrate the legislative intent to give police broad powers of installation once a warrant exists, with a strong degree of protection from their methods becoming publicly known.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon a number of cases dealing with public interest immunity. In Young v Quin & Ors (supra) at 236, Beaumont J cited a passage from D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (1978) AC 171 at 232 in which effective policing was listed as a facet of a larger public interest.  Beaumont J went on to say:
	


“the answers might reveal police methods of operation to the prejudice both of future activities of the Australian Federal Police and of relationship with overseas police forces….(and there is) concern that the revelation of information regarding surveillance of drug offenders would be likely to assist those in the drug trade to mount counter surveillance”.


	
	I have had regard to the confidential affidavit (Ex 5).  I am therefore aware of certain police methodologies used for the installation of surveillance devices, including in the present case.  I consider that the disclosure of information relating to surveillance device technology or methods of installation is not in the public interest and that cross-examination of the two officers for the purpose stated by Mr Thompson would result in such disclosure [see s 42(3) of the Act]. Such disclosure would undoubtedly prejudice effective policing strategies in the future.
	
	
	However, s 42(3) of the Act also requires that I take into account whether disclosure of the information is necessary for the fair trial of the defendant (here, the respondents).  The prosecution are often in a poor position to anticipate the case to be led by the defence.  Mr Thompson was proposing to call witnesses who were said to be at the house at the time of the installation. Presumably, such evidence might establish there was a basis to show it was “on the cards” that cross-examination of the officers would materially assist the defence case.
	
	
	Notwithstanding my findings in relation to the interpretation of the legislation, in the interests of justice and for reasons of procedural fairness, I allowed Mr Thompson to call his witnesses – one nearly 15 and the other 21 years of age.  I note that Mr Hill for the applicant anticipated that such evidence would be given on the voir dire and did not oppose it. 
	
	
	Both witnesses for the respondent gave evidence. It is not appropriate to outline their evidence in this judgment, suffice to say that it added little, if anything, to the matters to be determined on the application.  Nothing in their evidence gave rise to illegality or impropriety of the police officers.  There is no basis in my view for an argument under s 138 of the Evidence Act.  I am satisfied that the disclosure through cross-examination of the police officers is not necessary for the fair trial of the respondents pursuant to s 42(3) of the Act.  I am informed by submissions that neither respondent was the lawful occupier of the premises, nor were they aware of the surveillance devices.  The evidence of the witnesses called does not demonstrate any wrongdoing by police or any actions contrary to authorisations under the surveillance device warrant.
	
	
	The legitimate forensic purpose of cross-examination on behalf of the respondents was two-fold: firstly, that s 42 of the Act was not enlivened as the proposed cross-examination did not touch upon methods of installation; and, secondly, that the subterfuge by police gave rise to considerations under s 138 of the Evidence Act.  For the reasons given above, I am not satisfied that either argument is made out.
	
	
	Having had regard to all of s 130 of the Evidence Act, I am satisfied under subsection (1) that the public interest in preserving secrecy or confidentiality in relation to the information outweighs the public interest in admitting into evidence information that relates to a matter of state.
	


Orders


	
	The application is granted.  Officers Hayes and Tenkate are not required to disclose information of surveillance device technology or methods of installation: s 42(2) of the Act.
	
	
	The publication of information given in these proceedings which could reasonably be expected to reveal details of methods of installation, use of or retrieval of surveillance devices, is prohibited: s 42(5) of the Act.
	
	
	Information as to surveillance device technology, or methods of installation, use or retrieval of surveillance devices is not to be adduced as evidence except as is required for the proper conduct of the proceedings: s 130(1) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The confidential affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Lanyon is returned to the Crown Solicitor.

2766792,Halac v R [2015] NSWCCA 121,"_________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Garling J.
	
	
	GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of NSW by her Honour, Judge Hock, on 21 February 2014.
	
	
	The applicant, Sven Halac, pleaded guilty before Hock DCJ to an indictment on which there was one offence contrary to s 302.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth), namely that on 17 March 2011 in Sydney, he:
	


“… did traffic in a substance … being a controlled drug, namely, methamphetamine and 4-methylmethylamphetamine, and the quantity trafficked being a commercial quantity of methamphetamine and 4-methylmethylamphetamine.”


	
	It will be convenient to refer to this offence as the principal offence.
	
	
	At the time of sentencing, the applicant admitted a further offence and asked the Court to take that further offence into account in passing sentence on him for the principal offence. That offence was one also contrary to s 302.2(1) of the Criminal Code, namely that he did:
	


“aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an offence by Sjoerd Rogier Segaar, namely the trafficking in a substance by Sjoerd Rogier Segaar, the substance being a controlled drug, namely methamphetamine and 4-methylmethylamphetamine, and the quantity trafficked by Sjoerd Rogier Segaar, being a commercial quantity …”


	
	It will be convenient to refer to this offence as the schedule offence.
	
	
	The principal offence related to an occasion on 17 March 2011, when he was involved in the trafficking of 50.045 kg of white powder which, when analysed, showed a combined average purity of 80.8%. This meant that he was involved in the trafficking of 40.45 kg of pure methamphetamine and 4-methylmethylamphetamine. The facts and circumstances surrounding this offence will be set out in some detail shortly.
	
	
	The schedule offence involved the applicant aiding and abetting Mr Segaar who trafficked 14.312 kg of drugs from Sydney to Perth which, when analysed had a combined average purity of 76.4%, with the result that the amount of pure drug was 10.94 kg.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the principal offence is imprisonment for life. No standard non-parole period is applicable.
	
	
	Hock DCJ imposed an overall sentence of 18 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years and 6 months, commencing on 20 April 2011, which was the date upon which the applicant was arrested.
	


Facts


	
	The following summary of the facts is taken from the Statement of Facts tendered to the sentencing Judge, and from her Honour’s summary.
	
	
	The applicant was identified by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in connection with a syndicate in the Netherlands involved in trafficking controlled drugs in Australia. Amongst others, Ferry Cornelis Van Tatenhove, Adrian Stavrianos, Scott Bryce, and Sjoerd Segaar also came to the attention of the AFP.
	
	
	Between 1 February 2011 and 18 April 2011, the applicant was observed in the vicinity of a residential unit block in Clovelly on seven occasions. The applicant was observed by occupants of the Clovelly units opening and leaning into a white Mercedes van (“the van”). Keys to the van and a padlock for the garage in which it was housed were located in the boot of a locked car in the garage of a residential unit at 2 Grosvenor Street, Kensington. The single lock-up garage at the Clovelly units, and a unit at the Kensington units were both leased by Mr Van Tatenhove.
	
	
	On 17 March 2011, which was the day of the principal offence, the applicant drove his black Volkswagen Golf (“the Golf”) vehicle to Kensington, where he parked and walked into the driveway of the residential unit block at 2 Grosvenor Street.
	
	
	Shortly after arriving, the applicant was seen driving away from that residential unit block in a blue Holden Commodore. The blue Commodore was registered in the name of a known alias of Mr Van Tatenhove in February 2010. The applicant drove the Commodore to the Clovelly units, entered the driveway, and reversed the car to the garage door of Unit 6, the unit leased by Mr Van Tatenhove.
	
	
	The applicant, while parked in front of the garage at the Clovelly units, was seen to open the boot of the Commodore. The applicant left the Clovelly units and drove the Commodore to the Moore Park SupaCenta where he parked and was approached by Mr Stavrianos. Mr Stavrianos identified a white Toyota Corolla which was also parked in the car park. The applicant parked the Commodore next to the Corolla, removed three large sports bags from the Commodore, and placed them in the rear hatch of the Corolla. A further conversation took place between the applicant and Mr Stavrianos. Following the conversation the applicant left the SupaCenta, returned the Commodore back to the unit at Kensington, and left the property on foot. He was not arrested at that time.
	
	
	Mr Stavrianos met Mr Bryce at the exit of the car park at the SupaCenta and appeared to hand him a set of keys. Mr Bryce walked to the Corolla and drove the car out of the car park. Shortly after, Mr Bryce was stopped by AFP members and arrested. Three black bags containing 50.045 kg of white powder were located in the rear of the Corolla and seized. Mr Stavrianos was arrested by AFP members at about the same time in Kensington. The applicant was not arrested at that time.
	
	
	In respect of the schedule offence, the applicant was first observed to be involved on 21 March 2011, when he drove his Golf to the unit at Kensington, where he met with Mr Sjoerd Segaar. Mr Segaar, a Dutch national also identified by AFP members in relation to the syndicate, resided at the Kensington unit for a short period from 25 February 2011 until he left on 31 March 2011 to complete his role in the schedule offence.
	
	
	The applicant drove with Mr Segaar to Botany where Mr Segaar left the vehicle and entered the premises of Travel Wheels, a campervan rental company. Mr Segaar rented a campervan for a period from 21 March 2011 to 19 May 2011.
	
	
	Mr Segaar departed Travel Wheels in the campervan and followed the applicant in his vehicle to the Kensington units, where Mr Segaar and the campervan remained, and the applicant drove away in his Golf.
	
	
	Over the course of the next week, the applicant was seen on numerous occasions with Mr Segaar at the Kensington unit. The applicant was seen removing various items, including a toolbox, from his Golf and walking them into the unit block at Kensington. The applicant was also seen in the vicinity of the Clovelly unit block.
	
	
	On 28 March 2011, while the campervan was parked at Kensington, Mr Segaar was seen looking beneath the mattress inside. The applicant, who had arrived shortly before in his Golf, retrieved tools from his vehicle and entered the campervan with Mr Segaar. Shortly after, the two men drove in the Golf to Bunnings Warehouse in Randwick where they were seen leaving with three pieces of plywood, a hand saw, and a blue and white coloured Esky.
	
	
	Upon returning to Kensington, a conversation between the two men was recorded as they were working in the campervan. The translation of their intercepted conversation indicated that the two men were constructing something inside the van for the purpose of concealing two items.
	
	
	The applicant and Mr Segaar then drove to Anaconda Camping Goods Store at the Moore Park SupaCenta and purchased various camping items, including two black Denali brand backpacks. The two men left the store with their items contained in two large Anaconda branded orange plastic bags.
	
	
	The following day, 29 March 2011, the applicant picked Mr Segaar up from the Kensington unit and drove to the vicinity of 35 Darley Road, Randwick, where Mr Segaar left the Golf and put an orange plastic bag in a rubbish bin. AFP members later retrieved the orange coloured Anaconda branded plastic bag from the bin which was found to contain, amongst other things, silver duct tape and latex gloves. Forensic testing revealed the presence of methamphetamine and 4-methymethylamphetamine on several pieces of the silver duct tape.
	
	
	At 9:10am on 31 March 2011 Mr Segaar left the Kensington unit in the campervan. He was tracked by police to Perth where he arrived on 7 April 2011. On 20 April 2011 Western Australian Police in company with AFP members searched the campervan and located two black Denali brand backpacks concealed inside modified boxes beneath the mattress in the campervan. Each backpack contained seven packages of off-white powder that had a combined weight of 14.312 kg. Mr Segaar was arrested that night.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 20 April 2011 when AFP members executed a search warrant at his residential premises at Unit 1/17 Marcel Avenue, Coogee.
	
	
	On 21 April 2011, the day after the applicant was arrested, the garage at the Clovelly units was searched and found to house the white Mercedes van with expired registration and flat tyres. Inside the van, police located a number of sports bags containing plastic bags filled with an off-white powder. The powder was found to be methamphetamine and 4-methymethylamphetamine, and had a combined weight of 164.7 kilograms. The pure weight of the drugs was calculated to be 129.026 kilograms. The applicant’s DNA was found on the exterior driver’s side door handle of the van, and on a polo shirt and work glove located inside the van. The applicant’s DNA was not located on any of the plastic bags containing the drugs. The material about the quantity of drugs found during this search was objected to. Her Honour admitted the material.
	


Sentence Proceedings in District Court


	
	In the District Court proceedings, the Crown tendered a Summary of Facts of 18 pages. There was an objection to paragraphs 10 and 12 of the Summary because, so the sentencing Judge was informed by senior counsel for the applicant, those paragraphs referred to a volume of drug which was not germane to the offence on the indictment to which the applicant pleaded guilty. As well, he submitted that it was not relevant to the overall nature of the offending which was to be taken into account. The particular material which was objected to has been summarised in [29] above.
	
	
	In addition, the Crown tendered a past criminal record of the applicant from Belgium, and drew the sentencing Judge’s attention to three other sentences involving the other individuals who had been involved in what the Crown submitted was the same criminal syndicate, of which both the principal offence and the schedule offence were a part.
	
	
	The applicant’s senior counsel tendered a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 23 November 2011, that is to say, over two years prior to the sentencing hearing, some material reflecting the applicant’s progress whilst in custody, a letter from the applicant and some testimonials. As well, documentary evidence was tendered that established that the applicant’s parents, who were resident in Europe, were elderly, unwell and unable to travel to Australia. No oral evidence was called.
	
	
	The report of Dr Nielssen, which was not subjected to any cross-examination by the prosecutor, stated that the applicant had told him that during the years he lived in Australia, namely since about 2003, he had participated in long-term psychological therapy to help address feelings of anger which he had towards his father arising out of his upbringing as a young child, and aspects of his own behaviour also arising out of his early life experiences. The applicant told Dr Nielssen he had been seeing a psychotherapist at a health clinic in Sydney at weekly intervals for a period of about four years. There was no evidence before the Court from that psychotherapist.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen recorded that the applicant had suffered some periods of depression and had been prescribed anti-depressant medication in the past, but that he had not taken it regularly. In terms of his personal history, the applicant told Dr Nielssen that his mother was a Belgium national, that his father came from one of the mountainous regions of Turkey from a farming family and was a man of little formal education. The applicant told Dr Nielssen that he left school early, had worked as a painter, driving forklift trucks and as a builder’s labourer, and that he was always employed prior to coming to Australia. The applicant was multilingual, and apparently had not undergone any further education after leaving school.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen undertook a mental state examination and expressed the view that the applicant did not meet any of the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder. He noted that there had been no history of developmental delay, clinically significant intellectual impairment or symptoms of psychotic illness or severe depression.
	
	
	The case notes from the Department of Corrective Services, noted that the applicant had generally been well behaved, in regular employment and generally speaking, was an inmate about whom there was little, if any, criticism.
	
	
	The letter which the applicant wrote to the sentencing Judge was not supported by any sworn evidence. It expressed feelings of remorse and regret “… about my stupid and irresponsible behaviour”. He told the sentencing Judge that his behaviour in committing the crime “… represented poor judgment and ignorance”, and that he was “… very regretful and deeply ashamed for what happened”. He expressed his determination to “turn his life around” and to attempt to ensure that his future was a good one.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted to the sentencing Judge in comparison with one of the other relevant individuals, Mr Stavrianos, that the applicant’s criminality was less serious and by comparison, his offence was of a lesser gravity than the offence committed by Mr Stavrianos.
	
	
	The applicant’s senior counsel justified that submission by pointing to the fact that Mr Stavrianos was in communication with individuals overseas in respect of the quantity of drugs, including undertaking some negotiation. Mr Stavrianos was arranging for the delivery of the drugs to be done by others and that that combination produced a “signal difference” in the gravity of the offence to which the applicant was pleading guilty. It was put this way by senior counsel for the applicant:
	


“In our submission, those reasons more than suffice to produce a signal difference between the gravity of the offence seen from a point of view of the involvement in the overall evil of illegal distribution of prohibited substances as well as what might be called a difference in what might be called the hierarchical question. I wouldn’t wish to be understood as making the hierarchy submission to the forefront of the differences between Mr Stavrianos and my client, but there is a difference …”


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant agreed in submission that there was a materially greater involvement in the drug handling aspect of his client’s offence, than with respect to that of Mr Bryce, who was one of the other individuals whose sentence was before her Honour.
	
	
	As senior counsel for the applicant accepted, there was some difference in the subjective cases for each of Mr Stavrianos and the applicant but, ultimately, senior counsel submitted that such differences were not so marked as to result in any significant difference in the sentence between Mr Stavrianos and the applicant.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also submitted that, having regard to the timing and negotiations preceding the entry of the plea of guilty, his client was entitled to the maximum discount, namely, 25% on any sentence which he would otherwise have received. The Crown contended that 20% was appropriate.
	
	
	It does seem, although this is not entirely clear, that the Crown, having submitted to the sentencing Judge that the objective seriousness of the offending was above the mid-range, and that categorisation was in contest, that the applicant must have contended that the offending was below the mid-range.
	


Applicant’s Subjective Features


	
	The applicant was born on 29 June 1968, and was accordingly 42 years old at the time of the offence.
	
	
	He had no previous criminal history in Australia, although he had a previous criminal history in Europe.
	
	
	When he was 21, he was convicted by a Belgian court of theft in company accompanied by violence or the threat of violence. He was also convicted of a number of other counts of theft, handling stolen goods, counterfeiting and using counterfeit documents, and giving false testimony. For these offences he was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a suspended prison sentence of 5 years in addition. At the same time, he was convicted of two counts of possession of illicit drugs for which he received a fine and a suspended prison sentence.
	
	
	In July 1992, a French court sitting in Paris convicted him of importing, trading, transporting and selling illicit drugs and participating in the smuggling of prohibited goods. For these offences he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and a permanent restraining order was made prohibiting him from entering French territory.
	
	
	In 1994, he was convicted in a court in Ghent in Belgium of possession, purchase and importation of psychotropic substances. He was given a prison sentence of 1 year and a further suspended prison sentence.
	
	
	In 1995 he was convicted of selling illicit drugs and being in possession of them. For this offence he was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment.
	
	
	It can be seen that between the time he turned 21 in 1984, and about the turn of the century when he was 32, he had spent about 10 years in prison.
	
	
	As indicated earlier, the applicant came to Australia in 2003, and was involved in a number of romantic relationships with different women. He was the father of two children at the time of his sentencing. The inability of his elderly parents to travel to Australia meant that his capacity to stay in touch with them was severely restricted, if not completely removed.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing Judge commenced by summarising the Statement of Facts and the nature of the offending. She carefully noted the conduct of the applicant which directly related to the principal offence.
	
	
	She also noted as a matter of general context that the drugs had been brought into Australia by a sophisticated syndicate from the Netherlands. The principal offence was a part of that syndicate’s operations.
	
	
	Having noted all of the facts and, in particular, the facts surrounding the principal offence, her Honour went on to note that the particular role of the applicant, and the weight of the drugs were both factors relevant to the sentencing exercise. Her Honour noted that the weight of the drugs referrable to the principal offence was:
	


“… more than 53 times the threshold for the commercial quantity for methamphetamine which is 0.75 kilos.”


	
	This was a reference to the 40.45 kg of pure methamphetamine.
	
	
	Her Honour then analysed the applicant’s role. Of that, she said:
	


“As to the offender’s role, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he played a very significant part in this criminal enterprise.

I base that finding on these matters:

that he was the person who had access to, and obtained the drugs from, the Mercedes van which was kept at Clovelly Road premises. Those drugs were then handed over to Mr Stavrianos;

he was with Mr Van Tatenhove, who was further up the hierarchy, on five occasions between 29 January and 22 February 2011.

As previously outlined in the facts, the vehicle, that is the Mercedes van, contained 164.7 kilos of powder which was later analysed and calculated to be 129 kilos pure.

It is highly significant in my view that the offender was trusted to have access to this store or cache of drugs.”


	
	Her Honour, having drawn attention to those matters, then expressed this conclusion, but with a clear, and with respect, an entirely correct, caveat:
	


“I keep firmly in mind that he is to be sentenced for trafficking in 40 kilos of pure methamphetamine, but in assessing his role, his access demonstrates a greater involvement and level of trust and responsibility than either of the two co-offenders who have been sentenced.”


	
	Her Honour then dealt with the schedule offence and described the facts surrounding the applicant’s participation in that offence. Her Honour noted that the quantity of drugs involved with that offence was 10.94 kg, which was more than 14 times the commercial quantity.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that Mr Segaar, who was the principal offender in the schedule offence, had been found guilty by a jury and had been sentenced by the Supreme Court in Western Australia to 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and 4 months.
	
	
	Her Honour went on to consider the applicant’s subjective background, including his criminal history. Her Honour said of this that the applicant’s record did not entitle him to leniency, particularly as he had been in prison previously for similar offences.
	
	
	Of the applicant, her Honour concluded:
	


“In summary, the offender is an intelligent man. There is nothing in his subjective case which explains his willingness to engage in the illegal drug trade, yet again, in a foreign country. I note that the offender in his letter attributes his behaviour to ‘poor judgment and ignorance’. However, I find that his motivation must have been greed, given the enormous monetary value of such a large quantity of methamphetamine.”


	
	Her Honour went on to express the view that she could not accept the factual account given by the applicant to Dr Nielssen, including in particular, that her Honour did not accept that the applicant was only paid a sum of $15,000 for his part in the trafficking offence. She found that the applicant’s financial reward “… must have been a significant sum”.
	
	
	Her Honour noted the terms of imprisonment that had been imposed on others who had played a role in the principal offence. These were Mr Bryce, who was sentenced to 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years, and Mr Stavrianos who was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months.
	
	
	Her Honour then turned to consider the applicant’s role by comparison with Mr Stavrianos in response to the submissions which senior counsel for the applicant had made. On that question, her Honour said:
	


“Senior counsel for the offender submitted that this offender’s role was less than that of Mr Stavrianos.

I do not accept that that is the case. On my findings of facts, the offender was significantly more involved than Mr Stavrianos and his sentence must reflect this. In addition, there is the matter on the schedule, with his involvement in another serious drug offence, although his involvement is clearly at a lower level than for the count on the indictment.”


	
	Her Honour noted that it was appropriate to allow a discount of 25% to reflect the plea of guilty.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The applicant relies upon three grounds of appeal. They are as follows:
	



	
	The sentencing Judge erred in taking into account that the applicant had access to a store or cache of drugs in the amount of 164.7 kg.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge erred in determining in relation to the count on the Indictment, that the applicant was significantly more involved than the offender Stavrianos.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge erred in her assessment of the seriousness of the role of the applicant in the offence.
	


Ground 1: Store of Drugs


	
	As I have earlier described, the Mercedes van was searched on 21 April 2011, which was the day after the applicant was arrested. At that time drugs were discovered in it which had a combined weight of 164.7 kg and a pure weight of 129 kg. This search was conducted a little over one month after the principal offence occurred.
	
	
	The applicant visited the vehicle for a short time, about one minute, on 18 April 2011. Prior to that the applicant was last seen in the garage on 6 April 2011, when he left a large sports bag at the entrance to the garage.
	
	
	The search of the van revealed that the bags in which the drugs were contained were generally 1 kg in weight, and those bags were then found within a number of larger sports bags. The applicant’s DNA was found on the exterior handle of the sliding door on the driver’s side of the van, on a shirt and a work glove inside the van. Other DNA profiles were also found on the shirt and gloves. The applicant’s DNA was not located on any of the plastic bags in which the drugs were contained.
	
	
	Before the sentencing Judge, senior counsel for the applicant accepted that the quantity of drugs found in the van in April 2014 may be relevant in considering the:
	


“… overall criminality of the overall project in which all sorts of people are involved …”


	
	However, he submitted that the quantity did not reflect upon the applicant’s criminality and could not be relevantly taken into account in the sentence to be imposed upon him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted on appeal that the sentencing Judge erred in determining that the applicant was trusted to have access to the store or cache of drugs in the van. It was submitted that implicit in that finding was both the actual quantity of the drug found, and that the applicant knew of the quantity of drugs (namely, 164.7 kg of combined weight) present in the van in the garage. It was submitted on appeal that that finding was not open to the sentencing Judge on the evidence. The applicant submitted:
	


“Put simply, the drugs could have been put in that garage by someone else without the applicant knowing anything about it.”


	
	The Summary of Facts which was before the sentencing Judge revealed that the applicant was observed to be in the vicinity of the garage at the Clovelly units in which the van was kept on seven occasions between 1 February 2011 and 18 April 2011. On two of those occasions, he was accompanied by Mr Van Tatenhove who, on any view, was a senior person in the drug importation syndicate. On five of those occasions, the applicant attended without Mr Van Tatenhove, including on one occasion when he was in the company of Mr Segaar. Occupants of the block of apartments saw the applicant alone in the garage on a number of occasions, opening and leaning into the van which was parked there.
	
	
	The garage at the Clovelly units had first been rented in August 2009. The rental had been continued, at least up until April 2011. The facts disclosed that the tenant of the unit who had leased the garage to Mr Van Tatenhove, had entered the garage on a number of occasions to deal with her personal items, and on each occasion had seen the van parked in the garage. At the time the van was searched by the police on 21 April 2011, its registration had expired, and it had flat tyres. It had originally been purchased by Mr Van Tatenhove in December 2008.
	
	
	Clearly, on the basis of those facts, the van had been purchased, the garage had been leased, and the van parked in it for a significant period of time without being moved and in circumstances where the van was used to store drugs. That was apparently the reason why the applicant went there from time to time. There was no other reason suggested for him so to do.
	
	
	Another garage at Kensington had been used by Mr Van Tatenhove and Mr Segaar for their purposes. The applicant was seen in the vicinity of that garage on 20 occasions, with Mr Van Tatenhove, with Mr Segaar, and a number of other unidentified individuals. On occasions the applicant visited that unit block alone. On one occasion, the applicant transported a black and white sports bag from the Kensington garage to the garage at the Clovelly units where the van was parked.
	
	
	On the day of the principal offence, the applicant first attended at the garage in Kensington and then went to the garage where the van was stored. He removed from the van the parcel of drugs which ultimately made its way to Mr Stavrianos.
	
	
	The vehicle which he drove for the purpose of that offence was not his own Golf, which he had driven to and parked near the garage at Kensington. Rather he used a vehicle which was parked near the garage at Kensington and which was in the name of a known alias of Mr Van Tatenhove and which had been purchased by his girlfriend. The applicant returned that Commodore motor vehicle to the garage and left it there.
	
	
	It is also to be noted that the various residential premises and garages used by the drug syndicate were not under constant surveillance by members of the Australian Federal Police.
	
	
	Her Honour’s finding about the role which the applicant played in the criminal enterprise was that he played a “very significant part”. Principally, that finding was based upon the fact that he had access to, and obtained drugs from, the van which was a place where drugs were stored. However, even if not specifically referred to, such a finding must be taken to have been made by reference to all of the facts before the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	Although her Honour did not articulate this, the facts demonstrated that the van had been in place for a lengthy period of time, was not capable of being driven lawfully on the road, and without some repairs to its tyres, was not capable of being driven at all. Having regard to the number of times the applicant came and went, that he was seen accessing the van, and on the occasion when he committed the principal offence (he removed 50 kg combined weight of drugs from there), it was open to her Honour to find, as she did, that this van was the store or cache for the drugs being distributed by the syndicate to which the applicant had unsupervised and apparently unrestricted access.
	
	
	Her Honour also noted the applicant’s contact with Mr Van Tatenhove on a number of occasions prior to this offence. Her Honour did not specifically note, but was entitled to have regard to, the many occasions upon which the applicant had visited the garage premises in Kensington which was one of the premises used by Mr Van Tatenhove for the purposes of this drug importation syndicate.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded, based on the matters to which I have drawn attention, that the applicant had a greater involvement in the drug syndicate than did Mr Stavrianos and Mr Bryce, and that his “level of trust and responsibility”, was greater than either of those two.
	
	
	Her Honour’s findings about the access of the applicant to the van, its use as a storage place for drugs, and his contact with senior members of the drug syndicate were abundantly justified by the facts.
	
	
	It is correct that her Honour referred to the drugs in the van by reference to the combined weight of 164.7 kg. It also can be accepted that those drugs were found in the van after the applicant’s arrest. It can also be accepted that people other than the applicant had access to the van. It was not suggested, and her Honour did not find, that the applicant had put the drugs in the van, nor that he knew they were there in that quantity at the time the van was searched.
	
	
	The weight of those drugs was, of itself, wholly irrelevant to the integers of the principal offence. It was not appropriate, and her Honour expressly noted that she was not engaged in an exercise of sentencing the applicant by reference to the weight of the drugs which were found in the van after his arrest.
	
	
	The reference set out in [56] as to the quantity of the drugs found in the van was an unnecessary one, and when looked at in the calm reflection of an appellate court, an unfortunate one. But the resolution of this ground of the appeal is not to be determined by any failure of grammatical, or proper expression by a sentencing Judge.
	
	
	It is not apparent to me, from a reading of the whole of the sentencing remarks, that the sentencing Judge did anything more than use the weight of the drugs found in the van after the applicant’s arrest, as a way of identifying the van to which earlier reference had been made.
	
	
	The inclusion of any reference to the quantity of drugs found occurred on two occasions in the Remarks on Sentence. The first was when her Honour was giving a general description of the nature of the syndicate and the police investigation and its results. The second reference is that to which I have referred in [56] above. To the extent that her initial reference to the drugs was made, it was nothing more than, and ought be read only as being, a reference to the general background of the drug syndicate under the aegis of which the applicant’s principal offence fell.
	
	
	Her Honour was careful to note that she was not sentencing the applicant for the drugs that were found in the van, but was sentencing him for the role which he played in the delivery of a lesser, but nevertheless very large, quantity of drugs.
	
	
	I can detect no error of the kind for which the applicant contends, and I would not be prepared to uphold this ground.
	


Ground 2: Relative Involvement


	
	The applicant submits that the sentencing Judge erred in determining that the applicant was significantly more involved than Mr Stavrianos. This finding of the sentencing Judge followed, and gave content to, her rejection of a submission of senior counsel for the applicant that his role was less than that of Mr Stavrianos.
	
	
	Mr Stavrianos was the subject of a sentence, pronounced in the District Court by Hock DCJ on 27 April 2012.
	
	
	In her Remarks on Sentence with respect to Mr Stavrianos, her Honour noted in addition to taking delivery of the drugs from the applicant, that he had also undertaken, by email, in the period from 2 February 2011 to 15 March 2011, negotiations over the price and the delivery of the drugs.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded with respect to Mr Stavrianos, this:
	


“There is no evidence as to what remuneration the offender stood to gain from his involvement. However, given his role and value of the drugs, it must have been a significant figure. He was involved to a significant level in the hierarchy of this criminal offence. While the Crown conceded he was not ‘a’ or ‘the’ principal, he was not at a low level either, which Mr Bryce was. Not only was the offender communicating with others overseas in respect of this quantity of drugs, he was also arranging for the delivery to be done by others, no doubt in an attempt to distance himself.”


	
	It is also relevant to note that the subjective case with respect to Mr Stavrianos was quite different from that with respect to the applicant. In particular, her Honour found that Mr Stavrianos had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend. She found that he was an otherwise law abiding man who had engaged in, surprisingly to those who knew him, the particular criminal activity.
	
	
	There were differences in the facts tendered with respect to the role played by the applicant on the one hand and Mr Stavrianos on the other with respect to this particular drug transaction. Her Honour was called upon to make an evaluative conclusion based upon the facts which were tendered before her as to the role which the applicant played, and because of the submission which was made to her, his position relative to that of Mr Stavrianos. As is clear, her Honour concluded that his role was more significant than that of Mr Stavrianos.
	
	
	Having regard to the factual differences proved between them, such a finding was open to her Honour. It is only reviewable in this Court on the principles set out in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499: see Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [36] per Spigelman CJ, at [46] per Simpson J; R v KB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [53] per Bathurst CJ.
	
	
	The features of the applicant’s offending which were before her Honour, namely, the extent of his contact with other members of the syndicate, his frequent and unsupervised access to the van from which the drugs were removed for the purpose of their supply to Mr Stavrianos, and his extensive visits to the premises at Kensington, which was an address used by the drug syndicate, were all sufficient as a proper basis for the finding which her Honour made. These factual features were absent from the offending of Mr Stavrianos.
	
	
	I can detect no error of a kind sufficient to satisfy these principles. I am not persuaded to uphold Ground 2.
	


Ground 3: Assessment of Seriousness


	
	This ground of appeal asserts that the sentencing Judge “… erred in her assessment of the seriousness of the role of the applicant in the offence”.
	
	
	As there is a good deal of overlap between this ground and the previous two grounds, it is appropriate to concentrate on the features of the applicant’s submissions with respect to this ground which are not otherwise dealt with specifically.
	
	
	In the consideration of this ground, the applicant drew attention to the erroneous approach of the sentencing Judge in:
	



	
	connecting the activities of the applicant to the quantity of drugs found in the van (164.5 kg);
	
	
	taking into consideration the overall activities of the syndicate of which the applicant’s offence was a part;
	
	
	wrongly attributing to the applicant greater criminality than Mr Stavrianos.
	



	
	These are submissions dealt with under Grounds 1 and 2. In addition to these submissions, the following arguments were raised. First, it was submitted that her Honour was in error in rejecting the statement by the applicant given to Dr Nielssen, that he was only offered $15,000 for his part in making the delivery. The applicant’s submissions asserted that there “… was no basis to reject that the reward was in that order”. This is misguided and must be rejected. The Crown did not attempt to prove what the applicant was paid. It submitted that having regard to the quantity of pure drugs involved (40.45 kg), the reward would be substantial. This was an entirely reasonable inference to urge on the Judge.
	
	
	In considering this submission, it should be noted that this Court has previously said that statements made by an offender by way of history to an expert, such as Dr Nielssen, which statements are not supported by the offender giving sworn evidence and subjecting themselves to cross-examination, are of very little, if any, weight: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353 at [58] per Smart AJ (Spigelman CJ agreeing).
	
	
	The practice of offenders relying on hearsay statements for findings of fact in their favour is not uncommon, notwithstanding this Court’s remarks. It is not to be encouraged.
	
	
	It was open to her Honour to reject the statement. The quantity of drugs which had a value in the millions, itself provided a basis for her Honour to reject that account, which in any event was of very little weight.
	
	
	Secondly, it was submitted that the sentencing Judge had failed to focus on what the applicant actually did in the principal offence. It was submitted that his criminality did not depend on whether others in the enterprise trusted him or gave him responsibility to do various things unsupervised. His criminality, it was submitted, did not turn on whether he was trusted to have access to the store of drugs. Shortly put, it was submitted that the only criminality the subject of the charge to which he pleaded guilty, was being a courier of the drugs for a relatively short period of time, and in a confined geographic region.
	
	
	That this is what he did cannot be gainsaid. But to concentrate only on these features would be to disregard what the factual context of the crime was.
	
	
	What was involved was the importation and the sale of large quantities of drugs by an organised and sophisticated syndicate. The applicant’s offence took place within this context. His was not a casual interaction with the syndicate. He was not simply a courier, who was without knowledge of the context. The agreed facts showed that he had a much greater interaction with the syndicate than a mere courier would have.
	
	
	As well, in sentencing the applicant for the principal offence, the sentencing Judge was required to take into account the schedule offence which involved another significant drug trafficking transaction in which the appellant played a significant role.
	
	
	Of course, he was not being sentenced separately for the schedule offence, it was merely being taken into account, or more generally for the activities of the syndicate. The sentencing Judge correctly, in my opinion, put the offence in its context, and sentenced the applicant according to principle by having regard to the seriousness of his objective criminality, to his subjective case, and to the schedule offence.
	
	
	I would not propose to uphold Ground 3.
	


Summary


	
	I am not persuaded that any of the grounds alleging specific errors have been made out. Nor have I been persuaded, and it was not submitted, that the sentence was one which was not lawfully open to the sentencing Judge.
	


Conclusion


	
	The applicant needs leave to appeal. The sentence is a lengthy one. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal ought be dismissed.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2766793,Wilson v R [2015] NSWCCA 128,"Judgment:


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The applicant was sentenced by Howie J on 4 April 2008 for the offence of murder, for which he was found guilty by a jury on 22 November 2007.


	
	The offence of murder contrary to s18(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life (s19A). It has a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment pursuant to Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Howie J imposed a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 years, commencing 19 May 2006 and expiring 18 May 2026, with a balance of term of 6 years and 6 months expiring 18 November 2032.
	
	
	There were two co-offenders, Owen Frazer and William Spencer, who were each convicted of manslaughter. They were sentenced by Howie J as follows:
	


Frazer – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7½ years, with a balance of term of 3½ years.

Spencer – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9½ years, with a balance of term of 3½ years.


	
	The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal from the sentence imposed by Howie J on the following ground of appeal:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120

Application for extension of time


	
	An application for extension of time for leave to appeal against sentence is determined by a consideration of what the interests of justice require in a particular case: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451. Relevant factors include the length of delay, the reasons for the delay and the prospects of success should an extension of time be granted.
	
	
	“Muldrock error” has been conceded by the Crown. This leaves as the relevant issue in the proceedings whether, taking into account the full range of factors including events which have occurred since the imposition of sentence, the Court in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion should find that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	The reasons for delay in this case are explained by the extensive affidavit material, which has been filed. There has been no fault on the part of the applicant which has contributed to the delay. Although the extent of the delay is substantial (in excess of four years) I would grant an extension of time, given the concession which has been made as to Muldrock error.
	


Factual background


	
	The deceased was a person engaged in trafficking in drugs. He had shortly before his death come into possession of a large amount of money as a result of an armed robbery committed by him. Spencer learned of this fact and determined to have the money stolen. For this purpose, he contacted the applicant and arranged to meet him outside the deceased’s townhouse in Toronto where Spencer had been staying. Spencer was to use his key to allow the applicant into the premises. Earlier in the evening on which the robbery had been planned, the deceased was acting in a threatening manner and was brandishing a firearm. He was apparently affected by drugs. Spencer told the applicant of this incident and warned him to be armed.
	
	
	On the evening of 10 January 2005, or in the early hours of the next morning, the applicant went to the home of an associate named Frazer and asked him to assist. Frazer agreed to go with the applicant to supply physical support in order to intimidate the deceased to hand over the money. The applicant asked his nephew, Sales, to drive him and Frazer to the deceased’s premises, telling him that they were going to obtain drugs from the deceased.
	
	
	Shortly before arriving at the town house, a meeting took place at Lake Munmorah. The applicant and Frazer were in a vehicle driven by Sales. Spencer was in another vehicle with his girlfriend. After a short discussion, they proceeded independently to the townhouse with the applicant in constant contact with Spencer by mobile phone. They met outside the premises at about 4am and Spencer let the applicant and Frazer inside. Spencer then left the immediate vicinity of the townhouse.
	
	
	The two men confronted the deceased, during which two shots were fired from the pistol with which the applicant was armed. One struck the deceased in the forehead. The evidence was that the deceased was sitting on the side of his bed before he was shot. He bore injuries which indicated that he had been pistol whipped and had defensive injuries to his arms.
	
	
	Immediately after the shooting, the applicant and Frazer left the premises and returned to the vehicle in which Sales was waiting. When they arrived there, the applicant apologised to Frazer for what had happened saying “I’m sorry Owen. I’ve fucked up. I’m so sorry”. He repeated this several times.
	
	
	During the investigation of the killing, police spoke to the applicant in a recorded interview. The applicant denied any involvement in the killing and gave a somewhat nonsensical account of his activity, intending the police to believe that he had been affected by drugs to such an extent that he had been in an hallucinatory state at the relevant time.
	
	
	During the trial, the applicant gave evidence, as did Spencer and Frazer. Their evidence was to the effect that Spencer had set up a drug deal between the deceased and the applicant and that was why they went to his home in the early hours of the morning. It was the applicant’s evidence that neither he nor Frazer had been armed when they entered the premises. The applicant said that the deceased had been paranoid and took offence at the presence of Frazer. He threatened the applicant with a weapon and a struggle ensued during which the firearm accidentally discharged.
	
	
	His Honour found that it was the applicant who shot the deceased and that he had assaulted the deceased with the pistol shortly before it was fired. His Honour found that the applicant intended to kill the deceased when he fired the pistol. His Honour concluded that the applicant lost his temper with the deceased and as a result, fired the pistol.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested in May 2006 and has been in custody since that date.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	His Honour set out the salient features of the offending as follows:
	


“12    This was an armed robbery that went wrong. The offender did not intend to kill the deceased when he went to the premises. However this was still a grave case of murder even though the killing was not planned. The activity leading up to the killing was seriously criminal, involving as it did a planned armed robbery of a person in his own home using a loaded firearm. I can only presume that the offender and Frazer were expecting to be paid for what they were to do. However they were hired to commit a robbery not a killing.”


	
	His Honour reviewed the applicant’s subjective case. The applicant was aged 32 at the time of sentence. He had a relatively minor criminal record, dating from 1992 including some assaults and weapons offences. He had spent short periods of time in prison serving sentences. The applicant had been a user of amphetamines for a period but had given that up eight years before he was sentenced. He was, however, selling the drug as a means of earning some income at the time of the shooting.
	
	
	Dr Westmore, the applicant and his elder brother gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. His Honour found the applicant’s brother to be an impressive witness, who appeared quite distressed when speaking of the conditions under which the applicant was brought up.
	
	
	The applicant was a person of Aboriginal descent. His Honour found that he lived in very deprived circumstances as a child and was subject to considerable violence inflicted upon him by his stepfather. Some of his siblings were taken into care but not the applicant. Thereafter, he took the full brunt of the violence in the home. The applicant completed his schooling until year 9 by correspondence. He then worked in the opal fields until leaving home at the age of 16. Since then he had worked in various manual positions.
	
	
	The applicant had been in a relationship for seven years, as a result of which he had four children. The relationship ended because the applicant’s partner was neglecting the children through drug use. His Honour concluded that there was little doubt that the applicant’s background had left him with personality problems, but that it was to his considerable credit that he was able to overcome his use of drugs and largely avoid serious conflict with the law, especially insofar as offences of violence were concerned. His Honour noted that the applicant had recognised that he had problems with anger and had undertaken two courses while in custody to address that issue. His Honour found that his tendency to anger was relevant in the shooting of the deceased.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence, supported by documents, that after the shooting of the deceased he made efforts to improve his situation in life. By his own efforts he became involved in a company called “Active Industry Training” and underwent a six week course to obtain qualifications that he hoped would assist him to obtain employment. He completed that course and another one in November 2005 and obtained proficiency certificates in carpentry and construction. In February 2006 he obtained employment with Borg Manufacturing as a factory hand. He remained in that employment until his arrest in May 2006.
	
	
	When sentenced, the applicant was working as a sweeper in the prison and had not been the subject of any disciplinary action. He expressed remorse for the killing and accepted that had he not been there, it would not have happened. He said that it had brought him to his senses about the life he was leading at the time. He said that he accepted the jury’s verdict, even though he did not acknowledge that it was correct in that he still maintained the version that the shooting was accidental.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, insofar as the use of firearms was concerned, but that much would depend upon his situation when he was eventually released from prison. His Honour thought that he had shown signs of maturity and would no doubt continue to do so over the period of his incarceration. Other than that, his Honour was not able to reach a firm view about his prospects of rehabilitation, given the period that he must serve before he could be released.
	
	
	His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offence at slightly higher than midrange. His Honour declined to make a finding of special circumstances.
	


Events which have occurred since the applicant was sentenced


	
	The applicant has been in custody for 9 years. During that time, there have been only two breaches of gaol discipline. The first occurred in July 2009 when the applicant was charged with having a tattoo gun because he was found with sewing needles in his cell. The applicant’s explanation was that he was using the needles and thread to repair his clothes.
	
	
	The second incident occurred on 16 August 2009 when the applicant accepted cannabis from a female who visited him in gaol. He was apprehended taking it from her. He was charged with possessing a prohibited drug and introducing a prohibited drug into prison and was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months and 9 months respectively, such sentences to be served concurrently. He also suffered a loss of privileges for 3 months.
	
	
	Since those incidents, there have been no breaches of gaol discipline recorded against the applicant. On the contrary, he has received high assessments for co-operation and leadership from Corrective Services. He has completed various traineeships which will assist him in obtaining employment when he is released. The applicant is on the Aboriginal Inmate Delegate Committee at the Lithgow detention facility. The applicant is currently working as head spray painter in the automotive repair section of the gaol. He is about to undertake a Certificate 111 in Automotive Body Repair.
	
	
	The applicant has completed the “Getting Smart” program while in custody and received favourable reports. Typical of those reports is the following which he received when half through that program:
	


“Inmate has now completed seven sessions of the Getting Smart program with six more sessions to completion; inmate’s participation has been proactive, inmate to time completes all set tasks and activities, grasping session content and concepts. Kirrlie is a supportive member of the Getting Smart group, speaks with honest thoughts and feelings and has a strong commitment to the program’s goals, aims and objectives.”


	
	While in prison the applicant has lost contact with his four children and other members of his family.
	


Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that he had a strong subjective case. He referred to the favourable assessment of him by the primary judge who (unlike this Court) had the advantage of seeing both him and his brother give evidence. The applicant noted that despite his deprived circumstances as a child, and the considerable violence which was inflicted upon him by this stepfather, he had with some qualifications been able to avoid serious offending until this incident.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his difficulties with controlling his temper were linked to issues arising from his deprived childhood and that this was relevant to his moral culpability for the offending (Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61 at [32] – [34]). He submitted that full weight should be given to his deprived background when considering his moral culpability. In that regard, the applicant relied upon Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [43] where the plurality (French CJ; Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ) said:
	


“43   … The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.”


	
	The applicant relied upon the following favourable findings made by the primary judge in relation to his subjective case:
	



	
	His criminal record prior to this offence was relatively minor.
	
	
	Despite the personality problems caused by his background, he was able to overcome his use of drugs and largely avoid conflict with the law.
	
	
	He had made efforts, after the offence and before his arrest, to improve his life by obtaining employment and completing a course.
	
	
	He had recognised problems with anger and undertaken two courses while in custody to address this.
	
	
	He had expressed remorse and accepted the jury’s verdict, even though he maintained the shooting was accidental.
	
	
	There was nothing to indicate that protection of the community was a current concern or would be in the future.
	



	
	The applicant relied upon the favourable reports which he had received while in prison and that he had worked hard to complete as many courses as were available to him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in a general sense, concepts of parity were also relevant to whether a lesser sentence was warranted in law. He submitted that although his co-offenders had been convicted of manslaughter, whereas he had been committed of murder, it was unfair that he had to serve twice as long in prison. He submitted that despite the practical difficulties associated with taking parity into account in such circumstances, it was clear that apart from the fact that he had done the actual shooting, the circumstances of his offending and those of his co-offenders were the same.
	
	
	He submitted that he should be re-sentenced and that a lesser sentence was warranted in law.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant had a strong subjective case when originally sentenced and that case has become stronger over the last 9 years. Despite the lapse in 2009, the total effect of the reports on the applicant while in prison have been overwhelmingly positive. Most impressively, both while he was at liberty and during his incarceration, the applicant has been successful in removing himself from the drug taking milieu. Moreover, the effects of his profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and need to be fully taken into account when considering the application of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	That having been said, there remain a number of negative considerations which cannot be ignored. The objective seriousness of the offence was substantial involving the shooting of the deceased at close range after he had been pistol whipped. Although the applicant has expressed remorse for the killing, he has not expressed remorse for the robbery and has not in terms admitted that the killing occurred in the way found by the primary judge.
	
	
	While the issue of personal deterrence may have reduced in significance with the passage of time, the principles of general deterrence and denunciation remain relevant and important. There remain two important guidelines, i.e. the maximum sentence of life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 20 years. Even allowing that there was no premeditation or planning in relation to the act of killing, it cannot be ignored that the applicant went to the deceased’s home, expecting a confrontation, armed with a lethal weapon, accompanied by another man with the intention of robbing him.
	
	
	Taking all those matters, both positive and negative into account, I have concluded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law and that the applicant should be re-sentenced accordingly.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	An extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by Howie J on 4 April 2008 is quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years to commence on 19 May 2006 and to expire on 18 May 2022, with balance of term of 5 years and 4 months to expire 18 September 2027.
	



	
	HALL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	GARLING: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2766795,DPP v Bignill [2015] NSWSC 668,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) appeals pursuant to s 56(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) against the order made by Pierce LCM on 5 September 2014 dismissing a charge against Thomas Bignill, the defendant, of drive with low range Prescribed Concentration Alcohol (second or subsequent offence) contrary to s 110(3)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) (the Act).
	
	
	The plaintiff, in a summons filed on 17 December 2014, relied on the following grounds of appeal, each of which was accepted to involve a question of law alone:
	


“1   holding that the defendant was entitled to rely on a deeming provision, namely cl 31(3) of sch 3 to the Road Transport Act 2013, in relation to evidence adduced by the defendant as to the alcohol concentration in the defendant’s blood;

2   taking into account the above erroneous finding in determining whether the defendant had discharged the onus prescribed under cl 31(3)(c) of sch 3 to the Road Transport Act 2013;

3   applying the wrong test in determining whether the defendant had discharged the onus prescribed under cl 31(3)(c) to the Road Transport Act 2013; in that the court below failed to consider whether the defendant had established, on the balance of probabilities, that the concentration of alcohol in the defendant’s breath or blood was less that 0.05 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood at the actual time of driving; and

4   failing to give adequate reasons for its determination.”

The Facts


	
	On Saturday 19 April 2014 at around 9am Senior Constable Luke Polak was conducting Random Breath Testing (RBT) on Clark Road, Neutral Bay. He stopped the defendant who was driving a Toyota Kluger with four passengers: an adult woman and three children. He asked the defendant whether he had had any alcohol that day, to which the defendant responded: “Last night I did.”
	
	
	Senior Constable Polak conducted a passive test which detected alcohol in the defendant’s breath. He then conducted a non-passive test which returned a positive sample of 0.063. The defendant was arrested and taken to the North Sydney Police Station where he underwent a breath analysis which was completed at 9.36.38am. The results of the analysis were 0.054g of alcohol in 210 litres of breath. Senior Constable Polak issued a certificate under Sch 3 of the Act and printed out a docket on which the test results appeared (the Police Result).
	
	
	Senior Constable Polak offered the defendant the opportunity of having his blood tested which the defendant accepted. Senior Constable Polak took him to Royal North Shore Hospital. At about 10.35am a registered nurse at the hospital took a sample of the defendant’s blood with an authorised kit. A test of the sample revealed a reading of 0.049g/100ml (the Hospital Result).
	
	
	There is no issue about the legality of the procedures that were followed by police.
	
	
	In the Court Attendance Notice the Police Prosecutor alleged that between 9.11am and 10.30am on 19 April 2014 at North Sydney the defendant drove a motor vehicle, a Toyota Kluger, on a road, Clark Road, North Sydney while there was present in his breath the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol, 0.054.
	


The relevant legislative provisions


	
	Section 110 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“Presence of prescribed concentration of alcohol in person’s breath or blood

. . .

(3) Offence—low range prescribed concentration of alcoholA person must not, while there is present in the person’s breath or blood the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol:

(a) drive a motor vehicle, or

. . .

Maximum penalty: . . . 20 penalty units (in the case of a second or subsequent offence).”


	
	Section 114 of the Act provides:
	


“Testing for alcohol and other drug use

Schedule 3 contains provisions relating to the procedures for, and the use of evidence obtained from, testing for alcohol or other drug use by drivers and other road users.”


	
	Schedule 3 of the Act makes provision for testing for alcohol. Clause 1 of Part 1 includes the following definitions:
	


“breath analysing instrument means any instrument of a type approved by the Governor by order published in the Gazette as being designed to ascertain, by analysis of a person’s breath, the concentration of alcohol present in that person’s breath or blood.

breath analysis means a test carried out by a breath analysing instrument for the purpose of ascertaining, by analysis of a person’s breath, the concentration of alcohol present in that person’s breath or blood.

breath test means a test for the purpose of indicating the concentration of alcohol present in a person’s breath or blood, carried out on that person’s breath by means of a device, not being a breath analysing instrument, of a type approved by the Governor by order published in the Gazette.”


	
	Part 2 of Sch 3 provides for powers to test and take samples. Division 2 of that Part provides for RBT and breath analysis. Clause 3 confers power on a police officer to conduct RBT if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that a person is or was driving a motor vehicle on a road. If the person fails the breath test, the police officer may arrest the person without warrant: cl 4, Sch 3. The officer may require a person to submit to a breath analysis, after which the officer must deliver a written statement signed by the officer specifying the alcohol concentration of the person’s breath: cl 5, Sch 3.
	
	
	Part 3 of Sch 3 makes provision for requests for additional analysis of samples. Cl 21 provides:
	


“Request for blood sample to be taken for analysis when person required to submit to breath analysis

(1) A person who is required by a police officer under Division 2 of Part 2 to submit to a breath analysis may request the police officer to arrange for an authorised sample taker to take, in the presence of a police officer, a sample of that person’s blood, for analysis in accordance with Part 4 to determine the concentration of alcohol in the blood at the person’s own expense.

Note. Part 4 provides for the procedures in relation to the taking and analysis of samples taken under this subclause.

(2) A request by a person under subclause (1), or the taking of a sample of that person’s blood, does not excuse that person from the obligation imposed on the person to submit to a breath analysis in accordance with Division 2 of Part 2.”


	
	Part 4 of Sch 3 sets out the procedures for taking and analysing samples. There is no suggestion that the correct procedures were not followed in the present case. Part 5 of Sch 3 makes provision for evidential matters. Cl 31 relevantly provides:
	


“Evidence of alcohol concentration in proceedings for offences against section 110

(1) This clause applies to any proceedings for an offence against section 110 (Presence of prescribed concentration of alcohol in person’s breath or blood).

(2) Evidence may be given in proceedings to which this clause applies of the concentration of alcohol present in the breath or blood of the person charged as determined by:

(a) a breath analysis carried out by a police officer authorised to do so by the Commissioner of Police, or

(b) an analysis of the person’s blood under this Schedule.

(3) In any such proceedings, the concentration of alcohol so determined is taken to be the concentration of alcohol in the person’s breath or blood at the time of the occurrence of the relevant event referred to in clause 3 (1) (a), (b) or (c) if the breath analysis was made, or blood sample taken, within 2 hours after the event unless the defendant proves that the concentration of alcohol in the defendant’s breath or blood at the time concerned was:

. . .

(c) in the case of an offence against section 110 (3)—less than 0.05 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood. . .”


	
	Clause 35 of Sch 3 provides that a certificate prepared in the relevant form and signed by an authorised officer is admissible and constitutes prima facie evidence of the particulars stated therein, including the concentration of alcohol determined by the breath analysis instrument.
	
	
	The provisions referred to above derive from substantially similar provisions in the statutory predecessors to the Act set out in the table below. Their equivalence is apparent from the legislation itself as well as the secondary materials, including the Explanatory Notes. Accordingly, authoritative judicial interpretation of earlier provisions remains binding with respect to later corresponding provisions.

The Local Court hearing


	
	The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The matter was heard in the Local Court at the Downing Centre on 5 September 2014. The police prosecutor tendered evidence the Sch 3 Certificate and the Police Result. The prosecutor relied on cl 31(3) and submitted that, by reason of the deeming provision, he had proved that the defendant’s alcohol concentration at the time he was driving was 0.054 and that, accordingly, the offence against s 110(3)(a) of the Act had been proved.
	
	
	The defendant tendered the Hospital Result and contended that he was entitled to avail himself of the deeming provision with respect to that result. Therefore, he submitted, his blood alcohol concentration was deemed to be 0.049 at the time of driving and he should be acquitted.
	
	
	The police prosecutor contended in response that cl 31(3) (the deeming provision) applied only to the Police Result and not to the Hospital Result. In support of this submission the prosecutor referred the Magistrate to R v Relton (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 28 July 1994, Meagher JA, Abadee and Blanch JJ). In order to understand the Magistrate’s reasons it is necessary to set out the facts in R v Relton and how it came to be decided.
	
	
	In R v Relton a single blood sample was taken from the appellant (Relton) within two hours of a collision. It was divided into two portions. The test carried out by the police showed a concentration of 0.078, as a result of which Relton was charged with an offence under s 4E(1E) of the Traffic Act 1909 (NSW), (now s 110(3)(a) of the Act). Relton had a test carried out on his portion of the sample which produced a result of 0.035. Both were admitted into evidence. The prosecutor relied on s 4G(8) (now cl 31). The trial judge held that Relton had not discharged the onus under s 4G(8) of the Traffic Act as he could not be satisfied that the concentration of alcohol in the appellant’s bloodstream at the time of the offence was probably less than 0.05 .
	
	
	On Relton’s application, the trial judge stated a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court answered “No” to each of the trial judge’s questions, which were:
	


(1)   Did I err in law where I held that the appellant bore the onus under Section 4G(8) of the Traffic Act 1909?

(2)   If the answer to (1) is no, then did I err in law in holding that the appellant had not discharged that onus?


	
	In upholding the trial judge’s approach, Blanch J (Meagher JA and Abadee J agreeing) described s 4G(8) as a provision “which deems the concentration of alcohol in the blood to be the concentration determined pursuant to the appropriate analysis where the sample was taken within two hours”. Blanch J referred to the judgment of Windeyer J in Commissioner for Railways v Bain [1965] HCA 5; 112 CLR 246 at 273 where his Honour explained that the word “deemed” is often used to direct how, notwithstanding the true facts, some situation should be understood. Blanch J said that once the prosecution had proved the conditions which triggered the operation of the deeming provision the onus was then “clearly cast . . .  upon the defendant to overcome the state of affairs which are then deemed to exist”.
	
	
	Although Relton called evidence which was inconsistent with the evidence of the prosecution’s blood analysis, Blanch J found that that evidence “left the judge in a position where he could not say he preferred the appellant’s evidence to the prosecution evidence”. Accordingly, Relton had failed to discharge the onus cast upon him.
	
	
	The Magistrate in the present case rejected the prosecutor’s submission that the deeming provision applied only to the Police Result and could not, on a proper reading of cl 31 and R v Relton, apply to the Hospital Result. After hearing argument, his Honour delivered the following oral ex tempore reasons:
	


“Particularly fastening on the middle paragraph on p 4 of Relton. We don’t have the advantage of knowing precisely what the finding of the District Court judge was, so we have to rely upon what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said it was, admittedly in a brief descriptive way. That paragraph beginning, ‘He held that,’ in the middle of p 4 seems to say this, that he, the District Court judge had held that the onus that rested upon the appellant had not been discharged as he, the judge, could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities, but it appears from the way that is worded that the trial judge simple [sic] had regard to no more than, emphasis on that phrase, no more than the fact that there were two conflicting samples.

One can understand in the circumstances why that would be, with respect to the trial judge, an erroneous way of looking at it, but in our present matter we have gone a little further and we have ventilated the fact that it is known to be a fact, though we don’t have evidence of the amount, that one’s alcohol content in one’s blood dissipates if one is on the down side, as it were, coming down from drinking. It goes up, of course, if you’ve had some alcohol not long before the test, but we don’t know the results. We don’t have any evidence of the rate of dissipation in the facts around … (not transcribable) … and having regard to the particular time, 1 o’clock I gather, but it doesn’t matter whatever the time was, when the last drink occurred and how much drinking had occurred before that, and how that time related to the time of driving.

So in our particular matter I think I am entitled to simply say that the defendant is entitled to rely upon a deeming provision, which is the blood deeming provision, result in the section, to rely upon that as discharging on the balance of probabilities. The other deeming provision that at the time of driving the alcohol was little over 0.05, he is entitled to do that and one has regard to the extreme closeness of the readings, they are very close. It would be different if you had starkly different readings that were a large number of decimal points apart.

IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THEREFORE, THE DEFENDANT IS, IN MY OPINION, ENTITLED TO HAVE REGARD TO THE LATTER READING AND THE CHARGE WILL BE DISMISSED.”


	
	The passage from Blanch J’s reasons in R v Relton to which the Magistrate referred in the opening passage in the reasons was as follows:
	


“He [the trial judge] held that being so the onus that rested on the appellant under section 4G(8) of the relevant Act had not been discharged as he could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities on the evidence before him that the concentration of alcohol in the appellant’s bloodstream was less than 0.05 grams per 100 millilitres of his blood.”

The appeal


	
	As the first three grounds concern the construction of the deeming provision they will be dealt with together. The fourth ground, alleged inadequacy of reasons, will be dealt with separately.
	


Construction of the deeming provision: grounds 1-3

The parties’ submissions


	
	The plaintiff contended that the Magistrate was in error in applying the deeming provision to the Hospital Result and argued that, on its true construction, it applied only to evidence adduced by the prosecution that had been obtained in accordance with Sch 3 of the Act. Ms Mitchelmore, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, submitted that the Magistrate’s construction of the deeming provision was at odds with the plain meaning of cl 31, that it failed to take into account the context of the deeming provision, tended to thwart the legislative purpose of Sch 3 and was inconsistent with R v Relton and R v West (1974) 3 PSR 1273. I do not propose to summarise the plaintiff’s submissions at length because they form the basis of the reasons for my decision, set out below, for preferring the construction of cl 31 for which the plaintiff contended.
	
	
	Mr Doherty SC, who appeared with Mr Morgan on behalf of the defendant, submitted that the Magistrate was correct in holding that the defendant was entitled to rely on the deeming provision and there was, accordingly, no error. He contended that the defendant’s right to have a blood sample taken and tested was an important safeguard and that there was no reason why the deeming provision should not apply to a sample obtained and relied on by the defendant as well as to a sample relied upon by the prosecutor. Mr Doherty further submitted that a blood test “trumps” a breath test.
	
	
	Mr Doherty referred to the Second Reading Speech of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1968, which introduced the RBT provisions into the Traffic Act, which was the statutory predecessor to the Act. Mr Doherty relied on the following passages from the Second Reading Speech in support of these propositions:
	


“In the course of our investigation into the system best suited to the conditions of New South Wales, we considered a system based on blood analysis, as is in operation in Britain. Certainly, the most straightforward chemical test for determining the blood-alcohol concentration of a person is the analysis of a specimen of blood. Blood analysis requires, however, the extraction of a sample of venous blood from the driver concerned by a specially trained person and its subsequent analysis by a person qualified in this field. Having regard to the inconvenience to the individual concerned, and the difficulty of obtaining suitably trained and qualified persons in our land of vast distances, we decided upon the breath test system.” (Page 3418, House of Assembly Hansard, 4 December 1968)

“This leads me to another important safeguard for the driver. We have provided that a driver who has been requested to submit to a Breathalyzer test may ask the arresting policeman to arrange that he has a blood sample taken for private analysis.” (page 3419, House of Assembly Hansard, 4 December 1968)


	
	Mr Doherty also relied on dicta in Police v Dunstall [2014] SASCFC 85; 120 SASR 88 in which the importance of the person’s right to have a blood sample taken as a safeguard was emphasised. At [75] Gray J cited King CJ in Ujvary v Medwell (1985) 39 SASR 418 who said at 420:
	


“. . . The blood test is the only means by which a citizen can question the correctness of the result of the breath analysis. It must be the paramount concern of the Courts to ensure that the citizen has ready access to that check.”


	
	An appeal against Police v Dunstall has been heard by the High Court but has not yet been determined. As the facts of that case and the applicable legislation are much removed from the question to be decided in the present case, I do not propose to address it further. In any event, Mr Doherty relied on it solely for the proposition, which I understand to be common ground, that the defendant’s right to have a blood sample taken is an important safeguard.
	


Reasons

The statutory provisions: their text, context, and purpose


	
	Statutory construction must begin with the text, in the context of the legislative history and extrinsic materials: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd [2012] HCA 55; 250 CLR 503 at [39]; Thiess v Collector of Customs [2014] HCA 12; 250 CLR 664 at [22]. A construction that promotes the purpose of the legislation is to be preferred: s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW); Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [70], [78].
	
	
	Schedule 3 of the Act is concerned with assisting police to carry out, and prosecute, drivers and other road users who are affected by alcohol and/or drugs. Although a distinction is drawn between a breath test on the one hand and a breath or blood analysis on the other, none is drawn between breath analysis and blood analysis. There is, accordingly, no basis in the statutory wording or otherwise for according greater weight to a blood analysis than to a breath analysis.
	
	
	Read as a whole and in context, cl 31, and the other clauses in Division 1 of Part 5 of Sch 3, are directed at proving the commission of an offence under s 110 of the Act. Any potential ambiguity in cl 31(2), as to the party by whom such “evidence” may be led, is, in my view, resolved by cl 31(3), which provides that the concentration determined by either of the methods identified in cl 31(2) is taken to be the concentration at the time of the occurrence of the relevant event “unless the defendant proves” that the concentration of alcohol in his or her breath or blood testing is within the legal limit “at the time concerned”. The words “at the time concerned” mean the time at which the offence was committed, namely the time at which the defendant was driving.
	
	
	Although the words in cl 31(2)(b) “an analysis of the person’s blood under this Schedule”, whether obtained by the prosecutor or the defendant, could, if viewed in isolation, come within the words in cl 31(3): “the concentration of alcohol so determined”, this construction is inconsistent with the later words in cl 31(3) “unless the defendant proves . . .”. A construction of cl 31 that permits the defendant to rely on the statutory deeming in the first part of cl 31(3) cannot be reconciled with the existence and terms of the express statutory exception in the latter part of the subclause.
	
	
	The defendant derives the benefit of the exception only by establishing that his or her alcohol concentration was within the legal limit “at the time concerned”, namely, at the time of those actions which form the basis of the s 110 charge (in the present case, when the defendant was driving). It cannot be the case that the defendant can also get the benefit of the first part of the clause, which operates to deem the alcohol concentration found through testing undertaken within 2 hours of the driving to be the concentration at the relevant time.
	
	
	Such a construction would also be inconsistent with the generally accepted operation of a deeming provision. On his Honour’s construction, a defendant not only does not have to overcome that state of affairs, but the defendant can also bring about that state of affairs if he or she can lead evidence of a test that meets the criteria in cl 31(2) and (3).
	
	
	In my view, his Honour’s construction not only does not advance the purpose for which the provision was enacted but positively undermines it. If his Honour’s construction of the deeming provision were correct, a defendant would not need to prove a lesser concentration at the time of driving provided he or she obtained a blood sample before the expiry of two hours from the conduct the basis of the charge which was below the prohibited prescribed concentration. In other words, all that the defendant would need to do would be to adduce evidence of a competing test taken within the two hour time period. I regard this construction as irrational and inconsistent with the purpose cl 31, which is designed to facilitate proof (by means of a subsequent test) of blood alcohol concentration at an earlier time, being the time at which the offence is alleged to have been committed.
	


Relevant authorities: R v Relton and R v West

R v Relton


	
	I accept Ms Mitchelmore’s submission that the Magistrate’s construction was inconsistent with R v Relton. In that case, the results of a competing test taken within the time period were not sufficient to discharge the onus, at least where that evidence was not sufficient to outweigh the evidence adduced by the Crown. As the tests of Relton’s sample produced a lower result (for reasons which were not apparent), Relton would have succeeded if the deeming provision had applied to that sample. Accordingly, R v Relton was relevantly indistinguishable from the present case. The construction of s 4E(11) in R v Relton (now cl 31) was binding on the Magistrate.
	
	
	The Magistrate’s reasons in the present case reveal a misreading of what R v Relton decided. His Honour considered that the trial judge (in R v Relton) was in error in concluding that Relton had not discharged the onus because he could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the concentration of alcohol in his bloodstream was less than 0.05. In fact, the trial judge’s approach, which led to his Honour finding that Relton had not discharged the onus, was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
	
	
	Moreover, the Magistrate in the present case sought to distinguish R v Relton on two bases: first, that in the present case there were two samples taken at different times, whereas in R v Relton there was only one sample, which was divided for the purpose of testing; and, secondly, that the readings of the samples were relatively similar in the present case, whereas in R v Relton the results were widely divergent. In my view, these matters neither affected the operation of the deeming provision, as established by R v Relton, nor provided any proper basis for distinguishing it.
	
	
	I infer from his Honour’s decision that he considered that the relative closeness of the readings assisted the defendant. This can only be on the basis that the closeness of the Police Result to the Hospital Result tended to support the reliability of each, given the times at which the underlying samples were taken. So much can be discerned from the following passage from the reasons:
	


“. . . one has regard to the extreme closeness of the readings. They are very close. It would be different if you had starkly different readings that were a large number of decimal points apart.”


	
	The “starkly different readings” envisaged by his Honour were, presumably, readings such as those in R v Relton, which were irreconcilable because they were far apart yet should have been identical as the portions tested derived from the same sample.
	
	
	His Honour’s misreading of R v Relton was significant. His Honour concluded that the defendant could rely on the deeming provision and the later blood test “as discharging on the balance of probabilities”, presumably, the onus in the latter part of cl 31(3). That conclusion was contrary to the terms of the subclause and to the construction approved in R v Relton.
	


R v West


	
	The plaintiff also relied on R v West, a case stated which also concerned the effect of s 4E(11) of the Traffic Act (the statutory predecessor to cl 31). Street A-CJ (sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal with Isaacs and Lee JJ) said at 1274:
	


“The sub-section [s4E(11)] cast in a context in which the concentration of alcohol at the time of the test would be expected to differ from the concentration of alcohol at the time of the offence, the difference flowing, if from nothing else, merely from the passage of time which would necessarily have elapsed between the offence and the time of the test.

In order to avoid what would otherwise be the virtual impossibility of demonstrating the concentration of alcohol at the time of the offence, sub.s11 deliberately and expressly deems the result of the test on the breath analysing instrument to disclose what was the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the person at the time of the occurrence of the offence.”


	
	The opportunity that the section provided for the defendant to prove that there was a lower concentration of alcohol in his blood did not, on Street A-CJ’s analysis, cut down the ordinary significance to be attributed to the statutory deeming earlier in the section. Street A-CJ said:
	


“The early part of the section [the deeming provision] is absolute and clear in its operation. The concluding part of the section prescribes the circumstances in which the earlier part can be made the subject of an inroad, namely the circumstance in which the defendant proves the concentration of alcohol in his blood was less than that stated.”


	
	The interpretation of the deeming provision in R v West is consistent with the way it was later construed in R v Relton. The Magistrate was not referred to R v West. However, what the Court of Criminal Appeal found in R v West is also contained in R v Relton, to which his Honour was referred.
	


Conclusion


	
	I am persuaded that the Magistrate’s construction of cl 31 was at odds with the wording of the provision, the context in which it appears in the Act and its evident purpose. It was contrary to R v Relton and to the approach taken by the Court in R v West. The first three grounds have been made out.
	


Alleged inadequacy of reasons


	
	The principles that apply to the assessment of reasons of judicial officers, including Magistrates, are well known. The relevant authorities were recently summarised by Bellew J in DPP v Sadler [2013] NSWSC 718 at [77]-[82]. There is an obligation to give reasons, but allowance is made for the circumstances in which they are given. Accordingly, more latitude is given to reasons where, as here, they were given ex tempore, particularly in busy Local and District Courts.
	
	
	Because the first three grounds have been made out, the matter must be remitted to the Local Court for determination. Accordingly the fourth ground, which was effectively an alternative ground, can be addressed briefly.
	
	
	I do not consider the Magistrate’s reasons to be adequate. All that is clear from them is that his Honour considered that the deeming provision applied to both the Hospital Result and the Police Result. It is not clear why. Nor is it clear how his Honour read R v Relton as supporting either that construction or, indeed, the defendant’s case, or on what basis the factors his Honour identified as distinguishing the present case from R v Relton affected the construction of the deeming provision. The fourth ground has been made out.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff has succeeded. My preliminary view is that the defendant ought pay the plaintiff’s costs but, as I have not heard the parties on costs, I shall make provision in the orders for any other application to be made in writing.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Set aside the order of Magistrate Pierce, made on 5 September 2014 at Downing Centre Local Court, dismissing the charge against the defendant of drive with low range PCA (second or subsequent offence) contrary to s 110(3)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013.
	
	
	Remit the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.
	
	
	Unless either party makes a written application to my Associate within seven days for a different order, order the defendant to pay the costs of the proceedings.

		01 June 2015",2015-05-31 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766798,Haidari v R [2015] NSWCCA 126,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Ali Haidari, seeks an extension of time to appeal against his conviction on 17 April 2013 for an offence of riot under s.93B Crimes Act 1900, following a trial before RA Hulme J and a jury in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
	
	
	The Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of one year and two months commencing on 28 April 2013 and expiring on 27 June 2014, with a balance of term of eight months commencing on 28 June 2014 and expiring on 27 February 2015.
	
	
	The total term of the sentence expired on 27 February 2015. There is no appeal against sentence.
	


Application for Extension of Time


	
	The Appellant relies upon the affidavit dated 4 November 2014 of his solicitor, Edwina Lloyd, in support of the application for an extension of time. The affidavit discloses circumstances in 2014 which were beyond the control of the Appellant himself.
	
	
	The Crown did not oppose the extension of time which, in the circumstances, should be granted.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Appellant communicated the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the admission of the evidence of Officer Kiner identifying the Appellant, from aspects of footage of events within the Villawood Detention Centre, has given rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Ground 2 - The trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury in respect of the elements of riot - this ground was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal in light of the decision of this Court in Parhizkar v R [2014] NSWCCA 240.
	
	
	Ground 3 - the verdict is unreasonable.
	



	
	As no objection was taken at trial to the matter now complained of in Ground 1, the Appellant requires leave under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground.
	


Factual Background


	
	The Appellant stood trial with a number of other persons for alleged offences of riot and affray said to have been committed at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (“Detention Centre”) on 20 April 2011. Four persons were convicted of riot and one of affray.
	
	
	The factual background to the present appeal may be gleaned sufficiently from the remarks on sentence of RA Hulme J: R v Ali; R V Amiri; R v Feili; R v Haidari; R v Parhizkar [2013] NSWSC 871 at [5]-[6]:
	


“5   To put into context the actions of each offender which led the jury to find them guilty of the offences I have just indicated, it is necessary to set out in some detail what occurred at Villawood on 20 April 2011. For this purpose I will adopt what I said in sentencing Mr Chenarjaafarizad (with appropriate modifications where necessary):

‘[4]    [Villawood] is an approved place under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) for the detention of persons not authorised to enter or remain in Australia. Staffing at [Villawood] was contracted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship ('DIAC') to a company known as Serco. 

[5]    There are three compounds within [Villawood]; [each of the offenders were] housed in the Fowler Compound. There were four residential buildings within Fowler, named the Macquarie Building, the Nepean Building, the Clarence Building and the Darling Building. There were sundry other buildings, such as an office, mess, recreation room, gym and a laundry. There were 158 detainees within Fowler on 20 April 2011.’

6   The Crown case was that on 20 April 2011 a large number of detainees within the Fowler Compound set about a course of protesting the nature and circumstances of their detention and did so with the use of violence. 

‘[8]    Two detainees, Mehdi Darabi and Amir Morad Mansoor, were seen on the roof of the Macquarie Building early in the morning of 20 April 2011. Thereafter they were seen to engage in various activities which included abusing Serco staff and throwing roof tiles. 

[9]    In the early afternoon the activities officer tried to commence a game of soccer but Darabi and Mansoor told him not to because they were ‘making a point by being on the roof’. More tiles were thrown. A detainee on the ground, Mahmood Dadash, approached the activities officer and remonstrated with him in an attempt to have him desist from starting the soccer game. Another detainee, Ali Abdollahi, approached in the company of a large number of other detainees and threw punches at the activities officer but fortunately they did not connect. 

[10]    Around the middle of the afternoon a staff member who was taking refreshments to staff near the Macquarie Building was abused, told to ‘fuck off’ and had a tile thrown at him. Mansoor called out, ‘we're up here for a reason, don't drink in front of us, we are up here for a reason. How dare you eat or drink in front of us. If you drink or eat in front of us, we're going to throw tiles at you’. Staff who had formed a cordon around the Macquarie Building to prevent other detainees getting onto the roof were ordered to move back.

[11]    Detainees on the ground threw bedding and water bottles up to the roof. This activity continued and at about 6.00pm Mansoor called out to staff, ‘Don't stop them otherwise you'll get a tile thrown at your head’. 

[12]    More detainees attempted to join Darabi and Mansoor on the roof after 7.00pm. There was a large group on the ground, estimated to be between 40 and 60, aggressively yelling at Serco staff and management. There was a rush towards the Macquarie Building and more detainees made their way to the roof. 

[13]    At about 7.30pm, detainees were yelling, ‘we want freedom’. This continued for some time. Some of the detainees on the roof made ropes out of bed sheets to assist others to climb up.

[14] At about 8.00pm, there was encouragement to those on the ground to continue the disturbance and come up to the roof. Tiles were thrown at staff who were trying to prevent them. One tile landed no more than a metre from one staff member who, naturally enough, had concerns for the safety of her staff and the other detainees.

[15]    One officer estimated that at about 8.20pm there were 80-90 detainees around the Macquarie Building. Thereafter the situation deteriorated with more shouting, yelling and abuse, tile throwing and other threatening behaviour towards staff.

[16]    There was a bank of payphone booths near to the Macquarie Building. At about 10.00pm, [Saied Chenarjaafarizad] was seen to be banging on the Perspex side of one of the booths. ...

...

[18]    There was an altercation between [Chenarjaafarizad] and a male member of staff. [He] repeated the demands that were being made by one of the detainees on the roof, Majid Parhizkar, for cigarettes and food. He twice grabbed the staff member and then walked away; raising his arms and saying ‘fuck you, fuck you’. 

[19]    Detainees ... started to run around the compound discharging fire extinguishers. ... [I]t is not suggested that any member of staff was affected by any of the spray or hit by [a] fire extinguisher.

[20]    Detainees dragged wheelie bins onto the soccer field where the rubbish was tipped out and then set alight. ...

[21]    Timber tables and chairs were taken onto the field and put on the fire. ...

[22]    A number of detainees ... dismantled a set of soccer goal posts. ... One of those involved threw parts at Serco staff. ...

[23]    These various events ... contributed significantly to the utter mayhem that was going on in the compound at around 11.00pm. Staff were confronted with detainees on the roof throwing tiles at them and at buildings; a roaring bonfire on the soccer field; detainees running around discharging fire extinguishers and throwing them and other objects at staff. They were forced to retreat behind a wall of the office so as not to be struck by tiles. 

[24]    Eventually a group of around 20 or 30 detainees turned their attention to the staff and advanced towards them. The most senior officer described them as advancing ‘quickly and purposefully’. One of them was holding a fire extinguisher above his head. When they got near, this man looked like he was going to throw the fire extinguisher at the staff but he hesitated and threw it at a window in the office. Another detainee then came from the bonfire with a burning piece of wood and leaned in through the broken window and set fire to the office. At this point the staff fled the compound. 

[25]    Fires were set in a number of other buildings thereafter. The total amount of damage caused in the Fowler Compound and in other areas within Villawood was extreme; the estimated cost of reconstruction and repair is said to be in the order of $9 million. ...’”


	
	In relation to the Appellant, his Honour made particular findings of fact at [21]:
	


“Mr Haidari was seen on the roof of the Macquarie Building at around 7.30pm. He was involved in lifting up tiles and passing them to another detainee (Parhizkar) who threw them. He also threw some tiles himself.”

Issues in the Trial of the Appellant


	
	The trial Judge directed the jury that the elements of the crime of riot under s.93B Crimes Act 1900 were as follows (MFI36; AB342-343):
	



	
	there were 12 or more persons who were present together;
	
	
	those 12 or more persons used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose;
	
	
	the conduct of these 12 or more persons, taken together, were such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety;
	
	
	the accused was one of the 12 or more persons;
	
	
	the accused used unlawful violence for the common purpose; and
	
	
	the accused intended to use violence or was aware that his conduct may be violent.
	



	
	His Honour directed the jury that “violence” meant any violent conduct, and included violent conduct towards property as well as towards persons. It was not restricted to conduct that causes, or is intended to cause, injury or damage. It includes any other violent conduct, such as throwing something at someone that is capable of causing injury, whether or not it does.
	
	
	In his closing address to the jury, counsel for the Appellant made clear that the issue in the trial was whether the Crown had established elements (d), (e) and (f), namely that the Appellant was on the roof of the Macquarie Building using unlawful violence by throwing tiles (AB152).
	


The Role of Officer Kiner’s Evidence at the Appellant’s Trial


	
	Before moving to the first ground of appeal, it is appropriate to place in context the evidence of Officer Kiner at the trial of the Appellant.
	
	
	Officer Nathan Kiner was a client service officer employed by Serco at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre.
	


Pretrial Hearing


	
	Prior to the jury being empanelled, a wide-ranging voir dire (by way of a Basha Inquiry) was held. Officer Kiner was called to give evidence on the voir dire on 31 January 2013 (AB8-30). Three statements of Officer Kiner dated 23 April 2011, 6 June 2011 and 31 October 2012 (AB324-341) were tendered on the voir dire (AB8). These statements, amongst other things, related to his recognition of the Appellant on the night of 20 April 2011 and in the ABC footage taken of the events, to which further reference will be made.
	
	
	Although they were not in evidence before the jury, it is appropriate to refer to the statements of Officer Kiner, in particular for the purpose of considering whether leave should be granted under Rule 4 to allow the Appellant to rely upon Ground 1.
	
	
	The body of Officer Kiner’s statement of 23 April 2011 made no express reference to the Appellant. He stated that, between about 7.45 pm - 9.00 pm, he was walking around the Macquarie Building together with Officers O’Connor, Atchaparian and Papa. About this time, Officer Kiner “observed about 11-13 clients climb onto the roof of the Macquarie building” (paragraph 13). He said that, at about 9.30 pm “the clients on the roof of the Macquarie began to rip the tiles off and throw them at O’Connor, Atchaparian, Papa and [himself]” (paragraph 14). He said “I recognised the person throwing the tiles and know him to be Majid PARHIZKAR” (paragraph 14).
	
	
	Officer Kiner described later in that statement the preparation of notes in the early hours of 21 April 2011 (paragraph 34; AB329):
	


“Sometime between 2:00am and 8:00am, O’CONNOR, ATCHAPARIAN and I sat together and compiled a document of contemporaneous notes in relation to our observations. I have signed a copy of these notes and now attach it to this statement as Annexure B.

ANNEXURE B: 4 PAGES OF CONTEMPORANEOUS NOTES, SIGNED BY O’CONNOR, ATCHAPARAIN AND I.”


	
	The notes signed by Officer Kiner and others listed “Fowler clients” who were “observed on the roof of Macquarie”. The Appellant was included with a notation “roof top protest”. There was no mention of him throwing tiles, although entries of that type were recorded for some of the other listed persons (AB332-333).
	
	
	Officer Kiner’s statement of 6 June 2011 expanded on his earlier statement. He said at paragraph 7 (AB337):
	


“In paragraphs 14 and 15 of my statement dated 23 April 2011, I stated that about 9.30pm the clients on the roof of the Macquarie Building began to rip tiles off the roof and throw them at us. I also stated a person I saw throwing the roof tiles was Majid PARHIZKAR. At that time I also saw a person I know as Haidari ALI handing tiles to PARHIZKAR, which were then thrown towards myself and others, as well as a group of telephone booths located near to where I was standing at the time with other Serco staff. At this time I believe there were still between 11 and 13 persons on the roof of the Macquarie Building. Persons on the roof of the Macquarie Building at this time who were involved in removing and throwing roof tiles were being encouraged by the group on the ground beside the Macquarie Building.”


	
	Officer Kiner made a further statement on 31 October 2012. He stated that he had viewed on 10 October 2012 a DVD containing ABC footage of the events. Whilst doing so, he said that he recognised a number of persons, including the Appellant (paragraphs 6-7; AB339-340). His observations included the Appellant removing tiles and throwing tiles off the roof (AB340). He described his interaction with detainees in the course of his duties, stating “I have a strong familiarity with the clients as part of my regular duties and am able to recognise them by name” (paragraph 8; AB341).
	
	
	Although cross-examined by counsel for other accused persons, Officer Kiner was not cross-examined on the voir dire by experienced counsel appearing for the present Appellant. Nor was any objection taken or foreshadowed to any part of Officer Kiner’s evidence concerning his identification of the Appellant as a person throwing tiles from the roof of the Macquarie Building.
	


The Trial


	
	Officer Kiner was called by the Crown, and gave evidence in the presence of the jury between 26 February 2013 and 1 March 2013 (AB31-118). No objection was taken to Officer Kiner giving evidence that he recognised the Appellant, that he saw him on the roof of the Macquarie Building removing tiles and passing them to the co-accused, Majid Parhizkar (“Parhizkar”), nor to his evidence that he recognised the Appellant as one of the people recorded in the ABC footage. Cross-examination of Officer Kiner by counsel for the Appellant was directed to whether he was mistaken about his recognition of the Appellant.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the Appellant went onto the roof of the Macquarie Building at about 7.30 pm on 20 April 2011. Based upon the evidence of Officer Kiner, the Crown said that the lifting of tiles by the Appellant, and the throwing of tiles by others, was observed by Officer Kiner to occur some time after 9.30 pm (AB45, 47). Based upon the evidence of the ABC footage (Exhibit C) and Officer Kiner’s evidence based on that footage, the Crown contended that the lifting and throwing of tiles by the Appellant occurred some time after 10.15 pm.
	
	
	Further reference will be made to this evidence when considering the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The evidence at the trial also included video footage taken on a mobile phone from within the Fowler Compound. It was the Crown case that the mobile phone images (Exhibit J) and the ABC footage (Exhibit C) graphically portrayed several acts of violence engaged in by some of the detainees, including the Appellant, both before and after fires were lit in the Fowler Compound.
	
	
	The Appellant did not give evidence at the trial. Character evidence was adduced from Ellice Grien to the effect that the Appellant was a quiet, peaceful, polite person.
	
	
	It was the Appellant’s case that insofar as Officer Kiner nominated the Appellant’s name, his evidence did not reliably identify the Appellant. It was said that Officer Kiner did not otherwise purport to, nor did he, identify the Appellant from photographs or by description.
	


Ground 1 - Challenge to the Admission of the Evidence of Officer Kiner

Submissions of the Appellant


	
	Ms Francis, counsel for the Appellant, acknowledged that no objection had been taken by trial defence counsel to evidence from Officer Kiner that the Appellant was observed by him on the roof and was depicted in the footage. Counsel acknowledged that leave under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules was required to rely upon the first ground of appeal. It was accepted that it was necessary to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, before leave under Rule 4 would be granted.
	
	
	Ms Francis submitted that the evidence of Officer Kiner now challenged under Ground 1, if relevant, was opinion evidence. Counsel submitted that the position here was similar to that in R v Drollett [2005] NSWCCA 356, where an appeal against conviction was upheld in circumstances where the trial Judge allowed a witness to a gaol assault (a Mr Stephens) to identify the Appellant from CCTV footage of the incident, where the footage did not represent what the witness himself observed of the incident. Simpson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing) said at [54]-[57]:
	


“54    It is not at all uncommon for a witness to give evidence that a photograph or video depicts a particular place or scene as the witness observed it at some relevant time. Such evidence may include evidence that the film depicts an incident or even the subject of the litigation. Ordinarily, that evidence will be admitted as factual evidence, and its relevance will be apparent.

55    It is not difficult to envisage that a witness giving evidence of that kind may also be permitted to identify objects or persons depicted in such a scene which would not be readily (or at all) identifiable to the jury. One example is where the person depicted is photographed from the rear or partly obscured. A witness will be permitted to give evidence of that person’s identity. But this is evidence of fact. It is evidence of fact given from the witness’ recollection. The original or primary evidence, is, in reality, the description of the events given by the witness. The photographic material merely illustrates the oral testimony that the witness would be able to give describing the event in question.

56    It seems to me that his Honour mistook Mr Stephens’ evidence as being evidence in that category. I have already extracted some of the exchanges with counsel in which he seems to have taken the view that Mr Stephens was giving evidence, from the film footage, of what he had independently observed. That is simply not the case. Mr Stephens was not giving evidence that the footage represented what he had observed and which therefore illustrated his account of the event. The footage represented an event which he had not personally observed, except for a very small portion. When he purported to identify the appellant on the footage, he was not doing so by reference to something he had observed or of which he could give oral evidence that was illustrated by the film. Here the primary evidence was the film footage. Mr Stephens’ evidence was no more than an educated interpretation of what was depicted in the footage.

57    It was, therefore, opinion evidence.”


	
	Ms Francis submitted that Officer Kiner did not assert that the footage depicted the scene to which he had been an eye witness, nor did he assert that he had observed the person who he stated was the Appellant behaving in the manner depicted in the footage. Counsel submitted that the evidence was not admissible, relying upon the reasoning of Simpson J in R v Drollett at [59]-[66].
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	Mr Farmer SC, for the Crown, in emphasising that leave under Rule 4 was required to argue this ground, submitted that the Appellant only sought to challenge Officer Kiner at trial on the basis that he was mistaken about his evidence, not that he did not have the capacity to identify the Appellant.
	
	
	Further, despite being on notice about his evidence concerning who was recorded on the ABC footage engaging in acts of violence, no objection was taken by the Appellant to this evidence being given at trial. Specifically, the evidence was not challenged on the basis that it was opinion evidence and, for that reason, inadmissible.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Officer Kiner had given evidence about his work at the Fowler Compound, being work which he had undertaken for a period in excess of four years. The Crown pointed to the evidence of Officer Kiner in which he referred to the Appellant directly or by reference to the footage.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence of Officer Kiner was factual evidence relevant to the case against the Appellant of the type described by Simpson J in R v Drollett at [54].
	
	
	The Crown took issue with the Appellant’s submission that the evidence of Officer Kiner was opinion evidence for the purpose of s.76 Evidence Act 1995. If it was opinion evidence, the Crown submitted that it was evidence deriving from Officer Kiner’s knowledge of the Appellant based upon his experience and that it was relevant and admissible: s.79(1) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Appellant’s submission was based largely on assertions that Officer Kiner was not in a position to witness the events depicted in the footage, and that he did not give an account of his prior relationship or familiarity with the Appellant. Contrary to this, the Crown submitted that the evidence of Officer Kiner about what he observed on the ABC footage was evidence of facts observed by him. Further, it was submitted that the footage depicted a particular scene which Officer Kiner observed at the time. The fact that it was taken from the other side of the building, it was submitted, did not alter this characterisation of the evidence.
	
	
	It was submitted that leave to rely upon the first ground of appeal should be refused.
	


Determination


	
	The issue raised in the first ground of appeal is taken for the first time on appeal before this Court. Experienced trial counsel appearing for the Appellant did not object to the evidence of Officer Kiner on the basis contended for before this Court. No evidence was placed before this Court concerning this topic. Ms Francis submits that the fact that no objection was taken by counsel for the Appellant at trial was not a consequence of any tactical decision on counsel’s behalf.
	
	
	It is now contended that the challenged evidence was “not admissible” as it constituted opinion evidence for the purpose of s.76(1) Evidence Act 1995. The words “not admissible” in the Evidence Act 1995 ordinarily mean “not admissible over objection”: Seltsam Pty Limited v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262 at 287 [149]; Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232 at 244 [26]; WC v R [2015] NSWCCA 52 at [20]. The words “not admissible” may be contrasted with the words “is not to be adduced” (in, for example, ss.118 and 119) and similar directory words in other provisions: Gonzales v R at 243-244 [24]; WC v R at [20].
	
	
	In Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1 at 9 [20], Gleeson CJ and Hayne J observed:
	


“The Evidence Act applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties, and their counsel, who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection.”

Emphasis was given to this statement in R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 at 651-652 [23]-[28].


	
	From time to time, an affidavit of trial counsel is read on appeal where a ground of appeal requires leave under Rule 4. The utility of affidavits of this type has been questioned: R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427; 125 A Crim R 505 at [56]-[62]; Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at 519-521 [131]. Nevertheless, it has been a not uncommon practice in this Court where Rule 4 arises, notwithstanding what was said in R v Moussa: R v FDP at 648 [14]. No affidavit was relied upon in this appeal. Although the Appellant is represented by different counsel on appeal, the same firm of solicitors appeared for the Appellant at trial and on appeal (AB1).
	
	
	In the absence of any evidence, an inference may be available that trial counsel did not take the point now sought to be raised given the limited prospect that it would succeed, and the likely consequence that there would be a more detailed body of evidence emanating from Officer Kiner before the jury concerning his knowledge of the Appellant and his observations of events said to have involved the Appellant inside the Detention Centre on the night of 20 April 2011. An examination of the trial transcript rather suggests that the Appellant’s trial counsel, in the context of a trial with multiple accused, did nothing which may have served to expand the evidence which referred to his client. Submissions were then made to the jury that the evidence was insufficient to establish to the criminal standard that the Appellant was on the roof of the Macquarie Building throwing tiles.
	
	
	Leave required by Rule 4 will not be granted lightly: R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97; 145 A Crim R 304 at 313 [52]. It has been observed that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912  does not exist to enable an accused person who has been convicted on the basis of one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which the person could or should have raised at the first trial: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536. The observations cited (at [43] above) from Dhanhoa v The Queen underpin this statement from R v Abusafiah.
	
	
	The critical issue for the Appellant to establish is that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that he has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [21]. Another formulation of the test is that “leave will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirement of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings”: R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 193 at 195; FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [73]; WC v R at [9].
	
	
	The Appellant contends in Ground 1 that the admission of the evidence of Officer Kiner identifying the Appellant from aspects of footage of events within the Detention Centre has given rise to a miscarriage of justice. It is contended that this was opinion evidence which was not admissible because of s.76(1) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Although the orders of this Court in R v Smith [1999] NSWCCA 317; 47 NSWLR 419 were set aside on appeal in Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650, parts of the judgment of Sheller JA (Grove and Hidden JJ agreeing) have been cited and applied in later judgments.
	
	
	Sheller JA observed, at 423 [19], that if a distinction must be made between fact and opinion, “it can only be one of degree, calling for a decision as to whether, on a continuum which is unmarked and for which there is no exact measure, particular testimony has passed the point where it has become evidence of an opinion”.
	
	
	In Smith v The Queen, Kirby J (the only Judge to decide the opinion issue) observed at 667 [52] that the distinction between fact and opinion “is one of degree rather than of kind”. At 667 [54], Kirby J agreed that “a wide latitude should be accorded to the trial judge as to the applicable classification, given the blurred boundary between fact and opinion”.
	
	
	Later cases have emphasised these observations of Sheller JA and Kirby J concerning the imprecise distinction between fact and opinion: R v Marsh [2005] NSWCCA 331 at [29], [31]; R v Drollett at [53].
	
	
	As Simpson J observed in R v Drollett at [64], it will always be necessary to consider the circumstances of the case in question.
	
	
	The present case may be compared with a number of other cases where issues of this type have arisen:
	



	
	in Smith v The Queen, the police officers who purported to identify the accused person were not witnesses to the events portrayed in the photographs;
	
	
	in R v Marsh, the accused person’s sister did not witness the alleged offence, but her evidence of identification of her brother was admitted after application of the law stated in Smith v The Queen;
	
	
	in R v Beattie [2001] NSWCCA 502; 127 A Crim R 250, evidence of prison officers of photographic identification of the accused person, in circumstances where they had not observed the events in question, was held to have been wrongly admitted applying Smith v The Queen;
	
	
	in Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 363; 180 A Crim R 267 at 272-277 [9]-[40], this Court (referring to Smith v The Queen, R v Beattie, R v Marsh and R v Drollett) upheld decisions of a trial Judge allowing police officers (who were not present at the scene of the events) to identify accused persons from CCTV footage taken at the time of the events.
	



	
	The Appellant’s submissions in the present appeal focused upon the decision in R v Drollett. It should be noted that, unlike this case, objection was taken to the challenged evidence at first instance in R v Drollett. In that case (and importantly), the prison officer, Mr Stephens, did not claim to have observed any part of the attack giving rise to the charge (at [18]). His observations were limited to what happened immediately after its conclusion. Mr Stephens was shown the “extremely indistinct” footage of the incident, which was “not continuous video footage, but a series of still photographs taken at one second intervals”. When shown on a video player, they produced “a staccato-like, jerky image” (at [6]). He purported to identify Mr Drollett on that footage. On the basis of the whole of the evidence given by Mr Stephens, Simpson J concluded (at [60]) “that his identification of the appellant was made, not by recognition or familiarity with the appearance of the appellant, buy rather by a process of deduction”.
	
	
	The circumstances in R v Drollett are significantly different from the present case.
	
	
	The hurdle posed by Rule 4 lies in the path of the Appellant. It is necessary for him to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has resulted.
	
	
	For the purpose of considering this ground of appeal, and the unreasonable verdict ground (Ground 3), I have considered the evidence given by Officer Kiner, together with the mobile phone and ABC footage (Exhibits C and J). The relevant parts of Exhibits C and J were played in open court during the hearing of the appeal, and I have viewed Exhibits C and J again in Chambers since judgment was reserved by the Court.
	
	
	A summary of the evidence of Officer Kiner before the jury, particularly in relation to the Appellant, was set out in the Crown submissions. That summary, which is accurate, states:
	



	
	he had worked at Villawood Immigration Detention Centre for about 13 years and in the Fowler Compound for about four years (AB31);
	
	
	he worked 12-hour shifts (AB31);
	
	
	on 20 April 2011, he arrived at the Detention Centre at about 7.30 pm and shortly after that he arrived at the Fowler Compound (AB32);
	
	
	at the time he arrived at the Fowler Compound, there were about four people on the roof (AB33);
	
	
	later that evening, he saw other men making their way on to the roof and he saw approximately 11 to 13 on the roof (AB43);
	
	
	he recognised (that is, knew to identify) some of these men, including the Appellant (AB44);
	
	
	at about 9.30 pm, he saw the co-accused, Parhizkar, throwing tiles towards the officers and the Serco office (AB45);
	
	
	he recalled that the Appellant was wearing dark tracksuit-type clothing, a bluish-type coloured top and bottom (AB47);
	
	
	he saw the Appellant remove tiles and pass them to the co-accused, Parhizkar (AB47);
	
	
	he confirmed that in October 2012, he had looked at the ABC footage and provided a statement setting out what he had observed on the footage (AB53-54);
	
	
	he watched the video whilst in court and stated that he had observed “Mr Haidari, Ali”, wearing a blue top, blue pants throwing tiles from the roof (AB57);
	
	
	he was shown Exhibit E (AB319), a still image taken from the ABC footage and he stated “The man with the blue top and blue pants and with a tile over his head” he “believed to be Mr Haidari, Ali” (AB58);
	
	
	he stated “So just there, the man in the blue top and appears to be - black, sorry, head-hat, whatever, on his head, I believe that to be Mr Haidari, Ali” (AB59);
	
	
	Officer Kiner was asked (AB59):
	


“Q: And the man in the all-blue tracksuit seen at [counter] 9.54 throwing things, you can’t identify him?

A: Is that the man in the middle?

Q: Yes, with his back to us?

A: I believe that is Haidari, Ali.”


	
	he distinguished the Appellant, Ali Haidari, from the accused, Haider Hussein Ali (AB60).
	



	
	During cross-examination by counsel for the Appellant, Officer Kiner gave the following evidence (again from the Crown submissions):
	



	
	he agreed that it was approximately 9.30 pm - 10.00 pm when he saw the 11-13 people on the roof (AB76);
	
	
	he did not agree that he did not have a sufficient degree of familiarity with some of the clients on the roof to be able to work out who they were without looking at the nominal roll (AB77);
	
	
	he agreed that he may have looked at the nominal roll during the course of the evening (AB77-78);
	
	
	he stated that he got to know most of the clients and that “working with them on a daily basis I got to know each and every person” (AB82);
	
	
	he confirmed that he clearly remembered that the Appellant was on the roof, but it was possible that he got the wrong name, but “not in this case” (AB83);
	
	
	he disputed the assertion that he may have been mistaken by his identification of the Appellant (AB90-91).
	



	
	Officer Kiner had been employed at the Detention Centre since November 1999 and was permanently rostered in Fowler Compound since about 2007 (T567; AB31). The Appellant had been detained in the Detention Centre since 9 September 2010 (Exhibit A; AB316).
	
	
	It is appropriate to set out extracts from the evidence of Officer Kiner concerning the Appellant. In examination in chief, he was asked (T696-7; AB43-44):
	


“Q. During that time, did you make any observations of the roof of the Macquarie building? 

A. I did, yes.

Q. Later on had that changed in any way? 

A. It did, yes.

Q. In what way?

A. More people made their way on to the roof.

Q. Did you see any of them making their way on to the roof? 

A. I did, yes.

Q. How did they make their way on to the roof?

A. They pretty much used the fence line which is - it's very hard to see there. It's adjacent to the top corner of the Macquarie building, which is - the fence line was fairly close to that corner of the building and they used the fence line to help scale their way up to the top of the building.

Q. Do you know what the gap is between the fence line that you're talking about and the Macquarie building, what the width is?

A. Approximately no more than four foot, I’d say, three to four foot. It's not a big gap, no.

Q. Did you know anyone in particular that used that method to get on to the roof?

A. I can't recall anyone in particular that - no.

Q. How many people do you say you saw on the roof at about this time?

A. Approximately after they - regarding that time when they all made their way up, it would have been, I’d say, 11 to 13, approximately, people on the roof.

Q. Could you see them? 

A. I could see them, yes.

Q. Could you recognise any of them?

A. I could recognise some of them, yes.

Q. Could you tell us who you saw on the roof? 

A. I saw Morad Mansoor, Darabi, Mr Parhizkar, Razai, Haidari Ali I believe his name is, Ekhteyar.”


	
	Soon after, Officer Kiner was asked in chief (T700; AB47):
	


“Q. You mentioned Ali Haidari, you saw him on the roof, is that right?

A. Haidari, Ali or Ali ---

Q. Haidari Ali, sorry? 

A. That's right, yes.

Q. Can you remember what he was wearing?

A. Dark type of like tracksuit-type clothing, I believe.

Q. Colour, just dark or --

A. Like a a bluish-type colour, if I can recall correctly.

Q. Top and bottom or --

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. Did you, at the time you were on the ground in or near the Serco office, see him do anything while he was on the roof? 

A. I did.

Q. What did you see him do?

A. I did see him remove tiles and pass them to Mr Parhizkar.”


	
	A little later, the Crown asked Officer Kiner questions by reference to the ABC footage (Exhibit C) (T706-7; AB53-54):
	


“Q. Mr Kiner, you, in October last year, looked at some video footage is that right?

A. I did, yes.

Q. And you understood it was entitled “ABC Edited Footage” is that right?

A. That’s right.

Q. You understood, when you were looking at it, did you, that the camera which was used to take the footage was on the other side of the Macquarie building, as it were, from where you were inside the compound? 

A. That's right, yes.

Q. When you looked at that footage were you able to recognise anybody depicted in it?

A. I could recognise a few people, yes.

Q. I think you said a little while ago that there was something in the order of 11 or 13 people on the roof? 

A. That's right, yeah.

Q. When you looked at the footage you were able to recognise a few of them? 

A. Some people, yeah.”


	
	Exhibit C was then played in Court in the presence of the jury and Officer Kiner, and he was asked about persons visible in the ABC footage (T709-713; AB56-60). He said with respect to the Appellant (T710; AB57):
	


“There was also Mr Haidari, Ali, I believe, blue top, blue pants, also sighted throwing tiles from the roof.”


	
	Arising from some questions asked by the trial Judge, Officer Kiner was asked questions by reference to Exhibit E, a still photograph taken from Exhibit C (T710-711; AB57-58):
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: Can exhibit E be put on to the overhead projector please?

(Exhibit E placed on to overhead projector.)

Q. Now, this is an image taken from the ABC footage, do you understand that?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, we see the man on the left of the image, is a dark top with a hoodie over his head and he appears to have some sort of white material around his forehead. He has white shoes on. Are you able to identify that man? 

A. From this particular picture here it's a bit hard for me to identify that person.

Q. Next along a man with a blue top and dark pants, white hat carrying a tile. Do you recognise that man?

A. From this picture I can't, no.

Q. Behind him as we look at the image is a man wearing dark clothes again and has a narrow headband around his head. Do you recognise that man? 

A. I believe that man to be Mr Razai.

Q. To the right of him, as we look at the image, the man wearing black clothes has a larger white headband and appears to have something wrapped around his right hand, do you see that? 

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recognise that man? 

A. Again, from this picture I can't say who that is.

Q. And then to the far right of the image the man with the blue top and blue pants with a tole over his head, do you recognise that man?

A. I believe that man to be Mr Haidari, Ali.”


	
	The playing of Exhibit C continued and, soon after, Officer Kiner referred again to the Appellant (T712; AB59):
	


“Q. Yes?

A. That man that just bent down, I believe that to be Mr Razai.

Q. Mr Razai? 

A. Mr Razai.

Q. With the-

A White headband around his head.

Q. Narrow white headband around his head: 3.57.

A. So just there, the man in the blue top and appears to be - black, sorry, head - hat, whatever, on his head, I believe that to be Mr Haidari, Ali.

Q. He seems to have black long sleeves with a blue shorter sleeved shirt over the top?

A. Over the top, yes.

Q. That’s at counter 4.21. 

A. I'm sorry, but in relation to Mr Darabi and Morad Mansoor, they were both sighted towards the beginning of that video laying down, so.

Q. The man in the light green top, you are not able to identify him? A. No, I can't, no.

Q. And the man in the all blue tracksuit seen at 9.54 throwing things, you can't identify him?

A. Is that the man in the middle?

Q. Yes, with his back to us?'

A. I believe that is Haidari, Ali. I can identify Mr Morad Mansoor at the moment.”


	
	Counsel for the Appellant commenced cross-examination of Officer Kiner in the following way (T761; AB73):
	


“Q. Mr Kiner, the first point in time you saw the person you’ve nominated as Haidari Ali on the roof that evening was when Parhizkar was throwing tiles from it, agree?

A. He was up the same time, that’s right.”


	
	Officer Kiner was asked in cross-examination (T767; AB79):
	


“Q. Now, all of those persons, that is all of the persons from the Middle East, obviously have certain physical features in common, didn't they? 

A. Such as?

Q. Well, dark coloured hair.

A. Well, the majority.

Q. Dark brown eyes.

A. Yes.

Q. Olive complexion? 

A. Yes.

Q. And did that make it difficult for you to work out who was who on 21 April 2011?

A. Well, when you work with these people for the amount of time I have, you get to know these people. Some people stand out more than other people.”


	
	Soon after, he was asked (T770; AB82):
	


“Q. You see, Mr Kiner, the similar sounding and identical names of many of the detainees make it a challenge for you at times to put a correct name to a face? 

A. At certain times in certain situations, it may do, but, as I said, we work with these clients day in, day out. We got to know these clients. As I said before they all have different physical attributes and personalities which makes them stand apart from each other.” 


	
	Officer Kiner was asked (T771-2; AB83-84):
	


“Q. You just had the wrong name to the right face, do you accept that? 

A. Yes.

Q. That may well be the case also, Mr Kiner, might it not, with the person that you've named Haidari Ali? 

A. What may be the case?

Q. You may have put a wrong name to the correct detainee? 

A. I remember that person clearly.

Q. And the question is: given the circumstances of the similar sounding names, the identical names, you may have put the wrong name, Haidari Ali, to the detainee you say you observed doing things? 

A. It’s possible, but I - not in this case. 

Q. At no time before yesterday had you ever provided a physical description of the person you named as Haidari Ali to anybody. Agree?

A. That’s true.

Q. What, you simply didn’t, before yesterday you had never described the bloke?

A. No.

Q. Had you?

A. No.”


	
	Counsel concluded his cross-examination of Officer Kiner in the following way (T778-9; AB90-91):
	


“Q.. Mr Kiner, given the circumstances of that evening, the fact that, you know, lots of things were happening at once, it was a stressful situation, you were fearful for your own safety, it was a situation where many of the detainees were of similar ethnic background and had similar sounding names, is it possible that you are mistaken when you say Mr Haidari Ali was one of the clients on the roof? 

A. As I said before, we got to know these clients over a period of time. Each client has a different personality, different physical attributes which stands them apart from each other. Some I got to know better than others. That's what I'm saying.

Q. I will ask the question again, given the circumstances that I won't outline again, isn't it possible that you are mistaken when you say Haidari Ali was one of the clients on the roof? 

A. I made that statement one hundred percent.

Q. See, you may well have, as you did with Mr Paish's client, attributed the wrong name to the right client. Agreed? 

A. I can't comment on that.

Q. Why not? 

A. Because I'm human. Sometimes you make mistakes, sometimes you don't. But in this particular situation I'm sure that was Mr Haidari Ali on the roof.

Q. You see, have you ever thought you recognised someone in the past only to subsequently realise that you were mistaken?

A. It is possible.

Q. Ever made a mistake?

A. Of course I've made mistakes.”


	
	Having considered the evidence of Officer Kiner and the footage depicted in Exhibits C and J, I consider this case to be distinguishable from R v Drollett. In that case, Mr Stephens did not see any part of the event constituting the offence. Here, Officer Kiner observed critical events at relevant times. He said that he observed the Appellant on the roof with tiles. When shown Exhibit C, he said that it showed the Appellant throwing tiles from the roof. He gave evidence of those events including identification of the Appellant, whom he knew from his working experience at the Detention Centre.
	
	
	It has not been demonstrated that the further evidence of Officer Kiner by reference to the ABC and mobile phone footage constituted opinion evidence. Rather, the present case falls within the circumstances described by Simpson J in R v Drollett at [54]-[55].
	
	
	The fact that Officer Kiner may not have been observing events on top of the roof of the Macquarie Building from the same angle as that depicted in the film, did not operate against his giving evidence by reference to the footage of events, at least some of which he himself had observed. As Simpson J noted in R v Drollett at [55], an example of factual evidence of this type arises where the person depicted is photographed from the rear or partly obscured. In my view, this is a fair description of some of the visual images shown to Officer Kiner and the jury about which he gave evidence.
	
	
	The Appellant faces a substantial hurdle with this ground of appeal. He must demonstrate that Officer Kiner’s challenged evidence falls on the opinion side of the blurred boundary that lies between fact and opinion. There is no bright line test to be applied. Unlike other cases where this issue has arisen (see [54] and R v Drollett), Officer Kiner was present at the scene and testified that he had seen the Appellant on the roof with tiles in his hands. The ABC footage provided strong and clear evidence adverse to the Appellant, if the jury was satisfied that Officer Kiner had correctly identified the Appellant.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the evidence given by Officer Kiner which is now challenged was opinion evidence. Rather, it was factual evidence which was not objected to, but was challenged by the Appellant’s counsel in cross-examination and closing address upon the basis that this was a case of mistaken identity.
	
	
	The Appellant has not demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, so that leave to rely upon the first ground of appeal should be refused under Rule 4.
	


Ground 3 - The Unreasonable Verdict Ground

Submissions of the Appellant


	
	In support of this ground, counsel submitted that Officer Kiner’s evidence was not reliable, that it was based upon his “belief” that the Appellant was the person whom he observed lifting tiles off the roof, and that the footage was not of sufficient clarity taken on its own, or in conjunction with the evidence of Officer Kiner, to support the conviction of the Appellant.
	
	
	It was submitted that Officer Kiner had made mistakes with respect to names of persons and that this served as well to undermine the cogency of his evidence. Counsel submitted that there was no evidence upon which this Court was able to favourably assess the reliability of Officer Kiner’s belief in support of the conclusion that the relevant detainee was in fact the Appellant.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown referred again to the evidence of Officer Kiner, as summarised at [59]-[60] above, in support of the submission that the verdict in this case was not unreasonable.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the jury had the evidence of the ABC footage which, taken with other evidence, assisted a finding that it was the Appellant (amongst others) depicted on the roof. The jury had available evidence of the Appellant’s image in the nominal roll, and had been able to observe him during the course of the trial. It was open to the jury to conclude, from their own observations, that it was the Appellant depicted in the footage lifting tiles from the roof and throwing them, both being acts of violence for the purpose of the charge.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this Court would be assisted by its own viewing of the relevant footage, in the same way as the Court had been assisted in Dodds v R [2009] NSWCCA 78; 194 A Crim R 408 at 433-434 [99], [102].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Officer Kiner had given evidence of his familiarity with the Appellant. It was submitted that the Appellant did not challenge Officer Kiner’s capacity to give such evidence on the basis that he did not know him well enough to be able to identify him. Rather, the Appellant’s challenge to Officer Kiner’s evidence involved assertions that he used the nominal roll to assist him to identify people on the night, or that he may have been mistaken about the name of the person he saw, or that he was mistaken that it was the Appellant that he saw.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, having regard to the evidence before the jury, the verdict of guilty was reasonable.
	


Determination


	
	In Geitz v R [2013] NSWCCA 289, Beazley P (Price J and myself agreeing) set out, at [32]-[37], the principles to be applied in determining a ground of appeal that a conviction is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence:
	


“32   In M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, at 493, per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ, the High Court stated that the test to be applied in determining whether the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence was as follows:

‘Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict ... the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.’

33   Earlier in M, at 492, their Honours had said:

‘In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand' (citations omitted).

34   The Court added, at 494:

‘In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.’

35   M was approved in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. Their Honours noted that for the purposes of s 6(1), the starting point was that the jury had the primary function in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. It was integral to that proposition that the jury had seen and heard the witnesses. 

36   In applying this test, the Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence process as to its sufficiency and its quality: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400, the plurality, French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ, reaffirming the test to be applied in determining whether the verdict was unreasonable was that stated in M and MFA.

37   In Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113], Hayne J (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing), stated:

‘It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence ... That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.’ (citation omitted)”


	
	For the purpose of determining this ground, I have had regard to the entirety of the evidence referable to the Appellant, including the evidence of Officer Kiner and the mobile phone and ABC footage contained in Exhibits C and J, which I have reviewed again in Chambers since the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	I have kept in mind, as well, the fact that the jury had the opportunity to observe the Appellant during the trial, in conjunction with still and moving photographs said to depict the Appellant, as relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	I have had regard to the careful directions given to the jury by the trial Judge with respect to identification and recognition evidence (SU14-19; AB178-183). Those directions were not challenged before this Court. They constitute an appropriate reminder to this Court of its approach to assessment of evidence of this type.
	
	
	It is the case that some criticism may be made of the evidence of Officer Kiner. He had made some mistakes with respect to names during his evidence. An examination of the transcript of his evidence indicates that he used the term “belief” or “believe” from time to time. A fair reading of his evidence, however, indicates that this was a term used by him in circumstances where, in fact, he was expressing an unqualified identification of the Appellant. His turn of phrase did not involve a form of watered-down expression, indicating an element of doubt or uncertainty in his own mind.
	
	
	It was the evidence of Officer Kiner that he knew the Appellant and had dealings with him over a period of time whilst the Appellant had been detained at the Detention Centre since 9 September 2010. The Appellant was not a stranger to Officer Kiner.
	
	
	This Court has not had the extended opportunity to observe the Appellant during the course of the trial which was available to the jury. The jury, of course, had an opportunity to observe Officer Kiner give evidence over a reasonably extended period.
	
	
	However, the Court has viewed relevant extracts of the footage in Exhibits C and J, in conjunction with other evidence including that of Officer Kiner.
	
	
	Exhibit C is of particular importance. It is good quality footage, to be distinguished from the poor quality images referred to in R v Beattie, R v Marsh and R v Drollett.
	
	
	The person identified by Officer Kiner as the Appellant is clearly visible in Exhibit C, performing various acts as follows (using the counter number on the disk provided to the Court):
	


*   3:01 - The Appellant is identified - “blue top, black hat, whatever, on his head” (T712; AB59).

*   5:17 - The Appellant removes a tile from the roof (the person has a bare head and this remained so).

*   5:40 - The Appellant picks up and throws a tile into the compound.

*   6:08 - The Appellant removes a tile and hands it to Parhizkar (Officer Kiner said he saw the Appellant remove tiles and pass them to Parhizkar - T700; AB47).

*   6:27 - The Appellant hands a tile to Parhizkar.

*   6:59 - The Appellant throws a tile.

*   8:03-8:46 - The Appellant throws four objects.

*   9:10 -    The Appellant hands a tile to another man.

*   11:34   - The Appellant throws an object.


	
	Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied, upon the whole of the evidence, that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of the offence of which he was convicted: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493.
	
	
	It has not been demonstrated that a jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the Appellant’s guilt: Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at 596-597 [113]; Geitz v R at [32]-[37] (cited at [86] above).
	
	
	I would reject the third ground of appeal.
	


Proposed Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	time extended to 23 October 2014 for the Appellant to file a Notice of Appeal;
	
	
	leave refused under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon Ground 1;
	
	
	appeal against conviction dismissed.
	



	
	HALL J: I have read in draft the judgment of Johnson J and I am in agreement with his Honour’s reasons in respect of Grounds 1 and 3 of the Grounds of Appeal, and the orders which his Honour has proposed.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 3, the “unreasonable verdict” ground, having read the evidence, including in particular the evidence of Officer Kiner, and having, in particular, again examined the ABC footage concerning relevant events that occurred on 20 April 2011 at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (Exhibit C) in Chambers and viewed the mobile phone footage (Exhibit J), in my assessment, the evidence of Officer Kiner was reliable and cogent identification evidence in relation to the Appellant.
	
	
	Officer Kiner made three statements in relation to the events of 20 April 2011. The statements were made on 23 April 2011, 6 June 2011 and 31 October 2012 and were tendered on the voir dire hearing though not in the trial. It was not suggested to him in the cross-examination on behalf of the Appellant that any of his abovementioned statements contained any contradictions of significance on the identification issue.
	
	
	Officer Kiner’s evidence was that he was well-acquainted with the detainees in the Fowler Compound of the Detention Centre, and had dealt with them on a daily basis. The evidence was that he identified the Appellant on the night of 20 April 2011 on the roof of the premises. Officer Kiner said he was “one hundred per cent” certain that the Appellant was one of those on the roof. He also identified the Appellant in the ABC footage as one of the men who were throwing things from the roof and assisting others who were doing so.
	
	
	Officer Kiner was cross-examined upon the basis that many of the detainees were of Middle Eastern appearance and had physical features in common. Whilst this was accepted, Officer Kiner on a number of occasions emphasised the extent to which he had come to know the detainees. He rejected the proposition that similarity of physical features made it difficult for him to identify those involved in the activities on the night in question. The proposition was rejected in part upon the proposition:
	


“… when you work with these people the amount of time I have, you get to know these people …” (T767)


	
	In the course of the summing up his Honour reminded the jury that the Crown case against the Appellant was dependent upon a single witness, Officer Kiner. The trial Judge referred to the matters that counsel for the Appellant relied upon in his closing address and concessions made by Officer Kiner. These included similarities in the physical appearances of many of the detainees, many having the same or similar sounding first names or surnames, and that three detainees had the surname Haidari. The jury were reminded of the circumstances in which the identification was made including the fact that it occurred at night time in a chaotic situation. The jury were reminded of the matters that counsel had relied upon to support the possibility as a reasonable one that Officer Kiner had put the wrong name to a particular client that he observed throwing tiles from the roof. The jury were reminded that counsel for the Appellant had pointed out that Officer Kiner frequently used the expression “I believe” which, it had been submitted on behalf of the Appellant, suggested some doubt in his mind as to the correctness of the identification.
	
	
	Finally, the jury were reminded of the submission made as to the claimed difficulty in identifying the Appellant from the ABC video and the photographs, it having been submitted that he had never directly faced towards the camera and had no distinguishing features.
	
	
	As Johnson J has observed, no criticism was or could have been made as to the trial directions given, in particular, on the issue of identification.
	
	
	The evidence, following close analysis, in my opinion, excluded the possibility of any reasonable doubt on the issue of identification.
	
	
	Following a review of the evidence I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of the offence charged.

2766812,New South Wales Crime Commission v Elhassan (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 683,"Judgment


	
	On 10 July 2014 I made restraining orders in relation to the property of the defendant arising out of the suspicion of an authorised officer of the plaintiff that the defendant had engaged in a serious crime related activity, being the supply of drugs. One of the items of property was a unit, Unit 3, 11 15 Renwick Street, Leichhardt.
	
	
	Information has now come to light in relation to the sale of that unit and the purchase price paid for it, particularly in the light of the amount of the vendor's mortgage and the fact that the contract was privately negotiated without the intervention of an agent. There is evidence to suggest that both the vendor and the vendor's brother, who was said to have organised the sale, have information concerning the defendant's property.
	
	
	The application is made for the examination of the vendor's brother pursuant to Section 12 (1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). I am satisfied on the evidence that it is appropriate to order that the respondent be so examined.
	
	
	Accordingly I make Order 1 in the draft order provided to me. I grant leave in paragraph 2 and liberty in paragraph 3.

		03 June 2015",2015-06-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2766815,R v Sumpton (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 684,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	On Wednesday 29 October 2014, a jury in Grafton found Andrew Mervyn Sumpton (“the offender”) guilty of the murder of Michelle Roberts at South Grafton on 18 May 2012. He was also found guilty of two offences of intentionally damaging property by fire. The offences were closely related. Sentence proceedings followed and have been delayed for reasons to which I will return. Counsel made their final submissions on sentence yesterday. The offender now stands to be sentenced.
	
	
	The offences occurred early in the morning of 18 May 2012. Police and firefighters attended a house fire at the home of Michelle Roberts in South Grafton. Inside the house, emergency workers discovered the body of Michelle Roberts. It was badly burnt. She was unrecognisable. The post mortem examination showed that she died as a result of multiple stab wounds and also had injuries consistent with blunt force trauma.
	
	
	The examination of the scene by forensic officers and fire experts supported the inference that the fire was deliberately set. There were three separate “seats”, or points of origin, of the fire. One of those was on or under the body of Michelle Roberts.
	
	
	The offender was present outside the house of Michelle Roberts when the emergency services arrived. He was behaving in a way that interfered with the efforts of the firefighters. His behaviour and the things that he said to police that morning caused suspicion to attach to him. In the days following the fire, the offender gave a series of interviews with police. He was arrested and charged on 24 May 2012. He has been in custody since then and the sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	The trial commenced in Grafton on 7 October 2014 with a voir dire concerning the admissibility of a confession made by the offender in the cells of the Grafton Police Station. The confession was excluded: R v Sumpton [2014] NSWSC 1432. The accused was then arraigned on the following charges:
	


The murder of Michelle Roberts.

Intentionally damaging a two bedroom detached house at 10 Margret Crescent, South Grafton, the property of the NSW Land and Housing Corporation by means of fire.

Intentionally damaging clothing, bedding, a television and a single seat lounge chair, the property of Michelle Roberts by means of fire.


	
	The offender pleaded not guilty. The trial proceeded over the next ten days and counsel addressed the jury on Monday 27 October 2014. I summed up on Tuesday 28 October 2014 and the jury retired to consider its verdicts at 12.48pm. At 2.11pm on Wednesday 29 October 2014 the jury returned with verdicts of guilty in relation to each count. In light of the evidence and the offender’s testimony, the verdicts were not surprising. The Crown tendered the criminal histories of the offender as recorded by authorities in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. The sentence proceedings were adjourned to Sydney.
	
	
	On 12 December 2014 the Crown tendered some facts in relation to some of the Queensland offences and the parties provided some written and oral submissions. The case could not proceed because of difficulties on each side. The Crown needed time to present victims’ impact statements and indicated that it may seek to tender evidence to support a possible argument that the offender presented a future danger to the community. The offender was not in a position to tender evidence relevant to his ongoing medical and “pain management” issues. There were difficulties finding a date suitable to all parties and the proceedings were adjourned until 2 March 2015. A pre-sentence report was ordered.
	
	
	On 2 March 2015 counsel for the offender advised the Court that there were difficulties obtaining a grant of legal aid to obtain a report relating to the offender’s medical problems. This was in spite of comments made in December 2014 to the effect that the Court would be assisted by such a report. The Crown indicated it had decided not to adduce further evidence going to the issue of future dangerousness. The case was adjourned until 16-17 April 2015 with a direction that the defence serve its report and evidence concerning the offender’s medical condition in advance of that hearing. For reasons outside of the offender’s control, that did not occur. Counsel for the offender notified me, via my Associate and with the consent of the Crown, that legal aid had been refused in relation to the preparation of the report. The parties jointly sought an order directed to Justice Health that a report be prepared for the purpose of the sentencing hearing. I vacated the sentencing date and directed that a report be prepared. That report was finally provided on 27 May 2015 under the hand of Dr Suresh Badami. Defence counsel sought to examine him on that report and an order for short service of a subpoena was made on Friday 29 May 2015.
	
	
	On 1 June 2015 the parties adduced further evidence relevant to sentence. This included two victim’s impact statements, a body of evidence relating to the offender’s medical condition and the cross-examination of Dr Badami. Counsel made their final submissions. The victim’s daughter travelled to Sydney to present the victims’ impact statements and to observe the sentencing hearing. She expressed a desire to remain for the judgment but was unable to stay beyond today (2 June 2015). Given that circumstance, and taking into account the delay since the verdicts in October 2014, I resolved to proceed to sentence today. I adjourned overnight to consider my decision.
	
	
	I must determine the facts of the offences upon which the offender is to be sentenced and make a relative assessment of the objective gravity of the offences. I must make findings as to the aggravating and mitigating features of the offence itself and other matters relevant to an assessment of a just sentence. Where the feature is one that would aggravate the sentence, I must apply the criminal standard of proof (beyond reasonable doubt). Where it is a mitigating feature, proof is on the balance of probabilities. Some of the aggravating and mitigating features are detailed in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Act”) and I will apply that section even though I will not necessarily identify the specific sub-section or paragraph that applies to each feature. Sentencing ought not to descend into an application of “some sort of checklist”: Ghamraoui v R [2009] NSWCCA 111 at [23]. Rather, it is a matter of synthesising the various factors relevant to a proper assessment of a just sentence, applying the purposes of punishment established at common law and stated in s 3A of the Act, and determining instinctively the appropriate punishment for these offences bearing in mind the individual circumstances of this offender.
	
	
	I must determine the appropriate punishment for each of the three offences and then decide the extent to which the sentence should be accumulated bearing in mind the principle of totality and the need to denounce each of the offences individually.
	


THE FACTS OF THE OFFENCES


	
	The facts upon which the offender is to be sentenced must be consistent with the verdicts of jury bearing in mind the way in which the trial was conducted. In some instances it will not be possible to make conclusive findings as to the facts. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the following facts.
	
	
	On 17 May 2012 the offender and the victim met for the first time. They spent time together drinking. I am satisfied that each was extremely intoxicated by the time of the murder. As well as beer, the offender obtained some form of homemade whiskey from a friend. There was also evidence that they had taken some form of prescription drug, Valium or similar.
	
	
	I accept the offender’s evidence that they spent some time together in Ms Robert’s bedroom. I do not accept his evidence that they simply talked in the bedroom and that he had no sexual interest in her. I do not accept the Crown’s implicit suggestion that all of the sexual contact between them was “unwanted” or that the offender gained entry under the pretence of having forgotten his cigarettes. While there is some evidence to support those conclusions, I prefer the inferences that arise from the evidence of the witnesses Debbie Fordham and Yarnah Cook. Each of those witnesses described an incident when the deceased visited their home scantily dressed. Ms Fordham said she was wearing only a robe, “bra and undies”. The underwear had “black, lacy look ... like a set”. Ms Cook said that she “did like a little dance on the spot and was giggling”. The victim was discovered with underpants around her knees. Neither Ms Cook nor Ms Fordham recognised these and thought they were of a different colour. Ms Cook said that she followed Ms Roberts across the road and called out to see if there was anybody else in the house. The offender was inside, told her to wait and emerged pulling up his pants. In rejecting the offender’s evidence that he had no sexual interest in Ms Roberts and that they did not even touch, I also take into account the tendency evidence concerning the offender’s attraction to women of Asian appearance and a conversation he had with Mr Johnson when he picked up the bottle of homemade whiskey. That conversation suggested he was looking forward to returning to see Ms Roberts. According to the offender, he told Mr Johnson that he had met a “lady friend”, that they were having a bit of a joke and Mr Johnson said “go for it, mate”.
	
	
	From all of this evidence, I infer that the offender and Ms Roberts, drunk, were engaged in some kind of preliminary sexual activity. I reject the offender’s evidence that it was “impossible” for him to have a romantic or sexual interest in Ms Roberts because of a medical condition that means that he cannot achieve an erection. However, based on the evidence of his former partner Ms Beeching-Marshall, I accept that the offender had erectile dysfunction. What role, if any, his dysfunction had in the events that followed is difficult to know.
	
	
	As I observed in the course of the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions, it is not possible to do other than to speculate as to exactly what happened next. It may be that Ms Roberts resisted the offender’s sexual advances. It may be that he had difficulty achieving an erection. These are matters of speculation. However, what is known is that the offender then inflicted a brutal and sexually charged attack on Ms Roberts.
	
	
	Ms Roberts was a slightly built woman (she weighed 54 kg) and had a pronounced limp. Her disability required her to use a walking stick. She was also very intoxicated. I find that she was vulnerable to the offender’s violent attack. This is an aggravating feature of the crime. The evidence supports the conclusion, and I accept beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender used two weapons in his attack on Ms Roberts. He used a statue at least twice to inflict significant blunt force trauma to Ms Roberts’ face. He used a knife to inflict a large number of wounds including the fatal wounds. The use of weapons is also an aggravating feature although I note that many offences of murder involve the use of a weapon. However, it is not an inherent feature of the offence and it is an aggravating feature in the strict sense.
	
	
	A pathologist (Dr Beer) observed 24 stab wounds to the chest, abdomen, upper thigh and area of the vagina. The wounds to the area of the vagina support the inference that the murder had a significant sexual motivation. The wounds to the chest are likely to have caused death. In addition to the stab wounds, Dr Beer said that Ms Roberts had a broken nose and a number of her teeth were dislodged by the roots. These injuries, along with evidence of blood spatter in the area of the murder, suggested that she was struck with significant force with an object. There was a broken statue in the bedroom and I infer that the offender used this statue to strike his victim at least twice to the face.
	
	
	I accept the Crown Prosecutor’s description that this was a “spontaneous but brutal killing of a vulnerable woman in her own home”. I accept that the killing was sexually motivated although the precise nature of that motivation cannot be determined. The most likely scenarios are that Ms Roberts rejected the offender’s sexual advances or that the offender had difficulty in performing sexually. There was evidence to support the former proposition from a former cell mate (Zack Sommers). However, Mr Sommers’ evidence was of such poor quality that I am not prepared to act on it. The transcript does not reflect just how unconvincing his evidence was. What I can infer from the injuries to the offender himself, is that Ms Roberts put up a fight. However, I cannot determine if that was in response to sexual advances or the physical attack. In any event, whatever be the precise motivation, it provides no mitigation of any kind.
	
	
	I accept that the offender then fled the scene and returned to his home. The enormity of what he had done began to dawn upon him. He then returned to the scene and attempted to cover up his crime. He did this by setting fire to some sheets on or under Ms Roberts’ body and set two other fires within her house. He burned his hands in doing this. He then purported to raise the alarm, knocking on the door of some neighbours and saying that there was a fire in the house of his friend. He pretended to help the firefighters who came to the scene. He was, as Senior Counsel for the Crown put to him in cross-examination, the “arsonist claiming to have discovered the fire; the killer hiding in full view”.
	
	
	Over the coming days, the offender spoke to police on a number of occasions. He lied over and over again. His lies were increasingly desperate and transparent. His conduct was theatrical and unconvincing. He showed no remorse for what he had done.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS


	
	While I do not accept the Crown’s submission that this is a case that “approaches the worst category of offending”, I do accept that it lies comfortably above the middle range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The spontaneous nature of the attack, and the fact that it was not part of a premeditated or planned criminal activity, is a significant factor in mitigation. The evidence suggests to me, and I accept on balance, that the offender lost control for reasons that are not clear. While his intoxication is in no sense a mitigating feature, it increases the likelihood that he lost control in the circumstances that developed that night.
	
	
	As I have said, the victim’s vulnerability and the use of two weapons are aggravating features.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond doubt that, in the moment, the offender formed an intention to kill Ms Roberts. That intention was formed spontaneously and in the course of a frenzy during which the offender lost control of himself. Murders involving an intention to kill are generally considered to be more serious than those involving an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The Crown does not submit that the offence involved gratuitous cruelty or that the wounds to Ms Roberts’ genital area amounted to mutilation (cf R v Robinson [2002] NSWCCA 359).
	


Offence committed inside the victim’s home


	
	Whether the fact that the offence took place in the victim’s home amounts to a circumstance of aggravation is a matter of controversy. Counsel for the offender points to Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [111]-[112] where the Court said that there was a “clear line of authority” supporting the proposition that “it will be an aggravating circumstance when a victim is assaulted in his or her own home by an unauthorised intruder. However, it is otherwise when the offender is lawfully on the premises”. Similarly, in EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199 it was held by RA Hulme J:
	


“It is an aggravating circumstance where an offender intrudes into the home and not where the offender and a victim reside together.""


	
	However, subsequent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal (including observations by his Honour, RA Hulme J) have indicated that the Court may need to re-examine that statement of principle and that it may not accord with the plain words of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Act: Melbon v R [2013] NSWCCA 2010 at [1]-[2] and [43]-[44]. See also Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214, the comments of Kirby J in Oh v R [2010] NSWCCA 148 at [40] and my observations in sentencing in R v Simmons (No 8) [2015] NSWSC 627 at [9]-[11].
	
	
	As recently as last week, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the issue yet again: Aktar v R [2015] NSWCCA 123. Wilson J at [45]-[64] undertook a thorough and helpful analysis of the authorities and the proper approach to the interpretation of the statute. Her Honour referred to relevant extrinsic guides to an understanding of the section and concluded that the approach taken in Ingham v R (and applied in a number of subsequent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal) was unduly restrictive and that the “proper construction of the provision should … include its application to offences committed within residential premises by an offender lawfully present.” Hoeben CJ at CL (at [1]) preferred to reserve his judgment on the issue “until an occasion when the matter has been fully argued by both sides”. The Chief Judge stressed that he did not “deprecate” the approach commended by Wilson J. RA Hulme J (at [2]) also noted that the matter had not been fully argued and did not wish to say anything more than what he said in Melbon v R.
	
	
	Mr Dennis points to the tension between the authorities and submits that it would amount to error to find an aggravating circumstance given the current state of the authorities, stating resolution of the tension is a matter for determination by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	The state of the authorities remains unclear. It speaks eloquently to the proposition that pigeon-holing such matters as “aggravating” or “mitigating” can sometimes be unhelpful. The tension between the authorities is such that I do not propose to treat the matter as an aggravating feature for the purpose of the application of s 21A(2) of the Act. However, the fact that the victim was killed in her own home remains relevant to a proper assessment of the objective criminality of the offender’s conduct. I accept the Crown’s submission that the offender was an invitee and that this involved an element of trust. Ms Roberts was entitled to feel safe, and to be safe, in her own home. Even if she was physically able to flee the attack (which is unlikely), there was nowhere to which she was able to escape. Without treating it as an aggravating feature of the offence, it is a matter that bears upon a proper assessment of the objective gravity of the crime. The distinction between this approach and essentially ticking a box that s 21A(2)(eb) of the Act is engaged is a fine, and possibly elusive, one.
	


Mutilation of the corpse


	
	The Crown relies on the destruction of Ms Roberts’ corpse by fire as an aggravating feature of the crime. The Crown says that this amounted to mutilation of the corpse. Defence counsel concedes that the “mistreatment” of the victim’s corpse increases the objective seriousness of the offence and refers to a number of cases where that has been held to be the case. I accept that concession and have taken the matter into account in assessing the objective gravity of the offence of murder.
	
	
	I accept that the accused deliberately set fire to the bed-clothes surrounding Ms Roberts’ body and that this act was calculated to destroy Ms Roberts body and the evidence of his heinous behaviour. I accept that this amounted to mutilation of the corpse. However, the case is far removed from the circumstances that prevailed in R v Robinson. In that case, the offender disembowelled the victim, cut off his penis and threw it in the sink. This seemed to be a gratuitous act, performed for its own disturbing purposes. He later boasted about it. It was an important aspect in assessing the offender’s future dangerousness. While I accept that Mr Sumpton’s act of burning Ms Roberts’ corpse shows his complete disregard for his victim and her dignity, I do not treat the evidence in the same way as the sentencing Judge approached the mutilation of the corpse in R v Robinson. Further, I should tread warily in my treatment of this factor because the motivation of destroying evidence is also an aggravating feature of the arson offences even though the property destroyed by the arson is particularised as the chattels of Ms Roberts and the property owned by the housing corporation.
	


Conclusion as to the objective gravity of the murder charge


	
	Having considered all of these factors, I have concluded that the offence of murder falls comfortably above the middle range of objective seriousness.
	


Arson


	
	Turning to the arson offences, they are serious examples of offences under s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. As I have just said, the motivation of covering up a murder charge is a matter that increases the objective seriousness of these two offences. However, there are far more serious offences of arson, particularly those where a number of people are put at risk of injury or death. There are also cases where there is a far greater loss to the owners of the property and cases where the arson is motivated by financial gain and is well planned and executed.
	


THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF MICHELLE ROBERTS’ FAMILY


	
	I have received into evidence the victim’s impact statements of Michelle Roberts’ daughter (Lauren Pinxt) and her son (Mathew Pinxt). I thank Lauren Pinxt for her courage in reading these statements to the Court yesterday. It cannot have been an easy thing to do. I want to thank her and Mr Pinxt for sharing their memories of their mother and the impact that this awful crime has had upon them. I understand that nothing that the law can do will compensate you for your loss and your suffering. I realise that no sentence that I impose will seem to you to be long enough. Given the extent of your grief and your loss, how could it?
	
	
	Through your statements I have learned more about Michelle Roberts than was previously known by the Court. She was the greatly cherished mother of seven wonderful children. She was intelligent and well educated. Her love for her children was uncomplicated and unconditional. Lauren described her as a “rose trapped in a thorn bush” and that seems, on my imperfect understanding of her life, to be an apt and lovely description.
	
	
	I have also gained some understanding of your loss and your grief and the impact that the offender’s crime has had on you. I now know that Mathew went into a significant decline, relying on drugs and drink to help ease the pain. I know that Lauren feels bad because sometimes she was too busy to stay in touch. I know that the news of her mother’s death hit her like a tonne of bricks and that she feels emotionally volatile and angry; that she tries to stay busy to avoid thinking about what happened to her mother. She gets angry and upset when other people complain about their mothers – she wishes that she could still complain about her mother.
	
	
	To both of you and to your family, I express the Court’s deepest and sincere sympathy. I hope that time will allow your suffering to ease and that today will mark some form of closure to this dreadful chapter of your lives. I am entitled to take your suffering and loss into account in determining the appropriate sentence. However, I know that nothing I do or say will fill the hole in your lives.
	
	
	I have previously discussed the difficulties in applying the provisions of s 28(4) of the Act while maintaining the dignity and equality of all human life: see R v Hines (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273 at [78]. Those observations have been referred to by McCallum J in R v Halloun [2014] NSWSC 1705 and by Davies J in R v Do (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 512.
	
	
	In R v Halloun, McCallum J made the following observations (at [46]):
	


“As has been noted by another judge of this Court, the legislation does not explain how a sentencing judge is to determine when it is ‘appropriate’ to take the harmful impact on a murder victim's family into account in determining punishment: R v Hines (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273 at [78] per Hamill J. It seems unthinkable that the amendment reflects an acceptance by the legislature that some lives are more valuable to the community than others. I would construe the new provision as an important mechanism for ensuring that the evidence of family victims is placed before the court to give texture to the undoubted proposition that every unlawful taking of a human life harms the community in some way. In that way, the provision serves the purposes of sentencing stated in s 3A of the Act, one of which is to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”


	
	In R v Do (No 4) Davies J said (at [50]):
	


“It is far from clear what practical difference has been made by the amendment. As Johnson J noted in R v Pluis [2015] NSWSC 320, all lives are precious and the death of any person is a harm inflicted on the community in general.”


	
	In this case, defence counsel concedes that the harm done to Michelle Roberts’ family is an aspect of the harm done to the community and that it is appropriate to take into account that harm in assessing the appropriate sentence. The learned Crown Prosecutor has provided thoughtful written submissions attempting to explain the operation of the section and its interaction with concepts of equality before the law. In view of the sensible concessions made by counsel for the offender, it is unnecessary to attempt to resolve those issues now. I do express my gratitude to both counsel for their helpful approach to this difficult aspect of the case.
	
	
	I accept the concession made by Mr Dennis on behalf of the offender. I accept that the harm to the victim’s family is an aspect of harm done to the community. I accept that it is appropriate to consider that harm and to take it into account in connection with the appropriate punishment to be imposed on Mr Sumpton. I will do so.
	


THE OFFENDER’S PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHER MITIGATING FEATURES

Family and Personal History


	
	A pre-sentence report was prepared for the purpose of the sentencing proceedings. While the history provided is not corroborated, there seems to be no contest and the history appears to be uncontroversial. The offender is a 50 year old man. He has little to no contact with his family. He has not spoken to either of his sisters in over a decade and has only occasionally corresponded with his elderly parents. The offender seemed unconcerned about the lack of family contact and when asked the reason for it replied “that’s just the way it is”. The offender was second of four children and his elder, only brother passed away at the age of four. While he was well provided for, his father was strict, violent and often drank. The offender was the only son and bared the brunt of his father’s physical abuse.
	
	
	The offender attended school until the age of 15 when he left to commence employment. He worked in the grain transport and mining industries and said that although he had no formal qualifications to speak of, he acquired skills in his work which made him employable all over Australia. This resulted in a transitory lifestyle and the offender often moved from state to state at short notice.
	
	
	The offender explained that he would often use drugs such as speed to enable him to drive through the night to get from one workplace to another. In the interviews conducted for the pre-sentence report, the offender minimised his drug use. This is at odds with the evidence given at the trial by his ex-partner (Alexandra Beeching-Marshall). Ms Beeching-Marshall revealed that he introduced her to drugs and that he was a recreational user of amphetamines (speed and ice). Her evidence also indicated that the offender abused alcohol throughout their relationship and medical records indicate that the offender disclosed a history of alcohol related blackouts. The offender justifies his excessive consumption of alcohol, stating that he “worked hard and drank just as hard”. He does not consider his alcohol consumption to be problematic.
	


Criminal and Custodial History


	
	The offender’s criminal history disentitles him to leniency. He has a criminal history in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales. The offender is to be sentenced for murder which is classified as a “serious personal violence offence” pursuant to ss 21A(2)(d) and 21(6) of the Act. The offender has a bad record of traffic offences and a number of serious offences of dishonesty. More significantly, he also has a number of offences of violence recorded against him.
	
	
	The offender’s record for violence includes an offence in 2010 of assaulting police in New South Wales. In Queensland he was convicted of assaulting police on 7 February 2010. He was also convicted in Queensland of “deprivation of liberty” (10 April 1987), unlawful assault (24 October 1992), indecent dealing with children under 12 years (15 March 1996), assault occasioning actual bodily harm, obstruct police and common assault (23 December 2004) and being armed to cause fear (24 May 2004).
	
	
	He has previously been sentenced to terms of imprisonment. However, nothing in his criminal history even remotely approaches the gravity of his present crimes.
	
	
	While I have concluded that his criminal history disentitles the offender to leniency, I have not concluded that it is an aggravating feature in the sense that it should result in a sentence that is disproportionate to the gravity of the offences themselves: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566.
	
	
	I will further consider his history of offending in addressing the question of the protection of the community and the issue of future dangerousness.
	


Contrition and Remorse


	
	The offender maintains his denials. He told the author of the pre-sentence report that he was an “easy pinch” for police. He states that the initial admissions made to police were obtained when he was sleep deprived. That evidence was excluded at trial (R v Sumpton [2014] NSWSC 1432). Counsel for the offender objected to it being used on sentence and the Crown withdrew the tender of that material.
	
	
	In any event, by the time of the trial and in his conversations with the author of the pre-sentence report, he maintained his innocence. He denied the admissions allegedly made to the Grafton Correctional Centre co-ordinator (Andrew Hayes) where he said that he blacked out and “woke up with blood all over himself and she was a mess”. He told Mr Hayes that he set the place on fire because “she was fucked and I had to get rid of the evidence”. Mr Hayes made notes of this conversation shortly afterwards. I accept that something like that was said. I do not accept that it demonstrated any remorse.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report states the offender displayed very little “victim empathy” and focussed on his personal circumstances and “perceived maltreatment by the justice system”. While it can safely be assumed that the offender regrets the fact that he was caught and proved to be guilty, I am satisfied that he has no genuine remorse or contrition.
	


Future dangerousness, protection of the community, prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The Crown contends that the protection of the community should be at the forefront of this sentencing exercise and, implicitly at least, submits that the offender represents a future danger to the community. The prosecution relies on three parts of the evidence. First, the pre-sentence report assesses the offender as a “medium to high” risk of re-offending. Second, the criminal record contains offences of violence and sexual deviation. Third, it relies on the facts of this case and in particular the sexual component, the savage nature of the attack and the mutilation of the corpse by fire.
	
	
	Mr Dennis submits that the fact that the offender has not demonstrated remorse for his offending behaviour does not prohibit a finding of positive prospects upon his eventual release and refers to R v Alseedi [2009] NSWCCA 185. He further submits that due to the inevitability of a very lengthy sentence, the offender will be quite old by the time his sentence expires and that his advanced aged will reduce the likelihood that he will be a danger to the community when he is eventually released.
	
	
	As I said in R v Hines (No 3) “it is very difficult when an offender is to be sentenced to an extremely long sentence for a court to come to any conclusions, let alone any certain conclusions, as to the likelihood that they will offend again”. In Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that “a minimum term of eighteen years and six month is of such length as to take the prospects of re-offending in this case beyond even speculation”. In Fardon v Attorney General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575 Kirby J said at [124]:
	


""Experts in law, psychology and criminology have long recognised the unreliability of predictions of criminal dangerousness.""


	
	However, in the same case Gleeson CJ said at [12]:
	


""No doubt, predictions of future danger may be unreliable, but, as the case of Veen shows, they may also be right. Common law sentencing principles ... permit or require such predictions at the time of sentencing, which will often be many years before possible release.""


	
	In Hines (No 3) I referred to the authorities concerning the relevant standard of proof and concluded that it was not a matter in relation to which a sentencing judge was required to apply the criminal standard: see, for example, R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310 and particular the judgment of Handley JA at [40]. I think that the question posed by McCallum J in R v Gittany (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 49 at [58] is the relevant one:
	


""The critical question is whether the prior offences inform the extent to which a sterner sentence may be required in order to meet the objects of sentencing, including deterrence and the protection of the community.""


	
	While the offender has a record including offences of violence, and while the facts of this offence gives rise to legitimate concerns as to his future dangerousness, I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to extend his sentence (or non-parole period) beyond that which is proportionate to the gravity of the crime. By the time he is released, he will have reached, or be approaching, old age. His record is not such that I can conclude that he will be a risk of re-offending at that stage of his life. Plainly, it will be a matter for the parole authorities to consider. He will also be subject to the provisions of Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW).
	
	
	On the other hand, the same evidence leads me to the conclusion that I cannot make a positive finding that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to offend again.
	


The offender’s health


	
	The offender has sworn an affidavit in which he sets out a number of substantial medical conditions that he has suffered over many years. The learned Crown Prosecutor does not dispute the material in the affidavit and acknowledges that, in some instances, it is supported by independent evidence. The offender also relies on a number of extracts from his Justice Health file which goes back to when he was taken into custody (May 2012). Finally, a report was prepared by Dr K Suresh Badami a Clinical Director with Justice Health. In the limited time available to prepare this judgment, it is not possible to detail all of this material. However, I have read and considered all of the material.
	
	
	The material establishes that the offender suffers from significant back pain as a result of an accident at work around 15 years ago. Observing him in the dock in Grafton, it was obvious to me that he was in significant pain at various times during the trial. He says in his affidavit that the most effective medication for his pain is called “Lyrica”. Dr Badami gave evidence that this is a brand name of a drug called Pregabalin. It is not generally provided to inmates for various reasons. It is not on the “formulary” of medications and it must be specially approved. It has not been made available to the accused until the last few weeks. I accept Mr Dennis’ submission that the result is that the offender has endured substantial pain while on remand and that this has made his incarceration to this point more onerous than the average prisoner.
	
	
	The offender also has problems with each of his elbows. There was some evidence of this in the trial. His elbow will “lock” without warning and he then gets a “sharp and severe stabbing pain”. The offender is unaware of any medication that will reduce the pain in his elbow. There is a radiology report dated 29 May 2012 that confirms that there is an “olecranon spur” and “sclerosis on the margin of the radial head” in his right elbow.
	
	
	The offender has suffered from arthritis in his hands, knees, wrists and elbows for more than ten years. He says that the medication he received in custody had no effect on his arthritis. He believes that remaining warm alleviates some of the symptoms. Dr Badami said that there is no scientific or medical research to support this belief and that it is “very anecdotal”. He said “some people will feel warmer and more comfortable and safer in [warmer clothing]”. He says that the medical staff are unwilling or reluctant to recommend that prisoners be provided with such things as thermal underwear or more blankets because such requests are “a Corrective Services issue … entirely in their realm”. He said
	


“It does become a bit embarrassing when we make a recommendation and it is not followed through, then the patient comes back to us and says you made a recommendation why didn’t they give it to us. It puts us in an awkward position.”


	
	It is not for me to comment on the demarcation of responsibilities between Justice Health and Corrective Services, but I accept that the offender’s experience of custody is more onerous as a result of the lack of treatment for his arthritis.
	
	
	The offender has also suffered from shingles while in custody. He was treated for this but remains concerned that it will not be treated promptly in the future. While his concerns may be genuine, there is no evidence to suggest that if the condition recurs it will not be treated promptly and properly by the gaol authorities.
	
	
	Another matter of some concern was Dr Badami’s evidence concerning the availability of physiotherapists in the gaol system. He said there are 11,600 inmates spread over 32 gaols in NSW. There was no evidence of the number of inmates in need of physiotherapy. When asked how many physiotherapists were available across New South Wales, Dr Badami laughed and said “two”. The tone of his response involved an implicit agreement that the resources were insufficient to deal with the number of prisoners and the number of gaols.
	
	
	The Justice Health file is littered with requests by the offender for more medication to deal with his various ailments and his pain. In December 2014 he “threatened self-harm due to extreme pain and not being given extra medication to manage it”.
	


The relevance of the offender’s health to the sentencing exercise.


	
	In spite of the manifest credibility issues that arose in his evidence before the jury, the Crown does not dispute the offender’s evidence as to his health condition and the extent of his pain. The Crown Prosecutor referred to “independent evidence of the existence of his health issues” and said it has “no material that would objectively falsify the subjective levels of pain said to be currently experienced by the offender”. However, the Crown submits that the evidence is not such that it will make any difference to the sentence to be imposed. Senior Counsel says that the onus is on the offender and that he has not discharged the onus.
	
	
	The Crown referred me to the case of R v Smith (1987) 27 A Crim R 315 where King CJ said (at 317):
	


""How far should the new information about the appellant's health affect the matter? The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. III health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health.""


	
	In R v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395 Wood CJ at CL noted that the responsibility for providing adequate care and treatment for prisoners resides in the Corrective Services Authorities and said that it was “only in relatively rare cases that the Smith principle is applicable”. The Crown Prosecutor pointed to the fact that these remarks were picked up in Leighton v R [2010] NSWCCA 280 at [36]. In Leighton v R Price J (with whom Simpson and Howie JJ agreed) also said (at [36]) that:
	


‘Where ill health is considered to be relevant to the determination of sentence, the extent of the mitigation is to be balanced against the seriousness of the offence: R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1.


	
	Price J went on to hold at [38]:
	


“Notwithstanding any treatment that might be provided by Justice Health there is an abundance of evidence, which demonstrates that the applicant’s ill health will make his time in gaol significantly harder. He suffers from chronic osteoarthritis in the hips, knees and shoulders, his mobility is compromised as is his breathing. He experiences chronic neck and back pain and his vision is adversely impacted upon by shingles. He has difficulties dressing himself and standing or sitting for any length of time. The austerity of prison conditions will add to the problems that the applicant has encountered in his daily living”.


	
	Price J concluded that the sentencing Judge fell into error in failing to take into account the applicant’s health in the sentencing exercise. His Honour was of the view that it was entitled to “some weight” and would result in a “modest” mitigation of the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	In my opinion this is a very similar case. I am satisfied that that imprisonment will be “a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health.” I am also satisfied that there is “a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect” on his health. The former consideration is more potent than the latter but both have some application. Because of the objective gravity of the offending, the mitigation to the sentence will be modest. However, I will also consider whether it is a matter that might inform the question of special circumstances (s 44 of the Act) and the length of the appropriate non-parole period.
	


THE PURPOSES OF PUNISHMENT AND THE RELEVANT GUIDEPOSTS TO AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE


	
	I have taken into account the relevant purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), as well as the principles of sentencing established by the common law. The sentence I impose must ensure that the offender is adequately punished and is held accountable for his crime. The sentence must serve to protect the community from the offender. The sentence must denounce his conduct and recognise the harm done to the victim, her family and friends and to the community.
	
	
	The sentence should serve as a deterrent to the offender himself and should send a message to others that crimes such as these will be met with condign punishment. It should act as a deterrent to the commission of crimes of violence against vulnerable people and it should aim to deter alcohol fuelled violence. It is not enough to pay lip service to the principle of general deterrence. It must be reflected in the sentence actually imposed.
	
	
	Another purpose of sentencing is to foster the rehabilitation of the offender. It is difficult to see how the sentence that I will impose will achieve that end. However, that is a consequence of the gravity of the offender’s crime and current sentencing patterns.
	
	
	Murder is the most serious offence known to the criminal law and carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. That penalty will be imposed in the most serious of cases and it is not suggested by the prosecution that this is such a case. Nevertheless, in determining the appropriate sentence, “careful attention” to the maximum penalty is required: see Markarian v the Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [30]-[31].
	
	
	Each of the arson offences carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	There is a standard non-parole period of 20 years for the murder offence. The way in which the standard non-parole period is to be applied was determined by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. Along with the maximum penalty, it is an important statutory guidepost to the seriousness of the offence. However, it is erroneous to commence with the 20 year standard non-parole period and to oscillate up and down based around my assessment of the objective gravity of the offence (comfortably above mid-range) and relevant subjective features (such as the offender’s medical conditions). The correct approach is to synthesise all of the various relevant factors (including the standard non-parole period), to balance the purposes of punishment and to determine the punishment that I consider to be just in the individual circumstances of this case.
	
	
	I have considered the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission. However, the range of sentences there disclosed and the wide diversity of circumstances in which the crime of murder might be committed, means that the statistics are of little, if any, assistance.
	
	
	Mr Dennis has provided me with references to some cases that he says have some common features with the present case. As I understand it, the Crown Prosecutor accepts that these cases are a fair selection. Of course, no two sentencing cases are alike and I must exercise some caution in my approach to those cases. I have considered the sentencing outcomes in those cases as well as a number of other cases decided by members of this Court. That survey leads me to the conclusion that the sentence that I consider to be appropriate does no violence to the public’s legitimate expectation of consistency of punishment.
	
	
	Of course, there is no single, correct sentence and minds may (and often do) differ as to the appropriate length of a sentence.
	
	
	I do not propose to impose the standard non-parole period for the offence of murder in the present case. For the purpose of s 54B(3) of the Act, I record that my reasons for that decision are recorded throughout this judgment. The health of the offender is a particularly important factor. However, I have dealt with that matter in the manner disclosed in this judgment and I have incorporated it into the many features of the case that lead me to the conclusion as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the offender.
	


ACCUMULATION, SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE SENTENCE


	
	Mr Dennis concedes that there must be a degree of accumulation in relation to the sentences to be imposed. Questions of accumulation and concurrency are questions of discretionary judgment. While there are two different victims, in my assessment the two arson offences can appropriately be dealt with by the imposition of concurrent sentences. However, there must be a degree of accumulation between those sentences and the sentence to be imposed on the murder charge. Even though the offences are closely related and the motive for the arson was to cover up the murder, they are two distinct and separate acts of criminality.
	
	
	I have taken into account the principle of totality in determining the degree of partial accumulation. Because of the accumulation, and because the non-parole period for the murder charge will extend far beyond the expiration of the sentences to be imposed for the arson offences, I decline to set a non-parole period in respect of the sentences imposed for the two arson offences.
	
	
	The accumulation of the sentences is itself a matter that would justify a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Act. However, more significant is the hardship of incarceration on this offender arising from his various medical conditions and his chronic (and at times severe) pain symptoms. Ultimately, the parole authorities will determine whether the offender should be released at the expiration of the non-parole period that I will impose. That will turn to a large degree on his progress while in custody and assessments then made as to his prospects of rehabilitation and ability to assimilate back into society without posing a danger or risk to the community. I am conscious not to “double count” the accused’s medical conditions and have carefully considered the appropriate weight to be given to the factor when assessing the total sentence. When adjusting the non-parole period to reflect my finding of special circumstances, I have taken into account the extent to which the matter has operated to mitigate the total sentence.
	
	
	In R v Mastrionardi [2004] NSWCCA 273 Sheller JA (with whom Sperling and Adams JJ agreed) said:
	


“On the other hand his need for protective custody means that any time he spends in prison will be significantly more onerous than otherwise would be the case. There are, it seems to me, special circumstances in that the applicant needs to be kept in strict protection; R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 at 293, 301 and 304 and suffers serious psychological sequelae as a result of the assault upon him in prison. In Astill at 294 Kirby P, after referring to the judgment of Lord Lane CJ in R v Davies; Gorman v R (1978) 68 Crim App R 319 at 322, said:

“But is it clear (and really a matter of ‘common sense’ as the Lord Chief Justice declared) that ordinary sentencing principles would require consideration to be given to the disparity between arduous sentencing conditions and ordinary sentencing conditions.”

Logically, this factor should be brought into account in determining the full term sentence as well as a special circumstance in determining the non-parole period.”


	
	I have applied the same kind of reasoning to the present case. In doing so, I am conscious that I must not count the same matter twice. However, as Mason CJ and McHugh J said in Bugmy v the Queen at 531 “the considerations which a sentencing judge must take into account when fixing a minimum term will be the same as those applicable to setting the head sentence”. Their Honours went on to observe that the weight attached to those factors may differ (see also R v Kwon [2004] NSWCCA 456 at [19]-[21]). I have made a modest adjustment to the total sentence. I could make no more than a modest adjustment due to the seriousness of the crime. Both components of the sentence must denounce the crime and make the offender accountable for his actions. I have also made an adjustment to the length of the non-parole period. In doing so, I have taken into account the adjustment already made to the total sentence. The adjustment to the non-parole reflects my finding of special circumstances. That finding is based on the partial accumulation of sentence and the fact that the offender’s time in custody has been, and will continued to be, more onerous as a result of his medical condition. The offender will be aware that his release at the end of that period will largely be determined by his performance while in custody.

2766819,R v McNeil (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 757,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused, Shaun McNeil, is on trial charged with the murder of Daniel Christie at Kings Cross on 31 December 2013. He was arrested and charged on that date and has been in custody since. The trial commenced with the empanelment of the jury on Monday 1 June 2015.
	
	
	On the third day of the trial (3 June) Mr Smith SC, counsel for the accused, applied for the jury to be discharged because of prejudicial media reporting of the first day of the trial. He foreshadowed the possibility of the application the previous day.
	
	
	After receiving evidence and hearing submissions I refused the application. The following are my reasons.
	


A background of prejudicial pre-trial publicity


	
	The Crown case, very simply, is that the accused assaulted Daniel Christie on New Years' Eve 2013 in Kings Cross by punching him once to the head. As a result of that punch, Mr Christie fell to the ground and suffered catastrophic blunt force trauma causing his death. This tragic event occurred near to the location where a similar death occurred in similar circumstances 18 months earlier: see R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120. The two cases were at the forefront of a lot of media and community discussion about alcohol-fuelled violence, so-called one-punch homicides, and various efforts that should be, and were, made to quell such abhorrent events.
	
	
	It was in this context that there was pre-trial media publicity concerning the accused and his alleged involvement in the death of Mr Christie. This was a principal ground for an application for a trial by judge-alone being made pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). That application was refused by Johnson J on 2 April 2015: R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357. (Paragraph references given below relate to this judgment unless otherwise indicated). His Honour made an order prohibiting publication of the making of the application and the evidence and submissions relating to it until such further order as may be made after completion of the trial. That order was in force at the time I heard this application.
	
	
	The publicity considered in relation to the trial by judge-alone application included images of the accused, details of his criminal history and commentary arising from the public controversy concerning so-called one punch attacks in the Kings Cross area (at [44]). It was contended that such publicity suggested violent and dishonest tendencies on the part of the accused, often linked with inflammatory images of him (at [45]). The Crown acknowledged that there was a substantial volume of such publicity but emphasised that it occurred very largely in the period between January and March 2014; a fact that Johnson J accepted (at [47]; [71]).
	
	
	There was no dispute in the trial by judge-alone application that the earlier publicity was prejudicial to the accused. His Honour determined, however, that a significant period of time had elapsed since the majority of it had appeared and ameliorative steps could be taken to alleviate the possibility of potential and actual jurors locating it on the internet. In relation to potential jurors, an order was made prohibiting publication of the accused’s name up until a jury was empanelled. This was perceived to minimise the risk of jury panel members viewing such material because of any publicity given to the imminent trial. In relation to actual jurors, his Honour assumed (rightly) that the trial judge would give directions to the jury concerning media publicity upon empanelment and through the course of the trial. Such directions would include reference to s 68C of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) which renders it a criminal offence for a juror to make inquiries (such as searching on the internet) in relation to the accused or anything relevant to the trial.
	
	
	Before empanelling the jury on Monday 1 June 2015, I gave a more lengthy explanation than usual to the panel members about the need for objectivity and impartiality (T1-4). I referred to this case having been the subject of a degree of publicity and told them that it was essential that jurors be able to put aside any recollection they may have of such matters. The jury panel were taken elsewhere in the complex in order for panel members to have time to reflect upon what I had said. I indicated that if any of them considered that they should not be a potential member of the jury in this case for any reason, including an inability, or possible inability, to completely put aside any recollection of prior publicity, they would be automatically excused without any questions being asked simply by indicating that fact to the Sheriff's officers.
	
	
	I was informed that 8 out of the 56 members of the jury panel were excused as a result of that process. I was confident that the remaining panel members who returned to the court room for the empanelment process considered themselves to be able to decide the case objectively and only on the basis of the evidence presented during the trial. In short, these were people who took the role of being a juror generally, and the need for objectivity and impartiality in particular, seriously.
	
	
	There had been a pre-trial hearing on the Wednesday before the trial began at which a number of issues were discussed. One of them was my proposal to revoke the non-publication order made by Johnson J concerning the name of the accused immediately upon empanelment of the jury. Mr Smith raised two issues relating to that; one was a concern as to what might happen if for some reason a jury was empanelled but had to be discharged and then a new jury empanelled. In the Crown Prosecutor’s response he said:
	


“The second part is the previous reporting by the media. I think I was fairly candid in what I said to Justice Johnson about some of it. Some of it ought not be done and if the media are present at the opening of the trial it might be useful for your Honour to explain to them that there is a necessity of keeping this jury and that can only be done if reporting is done sensibly.”


	
	I responded as follows:
	


“Mr Crown, my view is that the media are well aware of what they can and can't report during the course of a trial. They don't need me to tell them that. They have their [own] lawyers and experienced journalists know the boundaries all too well.”


	
	There were quite a number of journalists present in court at the time these things were said.
	
	
	On Monday 1 June there were also a significant number of journalists present in court whilst the jury panel members were absent considering what I had said about the need for objectivity and impartiality. I took the opportunity to deal with a number of issues, including confirming that I would revoke the non-publication order made by Johnson J concerning the name of the accused. In that context I said this:
	


“For the benefit of any members of media who were not present in Court last Wednesday, some concern was expressed as to the reporting of the trial in the light of some of the reporting of the matter generally, particularly, soon after the event in question occurred on New Years’ Eve 2013. In the application before Johnson J, there was reference to a number of items of media reporting, reporting of matters generally relating to the accused that were asserted to be of highly prejudicial nature.

Can I just make clear that the Court remains concerned that the reporting of events during the trial be in accordance with well accepted boundaries in relation to the reporting of criminal trials. We don't want anything to risk the smooth running of the trial.”


	
	Following empanelment, I made some opening remarks to the jury. In the course of this I reiterated the fundamental importance of deciding the case upon the evidence and nothing else. I also informed them of the absolute prohibition on making inquiries about anything to do with the people involved in the case, including the accused, or the issues in the trial itself.
	
	
	Each member of the jury was given a document setting out some further directions supplementing those I had given orally in my opening remarks (MFI.1). The directions included that they should put aside any past or contemporaneous media reporting.
	
	
	Before the jury left at the end of the first day I gave further directions to the jury about the need for them to decide the case uninfluenced by other things such as by speaking about it to persons who were not fellow jurors. I reminded them about the requirement that they not make any inquiries for themselves about things to do with the trial and indicated that this included going to Kings Cross in order to make an assessment of the crime scene. I also specifically directed them to be wary of anything they saw or heard by way of reporting of the trial, given that such reports would by necessity be selective and probably based upon what a journalist thought might be interesting to the general public. I reminded the jury that it was for them to determine what evidence was important and it was for them to decide the case on the whole of the evidence.
	


Media reports following the first day of the trial


	
	An affidavit by the accused's solicitor was read in support of the application to discharge the jury. It referred to photographs of the accused that were published following the first day of the trial.
	
	
	There was a news report concerning the trial on Channel 7. A number of still images of the accused were displayed including the following:
	







	
	The report included a fifth picture which is not available in a format that can be incorporated in this judgment. It showed the accused holding a jug of blue liquid, probably alcoholic, while appearing to be dancing.
	
	
	Yahoo7 News and News.com.au published the following photograph:
	





	
	Channel 10 aired what it called a ""Newsbyte"" (which may well have been a synopsis of a longer story appearing on its main news program). It included the following image:
	





	
	Dailytelegraph.com.au published this photograph:
	





	
	An article published in the Daily Telegraph (2 June 2015, p. 16) included a cropped version of 4th photograph above.
	
	
	Of course, none of these photographs are, or will be, part of the evidence in the trial. They are not relevant to any issue.
	


Submissions


	
	Mr Smith submitted that the publication of these photographs was so prejudicial that neither could he make any submission to the jury that could address any thoughts that jurors might have about them and nor could any judicial direction adequately overcome it. It was submitted that the photographs directly bear upon the two issues in the trial: the accused's use of violence and his tolerance to the effects of alcohol.
	
	
	It was submitted that by showing that the accused appeared to be a person who consumed alcohol on other occasions, perhaps to a generous extent, the photographs could suggest that he was a person with a significant tolerance to alcohol. Mr Smith referred to the Crown's intention to call Dr Judith Perl, a pharmacologist, who would give an opinion that the accused was a person who had ""a very high level of tolerance"". That opinion is relevant to whether the accused had the required intent to establish the charge of murder and it is challenged by the defence. (As events transpired, the Crown did not call Dr Perl.)
	
	
	It was submitted that by showing that the accused appeared to have engaged in violent conduct in the past (the photograph of him with the torn shirt shown by Channel 10) it appeared that the accused was a person who was generally a violent man.
	
	
	The photograph that showed a large tattoo of the name ""Christie"" on the accused's forearm (“the Christie tattoo photograph”) would lead the jury to speculate that the name was a reference to the deceased. Mr Smith accepted my characterisation of this photograph (see below).
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there was no evidence that any juror had seen or heard of any of the photographs. He referred to my having directed the jury to ignore any media publicity. He also referred to my direction that jurors should report any irregularity, such as the inability of a juror to be impartial, and noted that no such report had been forthcoming.
	
	
	It was submitted that I should take into account that it was common ground between the parties that if the jury were to be discharged, a further trial with a jury should be deferred for a period of time to allow the prejudicial effect of the publication of the photographs of the accused to subside. A consequence of that would be that the recollection of eyewitnesses would suffer.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown Prosecutor suggested that before I contemplated discharging the jury I should exercise the power provided in s 55D of the Jury Act to examine jurors as to whether they had seen the photographs and, if so, whether they felt that their ability to be impartial had been compromised.
	
	
	In reply, Mr Smith submitted that questioning members of the jury was not practical and had no utility.
	


Determination

The Crown submissions


	
	I accepted that there was no evidence that any juror had seen or heard of the photographs. However, it may be readily assumed that there is a high possibility of this, given the widespread nature of their publication.
	
	
	It is true that I directed the jury to ignore media publicity but I did not direct them to completely avoid it. My direction was more concerned with the possibility of selective, or out of context, reporting of evidence given in the trial rather than with prejudicial material, which I did not anticipate would be published.
	
	
	It is also true that no report had been made by any juror concerning the inability of a fellow jury to be impartial. However, I do not believe that is any guide as to whether any jurors had seen the offending material.
	
	
	I am not convinced that consideration of the likely consequences of a discharge of the jury is a significant matter in the determination of this application. If I were of the view that the fairness of the trial was impermissibly impacted by the publication of the photographs of the accused, then a discharge of the jury would be the only option.
	
	
	Finally, I was not persuaded that questioning the jury was practical in the circumstances.
	


Assessment of the published photographs


	
	The photographs to which my attention was drawn were taken of the accused on various occasions prior to 31 December 2013. (He has been in custody since his arrest on that night.) They may be perceived to portray him as someone who has quite a few tattoos and drinks alcohol.
	
	
	The Christie tattoo photograph is concerning. I was told that “Christie” was the name of a former partner and so it is sheer coincidence that the name coincides with the surname of the deceased. There are a considerable number of publicly available (on the internet) photographs of the accused. But out of all of them, someone chose to publish the Christie tattoo photograph. The inference is available that it was selected because of the name in the tattoo. It would be open to an uninformed viewer to think that having a prominent tattoo of the name of the deceased indicates that the accused took some pride in having caused his death and that the tattoo was obtained as some sort of celebratory trophy. A view is available that the photograph was deliberately selected to maximise the prejudicial impact it may have. I cannot conceive that the person responsible thought that there was no chance of a juror seeing it (if he or she had bothered to give the possibility any thought).
	
	
	The photograph of the accused wearing what appears to be a torn shirt with much of his torso exposed gives the impression that he has been involved in a fight. It was this photograph that prompted Mr Smith's well-justified concern that it suggested that the accused was a man prone to violent behaviour.
	
	
	In relation to photographs showing the accused drinking alcohol, there is merit in Mr Smith's concern that they are capable of conveying an impression that the accused habitually drank alcohol, and to excess, and that therefore he was a man who had developed a significant tolerance to its effects. This would render it more likely the jury would accept the disputed opinion of Dr Perl that I have referred to above (which, ultimately, was not before the jury).
	


The issues in the trial


	
	There is a single issue in this trial: is the accused guilty of murder or manslaughter? Put more directly and specifically: can the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the punch, the accused intended to cause really serious bodily harm to Mr Christie?
	
	
	That this is the issue was made apparent from the time the accused, on arraignment in front of the jury panel, pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter (which the Crown did not accept in satisfaction of the indictment). It was made abundantly clear when Mr Smith opened to the jury and told them that there was no dispute that the accused punched Mr Christie and that the only issue was his intent.
	
	
	It is appropriate to note as well that Mr Smith told the jury that there was no dispute that the accused had earlier punched a teenager to the ground and then kicked him. He also referred to the accused having punched Peter Christie after he had assaulted Daniel Christie.
	
	
	What this means is that there is no issue before the jury that the accused acted violently towards the deceased and others. A single photograph of the accused with a torn shirt suggestive of having been in a fight does not say very much, if anything, about any propensity he might have to behave violently. It would be perverse, in my view, to draw that inference just from that photograph. There is enough evidence about the accused's behaviour on the night of 31 December 2013 to draw a conclusion that he was readily prepared to act violently. He concedes as much himself.
	
	
	Further, even if an inference was drawn that a person had a propensity to behave violently, that says nothing about whether that person intended on a specific occasion of being violent to inflict grievous bodily harm as opposed to some lesser degree of harm.
	
	
	As to the sub-issue of alcohol tolerance, there is no dispute that the accused was affected to some extent by alcohol. The only issue in this respect is the extent of any tolerance the accused had to the effects of alcohol. Photographs showing him drinking alcohol on other occasions say very little about the extent of his drinking behaviour. The photographs were likely taken in social settings, such as parties and other gatherings where it is unremarkable for people to drink alcohol. It would not be at all sensible to draw a conclusion that a person who drinks on such occasions is such a regular and heavy drinker that they have a high tolerance for its effects. I was not prepared to assume that the jury was not comprised of sensible people. (And they certainly do not look like they are; quite the opposite.)
	


The Christie tattoo photograph


	
	The Christie tattoo photograph is the most concerning. It is open to the interpretation I have described above. But such an interpretation would be completely wrong because the tattoo existed before the accused ever crossed paths with the deceased and his brother. Anyone who is aware of this would easily see that the name in the tattoo is just a coincidence and is of no significance. For this reason I concluded that an appropriate direction to the jury would suffice to overcome any potential for prejudice.
	


Expectation that jurors will adhere to their oaths and comply with judicial directions


	
	It is convenient to refer to a case cited by Johnson J in R v McNeil because it supports a proposition that judges in this era need to be robust in not readily assuming that juries easily succumb to prejudice as a result of media publicity.
	
	
	In R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258, Spigelman CJ said:
	


“[17] I have had occasion to summarise the relevant case law in the following manner, applicable to the present case, in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344:

‘[103] There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them. In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.’

[18] There are now numerous judicial statements as to the validity of such an approach.

[19] Going back, for example, as Gleeson CJ said in R v VPH (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 March 1994, unreported) at 7:

‘The jury will be given appropriate directions to confine their attention to the evidence that is put before them. Our entire system of the administration of criminal justice depends upon the assumption that jurors understand and comply with directions of that character.’

[20] Furthermore, as McHugh JA said in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425

‘[31] … Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.’

[21] The perspective that jurors properly perform their task, are true to their oaths and comply with a trial judge’s directions has repeatedly been applied in appellate courts over recent years. (See R v Milat; R v Bell; Long v R; R v Richards [1999] NSWCCA 114; (1999) 107 A Crim R 318; R v Dudko; R v D’Arcy; R v Burrell supra.)


	
	I accept that there can be cases in which such publicity can be extreme to the point of being very difficult for anyone to completely put aside. But the situation presented in this case cannot be so characterised.
	
	
	The photographs of the accused that are the basis of this application to discharge the jury should never have been published after he was charged; and certainly not during the course of his trial. The inference is available that publication was designed to present the accused in the worst possible light. This is particularly evident by the contrasting photographs, often appearing in the same news reports, of the deceased.
	
	
	In the end, whilst I acknowledge that reasonable minds may differ about this, I was satisfied that, with an appropriate direction being given to the jury, the risk of impermissible prejudice could be significantly and sufficiently ameliorated.
	


Conclusion


	
	The photographs of the accused should not have been published.
	
	
	The motivation of the persons who are responsible for their publication, on the basis of inferences open to be drawn from the material before me, appear to be highly questionable (and perhaps that is an understatement). The potential for impermissible prejudice to the accused’s trial for an offence of the utmost seriousness was very real.
	
	
	Whilst I determined not to discharge the jury, the publications have impacted upon the trial. It resulted in a need for defence lawyers to ask (appropriately) for time out to investigate the issue. Half a day’s sitting time was lost on that account. It occupied hearing time in dealing with the evidence and submissions in relation to the application which certainly cannot be said to have lacked merit. It occupied time by lawyers on both sides considering the issues when they should have been devoting their time to the issues in the trial itself. And it distracted me in having to consider and determine the matter and formulate my reasons for determination. It required me to spend some time giving the jury a direction about the matter and likely distracted the jury for some short time in considering what I had said. After announcing the refusal of the application to discharge the jury it necessitated the making of a non-publication order designed to prevent any further similar publications.
	
	
	Intrusion of the media into the conduct of a serious criminal trial for highly questionable reasons is intolerable. I propose to refer the matter to the Attorney-General for consideration of whether any proceedings should be taken as a result.
	


Order


	
	The order I made was that the application for the discharge of the jury was refused.

	HALL J:
	


Introduction


	
	The applicant, Kangmin Bae, presently aged 34 years, was indicted on five counts under the Criminal Code (Cth) arising out of the importation of various quantities of border controlled drugs into Australia.
	
	
	On 12 January 2012, he entered guilty pleas to four counts under s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (counts No 1, 2, 4 and 5 on the indictment) in that he imported a commercial quantity of a substance, being a border controlled drug, he having aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of the offences by another or others. The prescribed maximum penalty for an offence under that provision is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of 7,500 penalty units.
	
	
	On the lastmentioned date the applicant also entered a guilty plea to count 3 on the indictment, being an offence under s 307.2(1) of the same Act, namely, an offence of importing a marketable quantity of a substance being a border controlled drug (heroin), he having aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of the offence by another or others. The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of 5,000 penalty units.
	
	
	On 4 April 2013 the applicant was sentenced by Hock DCJ.
	


The Offences


	
	Particulars of the offences charged are as follows:
	


Offence 1: s.307.1(1) Criminal Code with subsection 11.2(1) Criminal Code – aid and abet the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine (3.713 kilograms – pure)

Offence 2: s.307.1(1) Criminal Code with subsection 11.2(1) Criminal Code – aid and abet the importation of a commercial quantity of methamphetamine (2.266 kilograms – pure)

Offence 3: s.307.2(1) Criminal Code with subsection 11.2(1) Criminal Code – aid and abet the importation of a marketable quantity of heroin (0.650 kilograms – pure)

Offence 4: s.307.1(1) Criminal Code with subsection 11.2(1) Criminal Code – aid and abet the importation of a commercial quantity of methamphetamine (2.243 kilograms – pure)

Offence 5: s.307.1(1) Criminal Code with subsection 11.2(1) Criminal Code – aid and abet the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine (4.021 kilograms – pure).

	The overall effective sentence, accordingly, was a term of imprisonment of 20 years. The sentences as noted above commenced on 19 April 2010 and are to expire on 18 April 2030, with an effective non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 19 April 2010 to expire on 18 April 2022.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The applicant in seeking leave to appeal the sentences imposed upon him relied upon the following grounds of appeal:
	


1.   Her Honour erred by taking into account, in assessing the applicant’s role, his use of innocent agents;

2.   Her Honour erred in accumulating the individual sentences to the degree she did;

3.   The individual sentences, the overall head sentence and non-parole period were manifestly excessive.

Evidence on Sentencing


	
	The following documentary evidence was admitted at the sentencing hearing:
	


Crown Exhibits

Exhibit A: Statement of Facts dated 17 November 2011

Exhibit B: Summary of DHL Consignments and Associated Evidence (set out in a table)

Defence Exhibits

Exhibit 1: Psychologist Report of Tim Watson-Munro dated 14 February 2013

Exhibit 2: Affidavit of Martin Ricci dated 15 February 2013

The Crown Case on Sentence


	
	The relevant factual matters, including in particular the events between 23 October 2009 and 8 April 2010, were set out in considerable detail in the Statement of Facts (Exhibit A) which was cross-referenced to a Table, (Table 1) being the “Summary of DHL Consignments and Associated Evidence” (Exhibit B).
	
	
	The Statement of Facts noted that the applicant was the holder of a Korean passport. He had no record of criminal convictions in Australia or in South Korea.
	
	
	The Statement of Facts recorded that in the period 23 October 2009 to 8 April 2010, 64 cardboard boxes were consigned by DHL Express courier at Toronto, Canada, to 10 different addresses in Sydney. In total, 45 boxes were recovered by police at various locations. Eighteen boxes contained border controlled drugs. Details of the consignments were set out in the Statement of Facts at [44].
	
	
	In para [7] of the Statement of Facts it was stated:
	


“The contents of most of the boxes were described on the corresponding consignment notes as motor vehicle wheel rims of various types. Several boxes were said to contain clothing, books and personal effects. The boxes were shipped to Australia by air freight as 24 separate consignments. The identity of the shippers varied although (i) most purported to be an entity connected with the sale of car wheels; (ii) many ostensibly different shippers provided identical contact names and telephone numbers. In the case of all but one of the consignments the freight costs exceeded the value of the goods by a significant factor. Many of the consignments nominated ‘Min’ or ‘Jake’ as the contact person for the receiver, names which the offender was also known to use.” (AB 61)


	
	There was evidence linking the applicant, directly or indirectly, to each of the consignee addresses: Statement of Facts at [5].
	
	
	The applicant entered Australia at Sydney on 11 December 2009 on a flight from Toronto. The Crown contended:
	



	
	That he did so in furtherance of a scheme to import border controlled drugs from Canada, namely, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and possibly other drugs by means of the boxes shipped by DHL.
	
	
	His role was specifically to coordinate the receipt and the collection of the boxes, their safe storage and the subsequent transfer of the narcotics for distribution and sale.
	
	
	The narcotics were contained in “Foodsaver” brand heat sealed plastic bags concealed between the surfaces of the two inner cardboard flaps that constituted the base of each box: Statement of Facts at [11].
	



	
	Facts relating to the consignment of drugs and associated investigations were conveniently summarised in the Crown’s Written Submissions dated 15 April 2015 at [13]-[17] which I reproduce below:
	


“13.   The applicant lived at an address in Strathfield for a period of time beginning shortly after his arrival in Australia. Four consignments totaling 10 boxes were sent to this address. He moved to 66/230 Elizabeth Street Surry Hills in February 2010. Two boxes in one consignment were sent to this address. The applicant rented a storage unit in Burwood for the safe storage of the consignments and narcotics concealed within them. He procured Han and Yoon to receive consignments at their respective addresses in Bunn Street Pyrmont and Murray Street Pyrmont. He also procured a person named Tjin Ow to receive consignments at his address in Killara. Four consignments comprising 11 boxes were shipped to Han’s address. Three consignments comprising 11 boxes were shipped to Ow’s address. Six boxes were shipped to Yoon’s address. Han and Ow helped transfer some boxes into the applicant’s possession and Ow telephoned DHL about the consignment addressed to Yoon’s address at the request of the applicant. Boxes were also consigned to other addresses. These included the office premises of the Korean Student Agency at 3/363 Pitt Street Sydney. Seven boxes in three consignments were delivered to this address. Han and Ow helped the applicant shift these boxes to the applicant’s premises in Surry Hills.

14.   The agreed statement of facts summarised the ultimate position regarding the consignments as follows: “In summary 64 boxes were despatched at Toronto and imported into Australia during the period 23 October 2009 to 8 April 2010. In total 45 boxes were recovered at various locations. Eighteen boxes contained border controlled drugs concealed between the cardboard surfaces of the two inner flaps comprising the base of the box. The two inner cardboard flaps in the base of the 27 remaining recovered boxes had been cut off and removed. A number of intact flaps that had been cut off were found to contain narcotic substances concealed between the surfaces of the cardboard. Several loose bags containing drugs were also found at the offender’s Elizabeth Street apartment.” [AB 66]

15.   A total of 21 of the 45 recovered boxes were found by AFP agents during a search of the applicant’s premises at Surry Hills on 19 April 2010.

16.   The drug seizures underpinning the five counts against the applicant in the indictment were as follows:

Count 1

On 19 April 2010 AFP agents executing a search warrant at the applicant’s Surry Hills premises found 6 boxes which had within the flaps at the base of each a total of 5.909kg of cocaine (3.713kg pure).

Count 2

On 19 April 2010 AFP agents executing a search warrant at the applicant’s Surry Hills premises found within the flaps of 2 boxes as well as in some loose bags a total of 2.945kg of methamphetamine (2.266kg pure).

Count 3

On 19 April 2010 AFP agents executing a search warrant at the applicant’s Surry Hills premises found within some loose cardboard flaps and loose bags a total of 1.94kg of heroin (0.65kg pure).

Count 4

On 16 April 2010 AFP agents executing a search warrant at Han’s Bunn Street Pyrmont premises found 4 boxes which had been delivered to that address on 1 March 2010. The cardboard flaps of the boxes concealed a total of 2.926kg of methamphetamine (2.243kg pure).

Count 5

On 13 April 2010 Customs officers found within the cardboard flaps of the 6 boxes consigned to Yoon’s address a total of 5.849kg of cocaine (4.021kg pure). A simulated delivery of these was effected by AFP agents to Yoon’s Murray Street, Pyrmont address on 16 April 2010.

17.   On sentence the prosecution relied upon the evidence of the finding of the 27 boxes from which the flaps had been removed and the sending of the additional 19 unrecovered boxes (in which it could be inferred drugs were imported) to show that the conduct forming the subject of the charges in the indictment was not isolated, but was part of a well-organised scheme for the importation of illegal drugs into Australia. [AB 29, AB 56]

The Sentencing Hearing


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. The report of Mr Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist, dated 14 February 2013 was as earlier noted, tendered on behalf of the applicant and the affidavit of Martin Ricci affirmed 15 February 2013 was also read. Mr Ricci was the applicant’s solicitor. His affidavit provided evidence as to the circumstances and events that elapsed prior to the applicant entering his pleas of guilty to the counts in the indictment.
	
	
	The sentencing judge, her Honour Judge Hock, set out in significant detail relevant factual matters concerning the offences. Her Honour’s sentencing remarks set out, inter alia, the facts referred to in the Crown’s Written Submissions at [14] and [15].
	
	
	Her Honour incorporated into the Remarks on Sentence a table which summarised quantitative and qualitative details and other information concerning the drugs seized by police (ROS at p 12). That table is reproduced below:

	The Statement of Agreed Facts recorded the following:
	


[46]   The prosecution relies on tendency and coincidence reasoning to prove that (i) the offender intentionally aided and abetted the importation of the border controlled drugs listed above; (ii) the remaining 27 recovered boxes had been utilised to import approximately 25 kg of border controlled drugs consisting of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin and possibly other narcotic substances and that the offender was also knowingly implicated in that activity; (iii) the remaining 19 unrecovered boxes had been utilised to import approximately 15 kgs of border controlled drugs of an unidentified type and that the offender was in addition knowingly implicated in that activity.

[47]   On the assumption that each box contained approximately 960 gm of narcotic substances the total quantity of mixed narcotic substances imported by means of the 24 consignments comprising 64 boxes would have been approximately 60 kg.” (AB 66)


	
	In the Remarks on Sentence her Honour stated:
	


“As to the offender’s role, as outlined in the facts, he played a very important role in these importations of border controlled drugs into Australia. While he was not the overall principal of this operation, he was the person trusted to coordinate the arrival and receipt of these drugs in Sydney. His part in the operation required a considerable degree of planning and preparation and included the offender approaching completely innocent people to provide their addresses for receipt of the boxes.

The counts on the indictment are not isolated but instances of a well‑organised scheme for importation of these three different illegal substances into Australia. The total pure weight of the drugs recovered is 12.893 kilograms, almost 13 kilograms.

As the facts outline, unfortunately most of these consignments were successfully imported into Australia. While there is no evidence of financial reward, the offender was clearly involved for considerable financial gain. The sentences to be imposed must deter foreign nationals in general and this offender in particular, from engaging in offences such as these.” (ROS 14)


	
	Her Honour then proceeded to deal with the matters that were relevant to the applicant’s subjective case. It was noted that he was an intelligent man, an attribute he employed in committing what the sentencing judge referred to as very serious offences: ROS 16. Her Honour noted that the applicant had expressed remorse and shame to the psychologist and that his pleas were taken as indicating an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice: ROS 16.
	
	
	Her Honour further observed that whilst the applicant was to be sentenced for each individual count, there had to be some accumulation of the sentences “… to reflect his overall criminality and of course to reflect that each offence was not isolated”: ROS 16.
	


Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Mr Nash of counsel who appeared on behalf of the applicant in this Court provided detailed written submissions dated 12 November 2014. These were supplemented by oral submissions at the hearing.
	


(i) Use of Innocent Agents.


	
	Mr Nash extracted relevant submissions and exchanges made during the course of submissions before the sentencing judge bearing upon this ground at [15]-[17] of his written submissions.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 1 – “use of innocent agents” – it was submitted that the extracted passages indicated that the sentencing judge took into account a matter that was considered to have increased the seriousness of the applicant’s offending, namely the use by the applicant of “innocent agents”.
	
	
	The submission for the applicant was that there was no direct or explicit evidence admitted in the sentencing proceedings that established that the applicant had solicited the addresses of completely innocent people, or otherwise used such people, to facilitate the importations in relation to which he was charged.
	
	
	At most, any evidence on this question was said to have been “equivocal and very limited”: Written Submissions on Behalf of the Applicant at [37].
	
	
	It was further submitted that the evidence did not identify which individuals, if any, the applicant dealt with to arrange the use of specified premises, or what the dealings with the agents were, or what the background of any individual he was said to have dealt with might have been.
	
	
	It was submitted that the objective seriousness of the offences should have been assessed without regard to the applicant’s claimed use of innocent agents to aid the importation of the drugs.
	


(2) Accumulation


	
	In relation to Ground 2 it was submitted, in effect, that the degree of the accumulation of the sentences and the sentencing judge’s findings relevant to the issue of accumulation ought to be viewed in the context of the Crown’s submissions at the sentencing hearing on that issue: Written Submissions on Behalf of the Applicant at [37]. Passages from the transcript were set out in that paragraph of the submissions.
	
	
	It was noted in this respect that the Crown’s submissions referred to the fact that the five offences committed by the applicant were “separate and distinct offences”, and that this was then followed by another Crown submission that they “formed part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of the same criminality” and that this was contradictory.
	
	
	The submission for the applicant was that a proper construction of the temporal context in which the offences were committed supported a greater degree of concurrency. It was submitted in this respect:
	


“… the facts made it clear that all were committed in the context of a single enterprise and that all occurred within a relatively short period of time …They [the importations] were substantially contemporaneous, had features in common, and arose in the course of one episode. These features all pointed towards a greater degree of concurrency rather than additional accumulation …” (Applicant’s Written Submissions at [39])


	
	It was also submitted that the sentencing judge had had regard to the fact that the offences were “not isolated” in the assessment of both objective seriousness as well as when deciding the degree of accumulation between the sentences imposed for each. To do so was said to involve “double counting”: Written Submissions on behalf of the Applicant at [40].
	
	
	Finally, in relation to this ground, reference was made to the sentencing judge’s observation that there had to be accumulation to reflect “… his overall criminality and of course to reflect that each offence was not isolated” (ROS 16)
	
	
	It was also submitted that it was not appropriate to take into account the “overall criminality” by reference to multiple allegations that related to uncharged matters. It was contended that her Honour fell into error by doing so.
	


(iii) Manifest Excess


	
	It was noted that taking into account the discount of 15% for the applicant’s guilty plea, the starting point for the individual sentences for the s 307.1(1) offences was just over 11 years 9 months. For the sentence imposed in relation to the offence the subject of Count 3 the starting point was said to be just under 5 years and 11 months: Written Submissions on Behalf of the Applicant at [46].
	
	
	The written submissions for the applicant in relation to Ground 3 acknowledged, in a general way, the limitations on a comparative analysis of sentencing cases for the purpose of demonstrating manifest excess in relation to a particular sentence.
	
	
	By reference to categories or groups of cases referred to in DPP v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1, it was submitted:
	


“45.   Notwithstanding those limitations, characteristics of the first 3 groups are of relevance to assessing the appropriateness of the head sentence and non-parole period imposed upon the applicant. Characteristics of the fourth group are relevant to an assessment of the individual sentences, particularly those imposed in relation to the s.307.1(1) offences (Counts 1,2,4 and 5).

…

48.   When considered in isolation the s.307.1(1) offences are akin to the cases within the fourth category. Neither the weights involved nor the roles described, albeit that the applicant must be regarded as at least ‘an overseer’, are inconsistent with the offences of the applicant. The quantities of the drugs in each of the s.307.1(1) counts were between 1 and 5 kilograms.”


	
	The submissions for the applicant accordingly centred upon an analysis which was to a large extent based upon the grouping of cases concerned with the importation of commercial quantities of narcotics as discussed in DPP v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [207]-[215] and the decision of this Court in R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65; (2011) 205 A Crim R 429. Further reference to these cases is made below.
	
	
	It was submitted for the applicant:
	


“59.   In short, and recognising the limitations of comparative analysis, the cases discussed in De La Rosa and Holland when looked at against the facts of this matter support the conclusion that both the overall head sentence and non-parole period imposed on the applicant were manifestly excessive.”


	
	In addition based on an analysis in the submissions of recent cases which were said to provide a comparative analysis of sentences, the sentences in them were relied upon to support the submission that the applicant’s sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	It was accordingly submitted for the applicant that this Court should conclude that the sentences were affected by appellable error and that other sentences were warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	In respect of Grounds 1 and 2, if either ground was upheld, it was noted that the Court would receive any additional material in the exercise of the sentencing discretion afresh: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37 at [42]-[43].
	
	
	If Ground 2 was upheld, then, it was submitted, the Court would proceed to resentence so as to reduce the sentence: Written Submissions on Behalf of the Applicant at [62].
	


Crown Submissions

Ground 1


	
	The Crown noted that in accordance with s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) the sentencing judge was required to take into account a number of matters as are relevant and known to the court including:
	


(a)   the nature and circumstances of the offence;

…

(c)   if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character – that course of conduct;


	
	In relation to this ground it was contended that her Honour was required to take into account, as a part of the nature and circumstances of the offences, that an aspect of the offending concerned the applicant having approached completely innocent people to provide their addresses for the receipt of the boxes containing the prohibited drugs.
	
	
	It was noted that her Honour did not quantify the extent to which this aspect was taken into account nor, it was contended, was her Honour obliged to do so: Crown Written Submissions at [22].
	
	
	Generally speaking, the Crown submitted, offending conduct that involves the use of innocent and unwitting third parties stands in a different context to offending conduct involving only the offender. In this respect it was argued that, amongst other matters, the use of innocent persons suggested a determination of one who is prepared to compromise and prejudice the interests of third parties in exercising the criminal scheme and it demonstrates the extent of planning involved in the offending conduct: Crown Written Submissions at [23].
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that it was not correct to say that there was no direct or indirect evidence on this issue, referring in this regard to the analysis in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the table of consignments, Exhibit B.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown sought to support its submissions primarily by reference to the person, Ow, who the applicant procured to receive boxes, the Crown also argued that it was implicit in the Agreed Facts that the applicant utilised the Pitt Street premises of a specified student agency.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Crown submitted no error had been demonstrated in the finding of fact as to “innocent agents” nor any error as to the weight that the sentencing judge gave to that matter.
	


Ground 2


	
	The Crown in its submissions relied upon the well-established principle that questions of the degree of accumulation and concurrency are matters for sentencing discretion. Reference was made to the recent decision in Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 25 (Hamill J at [43], Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing).
	
	
	The Crown submission was, in essence, that in the absence of any identifiable error of principle in the sentencing judgment in this case, this Court would not intervene.
	
	
	In relation to the question of structuring of sentences for multiple offences the Crown relied upon the decisions of this Court in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]; R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52] and Sabra v R [2015] NSWCCA 38 at [59], [62] in relation to the relevant principles to be applied.
	
	
	The Crown contended that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge, taking into account the extent of the accumulation of sentences, were consistent with the principles as discussed and enunciated in those authorities.
	
	
	The five offences for which the applicant was sentenced, the Crown contended, while falling within the one overall enterprise, were nonetheless distinct in a number of respects. These included the timing of the offences, the substances to which they related and the locations where the substances were found: Crown Written Submissions at [33].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that case law authority established that the fact that distinct offences fall within one larger overall criminal enterprise does not preclude some accumulation of sentences for the individual offences: Crown Written Submissions at [34].
	
	
	In respect of the submission as to the “uncharged” criminal conduct, the Crown observed that the sentencing judge in stating that the effective overall sentence was “of course to reflect that each offence was not isolated” (ROS at 16), was not referring to uncharged criminal conduct. The Crown submission on that point was:
	


“…she was referring to the five offences for which the applicant was being sentenced and, by reference to the principle of totality and to the obvious fact that there were five offences, those offences individually were not isolated. No double-counting or impermissible consideration occurred.” (Crown Written Submissions at [36])


	
	The Crown further submitted that the fixing of a single non-parole period of 12 years was consistent with what was said to be a carefully applied and principled approach: Crown Written Submissions at [37].
	
	
	The Crown identified the following matters as relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences:
	


“(a)   The weight of the drugs imported. The commercial quantity of cocaine is 2 kilograms. The pure quantity imported in count 1 was approaching twice that threshold and in count 5 just over twice. The commercial quantity of methamphetamine is 0.75 kilograms. The quantity of pure methamphetamine covered by counts 2 and 4 was three times this threshold. The marketable quantity of heroin is 2 grams. The pure quantity of heroin imported in respect of count 3 was 325 times this amount.

(b)   The total pure weight of the drugs recovered was 12.893 kilograms.

(c)   The maximum penalty for counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 was life imprisonment and or a fine of 7,500 penalty units. The maximum penalty for count 3 was 25 years imprisonment and or a fine of 5,000 penalty units.

(d)   The applicant’s role, as outlined in the agreed statement of facts was a very important one. Though not the overall principal, he was the person trusted to coordinate the arrival and receipt of the drugs in Sydney. His part in the operation required a considerable degree of planning and preparation.

(e)   The applicant’s role included him “approaching completely innocent people to provide their addresses for receipt of the boxes”.

(f)   The counts on the indictment were not isolated “but instances of a well organised scheme for importation of these three different illegal substances into Australia”.

(g)   Though there was no evidence of financial reward, the applicant “was clearly involved for considerable financial gain”.

(h)   The sentences imposed needed to deter foreign nationals generally and the applicant specifically from engaging in offences such as those in the indictment.

(i)   The multiplicity of offences and the fact they were not isolated required some degree of accumulation of the individual sentences to reflect the applicant’s overall criminality and the fact that each offence was not isolated.” (Crown Written Submissions at [18])


	
	The Crown submissions also identified the subjective features which the sentencing judge took account of in sentencing the applicant at [19] of the Crown’s Written Submissions as follows:
	


“(a)   The applicant had no prior criminal convictions, though that factor carried less weight in offences of this type;

(b)   The applicant, a Korean national who travelled to Canada to study, came to Australia for the sole purpose of overseeing and facilitating the importations of drugs.

(c)   The applicant was married in Korea in 2008 but his wife left him and returned to Korea after his arrest.

(d)   The applicant had a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, though he had detoxified in gaol.

(e)   The applicant was a heavy gambler who won significant amounts of money from gambling.

(f)   The applicant was anxious and depressed.

(g)   The applicant had completed some courses of study and was keen to undertake more after being sentenced.

(h)   The applicant had expressed remorse and shame to his reporting psychologist.

(i)   There was considerable delay prior to the applicant pleading guilty. This was partially explained by a change in legal representation.

(j)   The applicant’s pleas of guilty entitled him to a discount of 15% on his sentence which indicated an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.

(k)   The applicant, though able to speak English, would be isolated from family and friends while in prison in Australia, though this factor is of little weight for an offender who travels to Australia for the sole purpose of importing border controlled drugs, as the applicant did.”

Ground 3


	
	The Crown referred to well-established principles according to which an appellate court may interfere with a discretionary judgment of a sentencing judge: Crown Submissions at [39]-[40]; Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15].
	
	
	The limitations upon a comparative analysis of cases for the purpose of demonstrating manifest excess in a particular sentence were emphasised: Crown Submissions at [44]-[46]. It was observed, in particular, that the applicant’s submissions based upon the extensive analysis of categories of cases as discussed in De La Rosa were of limited assistance.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the appellant had failed to demonstrate any specific error or defect on the part of the sentencing judge in sentencing the applicant. Nor, it was contended, had the applicant demonstrated that the sentence imposed was outside the applicable range of sentences indicated by the table of comparative sentence decisions relied upon at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed on the applicant could not be viewed as manifestly excessive.
	


CONSIDERATION

Ground 1


	
	In relation to the first ground of appeal (asserted error by taking into account, in assessing the applicant’s role, his use of “innocent agents”) I do not consider, with respect, that there is any substance to this ground.
	
	
	Initial reference to the matter of “innocent agents” appears to have arisen in the course of oral submissions by counsel then appearing for the applicant at the sentence hearing. In the transcript of the sentencing hearing, 15 February 2013 at p 16, reference was there made by Counsel for the applicant to “ten different addresses” following which counsel stated that the sentencing judge, having presided at the trials in relation to the applicant’s co-offenders, would have a higher level of knowledge “… in relation to the innocent agents”: T 16:20-25.
	
	
	Reference to the concept of “innocent agent or agents” was also made in the course of the Crown’s submissions to the sentencing judge at T 20:15-50. Counsel appearing for the Crown referred to the Table (a reference to Exhibit B) which recorded the destinations of the boxes of drugs imported. Counsel stated in this respect:
	


“… most of the boxes went to innocent agents which were addresses in Pitt Street and various other parts of Sydney and that’s what those submissions are about, the innocent agents which were used …” (T 20:35-40)


	
	It is relevant to note for the purposes of Ground 1, that Exhibit B identified five separate deliveries of boxes to the premises of the student agency in Pitt Street, being deliveries made on 23 October 2009, 5 November 2009, 4 March and 31 March 2010 and on 7 April 2010.
	
	
	Even confining the sentencing judge’s reference to “innocent agents” to those five deliveries, the facts as to those deliveries provided a sound evidentiary basis for the sentencing judge’s finding that the applicant’s role included “… approaching completely innocent people to provide their addresses for receipt of the boxes”: ROS 14. It was open to her Honour to find that the applicant used the occupiers of the student agency premises in Pitt Street as “innocent agents” for the purpose of effecting delivery of the boxes containing the prohibited drugs in the course of his role in the importation scheme.
	
	
	Finally, it is to be noted that her Honour’s finding in relation to the applicant’s use of innocent people in the manner referred to was but one aspect of the applicant’s role, a role that in fact had several aspects to it, as described by her Honour in the course of her Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	Ground 1, in my opinion, should be dismissed.
	


Ground 2


	
	In relation to Ground 2 which asserts error in the sentencing judge accumulating individual sentences to the degree to which she did, the specific facts concerning the importations and the applicant’s role in relation to those facts established that his offending was critical in relation to separate and serious offences. The Remarks on Sentence referred to those facts in considerable detail, including in particular, the facts as to the specific DHL consignments, the number of boxes and their contents following seizure by police: ROS 10-14.
	
	
	In relation to the five seizures made by police on 13 April 2010, 16 April 2010, including the three separate seizures on 19 April 2010, her Honour set out details as to the nature of the drugs seized, their bulk weight and pure weight, the purity levels and the location referable to each of the counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on the indictment.
	
	
	Her Honour had regard to the total pure weight of the drugs seized (cocaine, methylamphetamine and heroin) was 12.893 kilograms (almost 13 kilograms).
	
	
	The evidence established (in particular, Table 1 in Exhibit B) that a large number of DHL consignments were involved in all 24 consignments comprising 64 boxes.
	
	
	As identified in the Remarks on Sentence, the applicant acted in a trusted position to coordinate the arrival and receipt of the various consignments of drugs in Sydney. As her Honour stated, his part in the operation required a considerable degree of planning and preparation. Her Honour accurately stated that the counts on the indictment were not isolated but were instances of a well-organised scheme for importation of three different illegal substances into Australia: ROS 14.
	
	
	Whilst each of the offences in Counts 1 to 5 were committed within a period of months as part of one scheme or enterprise, they each involved separate acts of aiding/abetting the prohibited importation of significant quantities of prohibited drugs. Each involved its own deliberate planned contravention of the Crimes Act. In my opinion, the fact that they took place in the course of a single enterprise does not mean that they may be properly characterised as merely involving a single course of conduct.
	
	
	The mere temporal relationship between the series of offences, does not, of course, mean that by virtue of that fact the criminality of one importation can or does encompass the criminality of another or other offences. Each, on the evidence, involved a deliberate and very serious contravention of the provisions of s 307.1(1) (Counts 1, 2, 4 and 5) and s 307.2(1) (Count 3) of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	The principles that apply to questions of the degree of accumulation and concurrency are well-established: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41; R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]; R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52] and Sabongi v R [2015] NSWCCA 25 at [43].
	
	
	The proper exercise of the judicial discretion on sentence does not, in my assessment, support the proposition advanced for the applicant with respect to the facts of the present case, that matters such as “temporal context”, commission of the offences “in the context of a single enterprise” or that the fact that the offences “had features in common” or arose “in the course of one episode” point to an erroneous exercise of the discretion by the sentencing judge resulting in insufficient concurrency of sentences imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	In Cahyadi, Howie J observed:
	


“[27]   In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which was warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common features it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.”


	
	The present case did not involve “a single episode of criminality with common features”. Rather it involved a scheme or enterprise pursuant to which there was undertaken a number of discrete and independent criminal acts, each, as earlier stated involving deliberate and very serious contraventions of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	The structure of the sentences imposed upon the applicant, in my opinion, reflects a fair and balanced exercise of judicial discretion.
	
	
	I have earlier referred to the fact that in the applicant’s Written Submissions it was argued that it was apparent from passages in the sentencing remarks, extracted into the submissions for the applicant, that her Honour had regard to the fact that the offences were “not isolated” in her assessment of, firstly, the objective seriousness of the offences and, secondly, in determining the degree of accumulation between the sentences imposed for each. It was submitted that this would involve “double counting” that aspect of the criminality and that this amounted to an error.
	
	
	For convenience, I again set out below the relevant extracts in the Remarks on Sentence. At p 14 her Honour observed:
	


“The counts on the indictment are not isolated but instances of a well‑organised scheme for importation of these three different illegal substances into Australia …”


	
	When dealing with the issue of accumulation, her Honour observed:
	


“While the offender is to be sentenced for each individual count, there must be some accumulation of the sentences to reflect his overall criminality and of course to reflect that each was not isolated.”


	
	I do not consider there was any double counting involved. I accept the Crown submission that the references by her Honour to “not isolated” in each of the above extracts, were not directed to the same object. When first used, in context, the phrase was referring to the proposition that the offences in Counts 1 to 5 were not isolated given the fact that there was considerable evidence of uncharged conduct by the applicant. This was indicated by the evidence established that there had been 64 boxes containing drugs, some of which were located and some of which were not.
	
	
	The second reference to “not isolated” arose in a context of the remarks that was directed to a different issue, namely, the accumulation of sentences relevant to the issue of totality. I accordingly reject the submission made on behalf of the applicant on this aspect.
	
	
	Finally, there is no basis for the submission that her Honour determined the degree of accumulation by taking into account uncharged acts on the issue of “overall criminality of the offences charged”. I accept the Crown’s submission that her Honour, in stating that the overall sentence was “of course to reflect that each offence was not isolated”, was not referring to uncharged criminal conduct but that those words were a reference to the five offences for which the applicant was being sentenced in the context of an overarching scheme. I accept that no double counting or impermissible considerations entered into the exercise of her Honour’s discretion.
	
	
	The determination, in particular, of the overall or effective non-parole period of 12 years represented, in my opinion, a proper exercise of the discretion.
	
	
	There is no merit in Ground 2. The ground should be dismissed.
	


Ground 3


	
	As earlier indicated, when discussing the submissions made on behalf of the applicant, considerable reliance was placed in relation to this ground upon the decisions of this Court in De La Rosa and Holland.
	
	
	Those submissions, as earlier indicated, placed heavy emphasis upon the sentencing analysis, based on other cases, undertaken by McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa in which his Honour categorised or grouped cases concerned with the importation of commercial quantities of narcotics into four groups, in particular, at [207]-[215] of his Honour’s judgment.
	
	
	Firstly, it is to be noted that his Honour subsequently in Holland, supra, at [3] referred to his judgment in De La Rosa and observed that some of his remarks “… may have been misunderstood”. In addition, McClellan CJ at CL there observed:
	


“… however it would be wrong to sentence an offender by seeking out the ‘category’ into which they fit and imposing a sentence which is thought to be appropriate for an offence which happens to have the characteristics found in that category.”


	
	However, with respect, the approach taken in the submissions for the applicant sought to establish that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive by reference to the characteristics referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa including those in group 2. The submission was that the applicant’s case should be categorised as below the “second group”. McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa stated that the head sentences in the decisions in his Honour’s second group ranged from 18 to 24.5 years and the non-parole periods were between 10 and 16 years.
	
	
	His Honour’s fourth category involved head sentences ranging from 8 years to 15 years with a non-parole period starting at 4 years and ending at 11 years: at [211]-[213].
	
	
	As the Crown observed in its written submissions at [42], the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa itself stated that it was not a guideline judgment.
	
	
	In Thuong Nguyen v R [2012] NSWCCA 184, Davies J (with whom Allsop P and Latham J agreed) observed at [38]:
	


“The appeal to De La Rosa must be approached with caution. This Court has held on a number of occasions recently that limited assistance is to be gained by an applicant endeavouring to place himself in one or other of the categories described by McClellan CJ at CL in that case: Angus John Lindsay v R [2012] NSWCCA 124 at [7]-[8]; Kuti v R [2012] NSWCCA 43 at [45]-[48]; Remus Ritter v R [2012] NSWCCA 121 at [42]-[44]. De La Rosa was not written as a guideline judgment: De La Rosa at [196]-[200] and [203]. The judgment should only be used for general guidance and assistance: Lindsay at [18].”


	
	It is, in addition, to be noted that whether or not the applicant could be categorised as being in or below group 2 in the groups referred to in De La Rosa is doubtful. McClellan CJ at CL in respect of that group referred to the fact that the majority of the offenders had played roles described as “essential” or “vital” but which were not principal roles. Accepting that the sentencing judge found that the applicant in the present case was not the overall principal of the operation, his role was nonetheless significant as he was a person trusted to coordinate the arrival and receipt of the drugs in Sydney: Remarks on Sentence at p 14.
	
	
	I am of the opinion that descriptions such as “essential” or “vital” though relevant to this case assist only to a limited extent in identifying the applicant’s criminality. Rather it is necessary to undertake, as the sentencing judge did, an analysis of the facts concerning the nature of the operations with which he was involved, the extent of planning, the overall scheme of which the subject importations were but part, the nature of the prohibited drugs, their amounts, the organisational role and other roles undertaken by the applicant.
	
	
	I do not consider that the decision of this Court in Holland, supra, provides the applicant with support in his contention that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In Holland the respondent in a Crown appeal was also a Canadian national but who resided in the Philippines. He was aged 57 years. He had engaged accountants to assist in the establishment of an apparently legitimate business, received monies to assist him and maintained contact with his Canadian associates.
	
	
	In that case the respondent had communicated with the customs brokerage firm as to the landing and delivery of a container. Examination of a forklift within the container revealed that hidden inside its batteries were 14 packages of white powder weighing in total 9,984.1 grams. On examination the packages were found to contain cocaine.
	
	
	The Court had regard, of course, to the particular subjective circumstances associated with the respondent who was given the benefit of a 45% reduction in his sentence for assistance and his guilty plea. The result was that from a starting point of 12 years, a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 4 years was imposed. The non-parole period represented 60% of the overall term.
	
	
	The applicant also relied upon a table of comparative sentence decisions which was referred to at the sentence hearing entitled “Drugs – Cocaine – Import Commercial Quantity” downloaded from the Public Defender’s Office.
	
	
	I do not consider that a comparison based on the sentences in the above material relied upon by the applicant establishes that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge in the present case was outside what might be considered to be an applicable range of sentences. The sentencing judge, with respect, made appropriate findings as to the objective seriousness of the offences, took into account the subjective factors, addressed the issue of totality and made provision for an appropriate accumulation of sentences to reflect the applicant’s overall criminality.
	
	
	Her Honour having addressed and taken into account all relevant factors and circumstances, imposed sentences that in my opinion were appropriate and not manifestly excessive.
	
	
	I am of the opinion that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	I have accordingly concluded that the following orders should be made:
	



	
	The application for leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.
	



	
	WILSON J: I agree with Hall J.

Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicants, Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay, each seek leave to appeal with respect to sentences imposed at the Bathurst District Court on 1 October 2013 by Blanch CJ of DC with respect to serious drug supply offences.
	


The Offences and Sentences

Kelly Eldridge


	
	Kelly Eldridge pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly taking part in the supply a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (770 grams of Heroin) contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	Kelly Eldridge asked the sentencing Judge to take into account, on a Form 1, an offence of supplying a prohibited drug (12.25 grams of Methylamphetamine) contrary to s.25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, an offence (when prosecuted as a separate charge) punishable by a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment with no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Taking into account the offence on the Form 1, Kelly Eldridge was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years commencing on 10 November 2011 and expiring on 9 November 2016, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 10 November 2016 and expiring on 9 November 2019.
	


Suzanne Mackay


	
	Suzanne Mackay was sentenced for two separate offences:
	



	
	Count 1 - knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (742 grams of Heroin), an offence under s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 punishable by imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years;
	
	
	Count 2 - knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug (27.6 grams of Heroin), an offence under s.25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 punishable by imprisonment for 15 years with no standard non-parole period.
	



	
	Suzanne Mackay was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment as follows:
	



	
	Count 1 - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years commencing on 8 November 2011 and expiring on 7 November 2016, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 8 November 2016 and expiring on 7 November 2019;
	
	
	Count 2 - a fixed term of imprisonment for two years commencing on 8 November 2011 and expiring on 7 November 2013.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	Kelly Eldridge relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - the Applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed on her as compared to the sentences imposed on her co-offenders Kan Seang, Tania Negro and Suzanne Mackay.
	
	
	Ground 2 - his Honour erred in that he failed to take into account the remorse shown by the Applicant.
	
	
	Ground 3 - his Honour erred in that he failed to take into account the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation on sentence.
	
	
	Ground 4 - the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was manifestly excessive.
	



	
	Suzanne Mackay relies upon a single ground of appeal, namely that the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the sentence imposed on Kan Seang.
	


The Various Offenders


	
	Sentenced at the same time on 1 October 2013 in the Bathurst District Court were five members of the Mackay family:
	



	
	Suzanne Mackay (54 years old);
	
	
	Elizabeth Mackay (50 years old), a sister of Suzanne Mackay;
	
	
	Kelly Eldridge (33 years old), a daughter of Suzanne Mackay;
	
	
	Tiamber Mackay (24 years old), a daughter of Suzanne Mackay; and
	
	
	Shoula Maria Knight (39 years old), a niece of Suzanne Mackay.
	



	
	Also sentenced by Blanch CJ of DC on 1 October 2013, following a separate sentencing hearing conducted that day, was Tania Negro (“Negro”) (29 years old).
	
	
	Finally, Kan Seang (“Seang”) (79 years old) was sentenced by Garling ADCJ on 4 February 2014, following a separate sentencing hearing.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	Statements of Agreed Facts were tendered on sentence with respect to each of Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay. What follows is drawn from those statements.
	
	
	On 13 April 2011, Strike Force Stagehand was formed to investigate an apparent increase in the supply of heroin in the Bathurst area. Enquiries led to an investigation into the Mackay family (Suzanne Mackay, her sister Elizabeth Mackay, and Suzanne Mackay’s children - Tiamber Mackay and Kelly Eldridge).
	
	
	Over the course of the investigation, it became clear to police that members of the family were involved in ordering heroin and methylamphetamine from two upper-level suppliers, Seang and Negro. One of the Mackays would usually then drive to Canley Vale, Sydney, to obtain drugs from Seang or Negro. The Mackays would pay Seang or Negro approximately $5,500.00 per ounce of heroin (28 grams) and $1,350.00 per “eight-ball” of methylamphetamine (3.5 grams).
	
	
	From July 2011, several telephone services were lawfully intercepted. A particular mobile phone number was identified as being predominantly used by various members of the Mackay family to make contact with Seang and Negro.
	


Supplies Involving Kelly Eldridge


	
	A number of telephone intercepts identified 18 separate supplies which provided a total quantity of 770 grams of heroin (the offence charged between July and November 2011 involving Kelly Eldridge) and 12.25 grams of methylamphetamine (the Form 1 matter).
	
	
	The first supply on 20 July 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang. Tiamber Mackay then met Seang at Negro’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The second supply on 22 July 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge organising again to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang. Kelly Eldridge then met Seang at Negro’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The third supply on 24 July 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay and Kelly Eldridge organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang and Negro, and then meeting Negro to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The fourth supply on 29 July 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge again organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang and Negro, with Tiamber Mackay then meeting at Negro’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The fifth supply on 20 August 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay and Kelly Eldridge organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang. Tiamber Mackay then met Seang at Negro’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The sixth supply on 23 August 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge organising to buy “two” ounces (56 grams of heroin) from Negro. Kelly Eldridge then met Negro to exchange money for this heroin.

	The eighth supply on 28 August 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Negro. Tiamber Mackay then met Negro to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The ninth supply on 31 August 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay and Kelly Eldridge organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Negro. Kelly Eldridge and Tiamber Mackay then met Negro to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The tenth supply on 2 September 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Negro. Tiamber Mackay then met Negro to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The eleventh supply on 7-8 September 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Negro on 7 September 2011. Tiamber Mackay then met Negro to exchange money for this heroin. On 8 September 2011, Kelly Eldridge entered discussions with Negro about returning 19 grams of the heroin, in exchange for one ounce of purer heroin. Eldridge then met Negro’s boyfriend to exchange money/heroin for the higher quality product.
	
	
	The twelfth supply on 10 September 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay organising to buy one ounce (28 grams of heroin) from Negro. Kelly Eldridge then met Negro to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The thirteenth supply on 12 September 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay and Kelly Eldridge organising to buy one ounce (28 grams of heroin) and half an “eight ball” of methylamphetamine (1.75 grams) from Negro. An exchange was then made on the afternoon of 12 September 2011.
	
	
	The fourteenth supply on 15 September 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge organising to buy one ounce of heroin and an “eight ball” of methylamphetamine (3.5 grams) from Negro. An exchange was then made on the late evening of 15 September 2011.
	
	
	The fifteenth supply on 19 September 2011 involved Kelly Eldridge organising to buy one and a half ounces (42 grams of heroin) and an “eight ball” of methylamphetamine (3.5 grams) from Negro. Tiamber Mackay then met Negro to exchange money for the prohibited drugs.

	The eighteenth supply on 8 November 2011 involved contact the previous day by Suzanne Mackay with Negro requesting “two full ones”, and then later “I want two and a half now”, and arranging to meet “up top” the following day. At about 7.30 pm on 8 November 2011, Suzanne Mackay and Elizabeth Mackay were observed at Blaxland McDonalds. A car owned by Negro arrived and an exchange was made. This was the fulfilment of the order to Negro for “two and a half” ounces (70 grams of heroin). Of that amount, 42 grams was taken back to an address at Kelso where Kelly Eldridge was waiting.
	


Arrest of Kelly Eldridge


	
	At about 10.15 pm on 8 November 2011, police executed a search warrant at an address in Kelso, the premises occupied by members of the Mackay family. During the execution of the warrant, police found Elizabeth Mackay, Suzanne Mackay and Kelly Eldridge within the residence dividing the bulk heroin into smaller deals. A large amount of indicia of supply was found in the residence.
	
	
	Kelly Eldridge was arrested and charged that evening. She was released on bail on 11 November 2011, but was rearrested on 14 November 2011 following a bail review and remained in custody thereafter.
	


Supplies Involving Suzanne Mackay

Count 1 - Supplies Between 12 July 2011 and 8 November 2011


	
	Telephone intercept evidence identified 16 separate supplies between July and November 2011 involving a total of 742 grams of heroin in which Suzanne Mackay was implicated criminally, giving rise to the offence in Count 1.
	
	
	The first supply on 12 July 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang. Tiamber Mackay drove to Seang’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The second supply on 16 July 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay again organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang. Tiamber Mackay drove to Negro’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.

	The fourth supply on 24 July 2011 involved the same facts as Kelly Eldridge’s third supply referred to at [20] above.
	
	
	The fifth supply on 27 July 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Negro and then meeting at Negro’s house in Canley Vale. Suzanne Mackay and another person drove to Negro’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.
	
	
	The sixth supply on 11 August 2011 involved Suzanne Mackay organising to buy “one and a half” ounces (42 grams of heroin) from Seang. Tiamber Mackay then met Seang at Negro’s house at Canley Vale to exchange money for this heroin.

This supply relates in part to Kelly Eldridge’s thirteenth supply referred to at [30] above.
	
	
	The fifteenth supply on 24 September 2011 involved the same facts as Kelly Eldridge’s seventeenth supply referred to at [34] above.
	
	
	The sixteenth supply on 8 November 2011 involved similar facts as those contained in Kelly Eldridge’s eighteenth supply referred to at [35] above.
	


Count 2 - Offence on 8 November 2011


	
	At about 7.50 pm on 8 November 2011, Elizabeth Mackay and Suzanne Mackay met a police undercover operative in the car park of the Blaxland Tavern. The undercover operative had previously arranged with Elizabeth Mackay to purchase one ounce of heroin for $7,000.00.
	
	
	In accordance with prior discussions between the undercover operative and Elizabeth Mackay, $2,000.00 had already been transferred by police to a bank account owned by Elizabeth Mackay on 7 November 2011. The remaining $5,000.00 was given to Elizabeth Mackay in cash. The undercover operative received a small brown carry bag which contained 27.6 grams of heroin at 18% purity.
	
	
	These facts constituted Suzanne Mackay’s second offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, heroin (27.6 grams).
	


Arrest of Suzanne Mackay


	
	After the transaction with the undercover operative on the evening of 8 November 2011, the Mackays were followed to the Kelso residence.
	
	
	At about 10.15 pm that evening, police executed a search warrant at that residence. During the execution of the warrant, personal searches were conducted of Elizabeth Mackay, Suzanne Mackay and Kelly Eldridge. Nothing of interest was found on Suzanne Mackay. A small amount of heroin was found on Elizabeth Mackay. The sum of $660.00 was located in the bra of Kelly Eldridge.
	
	
	A number of items, being indicia of supply, were located in the premises including digital scales. Three foil-wrapped items (later found to contain heroin) were found on the surface of the water in the toilet, and small pieces of square-shaped foil and a roll of Gladwrap were located on a table in the lounge room.
	
	
	Suzanne Mackay was arrested and charged that evening and has remained in custody since 8 November 2011.
	


Subjective Circumstances of Kelly Eldridge


	
	Kelly Eldridge was 31 years old at the time of the offences and 33 years old at the time of sentence.
	
	
	She had a limited criminal history involving driving offences in 1998, offences in 1999 of goods in custody and possession of a prohibited drug and a further goods in custody offence in 2002. All offences were punished by fines.
	
	
	Tendered in evidence at the sentencing hearing was a presentence report together with a report dated 1 February 2013 of Mark Howard, psychologist, and a letter from Kelly Eldridge and documents concerning her courses undertaken in custody. The contents of these reports will be mentioned later in this judgment.
	


Subjective Circumstances of Suzanne Mackay


	
	Suzanne Mackay was 52 years old at the time of the offences and 54 years old at the time of sentence.
	
	
	Her criminal history contained one entry. On 14 July 1999, she appeared at the Lithgow Local Court on a charge of bringing prohibited plants or drugs into a place of detention, for which she was fined $1,000.00.
	
	
	A presentence report dated 23 September 2013 was provided to the Court. A report dated 24 September 2013 from Anna Robilliard, forensic psychologist, was also tendered, together with a letter from another daughter of Suzanne Mackay who was not involved in these offences. These reports will be referred to later in this judgment.
	


The Sentencing Hearing in the District Court


	
	Given the grounds of appeal in this Court, it is appropriate to refer to the course of proceedings in the District Court.
	
	
	The proceedings against six offenders (all but Seang) came before another Judge at the Bathurst District Court on 13 May 2013. It was indicated that the sentencing hearing may occupy two-to-three days. Given this estimate, the matters were placed in the call-over list before the Chief Judge of the District Court on 15 May 2013 to be given a hearing date.
	
	
	Thereafter, the six matters came before Blanch CJ of DC sitting at the Bathurst District Court on 1 October 2013. Before that day, documentary material had been provided to his Honour by both the Crown and defence and it is apparent that his Honour had considered it.
	
	
	Soon after the matters were called on, his Honour indicated his provisional view on sentence with respect to each of the offenders. With respect to Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay, his Honour said (T3.29, 1 October 2013):
	


“For each of them I had thought that an appropriate penalty was something more like eight years with a five year non-parole period. The question in respect of Ms Eldridge is as I understand the basic purport of the prosecution case is that Suzanne who was is [sic] mother had a heroin addiction herself and because of that became introduced to dealers and then eventually became involved in significant dealing herself. But looking at the material Kelly who is one of the daughters was very heavily involved in it, in fact the particular instances where the police have recorded things, she appears more often than Suzanne in terms of the dealing and the drugs. So that those two seem to me, in terms of who was dealing with what, to be the most culpable if I can put it that way.”


	
	Soon after, his Honour said to counsel (T4.13, 1 October 2013):
	


“It comes down to the question then of what the appropriate sentence is for the two people that I see at the moment in this group as being the most culpable and that is Suzanne and Kelly Eldridge.”


	
	His Honour indicated provisional sentences as well for other offenders, but it is not necessary to refer to those for the purpose of determining the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Submissions were made by counsel for the offenders, including Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay.
	
	
	At the conclusion of submissions, his Honour proceeded to sentence five offenders (Suzanne Mackay, Kelly Eldridge, Elizabeth Mackay, Shoula Knight and Tiamber Mackay) in a single set of sentencing remarks. To assist determination of the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to set out extracts from the remarks on sentence.
	
	
	Early in the remarks, his Honour referred to the case of Suzanne Mackay (ROS1/AB11):
	


“Dealing firstly with Suzanne Mackay it appears that she is now 54 years of age and she had a long history of heroin use herself and because of her association with heroin and heroin dealers she came to a point of becoming involved in the distribution of the heroin and in doing that she involved her two daughters, her sister and her niece.”


	
	In the course of considering the facts of the offences, his Honour said (ROS2/AB12):
	


“The telephone calls indicate that on a significant number of occasions it was Suzanne Mackay who was involved in arranging the supply of the drugs.

Looking at the numbers of the calls and what occurred it does appear that Ms Eldridge was involved in somewhat more of the dealings but it is clear that Suzanne Mackay was the person who initiated the drug dealing operation. She has made that plain to Duffy & Robilliard the psychologists and it appears that she gives the reason for this, the fact that there were deaths in the family, she had a long history of coping with anxiety and depression and the use of heroin was her way of coping with it and she began to use more and more heroin and that was the motivation for the initiation of the offence.

Of course dealing with the objective facts of the case, it is a significant aggravating feature that she involved two of her daughters and her sister and niece in what was occurring. Another observation that I should make about the offences is that they are certainly not sophisticated drug dealing offences. They arose in an amateurish sort of fashion, however that does not in any way excuse them and nor does it militate against the imposition of a sentence that reflects both general and specific deterrence. At the end of the day, the activities of Suzanne Mackay and the other co-offenders was responsible for spreading a significant amount of heroin into the local community and that degree of drug abuse in the community can only have a very significant deleterious effect on the community as a whole and of course a sentence has to be imposed that reflects both general and specific deterrence.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the subjective circumstances of Suzanne Mackay (ROS3-4/AB13-14):
	


“So far as Suzanne Mackay is concerned, I have already indicated she is 54 years of age. She has a prior conviction in 1999 which is not of any significance so for all intents and purposes she should be dealt with as somebody without prior criminal history. There has been a report tendered by Duffy & Robilliard and that indicates that she was one of twelve children, her mother left the family when she was four years of age. I have already indicated that two of her sisters died in the period between 2008 and 2010 and that caused her a degree of anxiety and grief which may have been the trigger for her to become involved in these offences.

She is the mother of five children including Tiamber the co-offender here and Kelly Eldridge. Her children are aged between 34 and 19. She suffers from severe emphysema and obviously that is going to be a significant problem for her in a gaol situation. It appears that she has brought up the children largely by herself and her future in the community will be one where she will need to go and live with relatives and she has got the background of serious emphysema. She had been using heroin herself since the age of 17 and that abuse increased after the death of her sisters.

She has entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and she is entitled to a 25 per cent discount in relation to any sentence to be imposed. She has expressed contrition. Obviously she finds herself in the situation where she is regretting the fact that she has brought a calamity on her daughters and in particular on Kelly Eldridge who has herself six young children and who has now been in gaol since November 2011 as she has.

She has expressed to the psychologist an appreciation of what an evil heroin is in the community and indeed her view about that has been that she is glad that she was arrested because if she had not been her abuse of heroin would have increased to the point where she would now be dead. That may very well be the true situation so far as she is concerned.

Her prospects for rehabilitation will depend on her ability to come out of gaol drug free and remain drug free, bearing in mind the fact that she has been using heroin for almost 40 years prior to going into custody but of course she also has a significant health problem. And that significant health problem has to be taken into account too in the context of how difficult it will be for her in gaol compared to other people.”


	
	His Honour then imposed the sentences previously indicated (at [7]) on Suzanne Mackay.
	
	
	Next, his Honour addressed the objective gravity of Kelly Eldridge’s offences (ROS5-6/AB15-16):
	


“In the case of Kelly Eldridge, as l have already indicated she is a daughter of Suzanne Mackay. She was clearly involved in a significant number of the drug dealing. The telephone intercepts indicate that on more occasions than her mother she was actually involved in organising the purchase of heroin through Tania Negro and Kan Seang.

In her case, she is charged with one charge of supplying a prohibited drug greater than the commercial quantity, namely 770 grams of heroin. That is an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act. It carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of ten years. In addition, she asks me to take into account a charge of supplying a prohibited drug greater than the indictable quantity, namely 12.25 grams of methylamphetamine. The supply charge relates to eighteen charges similar to the matters referred to in her mother's case and the supplies extend between 20 July 2011 and 8 November 2011.

Objectively again, it is a serious matter involving the introduction of a significant amount of heroin into the community. It is an offence that requires a sentence to be imposed that reflects both general and specific deterrence as is reflected by the head sentence available and the standard non-parole period that has been fixed. In her case she has entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and she too, is entitled to the maximum discount of 25 per cent in relation to that plea of guilty.”


	
	The sentencing Judge then considered the subjective circumstances of Kelly Eldridge (ROS6-7/AB16-17):
	


“In her case she is 33 years of age. She was in custody for two days and then from 14 November she has been in continuous custody. Because of those two days, any sentence should date from 12 November 2011. She was born in Adelaide and her parents separated when she was six months old. She, too of course, comes from an Aboriginal background, raised by her mother in Bathurst. As I have already indicated in her mother's case, her mother had a longstanding heroin abuse problem and it appears from the reports tendered in Mrs Eldridge's case that many members of her family also had substance abuse problems.

A report from Duffy & Robilliard psychologists has been tendered. That indicates that she had a problem over the years with a sexual assault which occurred when she was five. She became pregnant at the age of 16 and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and the tragedy in her case is that she has six children aged between 6 and 16. She only lived sporadically with the father of the children and it appears from the reports and references tendered that she has been responsible largely for raising the children herself.

Of course, she has now been in custody for nearly two years and the children are being cared for elsewhere. It is difficult to ignore the fact that there are so many children and some children of such a young age that are going to be deprived of their mother. However, the law is that it is only in a highly exceptional case that the impact on the family is one that should result in any significant decrease in the sentence, the reason for that being that the fact of the impact of the family is because of the commission of the offence and it is a problem that is caused by the offender herself. 

She had, according to the reports, a history of regular heavy drinking and then the use of ice and she reports persistent anxiety since the age of 16. Obviously living in the way she has it has been difficult to raise six children and take responsibility for them and she appears to be a person who has been prepared to take responsibility for a number of matters. She has been doing a course at TAFE, at one stage she was looking to do a certificate relating to mothering at a distance and strangely in relation to the commission of the offence, I note that in the Duffy & Robilliard report they say:

‘Over time Kelly became responsible for organising and collecting purchase of heroin for her mother and others. From around September 2011, Kelly also began to organise concurrent purchases to support her own use of ice and amphetamine. Kelly described a pattern of recurrent purchases of substances as a means of supporting, increasingly regular use by herself and others...’

She does seem to be a person who has been prepared to accept responsibility, unfortunately in this case she has accepted the responsibility of helping her mother in the obtaining and distribution of drugs.”


	
	His Honour concluded (ROS7/AB17):
	


“In her case too, it is necessary to bear in mind the head sentence and the non-parole periods as indicators of the sentences Parliament regards as being appropriate in these cases. But taking into account the subjective material tendered in her case, in my view the appropriate sentence for her is exactly the same as the sentence imposed on her mother.”


	
	His Honour then passed sentence on Kelly Eldridge, in the terms set out at [5] above.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge then proceeded to deliver remarks on sentence concerning Elizabeth Mackay, Shoula Knight and Tiamber Mackay (ROS8-15/AB18-25).
	


Kelly Eldridge Ground 2 - Alleged Failure to Take Into Account Remorse on Sentence


	
	It is appropriate to commence with Kelly Eldridge’s second ground of appeal. Her first ground of appeal raises a parity issue, which is conveniently addressed at the same time as the sole ground of appeal raised by Suzanne Mackay, likewise a parity issue.
	


Submissions


	
	Ms Cox, counsel for Kelly Eldridge, submitted that the sentencing Judge had not considered her client’s remorse as a matter to be taken into account on sentence. It was submitted that Kelly Eldridge had expressed contrition to the author of the presentence report, to Mr Howard and in her letter which was before the sentencing court.
	
	
	Counsel noted that his Honour had found in favour of Suzanne Mackay on the issue of remorse based upon similar material tendered in her case (see [78] above).
	
	
	It was submitted that, as a practical demonstration of remorse, both Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay had entered pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that there was no suggestion in the remarks on sentence that his Honour had examined the cases with respect to the two offenders, for the purpose of finding remorse in the case of one but not the other. It was submitted that this Court should conclude that his Honour had failed to take into account this factor in favour of Kelly Eldridge on sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a finding as to genuine remorse was a matter within the discretion of the sentencing Judge.
	


Determination


	
	It is necessary to keep in mind that his Honour proceeded to sentence five co-offenders, in ex tempore remarks on sentence delivered at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing. In Currie v R [2013] NSWCCA 267, this Court said at [50]-[51]:
	


“50   As Spigelman CJ observed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 577 [48], the conditions under which District Court Judges give such reasons ‘are not such as to permit their remarks to be parsed and analysed’. In R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; 221 A Crim R 175 at 180-181 [34], with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J, I observed:

‘… it is necessary to keep in mind that the remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing on 3 February 2012. This course had the undoubted advantage that those present in Court could hear immediately the sentence which was passed and his Honour’s reasons for passing that sentence. A consequence of this approach, which is understandable in a busy court, is that remarks on sentence may not be ‘as robustly structured as they might otherwise have been’ (Simpson J in Simkhada v R [2010] NSWCCA 284 at [24]) and may ‘lack the order and precision of language that can be incorporated into a judgment after the luxury of time for consideration, refinement of expression, and polishing’ (Simpson J in Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 at [57]).’ 

51   It is important to keep these statements in mind, in particular, when considering submissions that his Honour did not refer in the remarks to certain matters which had been the subject of evidence and submissions at the sentencing hearing.”


	
	In the course of oral submissions at first instance, counsel for Kelly Eldridge had submitted that a finding of remorse should be made.
	
	
	His Honour noted that Suzanne Mackay had “expressed contrition” (see [78] above). This was not an especially strong finding in her favour for the purpose of s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The complaint of Kelly Eldridge under this ground is that his Honour made no such reference in that part of the ex tempore sentencing remarks as related to her.
	
	
	I am satisfied that what happened here, where there was mention of remorse in the case of one offender but not the other (when there was a similar evidentiary base in each case) is a byproduct of the delivery of ex tempore remarks on sentence for multiple co-offenders, rather than a failure on the part of the sentencing Judge to take remorse into account.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to take into account, as part of the instinctive sentencing process, remorse as complained of in this ground.
	
	
	This ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Kelly Eldridge Ground 3 - Suggested Failure to Take Into Account Prospects of Rehabilitation

Submissions


	
	Ms Cox relied again upon the fact that the remarks on sentence concerning her client made no reference to her prospects of rehabilitation. By way of contrast, it was noted that his Honour had addressed the prospects of rehabilitation of Suzanne Mackay (see [78] above).
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the material before the sentencing Judge was strongly in favour of a positive finding of prospects of rehabilitation. Had this issue been considered, it was submitted that a finding would most likely have been that Kelly Eldridge had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	It was submitted that error had been demonstrated in failing to so find at first instance.
	
	
	The Crown pointed, once again, to the discretionary nature of a finding with respect to prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	During the course of oral submissions, the Crown acknowledged that the material before the sentencing Judge with respect to Kelly Eldridge was probably more favourable from the point of view of prospects of rehabilitation than that concerning Suzanne Mackay (T10, 12 February 2015).
	


Determination


	
	Once again, it is necessary to keep in mind the ex tempore nature of the remarks on sentence delivered immediately after the sentencing hearing (see [91] above).
	
	
	This Court should be cautious in finding error through the absence of reference to a factor in ex tempore sentencing remarks.
	
	
	His Honour took a guarded view of Suzanne Mackay’s prospects of rehabilitation (see [78] above). Kelly Eldridge’s subjective circumstances (see [81] above) suggest that some caution was required in her case as well in assessing prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the sentencing Judge failed to have regard to Kelly Eldridge’s prospects of rehabilitation. Once again, I consider that the absence of any reference to this topic is a byproduct of the delivery of ex tempore remarks on sentence for multiple co-offenders, rather than a failure to have regard to this factor on sentence.
	
	
	This ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Kelly Eldridge Ground 4 - The Sentence Was Manifestly Excessive


	
	Ms Cox submitted that the sentence imposed upon her client was manifestly excessive. The Crown submitted that manifest excess had not been demonstrated in this case.
	
	
	This ground of appeal may be dealt with shortly. To make good this ground, it is necessary to demonstrate that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325-326 [6].
	
	
	The offence for which Kelly Eldridge was sentenced was punishable by imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. A further serious offence was taken into account on a Form 1. The offending conduct took place over several months and, as the sentencing Judge found, Kelly Eldridge was heavily involved in this course of serious offending, which saw a significant amount of heroin distributed to citizens in the Bathurst area. When regard is had to all relevant objective and subjective factors, it has not been demonstrated that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Kelly Eldridge Ground 1 - The Parity Ground Based Upon Comparison With Sentences Imposed on Seang, Negro and Suzanne Mackay

Suzanne Mackay’s Sole Ground - The Parity Ground Based Upon Comparison With Sentence Imposed on Seang


	
	It is appropriate next to consider the parity grounds advanced by each Applicant. Reference should be made to the sentencing proceedings concerning Negro and Seang and the sentences imposed upon each of those offenders.
	


Sentencing of Tania Negro


	
	Negro was sentenced on 1 October 2013 following a separate sentencing hearing before Blanch CJ of DC. She pleaded guilty to supplying a commercial quantity of heroin (748 grams), an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. Negro requested that an additional charge be taken into account on a Form 1, being a charge of supplying the indictable quantity of methylamphetamine (12.25 grams).
	
	
	Negro was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years with a balance of term of two years.
	
	
	Negro was 27 years old at the time of the offences and 28 years old at the time of sentence. She had one prior conviction in 2009 for low-range PCA, for which she received a six-month good behaviour bond under s.10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	In ex tempore sentencing remarks delivered later on 1 October 2013, Blanch CJ of DC referred to the facts of the offences, and the involvement of Negro (ROS2-3/AB128-129):
	


“It appears at the beginning that this offender was operating on behalf of Mr Seang and at his instruction.

As the supplies and telephone conversations continued it appears that this offender was taking a somewhat more active part, for example in one telephone call on 10 September Sue Mackay called the offender and wanted to get a stronger dose of the drug and this offender said ‘No worries’ and was obviously taking an active part in the conversation between herself and Sue Mackay and indicating a degree of autonomy or ability to negotiate about the nature of the heroin being supplied.

That really is the key question so far as she is concerned in this case because in the ordinary course of events she, with Mr Seang, were supplying the heroin that was being distributed by the Mackay family and in the ordinary course of events a longer sentence would be imposed on her than I have imposed on the ringleaders in the Mackay family.

However, Mr Givorshner [counsel for Negro] quite correctly raises the point that although she may have been on the face of it further up the line of supply and therefore deserving of a longer punishment, one really has to look at the role that she played and there is a real possibility that the role she played was not as an initiator in the offence but simply as someone acting at the behest of Mr Seang.

And in order to resolve that issue it is really necessary to look at the subjective aspects of this offender and how she came to be involved in the offence.”


	
	His Honour then considered Negro’s subjective circumstances, and their interaction with her offending conduct (ROS3-4/AB129-130):
	


“Briefly her background is that she was born in Fairfield in 1984. She turns 29 next week, she grew up with her mother and father but when her parents separated when she was 11 it transpired that the man she thought of as a father was not a father at all and her real father had moved back to Cambodia.

Her mother then began a new relationship with a man called Leng Yim who was abusive towards her and cruel and violent and given to drinking and he got her mother involved in selling drugs and it was in that sort of dysfunctional background that she grew up and she made every effort to stay away from her mother while her mother was in that relationship.

Her mother ended that relationship and then formed a relationship with Kan Seang who is the co-accused in this case.

So that in terms of looking at this question of just what part did she play and how much autonomy did she have, the man Kan Seang is a person who was standing in the position of her father and being her mother's partner. And all of the evidence points to the fact that she became involved in the commission of this offence when she undertook to pay her mother's debts and when she was at a particularly low point in her life and she took up the offer from Kan Seang to assist him in the drug dealing.

None of that of course excuses her because she was well and truly aware from her own upbringing about drug dealing and she was well and truly aware that he was involved in drug dealing and that she was assisting him in the course of the drug dealing.

So that it is a case where she has to be punished on the basis that she deliberately became involved in a drug trade that she knew all about and she knew, and must have known, of its illegality and the deleterious effects that it has in the community.” 


	
	His Honour then found that Negro played an active, but subsidiary, part to that played by Seang (ROS4/AB30):
	


“But nonetheless all of those factors when they are put together do lead me to the conclusion on the balance of probabilities that so far as she was concerned the part she played in it was an active part but it was a subsidiary part to that played by Kan Seang.

On that basis it is not appropriate for me to approach the sentencing on the basis that she was in a more culpable position than the members of the Mackay family who were involved in organising the distribution of the heroin.

The significant impact of that conclusion is that I had initially concluded that it would be appropriate to start thinking of her sentence as one of 12 years by way of a head sentence which could then be discounted.

Because of the conclusion that I have just reached in my view it is more appropriate to accede to the submission of Mr Givorshner that the appropriate starting point is ten years rather than 12 years.”


	
	His Honour then allowed a 25% discount for Negro’s plea of guilty, and a further 25% discount for her willingness to give assistance in what was then expected to be the trial of Seang. Application of the combined 50% discount reduced the head sentence to one of five years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	His Honour then considered what were described as “other compelling subjective features in her case” (ROS5/AB131). She had children aged six and eight years and was eight months’ pregnant at the time of sentence. She had been married in 2012 and her partner was supportive of her. She came from a very dysfunctional background from which she had managed to escape for a period of time. His Honour found that it appeared to be the case “that it was only because of the personal stresses that I have referred to that she succumbed to the invitation to become involved in this heroin dealing” (ROS6/AB132).
	
	
	His Honour found her prospects of rehabilitation to be “quite good”. In making a finding of special circumstances, his Honour noted that Negro had been exposed to drugs at one time and had succumbed to their use, so that a longer period than the statutory ratio was appropriate by way of non-parole period. As noted earlier, his Honour proceeded to impose a total sentence of imprisonment for five years comprising a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of two years.
	


Sentencing of Kan Seang


	
	Seang was sentenced on 4 February 2014 by Garling ADCJ. Although he had entered a plea of not guilty at an earlier time, he pleaded guilty to a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin (574 grams), an offence punishable by imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	After reciting the basic facts, Garling ADCJ referred to a factual dispute on sentence (ROS2/AB136):
	


“He agreed to supply a total of not less than 574 grams of heroin to members of the Mackay family or their representatives. He is charged on the basis of an ongoing offence of supply where the quantity of the drug supplied was not less than the commercial quantity of heroin.

The facts then set out the details of the fourteen occasions upon which heroin was supplied. When the offender pleaded guilty he disputed the Crown facts and there was a hearing held in relation to those facts. In brief the dispute was that he said he had only dealt in drugs on six occasions, supplying a total amount of heroin of just over 250 grams, and that the main person involved was Ms Negro.

She gave evidence before me. I have given a judgment in relation to this matter, and I found that this offender was the person who commenced supplying the drugs, that he used her to assist him. Certainly that was during the months of July, August and into September. She then found her own supplier and she took a much more active role from that time onwards, and in the end she supplied drugs on more occasions. This offender supplied a higher amount of drugs.

There can be no doubt that this offender knew exactly what he was doing. He was supplying a significant amount of drug on a significant number of occasions. He knew that the drug was being on-sold to people who used heroin.” 


	
	His Honour then considered Seang’s subjective circumstances (ROS3/AB137):
	


“The offender is 79 years of age. He has had a difficult life, at least before he came to Australia. He lived in Cambodia with his wife and four children. He joined the army and he fought against Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge - that was the army supported by the USA - he fought against them between 1970 and 1975 until Pol Pot took over.

He then went to live in a village with his family and was then sent to another province away from his family. He later learned that it was most probable that his wife and four children had been murdered. The children were aged between two and ten years.

He then had to escape. He went to Thailand and then, as a refugee, came to Australia in 1978. It is a very tragic past life he has had.

Since his arrival in Australia he appears to have been a law abiding citizen until he commenced selling heroin. He has no criminal record before this. His life in Australia appears to be unremarkable. He has no relatives living in Australia. He has a child, but has no contact with that child.

He has been in custody since 9 February 2012, just on two years. On one occasion he was assaulted in gaol and he still has pain in the chest area.

He said in evidence that he had various health problems. He had pain in his chest, problems with his kidney, he is a diabetic, has cholesterol problems, both legs become swollen. At times he has difficulty in walking and has pain in his joints. He takes medication for diabetes, cholesterol, and Panadol for pain.

I am satisfied there are special circumstances. They are his age and it is the first time he has been in custody.”


	
	His Honour allowed a 10% discount for Seang’s guilty plea entered on the day fixed for trial.
	
	
	Findings adverse to Seang were made with respect to remorse and his truthfulness (ROS4/AB138):
	


“I do not accept that he has demonstrated remorse. When questioned about it he eventually said he did. It was far from convincing, but clearly - as far as I am concerned - he did not tell the truth when giving evidence before me, nor did he tell the truth to the police, and I am not prepared to make a finding of remorse. However I do not believe he will offend in this way upon release. Obviously his age will probably prevent that, and also by now he would realise the seriousness of the penalties for this sort of offence.”


	
	His Honour took into account Seang’s age, health and difficulty with the English language in the following way (ROS4/AB138):
	


“There is no doubt that his age will make it far more difficult for him to serve his sentence than a younger person.

I have no doubt his physical ailments will also make it more difficult, and his difficulty with the English language will cause him some isolation and make his term of imprisonment more difficult.

It was put to me early in this sentencing proceeding that he did not want to die in gaol. I understand that sentiment, at the same time this is a most serious offence.”


	
	The sentencing Judge then turned to the question of parity (ROS5-6/AB139-140):
	


“The question of parity is an important issue. A number of persons were charged with various drug offences of a similar nature to this. They were sentenced by the Chief Judge of this Court in October 2013. I think there were five members of the Mackay family who received varying sentences. Certainly of those more involved in the drug dealing there were sentences imposed of eight years, with a five year non-parole period, with other sentences for other members.

In relation to parity the main offender I have to consider is Ms Negro, who was charged with an identical offence. I have indicated the part I believe she played and this offender played. I should say that the Chief Judge when sentencing her indicated that the starting point for her was ten years imprisonment. He subsequently reduced that by 50% as a result of her plea of guilty and her offer of assistance. She was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years with a non-parole period of three years. It was about 60% of the head sentence.

She was 29 years of age. She had two children and was pregnant at the time she was sentenced. I am told that child was born in gaol. She gave evidence in this hearing, and is still in custody. She had no criminal record.

There was a difference however, the facts in relation to the charge against her set out 18 occasions on which she dealt in drugs, this accused's facts set out 14 occasions. She was charged with supplying 748 grams of heroin, this accused 574 grams. And she also had a further matter on a Form 1. I take all those matters into account.

These of course are - as I said - most serious offences. This offence is an offence which must be punished by a severe period of custody. A very difficult part of this sentence is the offender's age. But I am also aware that when he was in his seventies he was clearly dealing with heroin, selling heroin for a profit, and he is a man - whilst having health problems - still has a significant degree of fitness.

In formulating this sentence and taking into account parity with Ms Negro, whose sentence started at ten years, I formed the view that the starting point for this offender should be lower than that because of the reasons I previously gave. I therefore reached a starting point a little under nine years. Then reducing that by 10% for the plea of guilty I reached a head sentence of eight years.

The normal non-parole period would be six years. As I understand it Ms Negro's non-parole period was about 60% of the head sentence. I then took into account the age of this offender and the difficulty he will have in serving his sentence. I concluded that the proper non-parole period, given those matters, was four years.”


	
	It will be immediately apparent that Garling ADCJ concentrated on the sentencing of Negro for parity purposes, with no examination being undertaken of the sentences imposed upon other offenders, including Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay. It is clear that his Honour was aware of the sentences imposed by Blanch CJ of DC on 1 October 2013 upon all offenders involved in this criminal enterprise.
	


Submissions on Behalf of Kelly Eldridge


	
	Ms Cox submitted that Seang and Negro played a greater role in the drug supply organisation, being described in the Statement of Agreed Facts as “upper level” suppliers (see [15] above). It was submitted that both were higher in the chain of supply than Kelly Eldridge.
	
	
	It was submitted that Negro’s starting point sentence was 10 years’ imprisonment and Seang’s starting point sentence was nine years’ imprisonment. Kelly Eldridge had a starting point sentence of 10 years and eight months.
	
	
	It was submitted that, after a late plea (and a disputed facts hearing resolved against him), Seang’s final sentence was eight years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. Negro’s final sentence, after a 50% discount for her plea and assistance, was imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of three years. Kelly Eldridge’s sentence was one of eight years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging the difference in subjective circumstances of Seang and the fact that he faced one charge only, it was submitted that the parity ground is made out by reference to Seang’s sentence and that of Kelly Eldridge.
	
	
	Again, whilst acknowledging that both Negro and Kelly Eldridge were sentenced for a single offence (and a Form 1 matter), and the additional discount extended to Negro for her assistance to authorities, it was submitted that the parity ground was made out in comparing her sentence with that of Kelly Eldridge.
	
	
	It was submitted that Suzanne Mackay had recruited Kelly Eldridge into the drug dealing operation, and that this was a significantly aggravating factor with respect to Suzanne Mackay. It was submitted further that Kelly Eldridge’s subjective case was more compelling than that of her mother. It was submitted that Kelly Eldridge ought to have been able to rely on findings in her favour on the issues of remorse and rehabilitation as addressed in the second and third grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that due proportion required that Kelly Eldridge receive a lesser sentence than that imposed upon Suzanne Mackay.
	
	
	Ms Cox submitted that a comparison of the role of Kelly Eldridge in the drug supply operation, and the level of criminality she displayed when compared with the roles and levels of criminality of Seang, Negro and Suzanne Mackay, ought lead to the conclusion that due parity has not been displayed and the sentence imposed upon Kelly Eldridge, and that she has a legitimate sense of grievance in this respect.
	


Submissions on Behalf of Suzanne Mackay


	
	Mr Bruce SC, for Suzanne Mackay, addressed her single ground of appeal, based on parity, by reference to the sentence imposed on Seang.
	
	
	It was submitted that Garling ADCJ had erred on the parity issue, by confining attention to the sentence imposed upon Negro and not those imposed on other offenders, including Suzanne Mackay.
	
	
	It was submitted that Seang was involved in the actual supply of 574 grams of heroin on 14 occasions for commercial gain. On the other hand, Suzanne Mackay was involved in the actual supply of 27.6 grams of heroin on one occasion (the second count) and was involved in receiving (along with other members of her family) 740 grams of heroin for supply on 16 occasions.
	
	
	Further, Suzanne Mackay (and her co-offenders, Kelly Eldridge and Elizabeth Mackay) all had serious drug addictions. Some of the heroin purchased from Negro and Seang was to be used by members of the Mackay family to support their addictions, although a portion of the heroin purchased was to be on-sold into the community as well.
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging Seang’s age and health as distinguishing factors, Mr Bruce SC pointed to the finding of absence of remorse in his case.
	
	
	Senior counsel pointed to a starting point in the case of Seang of “a little under nine years” (before the 10% discount for his late plea of guilty), with that starting point having taken into account Seang’s objective offending and subjective features.
	
	
	The starting point in relation to Suzanne Mackay was in the order of 10 years and eight months’ imprisonment, given the head sentence of eight years which included a 25% discount for her pleas.
	
	
	Even allowing for the fact that Suzanne Mackay was to be sentenced for two offences, it was submitted that the difference in the starting points with respect to these two offenders was stark.
	
	
	It was submitted that the disparity as between these two offenders was glaring, particularly after comparing the moral culpability of each offender. In these circumstances, it was submitted that Suzanne Mackay had a legitimate sense of grievance by reference to the sentence imposed on Seang.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown pointed to the significantly different subjective circumstances of Seang (his age and health) together with the fact that he was sentenced on one charge only.
	
	
	It was submitted that different Judges might take different views as to the culpability of offenders, and there might be differences in facts and impressions formed by each Judge as to the roles, levels of responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation: Rae v R [2011] NSWCCA 211 at [52]-[53].
	
	
	With respect to Negro, the Crown submitted that strong findings were made as to her involvement in the offending and her subjective circumstances, with the combined 50% discount being given for her plea of guilty and assistance to authorities.
	
	
	As a result of this dissimilarities, the Crown submitted that it is inappropriate to compare the sentence of Negro with that imposed upon Kelly Eldridge.
	
	
	It was submitted that an examination of the remarks on sentence concerning Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay did not give rise to any legitimate sense of grievance on the part of the former, arising from the imposition of similar sentences upon each of them for essentially similar criminal conduct.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that neither Kelly Eldridge nor Suzanne Mackay had demonstrated a legitimate sense of grievance arising from the sentences imposed upon their co-offenders.
	


Determination


	
	The present appeals arise from a series of sentencing decisions:
	



	
	the sentencing on 1 October 2013 by Blanch CJ of DC, following a joint sentencing hearing, of Suzanne Mackay, Kelly Eldridge, Elizabeth Mackay, Tiamber Mackay and Shoula Knight;
	
	
	the sentencing on 1 October 2013 by Blanch CJ of DC, following a separate sentencing hearing, of Negro;
	
	
	the sentencing on 4 February 2014 by Garling ADCJ, following a separate sentencing hearing, of Seang.
	



	
	In Rae v R, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J, I made some observations at [50]-[56] concerning practical issues which may arise where related offenders are sentenced by different Judges:
	


“50   Courts have emphasised the desirability of related offenders appearing for sentence at the same time before the same Judge, and the problems which may arise where that practice is not followed.

51   The authorities were gathered in the decision of this Court in Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67 (‘Dwayhi’) at [33]-[46]. It is appropriate to once again refer to these principles.

52   There are significant advantages where related offenders are sentenced by the same Judge at the same time, with remarks on sentence containing factual findings and conclusions concerning the relative criminality of the offenders and differing subjective features of each of them: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71]; Gurney v R; Willetts v R [2011] NSWCCA 48 at [81]-[82]; Dwayhi at [39]-[43].

53   Different Judges may take different views as to the relevant culpability of related offenders: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 320; R v Mercieca [2004] VSCA 170 at [6]; Dwayhi at [35], [37].

54   Where co-offenders are dealt with separately, there may be differences in the substratum of facts upon which the different sentencing Judges act and the impressions formed by them with respect to the relative roles, levels of responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation of the individuals involved, with this flowing in part from the different emphases which can be expected to be placed on aspects of the offending behaviour and the circumstances of the offenders: R v Rodden [2005] VSCA 24 at [28]; Dwayhi at [38].

55   Strong maintenance of the practice of related offenders being sentenced by the same Judge at the same time will serve the public interest in consistent and transparent sentencing of related offenders which underlies the parity principle itself: Dwayhi at [46].

56   A recurring theme in the authorities is that, where co-offenders are sentenced after hearings before different Judges, there may be different evidence and submissions, leading to different conclusions being expressed by the sentencing Judges concerning criminal conduct of persons involved in the same criminal enterprise.” 


	
	The relevant principles to be applied, where parity is raised on appeal, were outlined in Rae v R at [59]-[63]:
	


“59   Disparity between sentences is not of itself a basis of appellate intervention, but a factor to be weighed when the Court considers whether the sentencing process has been attended by error and, if so, whether the Court should intervene: R v Li [2005] NSWCCA 154 at [44]; Dwayhi at [25].

60   A complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence imposed on an offender cannot otherwise be challenged. It is the sentence imposed upon a co-offender which is said to give rise to a sense of injustice, not the sentence imposed upon the offender: Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189 at [7]; Dwayhi at [26].

61   The test for determining whether there is a legitimate sense of grievance is objective. What has to be demonstrated by an applicant is not that he or she feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the applicant’s grievance is justified: R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34]; Dwayhi at [21].

62   Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective circumstances. This Court will not necessarily intervene where the co-offender’s sentence is so inadequate that the Court should not take it into account: Lewins v R at [7]; Dwayhi at [21].

63   A ground asserting disparity is concerned with such markedly and unjustifiably different sentences imposed on co-offenders that they give rise to a genuine feeling on the part of a reasonable and impartial observer that justice has not been achieved because one offender has been unfairly treated, having regard to the sentence passed upon the other offender. What is required is a gross, marked, glaring or manifest disparity: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]; Dwayhi at [23]-[24].


	
	In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462, French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said at 474-475 [31]-[32] (footnotes omitted):
	


“The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.

A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive. Disparity can be an indicator of appealable error. It is also correct, as Mason J said in Lowe, that logic and reality combine to favour the proposition that discrepancy is a ground for intervention in itself. Unjustifiable disparity is an infringement of the equal justice norm. It is appealable error, although it may not always lead to an appeal being allowed. If an appeal is allowed on the ground of disparity, a court of criminal appeal in re-sentencing is not required to achieve identity of punishment. It must have regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender and give it appropriate weight. In such a case, an appeal to this Court on the question whether a disparity identified in a court of criminal appeal was unjustifiable and called for intervention by that court would also involve review of a qualitative and discretionary judgment.”


	
	Several of the offenders in this case were charged with different offences. As French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ noted in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at 474 [30], the parity principle remains applicable with necessary qualifications:
	


“The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen [[2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at 588-589 [201]- [203]. See also Farrugia v The Queen [2011] VSCA 24 at [8]- [19]], there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.”


	
	As might be expected, there were differences between the subjective circumstances of the different offenders whose sentences are presently under consideration.
	
	
	It is the case that Seang was to be sentenced for one offence of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin.
	
	
	Suzanne Mackay was to be sentenced for an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin and a further offence of supplying an indictable quantity of heroin.
	
	
	Kelly Eldridge was to be sentenced for an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin, with an offence of supplying an indictable quantity of Methylamphetamine to be taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	Negro was to be sentenced for an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of heroin, with a Form 1 offence of supplying an indictable quantity of Methylamphetamine.
	
	
	In my view, the true points of comparison relate to the primary charge against each of Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay. Kelly Eldridge’s other offence was taken into account on a Form 1. An entirely concurrent fixed-term sentence was imposed for Suzanne Mackay’s second offence.
	
	
	The starting point in relation to Seang’s sentence was a little under nine years. The starting point with respect to the sentences imposed upon each of Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay was in the order of 10 years and eight months.
	
	
	Seang’s offence was committed solely for financial gain. He was not a drug user.
	
	
	The offences of Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay were committed for a combination of reasons, including the feeding of their own drug addiction and intended distribution of drugs to others in the Bathurst region.
	
	
	Seang had no prior convictions and Suzanne Mackay and Kelly Eldridge had very limited criminal histories.
	
	
	Although the age and health of Seang assisted him on sentence, there was no finding of remorse and his evidence had been rejected at a disputed hearing on facts for the purpose of sentence.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the marked disparity in starting points for the sentences of Seang on the one hand, and Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay on the other hand, gives rise to a legitimate sense of grievance on the part of each of these Applicants.
	
	
	I have kept in mind that Seang was sentenced by a different Judge on materials adduced at that sentencing hearing. However, the findings arising from Seang’s factual hearing were largely adverse to him on sentence. Although Seang’s age and health were important considerations as part of his subjective case, the objective gravity of his offending was substantial.
	
	
	I am satisfied that each of Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay have made good their parity grounds by reference to the sentence imposed upon Seang.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that Kelly Eldridge has demonstrated a legitimate sense of grievance by reference to the sentence imposed on Negro. The findings made with respect to Negro serve to explain the approach of Blanch CJ of DC in sentencing her, with his Honour being no doubt well aware of the sentences imposed earlier that day on the other offenders, including Kelly Eldridge.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that Kelly Eldridge has made good her parity ground referring to the sentence imposed upon Suzanne Mackay. The relevant similarities and differences were taken into account by the sentencing Judge in determining sentence.
	
	
	The parity ground has been made good by each Applicant with respect to the sentence imposed upon Seang.
	


Resentencing the Applicants


	
	Once error is established, it becomes this Court’s duty to resentence unless in the exercise of its discretion, it concludes that no other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 88 ALJR 947 at 957-958 [42]-[43].
	
	
	As the appeals are to be allowed on the ground of disparity, the Court should have regard to the sentence (and the starting point) in Seang’s case and give it appropriate weight: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at 474-475 [31]-[32] (see [155] above).
	
	
	On the question of resentence, Kelly Eldridge relied in this Court upon her affidavit dated 5 February 2015 and the affidavit of Stephen Eccleshall dated 6 February 2015. Those affidavits recount the steps taken by Kelly Eldridge in custody to progress her rehabilitation, together with developments in her family since sentence was imposed. She has undertaken a number of courses in custody which evidences a constructive approach towards her rehabilitation.
	
	
	On the totality of evidence before this Court, it is appropriate to find that Kelly Eldridge has demonstrated remorse and that she has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I have regard to the objective gravity of the offences committed by each of Kelly Eldridge and Suzanne Mackay together with their subjective circumstances as found by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances should be made in each case with each Applicant requiring a longer period of supervision after release given long-term substance abuse issues. However, in each case, the non-parole period represents the minimum period for which each Applicant should be detained in custody for her offending conduct.
	
	
	The sentences to be imposed upon the Applicants will not be identical, having regard to the additional evidence with respect to Kelly Eldridge made by reference to the totality of evidence before this Court, and my assessment of the relative objective gravity of the offences committed by each Applicant.
	
	
	In the case of Kelly Eldridge, before application of the 25% discount for her plea of guilty, a head sentence of nine years’ imprisonment is appropriate. After application of the 25% discount, and giving effect to the finding of special circumstances, the sentence to be imposed will comprise a non-parole period of four years with a balance of term of two years and nine months.
	
	
	In the case of Suzanne Mackay, before application of the 25% discount for her plea of guilty, a head sentence on Count 1 of nine years and six months is appropriate. After application of the 25% discount, and giving effect to the finding of special circumstances, the sentence to be imposed (after some rounding) will comprise a non-parole period of four years and six months with a balance of term of two years and seven months.
	
	
	With respect to Kelly Eldridge, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	leave to appeal granted and appeal allowed;
	
	
	sentence imposed at the Bathurst District Court on 1 October 2013 quashed;
	
	
	taking into account the offence on the Form 1, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 10 November 2011 and expiring on 9 November 2015, with a balance of term of two years and nine months commencing on 10 November 2015 and expiring on 9 August 2018;
	
	
	the earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 10 November 2015.
	



	
	With respect to Suzanne Mackay, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	leave to appeal granted and appeal allowed;
	
	
	confirm the sentence imposed on Count 2 in the Bathurst District Court on 1 October 2013;
	
	
	quash the sentence imposed on Count 1 in the Bathurst District Court on 1 October 2013;
	
	
	on Count 1, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on 8 November 2011 and expiring on 7 May 2016, with a balance of term of two years and seven months commencing on 8 May 2016 and expiring on 7 December 2018;
	
	
	the earliest date upon which the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 8 May 2016.
	



	
	HAMILL J: I agree with Johnson J.

		03 June 2015",2015-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766839,WorkCover Authority of NSW v Interlink Carpentry and El-Bayeh [2015] NSWDC 277,"SENTENCE


	
	On 15 October 2011 at level 12, 33 York Street Sydney, a young man, Mr Aidan Chan, just 22 years old, was killed when he was crushed by a falling wall then under demolition. The demolition of the wall was the undertaking of the first defendant Interlink Carpentry Projects Pty Limited which was a corporate vehicle carrying out the works of its proprietor Mr Allan El-Bayeh.
	
	
	Mr Chan was the building manager of the company charged with the maintenance of 33 York Street, Sydney and his function on that day was to give access to Mr El-Bayeh and several of his employees. Mr Chan directed Mr El-Bayeh to the wall in question so that the men could commence the work.
	
	
	Mr El-Bayeh instructed his workers to commence demolition of the wall by first removing the middle section of its vertical face. The wall was in panels, each defined by brickwork laid between steel uprights or channels. As the centre of each panel was removed the upper portion was free to slide down within the steel channels.
	
	
	An opening having been created in the wall, Mr Chan sought to pass from one side to the other through that opening and as he did so the upper part of the wall, weighing perhaps 400 kilograms fell upon him, crushing him.
	
	
	Interlink Carpentry pleads guilty to the charge that it failed to ensure so far as reasonably practicable that Mr Chan would not be exposed to risk to his health and safety arising from the conduct of the defendant’s undertaking while at the defendant’s place of work, contrary to s 83 Occupational Health and Safety Act. Mr El-Bayeh was the director of Interlink Carpentry and pleads guilty to the charge that contrary to s 26(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, he failed by his actions or omissions to exercise due diligence to ensure that his company Interlink Carpentry complied with its obligations under s 8(2).
	
	
	Mr El-Bayeh accepts that the demolition was a task undertaken by his company. He concedes for himself and his company that he failed by his acts or omissions to discharge his duty. The negligence in this case is quite gross. Mr El-Bayeh concedes that it was not his practice to prepare safe work method statements in relation to works undertaken by the company. Before commencing the work Mr El-Bayeh undertook no investigation of the wall, his materials, the structural system of the wall or the sequence of demolition. He conducted no risk assessment.
	
	
	He established no exclusion zone which may have prevented Mr Chan being placed in the position of danger. He provided no safe work method statement. He failed to observe the most elementary of precautions mandated by Australian standards. This is not an incident where a company conscious of safety inadvertently failed to achieve the standard required.
	
	
	Mr El-Bayeh and his company were oblivious to any concerns for safety and accepted no responsibility at the time.
	
	
	The objective analysis of the defendant’s failure is summarised in the submissions of the prosecution as follows:
	


“The vice in this matter is to be found in:


	
	the complete lack of planning undertaken by the defendants
	
	
	the complete disregard of the Australian standard for the demolition of structures
	
	
	the failure to exclude Mr Chan from the demolition area whilst the work was being carried out
	
	
	the failure to undertake any risk analysis or any safe work method statement prior to the work being undertaken.”
	



	
	The event was completely foreseeable. The failures by the defendants were gross. The maximum penalty with regard to the corporate defendant is $550,000. Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that in determining the appropriate sentence the court is to take into account aggravating factors referred to in subsection 2.
	
	
	Amongst those aggravating factors are the injury, emotional harm and loss or damage caused by the offence. Not only was the harm to Mr Chan the most extreme, but the harm has carried on to have the gravest effect upon his family. The victim’s mother Mrs Christine Chan has been left as she says “a broken person, a shell”. She speaks of his family and his friends being now bound together, not by affection for the deceased but by his unbearable loss.
	
	
	It is of particular notice that s 21A includes subsection (iv) that the offence involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons.
	
	
	In mitigation it is apparent that the defendant does not have any record of previous convictions, although this would appear from the evidence of Mr El-Bayeh to be a circumstance of good luck rather than good management.
	
	
	Although Mr El-Bayeh himself expresses regret for the circumstance of the accident, and says that “I am extremely sorry for his death and I think about how I could have prevented it”, there is no evidence that he conveyed his remorse and responsibility to the victim’s family before today’s event. As Mrs Chan says, they await a coroner’s inquest to find out as they put it, exactly how it happened, it is quite apparent that the responsibility is with Mr El-Bayeh. It seems to me that if he conveyed his responsibility and sorrow to the family at an earlier time their suffering would have been alleviated.
	
	
	Subjective matters include the circumstance that although Mr El-Bayeh continues to engage in the building industry he does not now perform demolition work.
	
	
	The penalty must reflect general deterrence to persons who might otherwise adopt such a cavalier attitude to safety. This particular offence calls for a high measure of objective deterrence.
	
	
	Mr El-Bayeh is a young man and still works in the building industry. It seems to me that an element of subjective deterrence is required so that he is reminded of the responsibilities of entrepreneurs in relation to matters of occupational health and safety.
	
	
	The substantial matter put by his counsel is that he is a man of limited means and pursuant to s 6 of the Crimes Act 1996 I should consider his means to pay. That plea is founded upon evidence that Mr El-Bayeh together with his wife occupies a house presently worth between 880 and $900,000. He owns two investment properties which he says are together worth $1,000,000 although no expert evidence is called to confirm that fact. He has assets then of $1.9 million against which he has liabilities of approximately $1.4 million leaving net assets of nearly half a million dollars. His income is $80,000 a year.
	
	
	I take into account that his wife is a joint owner of this property and it would be appropriate to ascribe $250,000 in capital assets to Mr El-Bayeh.
	
	
	The maximum penalty which may be imposed on the corporate defendant for the offence is $550,000. Parity requires that I bear in mind the penalty imposed by Judge Finnane on CVD Asset Management Pty Limited the employer of Mr Chan. His Honour Judge Finnane fined that company $250,000. That company did not have the expertise of Mr El-Bayeh. Mr El-Bayeh concedes that of the persons present at the scene of the accident, to his knowledge he was the only person with trade qualifications. His responsibility for the accident exceeds by some measure that of the client company.
	
	
	The case falls into the worst category of offence.
	
	
	I convict the defendant Interlink Carpentry Pty Limited and I find that the appropriate fine will be $400,000. The plea of guilty entitles this defendant to a reduction of 25% and the company Interlink Carpentry Projects Pty Limited is fined $300,000.
	
	
	The maximum penalty which may be imposed for a breach of Mr El-Bayeh’s personal responsibilities is $55,000. The appropriate fine in this case is $45,000. He is entitled to a 25% reduction for his early guilty plea and cooperation with the authorities. I convict Mr El-Bayeh and I fine him $33,750.
	
	
	I order that the prosecution have a moiety of the fines and I order that the defendants pay the prosecution’s costs as agreed or assessed.

	I grant leave to the appellant to withdraw his appeals in respect of the destroy, damage property and contravene ADVO offences. It is noted that these sentences have now expired.
	
	
	Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. Instead of the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Magistrate, under s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 by order I release the appellant without passing sentence on him upon his giving security without surety by recognizance to the satisfaction of the Court that he will comply with the following conditions -
	



	
	That he will be of good behaviour for twelve months.
	
	
	That he will, for the period of twelve months, comply with the following conditions.
	



	
	that he notify the Registrar at this court of any change in his address. The Court notes his current address;
	
	
	that he attend Court if he is called upon to do so;
	
	
	that he accepts supervision from the New South Wales Community Corrections Service and accept all reasonable directions and recommendations of officers of that service regarding finance, domestic violence, alcohol, drug and gambling problems;
	
	
	that he report to the Community Corrections office at Taree within seven days of his release from custody.
	



	
	The Court notes that the time served in respect of these offences has been taken into account.
	


HIS HONOUR: I think that fixes it.

DRINKWATER: Your Honour I just was enquiring of my friend whether your Honour has to nominate an amount of security, even if it be without surety. Thank you.


	
	One hundred dollars.
	


DRINKWATER: Thank you your Honour.

		30 October 2015",2015-06-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766841,Genoli v R [2015] NSWDC 238,"Judgment


	
	Kaben Genoli was sentenced by Magistrate McCosker to four months’ imprisonment on 14 April 2015. The sentence was backdated to commence on 15 March 2015 and therefore expires on 14 July 2015. His Honour was sentencing Mr Genoli for two serious crimes. Both crimes were offences against the Crimes(Currency)Act 1981 (Cth). One was making counterfeit money. That is so serious that Parliament has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment for the offence. The second crime was uttering counterfeit money, knowing it to be counterfeit. Parliament fixed a maximum of 12 years imprisonment for that offence.
	
	
	Mr Genoli has been in custody since 15 March 2015 and has therefore served almost three-quarters of the sentence imposed by his Honour. Incidentally there were two other offences dealt with by his Honour which are listed on exhibit A, the severity appeal cover sheet, but both sentences have expired. In due course I will grant leave for Mr Genoli to withdraw those appeals.
	
	
	Briefly, what happened is this. Kaban Genoli decided to make counterfeit banknotes. He bought himself a scanner machine and then using printer paper and coloured and black ink he managed to produce over $2,000 worth of fifty dollar notes. It was, as Ms B Drinkwater who appears for him on the appeal said, a fairly amateur attempt. Mr Genoli then, during January this year, took himself around to various businesses in the Taree and Newcastle area – they were fast food outlets – and, with varied success, passed the fifty dollar notes in for buying small items and received legitimate notes in his change. Somebody alerted the police, he turned himself in on 12 February 2015 and pleaded guilty on 16 March 2015. He must have been bail refused from about that time because the sentence was backdated to 15 March 2015.
	
	
	Mr Genoli has a criminal record but it did not start until he was 25, which is, relatively speaking, quite late. He has a number of traffic offences and a common assault which is domestic violence related. Other than that, in the context of domestic violence again, there is a carriage service offence concerning a threat to kill. Obviously that was potentially a serious offence but it was dealt with by a fine in the Local Court which indicates that it was not likely to be regarded as very serious by the court. He has a record interstate but in each case there was no conviction recorded.
	
	
	Mr Genoli was raised in Gloucester. He is now 28. He lives at home. He had what is described as a supportive and loving upbringing and continues to have positive relationships with his family members. I take that from a helpful pre-sentence report prepared by a Community Corrections officer. He had some trouble with one of his relationships. There is an apprehended violence order. They lost a baby and the relationship broke up. Around about that time, which was during last year, he first used methylamphetamine. He quickly became addicted. Mr Genoli was also engaged in gambling on a regular basis, frequently losing a week’s income. That suggests a gambling addiction as well. He completed year 12 and has some qualifications in the automotive trade.
	
	
	Mr Genoli’s offending was linked to “financial strain due to his illicit drug use and gambling activities”. He acknowledged that his activities were “just stupid”. The author of the report assesses his risk of re-offending as medium. This is Mr Genoli’s first time in custody and the author of the report noted he said “his experience of incarceration has motivated him to avoid future offending behaviour”. The author thought that Mr Genoli “would benefit from a period of supervision” and Mr Genoli told the author that he was willing to engage in some intervention.
	
	
	Ms Drinkwater proposes that I allow the appeal and consider the time served to date to be sufficient in the sense that I would substitute a sentence of a good behaviour bond. She points to her client’s record - which is not extensive as I said - and commenced relatively late in his life and to the fact that he has never been in custody before and the offences did not involve dishonesty.
	
	
	Mr A Baker, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, acknowledges the force of these submissions. In addition, Ms Drinkwater has made available a letter from Mr Genoli’s brother pointing out that there is employment available for Mr Genoli when he is released. I think there is a good deal of force in Ms Drinkwater’s argument. Clearly what Mr Genoli needs in the community is some supervision so that he can deal with what appear to be two significant addictions, namely prohibited drugs and gambling.
	
	
	I think the time he has served, which is nearly three months, is sufficient for the purposes of punishing him for the serious crimes he committed. I propose to allow his appeal and to release him on a good behaviour bond.    
	
	
	The formal orders which I make are these. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. Instead of the sentence imposed by the Magistrate, under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing Mr Genoli to enter into a good behaviour bond for 12 months. The conditions of the good behaviour bond are these -
	



	
	that he be of good behaviour;
	
	
	that he notify the Registrar of this court of his address and any change;
	
	
	that he attend court if called upon to do so;
	
	
	that he accept supervision from Community Corrections and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions from officers of that service, specifically related to areas of finance, domestic violence, alcohol and drug problems and gambling.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now Ms Drinkwater and Mr Baker I will explain in a moment, are they all the orders I need to make?

DRINKWATER: I apologise I missed - how long your Honour was it?

HIS HONOUR: Twelve months.

BAKER: I think your Honour might already have withdrawn the other appeals.

HIS HONOUR: No I did not.


	
	I grant leave to Mr Genoli to withdraw his appeals in counts 3 and 4 listed on exhibit A.
	
	
	Returning to my reasons, I make it clear that in allowing this appeal I have taken into account the time he has served to date.
	


HIS HONOUR: Are there any other orders I need to make? Ms Drinkwater?

DRINKWATER: No your Honour.

BAKER: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Genoli have allowed your appeal. Can you hear me?

APPELLANT: A little bit yeah, yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You have won your case do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Drinkwater made a good case for you. You have served time. You committed some pretty serious crimes so far as the Federal Government is concerned which is why you got the gaol sentence. I am going to direct your release today or as soon as possible. Practically that might be today or tomorrow I am not too sure, do you understand?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: But you are on a good behaviour bond for 12 months. Do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: The good behaviour bond is conditional. You have got to keep out of trouble which means all trouble, no being busted for drugs or drink driving or anything like that, do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You have got to turn up to court if you get a notice and you have got to let the court know of your new address do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You have got to allow Community Corrections to supervise your supervision do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: They are going to focus on particular areas like your drug problem, your gambling problem and help you with finance and employment and things like that, do you understand?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You have got to let them help you. They know what they are doing, that is going to be very important, do you understand?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right where are you going to live - where are you going to go when you leave the gaol today or tomorrow?

APPELLANT: My girlfriend has a house which I put up bond for as well so me and her have worked things out so I’ll go there and then from there I’ll go to Tamworth after I find out what’s going on with my employment.

HIS HONOUR: So where is your girlfriend’s house, we had better make a note of that address.

APPELLANT: It’s--

HIS HONOUR: Unless somebody in court knows.

DRINKWATER: His partner is in the body of the court. 

HIS HONOUR: Is that where you are going tonight when you are released today or tomorrow?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Does your partner know that? Is she expecting you?

APPELLANT: Yes we talked about.

DRINKWATER: She is in the back of the court and she is nodding your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right good.

DRINKWATER: He does have work in Tamworth, it’s a question of when - if he goes to that work - and if that’s the case presumably Taree can transfer it to the Tamworth office.

HIS HONOUR: I guess so. Where is the nearest office to Gloucester for him to report to?

DRINKWATER: Taree.


	
	It is a further condition that within seven days of his release he reports to the Community Corrections office at Taree to commence his supervision. I have noted that his address on release will be 736 Waukivory Road, Gloucester.
	


HIS HONOUR:   So Mr Genoli once you are released you go to your girlfriend’s place and then once you have got another address where you are working, you have got to let them know do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: The other thing you have got to do is turn up at the Taree Community Corrections office, 41 Wynter Street, Taree. Ms Drinkwater will help you find that but you have got to go there and sign up for supervision do you understand?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: These are a lot of formalities which you have got to follow and understand but Ms Drinkwater will explain them to you because it is part of your sentence that you allow yourself to be supervised and that you let them help you. If you do not, they will breach you and you will be back before me and then I will have to consider setting aside the good behaviour bond or something worse do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else, I do not know how long the process takes do you for him to be released?

DRINKWATER: It could be this afternoon if they get the message quickly enough, if not in the morning.

HIS HONOUR: Now get on with the rest of your life now Mr Genoli. You are still not 30 yet are you.

APPELLANT: No.

HIS HONOUR: You have got a relationship with your partner is that right?

APPELLANT: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: So use this opportunity to clear your life up and settle into work and you have got two major issues you have got to deal with. One is the drugs and we have all heard about ice and how addictive it is. The other is your gambling and it might take a while to deal with those two problems. Be patient with yourself and then get on with your life do you understand?

APPELLANT: Yes your Honour thank you so much.

HIS HONOUR: Good luck. Ms Drinkwater I am going to ask my associate to print out another version of my orders here and make them available to you for your client Mr Genoli.

DRINKWATER: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Because I want him to see those conditions. You can either fax them to him or give them to him when you see him. How does he sign up for the bond?

SPEAKER: In the registry.

HIS HONOUR: I think Ms Drinkwater you need to give him some advice about going to

SPEAKER: ..(not transcribable)..

HIS HONOUR: Oh is that how it works? So he signs up before he is released.

2766844,R v McNeil (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 758,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This trial is concerned with the alleged murder of Mr Daniel Christie by the accused in Victoria Street, Kings Cross on New Year’s Eve 2013. The Crown alleges that the accused approached Mr Christie, who was a total stranger, and struck him with a single punch that caused him to fall to the ground. His head struck the hard pavement of the roadway and he suffered catastrophic injuries from which he subsequently died.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused intended by his punch to cause grievous bodily harm. The defence case is that there was no such intention and that the accused should be found guilty of manslaughter by way of an unlawful and dangerous act.
	
	
	The Crown case has closed, and Mr Smith of Senior Counsel has made an application on behalf of the accused that I direct a verdict of not guilty in respect of the charge of murder.
	
	
	It was Mr Smith’s submission that there was no evidence capable of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of one of the essential elements of the offence; namely, that at the time of the act causing death, the accused intended to cause really serious bodily harm. He referred to four bodies of evidence that were relevant to this issue: the CCTV footage; the eye witness testimony; the police interview of the accused following his arrest; and the evidence of Dr Bailey, the forensic pathologist. He submitted that, taking that evidence at its highest, it was not possible for that essential element to be made out.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the application and referred me to some aspects of the evidence supporting its argument that the element could be made out.
	
	
	The matter has to be seen in the context of events that occurred slightly earlier than the assault upon Daniel Christie. A short time before and distance away from the fatal assault, the accused assaulted a young person, who I will identify by the letter ""F"". He punched F, causing him to go to the ground, and then kicked him.
	
	
	Peter Christie, the deceased's brother, gave evidence that as the accused and F came in his direction a very short time later, the accused appeared to be ""a muscly bloke"", and he had ""an aggressive manner"". He was ""sort of like beefing up to look big"" and said, ""I'm an MMA fighter.” Another young person who I will identify by the letter ""G"" said that he heard the accused say ""something along the same lines.”
	
	
	There is evidence supporting Peter Christie’s description of the physical description of the accused as “a muscly bloke”. He weighed about 110 kg and told police he trained with weights. A photograph of the accused (Exhibit L) also supports the description.
	
	
	Witnesses have given various descriptions of the punch delivered to the deceased. Peter Christie described it as a, ""Right hand punch, extremely hard but fast with a bit of, like to Daniel's face with a bit of like, not just a quick jab, but like a bit of build up into it"" (T 117.25).
	
	
	Raymond Taylor said that the accused ""did a step, lunge, and then threw a punch and then hit the guy that was standing on the footpath in the face"" (T 127.42). He described the punch as being with ""lightning speed"" (T128.15). He described the movement of the accused's arm ""from his waist to the guy's face"" (T128.46).
	
	
	Manus Upadhyay described ""a big swing"" (T139.46). He agreed that it was ""coming from low on the body and up"" (T140.6). He agreed that his demonstration of the swing was ""his hand being somewhat down by his waist and then coming up approximately to the area of ... [the] head...and moving close to the middle of [the] body as the punch grows higher"" (T140.24). The speed of the punch he described as ""very fast""; (140.45).
	
	
	Daniel Clancy said ""he was stepping forward with his right foot and his hand came down low to - and I'd call it a long right hook"" (T160.11). He also said, ""it was done rapidly"" (T160.15). He agreed that it was ""a punch that has come from down about [the] waist and up and around"" (T160.28). And he said, ""He stepped and threw at the same time, so his hand probably travelled over a metre and a half"" (T161.13)
	
	
	In the accused's police interview he first described the punch in the following terms: ""I've just upper cutted"" (Q 252). However, he subsequently indicated that the punch was not hard, or with as much force as he could deliver.
	
	
	Dr Bailey's evidence was to the effect that there were too many variables to be able to say anything definitive about the degree of force with which the punch was delivered.
	
	
	I have a duty to direct an acquittal if, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the evidence is incapable of proving an alleged offence. In this case it is asserted to be so because of the failure of the evidence to possibly make out the essential element of intent.   I have no power to direct a verdict merely because I have formed a view that a guilty verdict would be unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 85. A verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207; R v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177 at [29].
	
	
	In Doney v The Queen the principles were explained (at 214-215) as follows:
	


""It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.

It is necessary only to observe that neither the power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict that is unsafe or unsatisfactory nor the inherent power of a court to prevent an abuse of process provides any basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function. The power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory, like other appellate powers, is supervisory in nature. Its application to the fact-finding function of a jury does not involve an interference with the traditional division of functions between judge and jury in a criminal trial.""


	
	I have considered the evidence and taken it at its highest in favour of the Crown. Having regard to the descriptions of the punch, and bearing in mind that it was delivered by a large and powerful man who was in an aggressive and agitated state of mind following the earlier events, it would be open to the jury to be satisfied that there was an intention to cause really serious bodily harm. Whether such a conclusion would be a reasonable one is another question but not one for me to consider.
	
	
	For these reasons the application is refused.

Judgment


	
	WARD JA: Mr Potier was convicted in October 2006 of an offence of solicit to murder contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The conduct in respect of which he was convicted was of soliciting a then fellow gaol inmate (“A”) to murder Mr Potier’s ex de facto wife, Ms Oswald. At the time of the commission of the offence, in early 2002, Mr Potier was in custody at Long Bay gaol awaiting sentence on an earlier conviction of two counts of solicit to murder, the intended victims in relation to those offences being Ms Oswald and her partner, Mr Wakeham. The earlier offences had taken place in May 2000, while Mr Potier was in detention at Villawood Detention Centre as an illegal immigrant. The timing of the later offence (which the Crown maintained was relevant to the question of motive) was before Mr Potier was due to be sentenced for the earlier offences.
	
	
	Following the jury’s guilty verdict on 3 October 2006, the trial judge, Shadbolt DCJ, sentenced Mr Potier on 13 November 2006 to imprisonment for 12 years to date from 7 August 2006 and to expire on 6 August 2018, with a non-parole period of 7 years to expire on 6 August 2013.
	
	
	On 15 September 2014, Mr Potier filed an application seeking to appeal against his 2006 conviction. An extension of time for the filing of that application is necessary given the lapse of time since his 2006 conviction and sentence.
	


Background


	
	As is apparent from the above brief introduction, Mr Potier has been found guilty in two separate trials, the first in 2001 and the second in 2006, of successive offences of soliciting to murder Ms Oswald. As some of the evidence at the first trial was adduced at the second (which is the subject of complaint by Mr Potier) it is necessary to set out a brief summary of the successive trials.
	
	
	By way of general background, I note that Mr Potier is a citizen of the United Kingdom. From around 1989 he was in a de facto relationship with a fellow UK citizen, Ms Oswald. The couple had a daughter. The relationship between Mr Potier and Ms Oswald broke down in August 1999. Family Law proceedings were commenced in England.
	
	
	In December 1999, Mr Potier flew to Australia with the couple’s daughter using false passports. In February 2000, following information provided to the federal police by an acquaintance he had made after his arrival in this country (Ms Conway), Mr Potier was detained and held in custody, first in Melbourne at the Maribyrnong Detention Centre and then in Sydney at the Villawood Detention Centre. Ms Oswald, who came to Australia in early 2000 to search for her daughter, had by then begun a relationship with a former acquaintance, Mr Wakeham.
	
	
	Ms Conway was in contact with Mr Potier while he was in detention. She contacted police to report conversations with Mr Potier in which, according to her, Mr Potier was seeking her assistance to arrange for the murder of Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham. The police obtained listening device interception warrants in respect of Ms Conway’s home telephone and arranged for an undercover police operative (“M”) to contact Mr Potier. M did so both by telephone and in person at the Villawood Detention Centre. A number of conversations between Mr Potier and each of Ms Conway and M, respectively, were recorded, as authorised by warrants the lawfulness of which is not challenged. The authenticity of those recordings remains hotly contested by Mr Potier.
	


First trial and 2002 offence


	
	Mr Potier was charged with two counts of soliciting M to murder Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham between 2 and 8 May 2000, while Mr Potier was in detention at Villawood (the 2000 offences).
	
	
	Mr Potier’s first trial took place between 19 September 2001 and 16 October 2001. The evidence given by Ms Conway and M at that trial is summarised in the later Court of Criminal Appeal judgment in which Mr Potier’s conviction appeal was dismissed (Potier v R [2006] NSWCCA 27). Relevantly, it was Ms Conway’s evidence that Mr Potier had adopted the expression “gathering evidence” as a code for killing Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham. An understanding of that code assisted in interpreting the conversations between Mr Potier and M. Recordings of the respective conversations were played to the jury.
	
	
	Mr Potier was represented by counsel at his first trial. He gave evidence at that trial.
	
	
	Mr Potier was found guilty by jury verdict on 16 October 2001 and was convicted of those two counts of soliciting to murder. On 18 October 2001, Mr Potier filed a notice of appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Before his sentencing for the 2000 offences, the events the subject of the second trial took place. Between 1 January 2002 and 8 February 2002, a number of conversations between Mr Potier and a fellow prison inmate “A” were recorded on a listening device placed in a TV set in A’s cell. The Crown’s case was that in those conversations Mr Potier again solicited the murder of Ms Oswald. Mr Potier was charged in relation to this offence in April 2002.
	
	
	On 10 May 2002, Mr Potier was sentenced on each of the 2000 offence count to imprisonment for 6 years and 8 months to commence on 8 May 2000 and to expire on 7 January 2007, with a non-parole period of 5 years to expire on 7 May 2005.
	
	
	On 29 June 2002, the Crown filed a notice of appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence. Mr Potier in turn appealed against the sentence.
	


Determination of appeals regarding 2000 offences


	
	The respective sentence appeals in relation to the 2000 offences were heard on 21 April 2004 separately from, and before, Mr Potier’s conviction appeal. On 25 August 2004, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Wood CJ at CL, Simpson and Bell JJ) refused Mr Potier leave to appeal against sentence and allowed the Crown appeal (R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136), re-sentencing Mr Potier to a total term of imprisonment of 8 years and 8 months to commence on 8 May 2000 and to expire on 7 January 2009, with a total non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months to expire on 7 August 2006. On 11 October 2004, a special leave application to the High Court was filed by Mr Potier in relation to this decision. This was later abandoned.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s conviction appeal, which had in the meantime been struck out of the list subject to being restored when it was ready to proceed, was heard on 30 September 2005 and 5 October 2005. On 17 February 2006, the Court of Criminal Appeal (McClellan CJ at CL, Hislop and Rothman JJ) dismissed Mr Potier’s appeal against conviction (Potier v R [2006] NSWCCA 27). On 6 September 2013, Mr Potier’s special leave application to the High Court relating to his convictions for the 2000 offences was dismissed by Hayne and Bell JJ (Potier v The Queen [2013] HCA Trans 207).
	
	
	It was not until after the dismissal by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2006 of Mr Potier’s appeal against his first set of convictions that the Crown proceeded with a bill of indictment in respect of the further solicit to murder offence alleged to have been committed by Mr Potier in early 2002.
	


Second trial


	
	Mr Potier’s second trial commenced in August 2006.
	


Application to adduce tendency and coincidence evidence


	
	In March 2006, prior to the commencement of the second trial, the trial judge heard an application by the Crown for leave to adduce tendency and coincidence evidence, including the evidence given by Mr Potier in his first trial. The substance of the tendency and coincidence evidence was identified in an amended notice served on 2 March 2006.
	
	
	The substance of the tendency evidence sought to be adduced was that Mr Potier had a tendency to solicit others to murder his ex de facto wife. The substance of the coincidence evidence sought to be adduced was that Mr Potier had solicited others to murder his ex de facto wife on two separate occasions (those being the occasions the subject of the respective 2000 and 2002 offences).
	
	
	As to the 2000 offences, the documents within which the substance of the said tendency and coincidence evidence was said to be contained were identified in the amended notice. They included statements and transcripts of evidence from various witnesses in the first trial, including particular pages of an electronically recorded police interview (ERISP) given by Mr Potier on 9 May 2000 and the whole of the transcript of the evidence given at the trial by Mr Potier. Also included were the monitored conversations and telephone calls and extracts from the listening device/telephone interception transcripts of the conversations between Mr Potier and each of Ms Conway and M.
	
	
	As to the 2002 offence, the documents within which the tendency and coincidence evidence was said to be contained included the listening device transcripts of conversations between Mr Potier and A on 2 and 6 February 2002.
	
	
	On the hearing of the Crown’s application to adduce tendency and coincidence evidence, Mr Potier was represented by Mr Terracini SC, appearing with Ms Moen and Ms Byrne of counsel.
	
	
	Mr Terracini informed his Honour that no objection was taken to the adequacy of the notice. Objection was taken to the whole of the proposed tendency and coincidence evidence on the basis that its conceded significant probative value did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect (Evidence Act 1995, ss 97 and 101(v)). Nevertheless, the stated position of the defence was that, even if the balance of the tendency and coincidence evidence were to be admitted, the transcript of the evidence given by Mr Potier in his first trial should be excluded. Mr Terracini submitted that the evidence given by Mr Potier at the first trial should not be admitted unless he gave an inconsistent version of that evidence at the forthcoming trial.
	
	
	No objection was raised to the effect that the fact of Mr Potier’s conviction was not specifically listed in the tendency and coincidence notice. Furthermore, the Crown made clear on that occasion its position that one of the important non-tendency uses of the evidence of conviction was that it provided a motive for the offence.
	
	
	The argument before his Honour in March 2006 proceeded on the basis that it was inevitable that Mr Potier’s conviction for the earlier offences would be made known to the jury; indeed that was the basis for the defence submission as to the prejudicial effect of the proposed tendency and coincidence evidence. There was no submission by the defence on that occasion to the effect that reference should not be made to Mr Potier’s conviction for the 2000 offences.
	
	
	Both Ms Conway and M were cross-examined on the voir dire by Mr Terracini. Among other things, M was cross-examined as to the references to notes in the transcript of one of the recordings. This related to a conversation on 5 May 2000. M gave evidence that there was a problem with the piece of equipment which had been used; that it was a technical problem of which he was not aware prior to using the equipment; and that, once he finished the telephone conversation with Mr Potier and replayed that version of it, he realised that there were problems with missing parts of the conversation. M said that he thought that STIB (State Technical Investigation Branch), a section within the Special Services Group attached to the New South Wales police, had been asked to analyse the tape and that the cause of the problem could not be determined - “there was just a stopping and starting possibly of the tape with the actual set tape”. M also gave evidence that the recording equipment was locked away after use.
	
	
	It should be noted that the Commissioner for Police in due course claimed and was granted public interest immunity in respect of information that would divulge details of the technology and equipment used in the investigations concerning Mr Potier. (A claim was also made for immunity as to the methodology used in solicit to murder cases investigations but it is not clear that this latter issue was finally determined. Nothing turns on this.)
	
	
	Consistently with the Crown’s tendency and coincidence notice, the Crown submitted that the conduct of the accused according to the evidence of the witnesses at the first trial could demonstrate that the accused had a tendency to have a particular state of mind, that is of murderous intent, towards Ms Oswald at the time of the subsequent offence; and that the conduct in the first trial was relevant to the credibility of two or more witnesses, on the basis that common sense and experience rendered it objectively improbable that similar allegations would be independently made by such witnesses unless they were true.
	
	
	On 24 March 2006, the trial judge gave judgment on the Crown’s application. His Honour gave leave to the Crown to adduce, as both tendency and coincidence evidence, the recordings played at the first trial of the conversations with Ms Conway and M but not the evidence of Mr Potier at that trial. His Honour said that he came to the same conclusion as to the admissibility of the evidence whichever of the Ellis (R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; (2003) 58 NSWLR 700) or Pfennig (Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; (1995) 182 CLR 461) tests applied; being of the view both that the prejudicial quality of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its probative value and that, if the evidence of Ms Conway and M were to be accepted, there would be no rational hypothesis consistent with Mr Potier’s innocence.
	
	
	His Honour observed that the fact that Mr Potier had been convicted (of the first offences) could not be avoided, since much of the conversation between Mr Potier and A was about the likely outcome of Mr Potier’s plan. A’s evidence, in that regard, was to the effect that Mr Potier had expressed to him the belief that if there were “no Ms Oswald” his appeal would succeed. On the present application, Counsel who prepared certain of the submissions, but did not appear, for Mr Potier points to the illogicality of such a belief. That, however, goes only to whether the jury accepted A’s evidence as to the relevant conversations. That a belief such as A says was expressed by Mr Potier might be unfounded or illogical is beside the point.
	


Conduct of second trial


	
	The second trial was listed to commence on 7 August 2006. Mr Potier’s defence was at that stage being funded by the Legal Aid Commission. Shortly before the commencement of the trial, an application was made by Mr Potier’s then Counsel (Mr Terracini) for leave to withdraw from the proceedings, indicating that this was on the basis that he was not able to conduct the case in accordance with Mr Potier’s instructions and at the same time comply with his duty to the Court. His Honour granted that leave. There was a re-assignment of legal aid to permit Mr Healey and Mr Lowe of Counsel to be retained in the matter, instructed by the same solicitor who had had the conduct of the matter at the time of Mr Terracini’s withdrawal, Ms McGowan.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s second trial in fact did not commence until 14 August 2006. Shortly thereafter, the jury was discharged when it was discovered that one of the jurors had a very poor command of English. The trial re-commenced on 16 August 2006.
	
	
	In the course of the Crown’s opening, the jury was told that Mr Potier had come to Australia under a false name and a false passport. (One of Mr Potier’s complaints in this Court is that the trial judge referred in summing up to the jury to his entry to Australia on a false passport even though he, Mr Potier, had not given evidence of that fact. However, evidence to that effect was given at the second trial by Ms Conway and there was no evidence to dispute that. Furthermore, in the recorded conversation with M on 2 May 2000, Mr Potier can be heard confirming to M that he came to Australia on a forged passport.)
	
	
	The jury was also told that Mr Potier had been found guilty of the first offence but caution was sounded as to the use to be made of that information.
	
	
	In Mr Healey’s opening to the jury, he informed the jury that Mr Potier challenged the recordings in the trial that had led to his conviction (i.e., the first trial) and said that they were unreliable.
	
	
	On 7 September 2006 (day 15 of the second trial), Mr Healey was granted leave for him and Mr Lowe to withdraw from the matter. This occurred at a time when A, the prison informant, was under cross-examination. Mr Healey’s withdrawal was precipitated by an incident that had occurred the day before, to which I will refer later, and which had prompted Mr Healey to request, unsuccessfully, that the jury be discharged. It will be referred to as the “Carlos” incident. Leave was also granted for Ms McGowan to withdraw. As a consequence, Mr Potier was thereafter unrepresented.
	
	
	His Honour refused Mr Potier’s application to adjourn the hearing following the withdrawal of his legal representation and refused Mr Potier’s next application, which was for the judge to disqualify himself for apprehended bias. Thereafter, Mr Potier had the conduct of his own defence. He made further unsuccessful applications for the adjournment of the hearing and for the jury to be discharged, in circumstances to which I will refer in due course. Meanwhile, on 13 September 2006, his legal aid was terminated.
	
	
	Mr Potier chose, as was his right, not to give evidence himself in his second trial. He called evidence from a number of prison inmates or former inmates: Mr Prasad, who described the pay phones in the “lockups” and said A was a “show-off” and a “gossiper”; Mr Hughes, who said that A was something of a gaol house lawyer and prone to exaggeration; Mr Parkes, who said he did not like A because he gave out incorrect legal advice and “big-noted” himself, and who gave evidence as to the time it took to get a television set in prison; and Mr McPhall, who said he thought A was a rumour monger and a gaol lawyer, who “big noted himself”, exaggerated and invented things, and was “a bit of a joke”; and who gave evidence that in gaol a television was a “number one possession”.
	
	
	Mr Potier also sought to call evidence in person or by videolink from a solicitor in Glasgow, Mr Edward MacKechnie. The Crown refused to meet the cost of Mr Potier adducing that evidence in that manner. The trial judge initially ruled against Mr Potier’s application to adduce evidence from Mr MacKechnie on the basis that it was not relevant but shortly thereafter revisited this ruling, being persuaded that the proposed evidence might have some tenuous relevance to one of the ways in which he understood Mr Potier was seeking to defend the allegations. Mr MacKechnie’s sworn statement was ultimately read to the jury with the consent of the Crown. He was not cross-examined on that statement.
	
	
	Mr MacKechnie’s statement included that Ms Oswald, a close friend, had told him during the period October 2001 to March 2002 that she was not living in Scotland and that he had told this to Mr Potier at the same time; and therefore that at the time of the alleged offence (January – February 2002) Mr Potier knew that Ms Oswald was not with her parents in Scotland or in Scotland at all. Mr Potier maintains the relevance of this lies in two respects: first, to show that he, Mr Potier, knew all along that A was never serious (because A thought Ms Oswald was in Scotland) and, secondly, that Mr Potier was having a joke at A’s expense (because A was “in fantasy land”).
	
	
	Mr Potier also sought to call evidence from A’s ex-wife (to show A’s true character – in essence to prove that A had given false evidence to the Court that he was still married); from Mr Wakeham (as to whether he had made certain threats to Ms Conway); and from a former inmate named Warren Richards (to say that Mr Potier had told him he was playing a joke on A and to say that A was regarded as “out with the fairies”).
	
	
	In the course of discussion in the absence of the jury on 19 September 2006, his Honour clarified with Mr Potier the defences he was seeking to raise. Mr Potier agreed that his case in defence was a combination of the following: that the recorded calls were not his; a defence of mental ill-health; that A had malevolently tried to entrap him and that Mr Potier was humouring him; and that he was playing a joke on A because he was privy to information in January/February 2002 that Ms Oswald was not in Rhynie (her parents’ home) but elsewhere in Scotland.
	
	
	Mr Potier, in his submissions on this appeal, summarises his defence case in broadly similar terms as being that: A was “a joke, lair, fantasy man” prone to exaggeration and often “out with the fairies”; that he was playing a joke on A; that he did not believe that A was serious; that he knew that Ms Oswald was in England, not with her parents in Aberdeenshire, and therefore that nothing could or would happen to her; and that A had a strong motive to lie, in that he wanted and was given a TV in his cell. (The listening device recording the conversations in A’s cell had been placed in the TV.) Nothing further was raised as to any defence based on his mental health.
	
	
	Pausing there, the case that A was trying to entrap him or that Mr Potier was playing a joke on A is clearly inconsistent with any denial that the recorded conversations with A took place; rather, it assumes that the conversations took place and seeks to explain away their significance.
	
	
	As noted earlier, the jury returned a guilty verdict on 3 October 2006 and Mr Potier was sentenced on 13 November 2006. His non-parole period has now expired.
	
	
	In the period after his conviction and sentence, Mr Potier has pursued or been party to various court proceedings both in Australia and in the United Kingdom. For present purposes, the most relevant is his application for special leave to appeal to the High Court from his conviction in the first trial. That application focussed on issues in relation to the authenticity or integrity of the 2000 recordings (see [50] below). Mr Potier was represented by Mr Brezniak of Counsel on that application, which was dismissed in September 2013, thus bringing to finality Mr Potier’s appeals from his conviction on the first trial.
	
	
	On 15 September 2014, Mr Potier filed the present application to appeal from his conviction in his second trial.
	


Recordings


	
	The integrity of the respective audio recordings is at the heart of much of Mr Potier’s complaint as to the reliability of his conviction in the first trial and that in his second trial. It is therefore convenient, before addressing the specific grounds of appeal, to summarise what Mr Potier contends to be the position in relation to the respective sets of recordings and his complaints in relation thereto.
	


2000 recordings


	
	In his first trial, at which Mr Potier had the benefit of legal representation throughout, the Crown relied on recordings of conversations between 2-9 May 2000 between Mr Potier and each of Ms Conway and M. Mr Potier maintained that those recordings (the 2000 recordings) had been altered, manufactured or created by some unknown method. His position as to whether it was his voice on the tapes was somewhat unclear.
	
	
	In the second trial, in the absence of the jury, his Honour asked Mr Healey at one point whether there was some contravening view that the conversations had not taken place. Mr Healey’s response was that this was “yet to be determined”. Mr Healey later informed the Court that Mr Potier was suggesting there had been alterations to the recordings or “products” of the conversations with M. Mr Healey said that it had “always” been the defence’s position that Mr Potier disputed the authenticity or integrity of all recordings; that Mr Potier disputed the conversations and that Mr Potier was suggesting alteration of the products of the telephone recordings of the conversation.
	
	
	Though Mr Potier later made statements to his Honour as to whether he was disputing the conversations which were on their face inconsistent (I refer to these later), his final position appears to have been that, while the voice on the audio recordings may have been his, there had been some alteration of the recordings (the equivalent perhaps of an audio “cut and paste”) so as to produce a manufactured compilation of a conversation that was not in fact the actual conversation that had taken place.
	


The “Telstra material”


	
	In the first trial, the defence was served with a statement made on 27 June 2000 by an officer of Cable & Wireless Optus (Mr David Finlay). That company was Ms Conway’s telephone provider. In that statement, Mr Finlay explained a process known as a “webtrace” by which information such as call charges from the Optus network is derived electronically.
	
	
	Annexed to Mr Finlay’s statement was a webtrace that had been carried out by Cable & Wireless Optus of calls to and from Ms Conway’s telephone number for the period from 22 April 2000 to 12 May 2000. The significance attributed by the defence to that webtrace is that it did not record or register five of the nine calls allegedly made to Ms Conway by Mr Potier in May 2000 (the “missing calls”).
	
	
	Mr Finlay gave an explanation at the first trial as to why telephone calls made to Ms Conway’s landline might not appear on the Optus webtrace. That explanation related to whether calls forwarded from a Telstra exchange were forwarded to an Optus exchange or switch where the number being called was “attached” or were forwarded to an Optus exchange where the number was “not attached”; since that affected what number would appear in the relevant search field. The webtrace process involved manually searching records on the switch by way of entry into the system of a particular telephone number and the requested time period. Obviously, the conclusion to be drawn from this evidence was that if the incorrect number was entered into the relevant search field the webtrace might be unreliable or inaccurate.
	
	
	Mr Finlay explained that a call could be on the system but not found when the webtrace was conducted. He accepted the propositions put to him by defence counsel that: first, he could not say categorically that there was a call at a particular time if it were not on the webtrace and, second, that “another” explanation for the non-appearance of a call on the webtrace was that it “just could not have been made at all”.
	
	
	Mr Potier understands the import of Mr Finlay’s evidence to be that there are only two possible explanations for the fact that five of the nine telephone calls did not register or appear on the webtrace of Ms Conway’s telephone: that the wrong search methods had been used or that the calls had not been made. That was not Mr Finlay’s evidence. Rather, Mr Finlay gave one explanation for calls not appearing on the webtrace and accepted that there was another possible explanation as put to him in cross-examination; he did not in terms say that there were only two possible explanations. A third possible explanation that would accord with Mr Finlay’s explanation of the webtrace process, and one which assumes some relevance in light of later events, would appear to be that the correct search methods were used but the correct telephone number from which the call was made had not been identified.
	
	
	Mr Finlay also said, when cross-examined, that if one knew the number of the party making the call then a better option would be to go to that number and check that number. He accepted the proposition put to him by defence counsel that the “only other way” (i.e., the only way to identify whether a call had been made to Ms Conway’s telephone number from a Telstra number, apart from the Optus webtrace) was to find the call charge records for the Telstra numbers.
	
	
	On 10 October 2001, shortly prior to the conclusion of the first trial and unbeknownst to the defence at that stage, Detective Inspector Laidlaw wrote to Telstra with an urgent request for a call charge record search on three specified telephone numbers (referable to three Telstra payphones at the Villawood Detention Centre) and a statement outlining the results of such a search for production in the criminal proceedings. That letter included the following statement, which Mr Potier treats as an admission on the part of the Crown that the calls were made from one of those three payphones:
	


A number of telephone calls have been legally intercepted between the accused and the police informant. Investigators conducted a ‘webtrace’ via Cable Wireless Optus on the informant’s landline, however due to the inefficiency of that trace a number of intercepted telephone [sic] do not appear. These calls all originate from the nominated Telstra payphones from the V.I.D.C.  Therefore the Crown Prosecutor seeks to rectify this by the supply of Call Charge Records from these services. (my emphasis)


	
	A statement dated 11 October 2001 was prepared on Telstra letterhead by the Administrative Officer Law Enforcement Liaison at Telstra, in which information was provided as to the results of that search. Annexed to the statement were the call charge records for the nominated three Telstra payphones for the period 1-9 May 2000. It is not disputed that the five missing calls were not recorded as calls made from any of those phones.
	
	
	The Telstra call charge records, not tendered or disclosed to the defence in the first trial, are referred to by Mr Potier in his submissions as the “Telstra material”. Mr Potier emphasises that the existence of the Telstra material was not known to the defence during his first trial. The defence was, however, aware that the missing calls did not appear on the Optus webtrace and had elicited evidence from Mr Finlay as to alternative ways to investigate whether there was a record of those calls having been made. Hence, it might be argued that the Telstra material was constructively available to Mr Potier at that first trial. Nothing, however, turns on this for present purposes, since the existence of the Telstra material was certainly known to the defence by the time of the second trial.
	
	
	The suggestion that the 10 October 2001 letter from Detective Inspector Laidlaw constituted some form of binding admission by the prosecution that the missing calls had been made from one of the nominated three payphones (and no other telephone in the detention centre), such that the prosecution cannot now be heard to argue that the fact that the calls were missing from the Optus webtrace is of no significance, cannot be sustained.
	
	
	The Police Act 1990 (NSW) establishes the police force in this State. In State of New South Wales v Fahy [2006] NSWCA 64; (2006) Aust Torts Reports 81-865 Basten JA held that the NSW Police Force is not a legal entity in its own right. Although the Police Legislation Amendment (Civil Liability) Act 2003 (NSW) had, for the avoidance of doubt, provided that a police officer was an employee of the Crown for the purposes of that Act, this was repealed in July 2004. Nevertheless, at common law, a member of the police force was regarded at least in some sense as a servant of the Crown (see Enever v R [1906] HCA 3; (1906) 3 CLR 969). However, Detective Inspector Laidlaw was not the prosecuting authority. He was an investigating officer. There is no basis to suggest that he had any personal knowledge of which, if any, of the available telephones might have been used to make the disputed “missing” calls. The statement made in his letter of 10 October 2001 can at best reflect his assumption that those telephones were the ones that had or may have been used.
	
	
	Even if Detective Inspector Laidlaw’s statement could otherwise have bound the Crown, admissions made other than in the formal course of proceedings (such as the statement relied upon in this letter) have been said to have merely an evidentiary significance, the so-called “admitting” party being entitled to dispute the accuracy of the admission – by evidence that it was influenced by mistake, misunderstanding or ignorance, or that it was otherwise inaccurate or unreliable (see Nominal Defendant v Gabriel [2007] NSWCA 52; (2007) 71 NSWLR 150 at [144] – albeit in the civil context).
	
	
	In the present case, Detective Inspector Laidlaw made clear in his evidence at the second trial that it had simply been his assumption that the calls were made from one of the pay phones. He said there were other telephones in the detention centre to which inmates could have access. There was also evidence at the first trial from a Mr Schofield, an officer at the Long Bay correctional centre, to the effect that on occasion inmates, including Mr Potier, had used a telephone in his office to make telephone calls.
	
	
	There is therefore room for doubt as to the evidentiary significance of a statement made in a letter written by someone not party to the conversations and not present at the time that any of the missing calls were made (assuming for this purpose that the calls were made); and obviously written in the context of an urgent enquiry as to the call charge records for telephones from which it was believed or assumed those calls had been made.
	
	
	It is not suggested that any search was made of call records referable to Mr Schofield’s telephone in order to exclude the possibility that the missing calls had been made from that telephone.
	
	
	In those circumstances no more than nominal, if any, weight could be attached to the statement in Detective Inspector Laidlaw’s 10 October 2001 letter.
	
	
	As noted, by the time of the second trial, Mr Potier and his then defence team were aware of the existence of the Telstra material. This was because it had been disclosed in an affidavit filed on 13 January 2005 in the course of the 2006 Court of Criminal Appeal conviction appeal proceedings. The relevant call charge records for the three Telstra payphones in the detention centre were annexed to that affidavit.
	
	
	In the course of the second trial, Acting Superintendent Laidlaw was asked “if” he had received the Telstra call charge records on 11 October 2001 what he believed he did with them. His response was that he believed he had “[b]rought it to the notice of the Crown Prosecutor”. While the question to which he gave that answer was framed hypothetically, Acting Superintendent Laidlaw later in the course of the cross-examination confirmed that he was quite sure that he had given the Telstra material to the Crown Prosecutor. He said that he assumed it would have been served on defence counsel, from which answer it is apparent that he professed no personal knowledge of whether that had occurred.
	
	
	Mr Potier points outs that, in the course of the defence summing up to the jury in the first trial, his then Counsel had emphasised the missing calls from the webtrace and had said:
	


The police with all their resources if they had ever checked the [Optus] web trace … would have realised that these calls weren’t there and if they had taken place you might well think that they could have through contact with Telstra, have obtained call charge records which would establish just that.

from which it seems he concludes that the significance of the missing calls, and hence the relevance of the Telstra material, must have been clear to the prosecution. Acting Superintendent Laidlaw was cross-examined to that effect at the second trial.


	
	In the present proceedings, Mr Potier has submitted that the evidence that the Crown prosecutor had the Telstra material (prior to the end of the first trial) could not have been considered by the High Court when the special leave application was determined because it was not known at that stage that there had been a “deliberate withholding” of that information. However, the special leave application was in September 2013. Mr Potier accepts that he knew from around January 2005 that the call charge records (i.e., the Telstra material) had been received. Acting Superintendent Laidlaw had been cross-examined on this very issue in August 2006, well before the High Court special leave application in September 2013. The High Court application focussed on the Telstra material as being fresh evidence not available at the first trial. Therefore, any allegation as to the deliberate withholding of this material was one that could have been raised at that stage.
	
	
	On the special leave application, Mr Brezniak conceded to the High Court that the call charge records were available by the time of the second trial. He accepted that the material that came to light close to the end of the first trial was that the three phones in the detention centre area to which Mr Potier had access were not the source of the calls and that there was no evidence as to whether the calls from the office of Mr Schofield, the officer within the detention centre’s telephone service, to which Mr Potier had access, might have been the source of the calls.
	
	
	Mr Brezniak dismissed the last possibility as a red herring on the basis that there were no calls from that telephone on the Optus webtrace. There appears, however, to be a circularity of reasoning in that last proposition, since it was apparently agreed by Mr Finlay that calls missing from the Optus webtrace might be able to be found by reference to a search of the call charge records of the party making the call – hence it would be necessary to obtain call charge records from Mr Schofield’s telephone number in order to exclude that possibility.
	


Production of the original 2000 recordings


	
	On 27 June 2008, an order to produce was issued by the Supreme Court, at the request of Mr Potier, requiring the Commissioner of Police to produce the following (Appendix 7 to Mr Potier’s submissions):
	



	
	A certified copy of all of the original recordings obtained under [identified warrants] in October 2001.
	
	
	A certified copy of the recordings played to the jury obtained under [an identified warrant] in October 2001.
	
	
	Copies of any technical analysis carried out on the recordings by any persons identifying the same.
	
	
	Copies of any reports, advices, communications of any kind concerning the modification of the recordings obtained under the warrants in October 2001.
	
	
	Copies of all communications relating to items 1 to 4 of above identifying the sender and recipient, together with dates between your servants and agents and representatives of the Crown Solicitor’s Office, Director of Public Prosecutions or Crown Prosecution Service.
	



	
	In its terms, the order to produce called only for material in relation to the 2000 recordings. The Commissioner produced a number of recordings in answer to that order to produce. Mr Potier says that these include four recordings not previously disclosed to the defence.
	
	
	It is necessary to descend into some detail as to precisely what recordings were produced in answer to the order to produce, given the significance that Mr Potier attaches to that material.
	
	
	On 23 October 2008, the matter was before a Registrar in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Counsel appearing for the Commissioner of Police, Ms England, informed the Court that there was production (in answer to par 1 of the order to produce), with no objection to access, of: one disc of telephone intercept material, four discs of listening device material and a two page statement dated 30 September 2008 of a police officer, Mark Alan Jones, certifying the listening device discs. She informed the Court that there was also production, again in answer to par 1 of the order to produce, of three discs of telephone intercept material in respect of which there was an objection to access on privacy grounds.
	
	
	Ms England explained that the discs in respect of which there was an objection to access contained records of 319 telephone calls on Ms Conway’s telephone, interspersed with which were the calls by Mr Potier to Ms Conway.
	
	
	Nothing was produced in answer to par 3 of the order to produce, on the basis that the event had not occurred. Orders 4 and 5 were opposed.
	
	
	As to par 2 of the order to produce, there was apparently an agreement reached with Mr Potier limiting this to the material listed in a document headed “List of recordings played to jury from first trial” that had been provided by Mr Potier. After taking instructions, Ms England then informed the Court that all of the material that had already been produced in answer to par 1 of the order (by which, somewhat confusingly, she referred to the three compact discs) answered par 2 of the order to produce.
	
	
	Mr Potier took issue with the proposition that material produced in answer to par 1 of the order to produce also answered par 2 of the order to produce. He referred to an affidavit that had been sworn in the 2006 conviction appeal proceedings that he said identified that there were two distinct and separate versions of the recordings (i.e., as I understand it, the original recordings obtained under warrant and the recordings played to the jury). He pressed for the production of the two sets of the 2000 recordings.
	
	
	On 13 November 2008, two sets of recordings were produced. According to the transcript, on that occasion the Crown tendered an affidavit of Detective Senior Constable Robert Hollows, in which he stated that he had collected the original compact discs of the “paragraph 2 material” from the office of the DPP, had made copies and had returned the copies and originals to the DPP.
	
	
	On that occasion, Mr Potier took issue with the statement by Ms England on the previous occasion that the “event” referred to in par 3 of the order to produce had not happened.
	
	
	Mr Potier drew attention to a document (attached to Mr Potier’s submissions with the annotation “MFI 13”) that was a redacted version of an STIB job report on NSW Police Service letterhead dated 26 June 2001.
	
	
	In that report, reference is made to four exhibits – an unmarked compact disc, and three cassettes. The report states that two of the cassette tapes “were affected by interference caused by the mobile phone” and that this inference cannot be removed or the product improved. In relation to the other cassette tape, the report states that the recording is “affected by some form of inference which leaves short bursts of blank portions between the conversation” and that the missing conversation is not on the tape and hence this problem cannot be improved. As to the compact disc, the report states that it is a computer data CD and cannot be played in a CD player; and that “[w]e do not have the equipment to work on this CD”. Pausing here, this job report is consistent with evidence given by M at the first trial, namely that recordings had been sent to STIB for analysis but STIB was not able to identify the problem.
	
	
	The report also states that the two cassette tapes and a third item (the description of which has been redacted) have been copied onto three individual compact discs. This report can only be referring to the 2000 recordings since it predates the events of 2002.
	
	
	The contention made by Mr Potier to the Court in November 2008 was that the document marked as MFI 13, i.e., the STIB job report to which I have referred above, fell within par 3 of the order to produce (and hence should have been produced). Nothing flowed from that, however, presumably because Mr Potier had in his possession a copy of the STIB job report anyway.
	
	
	What can be discerned from the above is that, as a result of the production in November 2008 of documents in answer to the June 2008 notice to produce, Mr Potier obtained access to two sets of the 2000 recordings, those being: first, the certified original recordings made in the telephone interception branch (referred to by the registrar as the “raw format”) (the par 1 material) and, second, a set of the recordings played to the jury in the first trial (of the particular conversations identified in the list Mr Potier had prepared, to which I will refer as the “jury recordings”) (the par 2 material).
	
	
	Mr Potier complains that the existence of two sets of the 2000 recordings (i.e., the raw format and the jury recordings) was not disclosed either to the jury (presumably referring to the jury in the first trial) or to the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2006. He maintains that a comparison of the two sets of recordings shows that it was wrong for the Crown to tell the jury that the recordings played to them were genuine.
	
	
	Pausing there, it does not follow that, if the recording of only a particular number of conversations was played to the jury (being extracted, so to speak, from an original recording containing a large number of irrelevant conversations), that which was played to the jury was not a genuine recording of the relevant conversations. From my review of the transcript of the second trial, there was no suggestion at any stage that what had been played to the jury at the first trial was the whole of the telephone conversations recorded on the listening device on Ms Conway’s landline (in respect of which the Court and Mr Potier were informed there were a large number of unrelated conversations).
	
	
	Mr Potier also says that it was false to say that the recordings played in both trials were from an original copy retained in the telephone interception branch.
	
	
	His submissions in relation to this issue seem, at least to some extent, to conflate the 2000 recordings and the 2002 recordings because Mr Potier refers to the “first 2 February recording” being blank and that this was only discovered by him when the respondents produced the original recordings in accordance with the order to produce. However, the only relevant 2 February recording could be a recording taken in 2002 and the 2002 recordings were not the subject of the 2008 order to produce. (I will come back to Mr Potier’s complaint as to the February 2002 recording shortly.)
	


Summary of submissions as to the Conway recordings


	
	In his submissions in these proceedings, Mr Potier makes three points as to the 2000 recordings of conversations between himself and Ms Conway.
	
	
	First, he says that, insofar as it is suggested that the missing calls were not shown on the Telstra material because another telephone had been used, this is inconsistent with the letter from Detective Inspector Laidlaw to Telstra (MHP3), namely that these were the pay phones that had been used. (This relies upon the statement in that letter being some form of binding admission against the Crown, which as I have explained above it is not.)
	
	
	Second, he says that the suggestion that another phone may have been used cannot be accepted because at the time the calls were made, according to the webtrace, Ms Conway’s phone was not receiving calls from any number and, further, that during the period from 2 to 9 May 2000, there were no phone calls from any number of the same length of the recordings that were played, therefore, he says the calls were not made. (This submission does not take into account the possibility that the Optus webtrace had not registered a call to Ms Conway’s phone from another telephone, the call charge records for which have never been obtained.)
	
	
	Third, Mr Potier says that the police did carry out investigations as to whether any other phones were used to contact Ms Conway (referring to Detective Inspector Laidlaw’s evidence T 364.40-50) and that there is no evidence that another phone was used. That involves a misreading of Detective Inspector Laidlaw’s evidence. Moreover, at the first trial there was evidence raising the possibility that another telephone had been used; namely that of Mr Schofield. Reference was made to this in the evidence given by the then Acting Superintendent Laidlaw at the second trial. (The Crown maintains that it was not obliged to prove the phone from which the calls were made; that it has established the provenance of the recordings; and that Ms Conway gave evidence identifying the voices of Mr Potier and herself on the recordings and as to what was said in the conversations.)
	
	
	Mr Potier also raises particular issues as to the conversations with Ms Conway that were recorded on 2, 5 and 8 May 2000, to which I refer when considering the challenge he makes to the authenticity of the recordings of conversations with M below.
	


Submissions of Mr Potier re recordings of conversations in 2000 with “M”


	
	Mr Potier has prepared a schedule (MHP 6) in which he sets out his analysis of the list of the recordings played to the jury of his conversations in 2000 with each of Ms Conway and M. In that document he highlights the five calls missing from the Optus webtrace and points to various discrepancies he has identified between the length of the original recordings and those played to the jury. He has also raised an issue as to one of the phone conversations overlapping with another.
	
	
	It appears that Mr Potier has prepared that analysis based at least in part on a comparison between the start/stop times of the recordings shown in the police audio log in relation to the listening device that recorded the meetings with M and the length of the recordings played to the jury.
	
	
	The recordings of conversations with M where Mr Potier has identified a difference between the length of the recordings obtained under warrant and the recordings as played to the jury or has otherwise challenged the timing of the recordings are: first, his meeting with M on 2 May 2000; a telephone conversation with M on 4 May 2000; a telephone conversation with M on 5 May 2000; and a meeting with M on 8 May 2000.
	


2 May 2000 recording of meeting with M


	
	As to the meeting on 2 May 2000, Mr Potier notes that the officer recorded the start/stop times at the beginning and end of the recording as being 7pm to 7.30pm but that the tape played to the jury was 34 minutes in length. He concludes that there were four extra minutes on the recording played to the jury; by inference suggesting that those were added to the recording in some fashion.
	
	
	Mr Potier also places emphasis on what he maintains was directly inconsistent evidence given by two police officers as to the 2 May 2000 recorded meeting, his submission being that one of the two officers must have been lying.
	
	
	The meeting between M and Mr Potier was recorded by M on a listening device. The precise details as to this device and the mechanics of its operation were the subject of a claim for public interest immunity by the Commissioner of Police. While that conversation was being recorded on M’s listening device it was also being monitored at the listening post in the undercover branch.
	
	
	Detective Chief Inspector Jones gave evidence as to his involvement in the investigation into the 2000 offences. He had assisted between 6.59pm and 7.30pm on 2 May 2000 in monitoring, from the listening post in the undercover branch, the conversation between M and Mr Potier at the Villawood Detention Centre.
	
	
	His evidence was that there had been an attempt separately to record the conversation using equipment at the listening post but that the machine had failed to record the conversation. He postulated that that could have been due to operator error but conceded that, as with any equipment, there could have been a malfunction. Asked whether any suggestion that there was a second tape in existence of that conversation (i.e., apart from the recording made by the device which M had with him at the meeting) could be excluded, Detective Chief Inspector Jones said that there was a tape but there was nothing recorded on the tape and it had not been produced to the Court. He identified an entry in the police tape log book that he said referred to that particular tape (being the entry previous to that comprising M’s recording).
	
	
	Relevantly, Detective Chief Inspector Jones also gave evidence that he had been at the Special Services Group premises later that evening; had seen the constable produce a piece of technical equipment to replay a portion of the conversation between M and Mr Potier; and had seen the constable produce a compact disc (which he identified as tape numbered 2377 in the log). This is clearly a reference to the recording that was made on the listening device that M had with or on him during the meeting with Mr Potier.
	
	
	The evidence that Mr Potier says is directly inconsistent with the above is evidence from Acting Superintendent Laidlaw, which he says was to the effect that an audiotape was generated at the listening post and that it did have a recorded conversation on it (Mr Potier referring to the evidence given in the transcript at T 346 and T 356).
	
	
	Acting Superintendent Laidlaw’s evidence (at T 346) was that the entire conversation between M and Mr Potier recorded on 2 May 2000 “was recorded on audiotape” and that together with other undercover branch operatives he monitored the conversation. None of that is inconsistent with Detective Inspector Jones’ evidence, from which it is apparent that he thought that the conversation was being recorded in the listening post at the time that the conversation was being monitored. Acting Superintendent Laidlaw then said that at the conclusion of the conversation with Mr Potier, the audiotape was later copied and handed to a Detective Platt. He was not asked whether he had listened to the tape at that stage or, if he did, whether the tape was blank. To this point the only potential inconsistency in the evidence is whether a copy of the audiotape generated at the listening post (which according to Detective Chief Inspector Jones was blank) had been provided to the investigating officers or not.
	
	
	Acting Superintendent Laidlaw was further cross-examined as to his statement that the entire conversation had been recorded on audio tape. He said that the original of the tape was with the undercover branch and went on to say “I won’t go into specifics on how it was recorded, obviously for methodology reasons, but I believe it is with them” (T 356.25). That answer strongly suggests that what Acting Superintendent Laidlaw was there referring to was the recording made on the device that was with M, since it was that device that was the subject of the claimed immunity.
	
	
	He then agreed that at the end of the conversation on 2 May 2000 Detective Platt was given an audio tape of the conversation so that it could be transcribed; said it was a copy not the original; and said that that was produced at the conclusion of the conversation. He also agreed that in his statement he had said that he was given an audio cassette tape that he had caused to be transcribed.
	
	
	What emerged from the course of that cross-examination does not permit a finding that either of the police officers was lying and it was not put to either of them that he was.
	
	
	The most likely explanation of any inconsistency in the above evidence is confusion as to the different modes of recording and, in particular, to the device that was used by M (which was the subject of the claim for public interest immunity). Such confusion, without any disrespect to Mr Potier’s then counsel, was apparent from the questioning of Detective Chief Inspector Jones (see from T 277-279), which led to discussion, in the absence of the jury, as to how, as a technical matter, the compact disc of the 2 May 2000 conversation was produced. Counsel for the Commissioner of Police made it clear that the public interest immunity related to the assumption that counsel for the defence had made in questioning Detective Chief Inspector Jones to the effect that the recording and the equipment were distinct. This led to information being provided on a confidential basis to the trial judge and to counsel for the defence, which Mr Healey indicated was of assistance to him in elucidating the matter.
	
	
	From the questioning of Detective Chief Inspector Jones that followed, it is apparent that it was the recording by M (not the VHS audiotape that had been produced at the listening post) that was forwarded to the STIB for possible “enhancement”.
	
	
	The cross-examination of Detective Chief Inspector Jones and Acting Superintendent Laidlaw on this topic was described by counsel for Mr Potier as going to “the issue of the authenticity or integrity” of three things – the technical equipment used; the technical equipment used to replay the recording; and the compact disc. Mr Healey informed the Court, in the absence of the jury, that Mr Potier did not accept that the compact disc (MFI 3 at the second trial – item 2377 in the police tape log book) was a genuine record of what had been played in court and that Mr Potier was suggesting that there had been alterations to the “products” of the conversation.
	


4 May 2000 recording of telephone conversation


	
	The evidence of Detective Chief Inspector Jones was that on 4 May 2000 he was present at the Special Services Group premises at about 5.40pm when M made a telephone call which was recorded. He says that at the completion of the call M handed him a cassette tape and he replayed a portion of the conversation from that tape to M. Details of that tape (marked MFI 4 at the second trial) were entered into the tape log book at entry 2378.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s schedule (MHP 6) records the time difference between the two recordings of this telephone conversation as approximately one second. He makes no specific submission in relation to this call.
	


5 May 2000 recording of telephone conversation


	
	Detective Chief Inspector Jones gave evidence that on 5 May 2000 he had a telephone conversation with M in relation to a telephone call the latter had made to Mr Potier on that date that was only partly recorded. He said that he had listened to part of that recording (MFI 5). He was not sure if he had listened to it in its entirety. He recalled that there were parts of the conversation that were not recorded on the tape.
	
	
	As to this telephone conversation, Mr Potier maintains that the records of M’s mobile phone account shows that this call overlapped by some five minutes with the conversation that it is alleged Mr Potier was having with Ms Conway on 5 May 2000 (which did register on the Optus webtrace). Mr Potier says that the Optus webtrace shows that the conversation with Ms Conway finished, after 11 minutes, at 19.42; whereas M’s phone account shows a ten minute phone call finishing at 19.45. Mr Potier also maintains that with the 5 May 2000 telephone conversation with Ms Conway there is a discrepancy of around 11 minutes between the length of the actual telephone intercept recording and that played to the jury (although he does not point to any particular content in the conversation as having been either added to the former or excised from the latter).
	
	
	As to the 5 May 2000 call, Mr Potier says that the transcripts were incorrect in that it was suggested in the transcript that things had been said, in terms of having been actually recorded, but that M’s notes show things that were not recorded. He submits that this leads to an inference that what was on the tapes was factually incorrect.
	


8 May 2000 meeting


	
	Detective Chief Inspector Jones also gave evidence that on 8 May 2000, he had a further conversation with M at Special Services Group premises during which M handed him a cassette tape. He played a portion of that tape and M initialled the tape and it was recorded as 2381 (MFI 8). Similarly, on 8 May 2000 he said that he assisted with Detective Platt and Senior Constable Brown in monitoring a conversation between M and Mr Potier and was present when a portion of that conversation was played and the tape was labelled and entered with details 2382 (MFI 6) and 2383.
	
	
	As to the 8 May 2000 meeting between Mr Potier and M, Mr Potier maintains that the start/stop times of the recording in the police log reveal a 33 minute recording but that the recording played to the jury was only 30 minutes. He also points to notes in the transcript referring to “break in tape” whereas he maintains there was no break in the recording to the jury.
	
	
	In his schedule (MHP 6), Mr Potier also notes differences of around four minutes and eight minutes in the recordings of two telephone conversations with Ms Conway on 8 May 2000.
	


General complaint as to quality of the recordings


	
	Mr Potier describes certain of the original recordings as being bad recordings or having a “bad echo”. The perceived discrepancy between the recorded lengths of various of the 2000 conversations and the recordings played to the jury, as well as the contention that one call on 5 May 2000 would have had to have been made simultaneously to Ms Conway and to M; as well as discrepancies as to the quality of the 2000 recordings, were all matters raised in submissions on the High Court special leave application.
	


2002 recordings


	
	At the second trial, the evidence included not only the telephone recordings from the first trial and an electronically recorded police interview (ERISP) with Mr Potier in 2000, but also the listening device recordings made on 2 February 2002 and 6 February 2002 of conversations between Mr Potier and A.
	
	
	Mr Potier complains that it was not until 2009 (after his second trial) that he discovered that there were two sets of material in relation to the 2002 recordings – the original on VHS and a “highlight tape” on CD. That complaint is contradicted by the evidence to which Mr Potier also points (from Detective Sipos) to the effect that the 2 February 2002 recording to the jury (Exhibit M at the trial) was from a “highlight tape”.
	
	
	Mr Potier calls into question the provenance of the highlight tape because he says that the evidence of the police was that the VHS tapes were included in the evidence log but the highlight tape was just kept in a drawer and not in safe keeping.
	


2 February 2002 recording


	
	The first of the 2002 recordings about which Mr Potier raises issues is one made on 2 February 2002.
	
	
	Marked “MFI 1” in the present proceedings is a copy of a letter dated 17 September 2014 from Mr Potier to the Registrar enclosing further supplemental submissions dated 17 September 2014 and enclosing two VHS audio tapes. The first of those (marked Supplemental Exhibit MHP 1) is described as a VHS audio tape provided by the police of the alleged conversation of Mr Potier and A on 2 February 2002 “taken from Master Tape stored as exhibit”.
	
	
	Mr Potier seeks to tender the VHS recording of 2 February 2002 (his supplementary exhibit MHP 3), to show that there is no audio contained on that tape. Mr Potier notes that what was entered into the police evidence log book was described as being blank (save as to confirmation of date and time) with no audio on it; whereas the version played to the jury did have audio on it.
	
	
	At the second trial, Mr Potier cross-examined various police officers as to the provenance and integrity or authenticity of the tape. Relevantly, the VHS tape of the 2 February 2002 conversation between A and Mr Potier was taken from secure storage and delivered to Sergeant Van Dyke of the STIB for “enhancement”. Sergeant Van Dyke gave evidence that he had produced a CD from the master tape recording. The sergeant confirmed that his task was to process the VHS in an attempt to improve the intelligibility of the voices. He said that “using recognised signal processing techniques” he produced an STIB compact disc.
	
	
	In cross-examination by Mr Potier, Sergeant Van Dyke explained that he had prepared a pro forma statement as to the processing of the disc because of privilege in relation to the particular techniques involved in forensic signal processing. He said that the “enhancement” process was not capable of adding to a recording nor of removing answers from a recording. The sergeant confirmed that he had produced one STIB compact disc. He gave evidence that some portions of the tape were unable to be improved, referring to negative signal and noise ratio.
	
	
	The second tape enclosed with the 17 September 2014 further supplemental submissions (marked Supplemental Exhibit MHP 2) is described as a VHS audio tape provided by the police of the alleged conversation of Mr Potier and A on 6 February 2002 “not jury version”. The supplemental exhibit also contains the statement “Jury version taken from highlight tape not stored as exhibit”. Also part of “MFI 1” is what purports to be the transcript of the recording played to the jury of the 6 February 2002 conversation.
	
	
	Mr Potier has prepared an analysis of the highlight tape (MHP10) which he says shows that the tape was stopped roughly halfway through the recording played to the jury and not restarted. Mr Potier submits that the highlight tape played to the jury is therefore not the highlight tape as recorded because it has had 19 minutes of extra recordings put onto the end of it after it was stopped.
	


6 February 2002 recording


	
	Reference is also made to the evidence of Senior Constable Maglicic of STIB (T 822) to the effect that exhibit M (a disc that Mr Potier describes as the original recording of the 6 February 2002 conversation but which elsewhere is identified as a recording of the 2 February 2002 conversation) was not produced by the audio video signalling process section.
	
	
	Mr Potier maintains that this evidence shows that some person in the police force has altered the original recording of the 2 and 6 February 2002 conversations to add to the recording the alleged conversations. He makes this submission on the basis that: the only recording mediums placed in the police log book in 2002 were the VHS master tapes; the recording of 2 February 2002 was entirely blank but, after enhancement, it contained a full audio product; and that the conversation of 6 February 2002 comes from the highlight tape not entered into the police log book and that recording is noted as having been stopped approximately halfway through the conversation played to the jury.
	


Summary of position re the Telstra material and the recordings


	
	In summary, as at the time of, or at least by the end of, the second trial the position is that: Mr Potier was aware of the existence of the Telstra material (and had been since the filing of the January 2005 affidavit in the 2006 conviction appeal proceedings); he was aware that the Crown had, or at least may have had, that material before the end of the first trial (as per the cross-examination in August 2006 of Acting Superintendent Laidlaw); he was aware from the evidence of Detective Sipos that the 2 February 2002 recording played to the jury was from a “highlight” tape; and he knew that Sergeant Van Dyke had carried out what was referred to as forensic signal processing as a result of which the Crown maintained that the intelligibility of the voices on the original VHS tape recording had been improved.
	
	
	Furthermore, the Crown maintains that all recordings, including all 13 master tapes, were copied and supplied in advance of the second trial to junior counsel for the defence and points to the fact that Mr Potier did not dispute this when it was raised before the trial judge on 8 September 2006. The Crown also points to the evidence of Detective Sipos in this regard (T 734).
	
	
	Mr Potier nevertheless complains that nothing was disclosed in the second trial as to the “unusual” nature of the recordings or that there were two sets of recordings or that the Crown had (by the end of the first trial) received the Telstra material.
	
	
	Three sets of tapes/discs were marked for identification during the appeal hearing. In his 8 January 2015 supplemental submissions, Mr Potier identifies the respective MFI’s as follows:
	


MFI 1 as the two VHS tapes of alleged recordings of 2 and 6 February 2002.

MFI 2 as the two sets of recordings of alleged conversations between Mr Potier and Ms Conway between 2 and 9 May 2000, together, he believes, with alleged conversations of 4 and 5 May 2000 with M.

MFI 3 as the recordings of the alleged meetings of 2 and 8 May 2000 between Mr Potier and M.


	
	Mr Potier has sought to tender the tapes marked MFI 3. The Crown objects to that tender. I will deal with it in relation to ground 8 of the appeal. Suffice it to note at this stage that Mr Potier maintains that the discs marked MFI 3 were produced (with other material) in answer to the June 2008 order to produce and he relies on these as the actual tape recordings of the conversations between himself and M on 2 and 8 May 2000 (see AT 43; 10/11/14).
	
	
	Mr Potier in his submissions has requested the Court to consider the authenticity of all recordings played to the juries and to listen to the recordings at the same time as reading the transcripts of the recordings.
	
	
	In this regard, Mr Potier submits that in the conversations with M there were two conversations in effect being recorded and that they differ in style and content – namely, that while M talked about the solicitation of the murder of two people, he, Mr Potier, is recorded as repeatedly emphasising “Do nothing illegal” and “Get the evidence needed for the Family Court”. Mr Potier also maintains that the response recorded on the transcript as “mmm” to the question whether he wanted the persons “knocked” cannot be heard on the recordings. Hence, Mr Potier emphasises the importance of listening to the original material.
	
	
	For the reasons set out in due course, leave to tender MFI 3 should be refused but, even if it were to be admitted, it does not assist Mr Potier.
	


Submissions in the present proceedings


	
	Numerous submissions were filed on behalf of, or by Mr Potier. So that there is no doubt as to the material that was put before this Court by Mr Potier, those documents are listed below. As at the time of the hearing of the appeal, the Court had been provided by Mr Potier with:
	



	
	Grounds of appeal against conviction submissions filed 10 September 2014 (referring to various documents copies of which were attached and described as MHP1 – MHP 14 respectively), with 5 appendices.
	
	
	Further supplemental written submissions dated 17 September 2014 and filed 25 September 2014 (including supplemental exhibits described as MHP 1 – MHP 3 respectively).
	
	
	Final submissions in conviction appeal (Part 1 of 2) dated 3 November 2014 and filed 4 November 2014.
	
	
	Final submissions in conviction appeal (Part 2 of 2) dated 5 November 2014 filed 5 November 2014.
	



	
	The Crown filed submissions on 21 October 2014 and submissions in response to Mr Potier’s further ground of appeal on 30 October 2014. The Crown also prepared a summary of trial which was filed on 20 October 2014.
	
	
	Provided to the Court at the hearing of the appeal was a copy of the transcript of proceedings before the High Court on the special leave application in 2013 and the summary of argument filed on behalf of, or by Mr Potier in the High Court of Australia on 23 April 2013, dated 25 June 2013 and signed by Mr Brezniak, Counsel who appeared for Mr Potier on that application.
	
	
	After judgment was reserved Mr Potier also sought leave (which the Court granted) to file further submissions that he indicated would be prepared by Counsel as to the adequacy of the trial judge’s directions on the s 91 issue (as to admission of the fact of conviction). Leave was granted for Counsel’s submissions to be filed on that issue, Mr Potier having indicated that Mr Brezniak of Counsel had agreed to prepare them. Those submissions were ultimately filed, but expressed to be incomplete, on 23 January 2015. They extended beyond the scope of the leave that had been granted, to include submissions not only on the adequacy of the s 91 directions but also as to the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence per se and the admission of evidence as to the fact of conviction. Mr Potier also filed submissions on 8 January 2015 in relation to the issue of the audio recordings. The Crown filed submissions in response to Mr Potier’s submissions on 30 January 2015. On 27 February 2015, Mr Brezniak filed an expanded version of the 23 January 2015 submissions. The Crown objected to reliance on those additional submissions but was given leave to reply to the additional material.
	
	
	I have taken into account all those submissions in preparing these reasons. I have also, as Mr Potier urged the Court to do, listened to the various audio recordings. That exercise was quite unproductive in terms of revealing any obvious lack of authenticity in the recordings but was instructive in dispelling any suggestion that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what Mr Potier was talking about with M (when he referred to evidence being gathered) was something that did not bear the innocent explanation that Mr Potier seeks to ascribe to it.
	


Preliminary Ground of Appeal


	
	Before proceeding to the specific appeal grounds raised in Mr Potier’s notice of appeal, I note that in his written submissions Mr Potier has raised as a preliminary ground of appeal an allegation that the Crown has “deliberately and with conscious intent” denied him “all forms of access” to legislation and decisions of the courts. Similar complaint was made in the course of Mr Potier’s oral submissions. No detail is provided in Mr Potier’s submissions of instances where he claims he has been denied access to such material, although the transcript of various procedural hearings before Garling J in 2014 records a number of complaints by Mr Potier as to an inability to have access to his legal papers and facilities to review his electronic material.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s written submissions on this appeal make reference to various authorities and legislation, from which it is apparent that Mr Potier has had at least some access to the material to which he contends the Crown has denied him access. It is not apparent from the material submitted by Mr Potier that he has been prejudiced in his ability to articulate the basis for his appeal by any delay in access to his papers. He has had considerable time to prepare his appeal.
	
	
	No doubt there have been limitations on Mr Potier’s ability to prepare his submissions as a result of Mr Potier’s incarceration. However, it is also pertinent to note that Mr Potier has had numerous proceedings on foot – on 14 October 2014, he indicated that he had on foot, apart from the present proceedings, an application for administrative inquiry into his first conviction; an appeal from Garling J’s refusal to grant a writ of habeas corpus; an appeal regarding an application for a criminal justice stay warrant; an application before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg; a judicial review application before the administrative court of the High Court in London; an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in London; an application in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London; a part-heard judicial review application before the Supreme Court in Queensland; and an appeal from a decision of McCallum J declaring him to be a vexatious litigant.
	
	
	This complaint does not relate to the conduct of the second trial nor does it support any submission that that trial miscarried. (That issue is raised by ground 7 of the appeal.) Rather, it appears to be a complaint that these appeal proceedings involve a miscarriage of justice. He submits that these proceedings have “a real danger of miscarrying due to the substantial imbalance of resources available to each party to allow them to adequately argue their positions on appeal”. He invokes the decision of Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23; [1989] 41 A Crim R 307 and submits that this Court has a positive and binding obligation to intervene to rectify this situation.
	
	
	In Jago, the High Court considered the trial judge’s responsibilities to ensure a fair trial and to avoid abuses of process, not specifically in relation to self-represented litigants, in the context of considering the circumstances in which criminal proceedings may be permanently stayed where there has been an unreasonable delay in the pre-trial process. It is not authority for the proposition that the substantial imbalance of resources of itself is a ground to uphold an appeal such as this.
	
	
	The duty of a trial judge where there is a self-represented accused is to give information and advice as is necessary to ensure that he or she receives a fair trial so that the accused is put in a position where he or she is able to make an effective choice as to the exercise of his or her rights during the course of the trial. The judge has a duty to ensure that there is no procedural disadvantage occasioned by the litigant’s unfamiliarity with the court process (see Rajski v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd [1986] NSWCA 1).
	
	
	It is apparent from a review of the transcript of various of the procedural hearings conducted by Garling J in the case management of the appeal proceedings, that his Honour was careful to ensure that procedural issues were drawn to Mr Potier’s attention and to make directions to facilitate Mr Potier’s ability to prepare his appeal.
	
	
	Considerable latitude has been extended to Mr Potier in the time allowed for, and manner of, the filing of submissions in these proceedings. It is also apparent that Mr Potier has had the benefit of at least some legal advice (from Mr Brezniak) from time to time in relation to these appeal proceedings. There is, in my opinion, no basis for complaint by Mr Potier as to any miscarriage of the appeal proceedings due to limitations on his ability to prepare submissions while incarcerated or due to the disparity in resources available to him as opposed to those available to the Crown.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	Mr Potier has set out 8 grounds of appeal in his application filed on 15 September 2014. Those have been supplemented informally by an additional ground 1 in circumstances to which I refer in due course. The headings to the particular grounds are as articulated in Mr Potier’s submissions. There is considerable overlap between various of the grounds, as is apparent from the way in which Mr Potier has interleaved references to them in his submissions.
	
	
	Ground 4 alleges bias on the part of the trial judge. The High Court has said that an appellate court dealing with allegations of bias, coupled with other discrete grounds of appeal, must deal with the issue of bias first because bias strikes at the validity and acceptability of the trial and its outcome (Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55; (2006) 229 CLR 577 at [117]). In the present case it cannot be said that the complaint of bias is discrete from the remaining grounds of appeal (there being considerable overlap, for example, between ground 4 and ground 3, which challenges various rulings of the trial judge, as well as with grounds 1 and 5).
	
	
	In the circumstances, what I propose to do is first to deal, together, with grounds 3 and 4 of Mr Potier’s grounds of appeal (raising the issues of the correctness of his Honour’s reasons and bias), before turning to the remaining issues.
	


Ground 3 – Judge’s rulings; Ground 4 - Bias


	
	These grounds are expressed as follows:
	


3.   That the Presiding Judge made a substantial series of Rulings against the Defence as a whole during the Trial which caused the Trial to miscarry.

4.   That the Presiding Judge exhibited a number of instances of unreasonable bias against the Appellant and when called upon to excuse himself declined so to do thereby causing the Trial to miscarry.


	
	I have extracted from Mr Potier’s submissions the particular instances identified by him as relating to grounds 3 and 4. Mr Potier has listed the issues he seeks to raise under these grounds in a schedule attached to his 3 November 2014 (Part 1 of 2) submissions. For the most part the list in the schedule conforms to the issues extracted from the written submissions though on occasion there are some differences in expression. There is also a degree of repetition throughout the submissions as to the complaints that Mr Potier makes in these grounds.
	
	
	In Mr Potier’s schedule, he groups the complaints as to his Honour’s rulings under the headings “Pre-Trial”, “During Trial” and “Sentencing Hearing”. I propose to deal with the challenged rulings and the bias allegations together under broad headings relating to the substance of the complaints. (In relation to the particular complaints I have noted in square brackets where in Mr Potier’s schedule of issues he has indicated that the issue is dealt with in his written submissions.)
	
	
	Mr Potier maintains that each of the challenged rulings stands in its own right as a valid ground of appeal but submits that, together, they demonstrate overwhelmingly that there has been a miscarriage of justice. As to bias, he relies to a large extent on the number of adverse rulings made by his Honour, though particular rulings (such as the refusal to grant an adjournment of the trial in circumstances where Mr Potier then had no legal representation) are emphasised as demonstrating bias. Mr Potier’s submission is that:
	


The issue I take with his Honour in terms of how he conducted the issues was that if you look at the decisions that were made, in my opinion and my submission a number of them could quite easily have been said, well that was really in his discretion but the totality of them clearly takes it past that.

Legal principles


	
	Before turning to the particular issues raised by Mr Potier, it must be noted that where challenge is made to the correctness of rulings made by the trial judge on matters of evaluative judgment or in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion, what must be demonstrated by Mr Potier is error in the House v The King sense (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5), namely that his Honour made an error of legal principle; made a material error of fact; took into account some irrelevant consideration or failed to take into account or give sufficient weight to a relevant consideration; or arrived at a result so unreasonable or unjust as to bespeak error of that kind (see also Micallef v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 274 at [45]). In general, no attempt was made to identify such an error.
	
	
	As to bias, although Mr Potier said that he was alleging both actual and apprehended bias, nothing was put before the Court as going to actual, as opposed to apprehended, bias.
	
	
	Actual bias may arise through interest or by reason of relationship, friendship, enmity or other factor (R v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong [1976] HCA 39; (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 258). The state of mind of a judge that needs to be demonstrated to establish actual bias is one “so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or arguments may be presented” (Setka v Gregor [2011] FCAFC 64 at [10], applying Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 532).
	
	
	No basis for an allegation of actual bias is apparent. The transcript demonstrates that his Honour considered the submissions put to him by both the Crown and the defence in relation to the matters that arose for determination during the course of the trial. Even if his Honour had incorrectly made all of the adverse rulings about which Mr Potier complains that would not of itself warrant a conclusion of actual bias.
	
	
	Apprehended bias arises where a fair-minded person might reasonably suspect the judge of prejudging the case or might reasonably apprehend that the judicial officer might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question that he or she is required to decide (see Webb v R [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41; R v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Ex parte The Angliss Group [1969] HCA 10; (1969) 122 CLR 546; Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; (2000) 201 CLR 488; Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337).
	
	
	The hypothetical observer is taken to be a reasonable person (Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Burns [2010] NSWCA 265; (2010) 207 A Crim R 362 at [70] per Beazley J citing Johnson v Johnson at [11] – [14]). The hypothetical observer would not come to a hasty conclusion based on the appearance evoked by an isolated episode of temper or remarks to the parties or their legal representatives taken out of context (George v Fletcher (Trustee) [2012] FCAFC 148 at [72]).
	
	
	Observations made in the course of argument (such as his Honour’s comments in the course of the withdrawal and adjournment applications) even if of a robust kind will not necessarily demonstrate bias. It is well recognised that in the course of a hearing there may be exchanges and even robust expression of views without leading to a conclusion that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias (Antoun v R [2006] HCA 2; (2006) 224 ALR 51 at [27] & [30] per Kirby J, see also: Johnson v Johnson [at 493]; Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd at [111]).
	
	
	In the case of apprehended or ostensible bias the matter is determined by an objective examination of relevant facts (Spencer v Bamber [2012] NSWCA 274 at [107]). All the relevant circumstances of the particular case may be taken into account in applying the test, though only such knowledge of matters of legal or other specialist practice and process as can reasonably be attributed to the lay observer (including, perhaps, matters of which the observer would inform himself or herself before reasonably forming any firm apprehension) will be taken into account (Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 584-585 per Toohey J; Najjar v Haines (1991) 25 NSWLR 224 at 239-240 per Rogers JA).
	
	
	The application of the test for apprehended bias requires: first, the identification of what it is said might lead the decision-maker to decide a question other than on its merits; and, second, articulation of the logical connection between the matter identified and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the question other than on its merits (Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy at [16], as confirmed by the High Court in Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; (2011) 282 ALR 685 at [31]; [67]).
	
	
	Perhaps unsurprisingly, since Mr Potier has no legal qualifications, he did not attempt to identify any such logical connection. I have therefore considered each of the instances of alleged bias to assess whether there is anything that might satisfy the test set out in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy.
	
	
	In summary, none of the instances of alleged bias, taken individually or collectively, constitutes conduct that would in my opinion cause a fair-minded observer reasonably to suspect that the trial judge was not bringing or would not in the future bring an objective and impartial mind to the rulings and determinations he was required to make during the course of the trial. Nor is there any error in the House v The King sense revealed in the rulings made in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion. Therefore, grounds 3 and 4 have not been made out. The reasons for that conclusion by reference to the particular complaints that have been made are as follows.
	


Adjournment applications and the like


	
	Under this heading I have grouped together the complaints made by Mr Potier as to the refusal by his Honour to grant various adjournment applications, his Honour’s refusal to grant Mr Potier bail to prepare his case, and the complaint that his Honour placed Mr Potier in an impossible situation following the withdrawal of Mr Potier’s legal representation and denied Mr Potier access to material necessary for his defence or going to the preparation of the trial. As articulated by Mr Potier, those complaints are as follows.
	


Withdrawal of Mr Terracini SC on 3 August 2006

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow an adjournment after the withdrawal of Mr Terracini SC so that Mr Potier could adequately instruct replacement counsel and so that replacement counsel could adequately prepare [grounds 3 & 4]; [AWS 10]

●   the trial judge’s misunderstanding as to reasons why Mr Terracini SC withdrew prior to start of trial [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 11]


	
	The first refusal of an adjournment of which complaint is made relates to the application made following Mr Terracini’s withdrawal from the matter on 3 August 2006. It is necessary to set out in some detail the background to this (and the subsequent adjournment applications) in order to put his Honour’s respective adjournment rulings in context.
	
	
	The trial had been listed to commence on 7 August 2006. On 31 July 2006, Mr Potier, appearing without legal representation on this occasion notwithstanding that Mr Terracini was still retained in the matter at this stage, brought an application (having joined the Attorney-General and the Legal Aid Commission thereto) before the trial judge in which he complained as to legal aid funding issues or difficulties and sought a stay of the trial.
	
	
	The transcript reveals that, during the course of the discussion as to the stay application, his Honour observed that Mr Terracini was present (apparently on another matter) in the courtroom. Mr Terracini did not suggest to the Court that he would not be appearing at the forthcoming trial. Mr Potier’s stay application was dismissed. No complaint is made about this.
	
	
	On 2 August 2006, a further application was made for the vacation of the 7 August 2006 trial date. On that occasion, Mr Healey of Counsel appeared on behalf of Mr Potier, instructed by Ms McGowan (Mr Terracini’s instructing solicitor). The Crown foreshadowed an application the following day by Mr Terracini to seek leave to withdraw.
	
	
	Ms McGowan gave evidence in support of the application to vacate the trial date. Ms McGowan’s evidence was that, following a conference that had been held with Mr Potier at the gaol that or the previous day, Mr Terracini and his junior had withdrawn as Counsel. Ms McGowan was restricted in what she could say to the Court about the circumstances of Counsel’s withdrawal due to the need to preserve legal professional privilege. Ms McGowan gave evidence that she needed funding approval from the Legal Aid Commission in order to retain replacement Counsel. That was the basis for the adjournment application.
	
	
	His Honour refused at that stage to adjourn the proceedings. In so doing, his Honour expressed the view that if replacement Counsel were to be found the Legal Aid Commission would be obliged to extend funding (as indeed it did with no delay once leave was granted for Mr Terracini to withdraw).
	
	
	On 3 August 2006, as had been foreshadowed the previous day, Mr Terracini sought leave (for himself and junior counsel) to withdraw from the matter. He informed the Court that an impasse that could not be overcome had been reached “in terms of the future conduct of the case and how it is to be conducted”. In that regard he referred to applications “in terms of adjournments whilst other matters proceed” and an unidentified issue which he indicated legal professional privilege precluded him from elucidating.
	
	
	Mr Terracini also informed the trial judge that he would not be advising the Legal Aid Commission that Mr Potier’s case had been insufficiently funded, nor would he indicate to the Legal Aid Commission that it had either incorrectly or capriciously refused any application that the defence representatives had made to assist Mr Potier. Those statements were obviously inconsistent with, and it was open to his Honour to conclude reflected adversely on the reliability of, the basis on which Mr Potier had brought his stay application on 31 July 2006.
	
	
	As recorded in his Honour’s reasons for granting leave to counsel to withdraw, Mr Terracini informed the Court that:
	


…in every case there has to be at least an acceptance by an accused that the advice he has been given is sound and acceptance that there has to be a method of conducting a trial which of course does not seek to manipulate the trial process. … 

There are certain issues about which Mr Potier wants done an[d] it’s our view that certain matters not only shouldn’t be done but can’t be carried out in the version that he requires it. (my emphasis)


	
	This can only be understood as a reference to the Bar Rule pursuant to which a barrister may return a brief if the barrister’s advice as to the preparation or conduct of the case, not including its compromise, has been rejected or ignored by the instructing solicitor or the client as the case may be (Rule 99). That was certainly the understanding of the Crown as to the basis for the withdrawal of Counsel from the case as later explained to the Court of Criminal Appeal on 13 September 2006.
	
	
	A note prepared by Mr Potier setting out Mr Potier’s understanding of the reasons for his then Counsel’s withdrawal was included in the appeal books in these proceedings as a confidential attachment to Mr Potier’s submissions on this appeal (MHP 6). Mr Potier did not wish to waive legal professional privilege in the advice, although indicated a preparedness to do so if necessary. Given that the document represents no more than Mr Potier’s stated understanding of the position at the time and, more importantly, that it was not available to the trial judge at the time, there is no useful purpose to be served by a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to that document. Its contents cannot have informed his Honour’s assessment at the time so cannot be relevant when considering whether his Honour had erred in the exercise of his discretion or whether his conduct in refusing the application gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. This complaint is therefore without foundation.
	
	
	In a subsequent application to the Court of Criminal Appeal in September 2006 seeking to appeal the refusal of a later adjournment application, Mr Potier informed the Court that Mr Terracini had been wrong in advising as to “a particular inclusion of a particular type of evidence”, since Mr Healey had subsequently advanced that evidence without objection from the Crown. Whether or not that be the case is irrelevant. What is relevant is that it was open to the trial judge on 3 August 2006 to conclude, from what had been said in Court on 2 and 3 August 2006, that defence counsel considered themselves bound to withdraw from the case not only because advice given by them to Mr Potier had not been accepted but also because they considered that his instructions could not be carried out consistently with their view as to their ethical obligations to the Court. The inconsistency between Mr Terracini’s statements as to a lack of any funding or other legal aid difficulties and what Mr Potier had said on 31 July 2006 was also a matter open to be taken into account by his Honour in that context.
	
	
	In his reasons for judgment when granting leave to withdraw his Honour referred to the stay application that had been made (on 31 July) on the basis of insufficient payment of counsel; that Mr Terracini had specifically denied any funding problems; and that the application had wasted the time of the Crown Prosecutor, instructing solicitors, the barristers appearing for the Attorney-General and the Commissioner of Police, and the legal aid solicitors. His Honour also noted that Mr Potier’s solicitor (Ms McGowan) had said that Mr Healey and Mr Lowe were prepared to accept the brief subject to Legal Aid Commission approval.
	
	
	His Honour expressed the view that, though the brief was voluminous, the matter was not of great intricacy or complexity. His Honour also expressed the opinion that Mr Potier had manufactured the situation (in which his barristers had withdrawn from the case a week before the trial commenced) himself and said that “this Court is not to have its list radically re-arranged because of the manipulation of the particular accused”.
	
	
	His Honour made clear on 3 August 2006 his intention that the trial would commence on 7 August 2006, as listed, whether or not Mr Potier had legal representation.
	
	
	His Honour’s discretion did not miscarry. His Honour took into account the relevant matters. The complaint that his Honour misunderstood the reasons for Mr Terracini’s withdrawal fails to take into account the fact that those reasons were not available to his Honour at the time (nor is there any evidence even now from Mr Terracini as to those reasons). All that was before his Honour in that regard was what Mr Terracini had said in open court, which put his Honour on notice that experienced senior counsel considered that his client’s instructions were inconsistent with the manner in which the matter could ethically be conducted. His Honour’s comment as to the manipulation of the list, understood in the context of what had occurred the previous week and the observations made by Mr Terracini (which his Honour could have expected not to have been lightly made), does not reveal bias.
	
	
	As to the complaint that his Honour did not allow time so that replacement counsel could adequately prepare the matter, as already noted the trial did not in fact commence on 7 August 2006. Presumably this was because, after his Honour’s judgment on 3 August 2006, an application was made by Mr Potier to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a stay of the trial. That application was ultimately withdrawn, following which Mr Healey, who had by then been retained to appear at the trial, made an application on 11 August 2006 to the trial judge for an adjournment of the trial (then listed to commence on 14 August 2006). Mr Healey confirmed the reassignment of legal aid in the matter and to there being “extreme difficulties”, which appears to be a reference to difficulties in preparation of the matter for a trial commencing on 14 August 2006. Part of that difficulty may well have been the time taken up in the appellate proceedings that were not pursued, but in any event it appears that replacement counsel had around a week after the reassignment of legal aid to prepare for the trial.
	
	
	His Honour did not accede to the application for an adjournment beyond 14 August 2006. His Honour expressed the opinion that the difficulties were not insurmountable and the suspicion that if the trial did not start then there would be further delays.
	
	
	Relevantly, however, his Honour also indicated that he would go to any length to see that Mr Healey was not inconvenienced (giving as an example the possible situation where Mr Healey had not read a witness’ previous evidence before that witness came to give evidence in the present trial). Although his Honour said that the trial would start on 14 August 2006, he also said that any such adjournment applications (to meet Counsel’s difficulties in preparation) would be dealt with as they arose.
	
	
	In context, therefore, the refusal on 11 August 2006 of an adjournment to the starting date of the trial would not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. The suspicion that his Honour there expressed of there being further delays if the trial did not then start was one that his Honour no doubt had formed based on the events that had preceded the withdrawal of Mr Terracini. That suspicion was not without some foundation.
	
	
	No error in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion has been revealed. His Honour clearly took into account the need for efficient case management of the trial and the ability to accommodate any difficulties caused by the short time counsel had had to prepare by the grant of short adjournments as and when the need arose.
	
	
	For completeness, I note that when the second trial commenced, on 14 August 2006, a further application for an adjournment was made (and rejected). It is not clear whether Mr Potier takes issue with the refusal of this particular adjournment application. If he does, then for the same reasons as those already given, no bias and no appellable error is shown in the making of this ruling. Mr Healey did not point to any particular difficulty in preparation at that time. Moreover, it is tolerably clear that no prejudice resulted to Mr Potier from the refusal of this application. By 18 August 2006, only two days after the re-commencement of the trial, Mr Healey was able to inform his Honour that counsel “are almost on top of it [the brief] at the moment” (though seeking an adjournment, which was allowed, before the commencement of cross-examination of Ms Conway, the Crown’s first witness).
	


Denial of right to consult and instruct counsel

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow defence counsel time to receive instructions from Mr Potier during the trial; [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 11]


	
	This complaint relates to an incident on day 9 of the trial, 28 August 2006, when Mr Potier still had the benefit of legal representation. The transcript records that Mr Healey raised with his Honour, in the absence of the jury, that the accused had been late to Court and that the defence team had been able to see him for only five minutes before Mr Potier was taken away. Mr Healey’s request to the judge was whether efforts might be made to assist the defence to “give them time”.
	
	
	It is clear that Mr Healey was not requesting an adjournment of the trial at that stage but was raising a complaint as to the time taken for Mr Potier to be transported from the gaol that day. His Honour said that he could not really assist in that (i.e., presumably in the arrangements by which corrective services transported prisoners to court for court hearings) but went on to say that if the defence needed to get instructions on the run “we will just pause”.
	
	
	Mr Potier maintains that denial of the right to consult and instruct defence counsel is of itself a ground for retrial as it is a denial of natural justice. There is no substance to Mr Potier’s complaint in this regard. Mr Healey did not seek an adjournment to obtain instructions on the particular occasion to which Mr Potier has referred; nor has any prejudice been shown from the late arrival of Mr Potier to court on that occasion.
	
	
	In the period that Mr Healey represented Mr Potier, as Mr Potier in fact concedes (in his first submissions p 11) his Honour granted adjournments on a number of occasions to permit Mr Healey to seek instructions (the first being on the very day the trial commenced when Mr Healey sought and was granted an adjournment until midday to obtain instructions as to a potential Basha enquiry).
	


Mr Healey’s withdrawal – 7 September 2006

●   the trial judge’s refusal to grant application for adjournment after withdrawal of Mr Healey of Counsel; [ground 3 – judge’s rulings]


	
	This complaint arises out of what has been referred to as the “Carlos” incident. Some detail is needed in order to explain that incident (which features as the basis for numerous of Mr Potier’s complaints).
	
	
	By 6 September 2006, Mr Healey was in the process of cross-examining A, the prison informant whose evidence was that Mr Potier had solicited him to arrange the murder of Ms Oswald. On that day, A gave what Mr Healey described as an answer that was “totally out of the blue” to a question by Mr Healey. In Mr Potier’s initial submissions of 10 September 2014 he asserted that the answer that had been given came “as a major shock to all present”.
	
	
	The question arose during the course of cross-examination by Mr Healey as to what was set out in the transcript of one of the conversations recorded in A’s cell (the 2 February 2002 conversation). A was asked to explain the statement “you get Carlos”. He was asked a very open-ended question, namely “what is that about?”. This was one in a succession of similar questions, the thrust of the cross-examination being to ascertain A’s explanation of what was contained in the transcript and then to put to him that the explanation was false.
	
	
	A’s answer was as follows:
	


A:   At that stage you know my memory is telling me that, I remember Malcolm Potier wanted Carlos killed. He was another inmate in the goal.

OBJECTION (HEALEY).

A:   … and I think that was a note to me in order to see if I could arrange to spread the word to get him killed for a thousand dollars.


	
	Mr Healey immediately asked to speak to the judge in the absence of the jury. Mr Healey was given a short time to take some instructions and then informed his Honour that the answer was totally out of the blue; that he had instructions that a man called Carlos had been Mr Potier’s cellmate and was in the same wing but had moved to another cell; that there had never been any suggestion of violence or problems between the two; and that what was set out on that page of the transcript was complete nonsense and nothing could be made of it.
	
	
	In the debate with his Honour that followed, there was some confusion as to what instructions Mr Healey had had about that topic before the question was asked. However, the exchanges between Mr Healey and the trial judge can only be understood as conveying that Mr Healey’s instructions before asking the question were limited to what had been indicated to his Honour (as summarised at [207] above). Mr Healey did not suggest (nor could he, consistently with the basis on which objection was being made to the answer given to the question, have suggested) that he had instructions, before asking the question, that what was in the transcript related to a suggestion that a fellow prisoner be killed.
	
	
	Mr Healey maintained that A had simply volunteered that answer. His Honour clearly did not accept that characterisation of what had happened. He pointed out that Mr Healey had asked the question and that the witness had answered it. His Honour commented, in the course of that exchange, that Mr Healey had brought this on himself and that he should not have asked the question in the way he did (an observation that would best be characterised as part of the robust exchange of views between bench and bar in the absence of the jury).
	
	
	Mr Healey indicated that his cross-examination of A had been seeking to establish the “unreliability of the expressions” (in the transcript) and that A was fantasizing.
	
	
	Mr Healey then sought another adjournment to talk to his client, indicating that consideration had to be given to whether there be a request to abort the trial, and informing his Honour, that Mr Potier had asked for advice as to whether this fresh issue might affect his chance of acquittal.
	
	
	Having been given a further opportunity to discuss the matter with Mr Potier, Mr Healey then informed his Honour that Mr Potier wished him to ask A on the voir dire some questions such as whether he had reported that information (i.e., that Mr Potier wanted Carlos killed) to the prison authorities or police officers. The Crown had no objection to the asking of further questions but foreshadowed that the answers might lead to “a fuller development of this new and unfortunate point” that had arisen.
	
	
	The Crown in that context raised concern as to a possible Birks point of appeal. The reference to a Birks point of appeal (i.e., an appeal on the ground of incompetence of counsel as considered in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677) was obviously made in anticipation that Mr Potier might attempt to rely on the Carlos question as a subsequent ground of appeal based on incompetence of counsel (Mr Potier having unsuccessfully raised a Birks point on appeal after his first trial). The Crown pointed out that there was further reference to Carlos in the transcript which it submitted lent some credence to A’s answer.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, by way of “cure”, his Honour should give a suitable direction to the jury.
	
	
	His Honour then indicated his perception that there was a risk that if Mr Healey continued on with this issue that the trial might be so “muddled” as to require that it be aborted and observed that, if Mr Healey’s cross-examination was intended to put forward that A was an agent provocateur and made up stories, then the making of what the defence would contend was a further (albeit unexpected) one might not be to the accused’s disadvantage. His Honour also expressed a doubt as to the wisdom of asking A a further question that the Crown had suggested would probably amplify what A had already said.
	
	
	Mr Healey took issue with the Crown’s suggestion (which he described as fanciful) as to the Birks point and in that context said “if I was to take up his suggestion, it would mean that this counsel would withdraw on the Crown’s assertion, from representing this accused in this trial”.
	
	
	I interpose to note that at this point it can be assumed that Mr Potier (who was present in Court and had apparently been following the course of proceedings sufficiently closely to have immediately sought advice at the time as to how the matter might affect his chances of acquittal) must by now have understood the significance of the so-called Birks point as being that it might lead to the withdrawal of counsel. As noted, Mr Potier had raised a Birks point of appeal, unsuccessfully, in relation to his conviction in the first trial. He presumably had also heard reference by his Honour to the possibility that the trial might become so muddled as to require that it be aborted.
	
	
	This assumes some significance in light of the course Mr Potier ultimately took, as will shortly be outlined.
	
	
	Mr Healey then confirmed that Mr Potier saw the advantage of asking A on a voir dire whether he conveyed the Carlos information to the authorities and Mr Healey said that if A said no, then Mr Potier would wish that to be put to the witness in the presence of the jury to show that “he makes it up as he goes along”. Mr Healey added:
	


He understands, and I am not going to quarrel with your Honour’s first wise suggestion [apparently a reference to giving the jury a direction and not pursuing the matter further], but at the end of that subject that the answer was given, the accused wished to give me certain instructions to abort the trial. I have got to follow his instructions and the course which I suggest [i.e. for there to be a voir dire], I act thereafter.


	
	The Crown indicated that it might have to re-examine A to re-establish his credibility.
	
	
	It was in that context that his Honour acceded to the request for a voir dire to be held. A’s evidence on the voir dire was that he did not report the Carlos matter to the authorities. A also gave evidence to the effect that he thought Mr Potier was joking about wanting to have Carlos killed.
	
	
	However, after taking further instructions from Mr Potier, Mr Healey did not proceed as had been foreshadowed (i.e., to move to elicit that same evidence from A in the presence of the jury). Instead, Mr Healey said he was instructed to apply for a discharge of the jury on the basis of irremediable prejudice, referring to the “unsolicited” answer.
	
	
	His Honour refused to discharge the jury for the reason that the answer that had been given was a result of the course chosen by counsel in cross-examination of A. His Honour indicated that he proposed to give the jury a direction to disregard that evidence; to tell them that it formed no part of the Crown’s case and that it would be irrelevant and unfair to both the accused and the Crown to take it into account.
	
	
	His Honour also decided at that point that there should be no further reference to the Carlos issue because otherwise the Crown would re-examine and the defence would be back with the same problem. His Honour indicated that if Mr Healey asked him to direct the jury to disregard the answer, then the matter would not be able to be revisited. Mr Healey appeared to accept that.
	
	
	When the jury returned his Honour gave the kind of direction that had been foreshadowed.
	
	
	At some point that day, Mr Potier handed, through his solicitor, to Mr Healey a note. Following the luncheon adjournment, in the absence of the jury, Mr Healey again raised the matter of the Carlos incident. He informed his Honour that during the luncheon adjournment he had had a conference with Mr Potier in which Mr Potier had raised concerns that he was not receiving a fair trial. Mr Healey indicated that there was uncertainty as to whether Mr Potier wished Counsel to remain in the trial and indicated that he would need to seek a ruling from the Bar Council as to his position.
	
	
	His Honour at that time made it clear that Mr Potier should know that if he either withdrew his instructions or made the position intolerable for counsel the only option he would have would be to conduct the trial himself. His Honour recognised that Mr Potier would face very severe difficulty in conducting his own trial but said that he did not want Mr Potier to labour under any misapprehension that he could cause any delay in the trial because of this issue; and that if Mr Healey were not his Counsel the trial would go on. His Honour also expressed his opinion that the conduct of the trial at Mr Healey’s end had been beyond reproach; and that in circumstances where virtually the whole of the first trial had been replayed in the second, this material did not count very much one way or the other. The note that Mr Potier had handed to Mr Healey was later read onto the transcript but at this point the trial judge was unaware of its contents.
	
	
	On 7 September 2006, Mr Healey formally applied for leave to withdraw. He advised his Honour that he had taken advice from senior counsel; that the operation of both parts of Rule 101 of the Bar Rules necessitated his withdrawal; and that Mr Lowe was also in the same position.
	
	
	At the relevant time, Rule 101 of the Bar Rules was as follows:
	


101.   A barrister who has reasonable grounds to believe that there is a real possibility that the barrister may cease to be solely a disinterested advocate by becoming also a witness in the case or a defender of the barrister’s own personal or professional conduct against criticism must return the brief as soon as it is possible to do so without unduly endangering the client’s interests, unless:

(a)   the barrister believes on reasonable grounds that:

(i)   allegations which involve the barrister in that way have been raised in order to remove the barrister from the case; and

(ii)   those allegations can be met without materially diminishing the barrister’s disinterestedness; and

(b)   a member of a Professional Conduct Committee of the Bar Association who is Senior Counsel approves of the barrister keeping the brief after the barrister has informed that Senior Counsel of the circumstances.


	
	Ms McGowan also sought leave to withdraw on the basis of her lack of experience and said that her client had instructed her that it would be unfair for her to continue without Counsel. She indicated that she had earlier (in the context of her position when Mr Terracini withdrew) obtained advice from the Law Society’s Professional Standards Committee and that that advice continued to apply.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the fact that Mr Potier had previously raised a Birks argument in respect of the conduct of the first trial and said:
	


… in the absence of any further indication from the defence [sic], particularly Mr Healey, as to the reasonable grounds for his application to withdraw in accordance with the Bar rules [sic], one is left to conclude that in an eerily coincidental way with the withdrawal of Mr Terracini, that the accused has, if you like, sought to compromise yet another legal team’s instructions, in such a way that without actually dismissing them or terminating their instructions, they are nevertheless forced into a situation where they submit they are so compromised that they must withdraw.

In my submission the accused may be hoping to capitalise on a distinction between terminating instructions and effectively sacking his lawyer, and the situation where he would say through no fault of his counsel [sic] withdraw leaving him unrepresented.


	
	In his Honour’s reasons granting leave to withdraw he said that both Mr Healey and Mr Lowe had indicated that they were minded to withdraw and that Ms McGowan was in no position to conduct the case and had considered that the advice from senior counsel also applied to her. His Honour said: “As this is the second set of counsel who have been confronted by the same problem, I can only conclude it is one of Potier’s own making and he must bear the sole responsibility for what has occurred”.
	
	
	Nothing in the above reveals any basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of his Honour in the manner in which his Honour dealt with the withdrawal of the second set of Counsel. I consider later the complaint raised by Mr Potier as to the manner in which the withdrawal of Counsel was done before the jury.
	
	
	Following the grant of leave for his defence team to withdraw, Mr Potier applied for an adjournment of the trial. The Crown opposed the adjournment.
	
	
	In ruling on that adjournment application, his Honour said that the case largely comprised telephone intercepts and recordings; that no one would know the case better than the accused and that Mr Potier had instructed counsel on two occasions and neither had raised problems in receiving instructions, which indicated to his Honour that Mr Potier was well aware of the matters he wanted to put before the jury and quite capable of doing so. His Honour said that no one was in a better position than Mr Potier to be in command of the case he sought to put, and that he had been warned as to the consequences of his actions and said: “that he has compromised yet another set of counsel can only be seen as a deliberate act on his part”.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the course of events (so far as they were then known to his Honour) to that stage, it cannot be said that his Honour’s refusal to grant an adjournment demonstrated any error in the exercise of his discretion. Nor did it demonstrate bias.
	
	
	An application for his Honour to disqualify himself for apprehended bias was then made and rejected. It is also the subject of complaint. I deal with this as part of the group of complaints directly relating to the Carlos incident.
	


Termination of legal aid

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow an adjournment under s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act (in circumstances where an appeal from the withdrawal of legal aid had been the subject of preliminary submissions by Mr Potier) [relied on for both grounds 3 & 4]; [AWS 16]


	
	On 15 September 2006, there was a further application for the adjournment of the trial consequent upon the withdrawal of Mr Healey, by which time legal aid for Mr Potier had been withdrawn.
	
	
	The background to this is that, following the ruling on 7 September 2006, Mr Potier brought an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for leave to appeal from the trial judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment. It was contended on that application that the trial judge had erred in drawing the inference that Mr Potier was at fault for being in the position that he was unrepresented at the trial. In the course of that application, Mr Potier sought to adduce fresh evidence, namely to call Mr Healey (thereby waiving legal professional privilege) so as to explain the reason for his withdrawal.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal (Hunt AJA, Barr and Johnson JJ) did not consider that the adducing of fresh evidence was an appropriate procedure when it was open to Mr Potier to renew his application for an adjournment before the trial judge with that fresh evidence to support it and refused Mr Potier leave to appeal from that decision (Potier v R [2006] NSWCCA 300). Their Honours made the observation (at [2]) that the inference the judge had drawn (that Mr Potier was at fault for the departure of his counsel) was clearly open to the trial judge on the material before him. Hunt AJA commented, in the course of argument on that application (on which Mr Potier places reliance as supporting his contention that the trial judge was biased) that the course of Mr Potier representing himself would be a disaster in such a complex matter.
	
	
	The trial then resumed on 14 September 2006. On that occasion, a solicitor representing the Legal Aid Commission, Mr Kirkwood, informed the Court that legal aid had been withdrawn with effect on 13 September 2006 for reasons that he could not reveal without breaching legal professional privilege, although he was able to indicate that the departure of Mr Healey was a consideration that came into the decision.
	
	
	Mr Potier informed the trial judge that he had lodged a preliminary application, appealing that decision to the Legal Aid Review Committee and submitted that this acted as a stay of the proceedings, invoking s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 (NSW). (He also invoked Article 14(3) of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.) Mr Potier submitted that the trial judge should rule on the application for a stay having regard to s 57 of that Act first, since, if his Honour ruled on that application in his favour, it would not be necessary for Mr Healey to divulge his instructions.
	
	
	Section 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act provides for a stay of proceedings where the Court is satisfied: that a party has appealed or intends to appeal in accordance with s 56 to a Legal Aid Review Committee; that such an appeal is competent; that the appeal or intention to appeal is bona fide and not frivolous or vexatious or otherwise intended improperly to hinder or delay the conduct of the proceedings, and that there are no special circumstances that prevent the Court from so doing.
	
	
	The purpose of s 57 was explained in Lewis v Spencer [2007] NSWSC 1383; (2007) 179 A Crim R 48 by Rothman J as being to ensure that, so far as practical, persons without the means to be represented are not tried and convicted in the absence of representation, when there is a possibility that, after their application for legal aid has been dealt with, they will be properly represented. His Honour noted that representation of parties in proceedings aided not only the parties themselves but also the administration of justice.
	
	
	The determination of the bona fides of an appeal is one that has to be determined objectively. It is a question as to whether the appeal is being pursued for relevant purposes. Whether the applicant subjectively believes that the application or appeal is bona fide is not sufficient to prove that it is objectively of that nature (see Re Barbara Ann Cameron and Gamester Pty Ltd v Rural Press Ltd; John Lindsay Parker and Timothy Roy Starkey [1992] FCA 157; (1992) 35 FCR 211; Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 26 FLR 257).
	
	
	There is some debate as to whether there is any more than an evidentiary onus on the party opposing an adjournment to establish circumstances sufficient to engage either of the sub-sections in s 57, in order to overturn the prima facie position that, an appeal having been lodged or an intention to appeal having been indicated, the proceedings are to be adjourned (see Rothman J in Lewis v Spencer at [11]; Fibre-Tek (Gold Coast) Pty Ltd v Skye Bennett [2006] NSWSC 1100; HSBC Bank Australia Ltd v Murtough [2010] NSWSC 320). It is not necessary here to explore that issue.
	
	
	The circumstances before his Honour, when considering whether he was satisfied that the appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee was frivolous, vexatious or intended to hinder or otherwise delay the proceedings, included those from which it was open to his Honour to infer that Mr Potier had manufactured a situation in which both sets of counsel had been forced to withdraw from the proceedings. The relevant circumstances also included that Mr Potier’s legal aid had been withdrawn by the Legal Aid Commission for the reasons proffered by the solicitor for the Legal Aid Commission appearing before his Honour, Mr Kirkwood.
	
	
	As made clear in his Honour’s subsequent reasons on the dismissal of the adjournment application, the trial judge considered that the fact that Mr Healey and Mr Lowe were the second set of counsel forced to withdraw from the case prima facie put in question the bona fides of the appeal and therefore it became necessary to consider the circumstances of Mr Healey’s withdrawal.
	
	
	In response to the suggestion by Mr Potier that if Mr Kirkwood from the Legal Aid Commission were to confirm that two of the reasons for withdrawal of funding did not concern Mr Healey, then Mr Healey would not be pivotal to the deliberations under s 57 of the Act, his Honour said:
	


All the relevant material I have to take into consideration includes not only Mr Healey's withdrawal, but it also includes Mr Terracini's withdrawal from the case as well.

…

It is important to me because it shows a pattern of behaviour, and even as I see it, without knowing the full facts which are apparent, that would be as much as anything else that would convince me that your appeal may be vexatious.


	
	Mr Potier waived privilege in relation to the disclosure of the contents of the letter from the Legal Aid Commission withdrawing legal aid. The letter was read onto the transcript by Mr Kirkwood:
	


Ground 1. You have failed on numerous occasions to co-operate with the Legal Aid Commission and the representatives engaged by the commission on your behalf.

Ground 2. You have failed on numerous occasions to heed advice provided to you by the commission and/or the legal representatives engaged by the commission on your behalf.

Ground 3. You have through your actions forced the withdrawal of the legal representatives engaged by the commission on your behalf on numerous occasions just prior to or during the hearing of the matter.


	
	His Honour reviewed that letter and said that it confirmed the view he had that the application was vexatious, whereupon Mr Potier said that if that was the case then “with the greatest regret” he would have to waive the privilege in respect of Mr Healey. His Honour made it clear on at least three occasions that it was up to Mr Potier whether he chose to waive privilege. There followed this exchange:
	


ACCUSED:   My perception of threat, and this is mine not yours, I know you are not threatening me, my perception is this, if I do not waive privilege, I do not get an adjournment. If I do [not] get an adjournment, I am going to be defending this matter tomorrow morning, and that's going to give me enormous--

HIS HONOUR:   An applicant in the Court has the carriage of the matter and the responsibility of the application. You are the applicant, you remain the applicant for the adjournment. It is a matter entirely for you what evidence you place before me. So far I see no evidence to persuade me that any adjournment is appropriate in these circumstances. If you wish to call some evidence, do so.


	
	Shortly before that exchange, his Honour had said to Mr Potier:
	


Let me put it this way to you, Mr Potier, if the appeal was the result of the withdrawal of instructions and withdrawal from the case by Mr Healey, if that was one of the reasons for Legal Aid to refuse or withdraw legal aid, then in order for me to form the view it was not frivolous and vexatious, that is your appeal, having regard to the fact that the second set of counsel have withdrawn, under circumstances which have not been entirely clear to me, then unless I am convinced that it isn't frivolous or vexatious, that does not form grounds for an adjournment of these proceedings. So unless you waive privilege and Mr Healey can come into court and tell me why he withdrew and what transpired between you, then the case is unaltered.

…

So in order that the Gordian knot be cut, you would have to waive privilege. If you don't want to do that, that's a matter entirely for you. Then I shall not have regard to section 57, because I would regard your appeal, having regard to all the circumstances, as being frivolous and vexatious. It is a matter entirely for you.


	
	Mr Potier ultimately waived legal professional privilege in respect of the advice given at the 6 September 2006 conference and Mr Healey was called to give evidence on the voir dire. Questioned by Mr Potier on this issue, Mr Healey stated his opinion that he did not consider that the raising by the Crown of R v Birks was a matter of concern or a relevant issue.
	
	
	At Mr Potier’s request, Mr Healey read onto the transcript the note written to him by Mr Potier on 6 September 2006, as follows:
	


I have to put on records with you my worry about what Crown has said R v Birks and yourself. My concern is this, am I accepting and thereby giving up a ground of appeal? What the Crown says is your mistake in the, “Carlos” questions in light of his Honour's ruling about not aborting the trial and you not being able to further cross-examine I do feel that a major damage could have been done to my defence.


	
	In the cross-examination by the Crown that followed, Mr Healey gave evidence as to the advice he had given in conference with Mr Potier. Given the significance attributed to the Carlos incident and the fact that it led to the withdrawal of Mr Potier’s legal representation, that should be set out in full:
	


Q.   Once that piece of paper had been read by you would you go on to tell his Honour what your response to the accused was?

A.   Your Honour, I said to the accused, I will not disabuse you of some of your view although I do not angry [sic.; scil agree] with it. I will need to withdraw if you feel that you may lose a chance to be acquitted.

Q.   What with [sic; scil did] he say?

A.   He said, “I’m not asking you to withdraw and I’m not sacking you.”

Q.   You said?

A.   I said, “Well, don't raise it. If I withdraw the judge will force you on without counsel. You will not get an adjournment.”

Q.   He said?

A.   “I do not like attitude of the judge.” He is quite negative towards me and I feel that he is blackmailing me.”

Q.   And you replied?

A.   I said, “It is your case. If you feel that the competence of counsel, Birks, is really an issue, then in my view the CCA rarely gives credence to it, especially not in a case like this. I think that we should just should [sic] go on.

Q.   Yes?

A.    And he said, “It is not your fault. I am one hundred percent in the belief that you are correct in what you have said. The judge has drifted into error and I’m worried … that he has impeded your cross-examination. I’m very worried about it.”

Q.    Yes?

A.   And I said to him, “Are you asking me to form a view that I can not adequately represent you and I will have to withdraw?” The accused said, “If it leaves me in a situation where I have to represent myself then, so be it.” I said, “If you feel that you are going to lose in the Court of Criminal Appeal are you saying that I should withdraw?” He said, “The judge gave directions to the jury and I cannot get back what has been said, especially in this case. The jury may think that I am a murderer or a psychopath and I am not going to be blackmailed by that judge.” I said, “Do you have no confidence in counsel, or that counsel cannot discharge his duties?” He said, “I believe that you can, but the Crown has said Birks’ case applies and I am in a situation where I cannot say that I have not lost a chance in the CCA if you remain. Can I? That is the dilemma that I have.” I said, “I think that your concern is academic and splitting hairs. If I withdraw you have Peter and Frances.” He said, “That is a grossly unfair. I don’t want Peter and Frances is not able to conduct my defence.

I said, “You must put aside what has happened and allow me to continue to represent you, but you must listen to my advice.” He said, “I cannot. It is a problem if the trial is allowed to continue with the ‘A’ stuff in front of the jury. (1), you can tell the judge that you are threatening to withdraw from appearing for me unless he allows you to ask questions of ‘A’ on the Carlos issue, or, (2) that you, Healey, will act to withdraw from appearing for me on my instructions to you, upon my worries set out in number 4 to the damage caused and you continuing to appear. I also ask you to have the judge disqualify himself as I feel that he is biased against me and I feel that I can not get a fair trial.”

I said, “I can not do that and I will not be a party to manipulating the system of justice. The judge has made his decision and you can appeal against that later if you are convicted.” He said, “Well, I'm not going to be blackmailed by any judge who will not allow my counsel to ask a question. If I am without counsel he must discharge the jury. I do not want to continue the trial with this judge. The competence of my counsel having been raised by the Crown in Birks may impinge upon my right to appeal against his Honour's refusal to abort the trial if you continue to act for me. I said, “You can continue to retain me and continue with the trial. You will not lose your chance of appeal against the refusal of the judge to discharge the jury. The accused said, “You are asked that question then ‘A’ buckets shit on me about Carlos.”

I said, “The CCA will not uphold that argument on a Birks point in my opinion and you still have the argument about refusing to abort the trial anyway.” And accused said, “How will I ever know?” I said, “I can not answer that for you, Malcolm. You can continue to use me and keep me as your counsel, but I can not be party to manipulation of the legal system. I am either in or out. You can either withdraw the point or I may take the view that I should withdraw. It is clearly an academic argument that you are raising. You can withdraw your instructions or I may have to withdraw.”

I then came up to court with my instructing solicitor and spoke to Mr Lowe and raised the matter with the Crown and your Honour in chambers and sought further time to speak to the accused. At about 2.15pm I went to the cells with Ms McGowan and Mr Lowe of counsel and spoke with the accused, I raised the issue of the note with him again and we spoke until about 2.30pm.

I said, “I have seen the judge and I need to clarify with you what will happen if I withdraw. The judge has indicated that the trial will continue and that Mr Lowe can continue to act for you.” Mr Potier said, “No, if the leader goes, so does Mr Lowe. Your solicitor is not competent to run technical arguments and issues.” I said, “Exactly, the trial will continue at 3pm today without counsel unless you withdraw your concern about me continuing to act for you. You will need to martial the brief and you will not lose the opportunity of ground of appeal based on his Honour's refusal to abort the trial. The issue is only one of splitting hairs. You have an unenviable situation that you have put yourself into mounted on tenuous ground of appeal based on the Birks point. To put to me as your counsel that I should withdraw if I am the subject of a possible ground of appeal is ridiculous. I not go wish to withdraw and you should withdraw point 4 in writing if I am to continue.

He said, “I do not want you to withdraw.” I said, “Well, then there is only one thing to do, and that is it to withdraw your feelings about the Birks point and what follows.” The accused said, “I will not be blackmailed by any judge. I won’t bow to blackmail. He wants to bury me without trace. My feelings are that if you did withdraw I would stand up at 3pm and ask him to abort the trial. If his Honour won't abort the trial then I want to go to the cells. I do not want to participate because he is biased against me. I won’t play games and they can finish without me. I have clearly marked my territory. It is beyond my capacity to conduct the trial without counsel. If you have to withdraw then there is a mistrial. It is the only way I can see to deal with a blackmail threat.” He said, “If the judge forces me on then I will refuse to speak. I will not conduct my defence and I will go down to the cells and not return to court. They can hear the evidence without me and convict me in my absence.”

I said, “Then that will be a complete failure for you, Malcolm, and serves no good purpose whatsoever. I cannot agree with your point of view. You could see yourself in custody for many years if you continue with these views.” He said, “I do not like being blackmailed. It goes against everything I have fought for. The judge knows that I cannot defend myself if you walk out.” I said “I am not going to walk out on you, Malcolm.” He said “Well, whatever. He is putting myself in a situation where I need to accept the Crown is right and you are wrong. I have to form a view today that you are right and the Crown is wrong, I believe. I accept that I am not qualified to pass an opinion or I am incapable of forming a reasonable view. I may be wrong.” I said, “In life we all take chances. You go to the races, you bet on horses on a proper founded basis.” He said, “I don't gamble on things I cannot afford to lose.” I said, “I’m only using that as an analogy. You will not lose your chance and right to appeal.” He said, “If the trial is to continue then I am being forced into position by the Crown.”

I said “Surely you are not frightened of him?” He said “I am not frightened of anyone. It goes against my principles to submit to blackmail”. I said “If I thought that you were right, I would support you.” He said “I cannot submit to blackmail”. Mr Lowe said, “We appreciate your views, withdraw what you wrote. Are you prepared do that?” He said “We are debating the issue now. We have 15 minutes to go”. I said “It seems to me that you are playing gamesmanship. We need a decision now, we start at 3pm, and it may be with or without me. It would be better to go on with counsel. If I am a catalyst then abandon your instructions”. He said “I am not happy with the judge’s attitude, it is not very fair, and he is threatening you and me and assisting the Crown. I will let you know at 3pm”. I left the cell complex and came back to court.

At 3 o’clock Mr Potier arrived from the cells and said “I have not changed my mind and I am not going to allow any judge to blackmail me. You will have to represent me because I cannot represent myself. Can I put a statement on the record, will he allow me this” I said “Not while you have counsel. Either you withdraw that note or I may need to withdraw”. Following that I made certain applications to your Honour to seek advice from other parties. I did so. (my emphasis)


	
	Mr Potier did not re-examine Mr Healey to suggest that this account of the conference was inaccurate. Mr Potier did, however, deny the proposition put to him by the Crown that he had written the note as a device to abort the trial.
	
	
	The evidence thus before his Honour included evidence from Mr Healey as to the use to which Mr Potier had said he intended to put his state of lack of representation, so as to cause the jury to be discharged. In those circumstances, no error was shown in the trial judge’s refusal to allow an adjournment notwithstanding the prima facie position under s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act.
	
	
	His Honour then proceeded to dismiss Mr Potier’s application for an adjournment of the trial. In his Honour’s reasons, he said:
	


It becomes clear from the evidence of Mr Healey that the accused, thinking that he might have an appeal based upon the incompetence of counsel, did not wish to compromise it by allowing counsel to continue. …

On several occasions Mr Healey asked him to put aside point 4 of his written instructions and to allow him to continue.

The accused then set out actions which should be undertaken by counsel which represented clear manipulation of the legal system. When Mr Healey declined to be party to any such venture Potier accused the Court of blackmailing him. At one stage Mr Healey said “You can withdraw your instructions or I may have to withdraw”. It became clear to Mr Healey that Potier did not wish the trial to continue before this Court as presently constituted.

At a subsequent conversation at 2.15pm Mr Healy told Potier that Mr Lowe could continue to act, but Potier said “No, if the leader goes then so does Mr Lowe. Your solicitor [Ms McGowan] is not competent to run technical arguments and issues”.

He refused point blank to withdraw his written instructions, threatened that he would not appear in the Court if he were forced on, and despite Mr Healey’s best efforts to have him see the logic of the situation and the seriousness of the consequences which would follow upon the course he seemed determined to pursue, and despite being given time to consider his position, Potier remained adamant that his instructions in writing would not be withdrawn, and Mr Healey had in my view no option but to withdraw.

…

The circumstances are entirely of Mr Potier’s creation and if fault is to be apportioned then it lies entirely with him. Nothing that I have heard causes me to change a view that firstly, Mr Potier has created situations where both sets of counsel have been forced to withdraw, and secondly, that the Legal Aid Commission exercised its discretion appropriately and indeed, it has a statutory duty under s 12(a) of the Act to refuse him legal aid, and, thirdly, that an appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee would be frivolous and vexatious, and, in the light of the inevitability of the failure, designed solely to abort this trial. (emphasis as per original)


	
	His Honour went on to state that Mr Potier had never lacked representation because even when Mr Healey was so compromised that he was forced to withdraw, Mr Potier had the services of Mr Lowe of counsel and Ms McGowan, solicitor, both of whom he had dismissed.
	
	
	Although Mr Potier subsequently took issue with his Honour’s suggestion that he had dismissed Mr Lowe and Ms McGowan, there was a basis for his Honour’s conclusion that he had effectively done so.
	
	
	As to Mr Lowe, the transcript records Mr Healey informing his Honour that Mr Lowe considered himself in the same position as Mr Healey (i.e., that he had been put in a position where he was required under the Bar Rules to withdraw) and in that sense the statement that Mr Lowe had been dismissed would not strictly be accurate. However, it is also clear from the transcript, following the evidence given by Mr Healey, that his Honour understood that evidence to be to the effect that, up until the time of and during the conversation that Mr Potier had with Mr Healey and Mr Lowe, the position was that if Mr Healey withdrew Mr Lowe could have continued (in which case Mr Potier would not have been without counsel) but that what occurred in that conference amounted to the effective dismissal of Mr Lowe. That would explain his Honour’s characterisation of the situation as being one where Mr Healey withdrew but Mr Lowe was effectively dismissed.
	
	
	As to Ms McGowan, while she did indicate to his Honour that she had obtained similar legal advice as to her position as that obtained by Mr Healey, she also indicated that Mr Potier had not wished her to continue without Counsel. Mr Healey’s evidence supports the conclusion that Mr Potier had made it clear that he did not wish Ms McGowan to continue the trial without Counsel and in that sense she too was effectively dismissed.
	
	
	Nothing, therefore, turns on the fact that his Honour had referred, in his reasons for refusing the adjournment, to Mr Healey being the only member of the defence legal team who had withdrawn.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s submissions in this Court were that if Mr Healey was correct in withdrawing “due to the error of ‘Carlos’”, there is and was no justification for Mr Lowe or Ms McGowan also to withdraw and all that should have happened was that the trial continue with a lesser but experienced representation. Two difficulties with that submission must be pointed out. First, the withdrawal of Mr Healey was not over the “error” of the Carlos question, as such. Rather, Mr Healey was placed in a position where he considered he was required to withdraw because Mr Potier had made clear he wished to maintain a Birks ground of appeal in relation to the questioning of A over the Carlos matter (by reference to the applicable Bar Rules) and, secondly, as a result of what Mr Healey considered to be Mr Potier’s attempt to encourage him to manipulate the Court process. Secondly, the evidence of Mr Healey makes it clear that not only did Mr Lowe consider himself to be in the same position as Mr Healey but also that Mr Potier had made it clear that he did not wish his trial to continue with the representation of Mr Lowe or that of Ms McGowan alone.
	
	
	His Honour considered that, by his actions qua his Counsel and his solicitor, Mr Potier had placed himself well outside the range of the considerations referred to in Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 315. That conclusion was well open to his Honour given the more complete explanation of events by then available to him as to the circumstance in which Mr Healey had withdrawn as counsel.
	
	
	It is apparent that his Honour was mindful of the potential application of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act, had concluded that the evidence gave rise to a prima facie view that the exception applied, considered the evidence before him and concluded, for cogent reasons, that s 57 did not, in the circumstances, mandate a stay of the proceedings. No error has been shown in that regard. Nor is the ruling one that discloses bias, or any basis for an apprehension of bias.
	
	
	Mr Potier relies on the observation made by Hunt AJA in the Court of Criminal Appeal on 13 September 2006 (at the time of Mr Potier’s unsuccessful application for leave to appeal from the trial judge’s refusal to grant the adjournment sought on 7 September 2006), to the effect that it would be a “disaster” for the trial to continue without legal representation for the defence. Mr Potier says that, if that assessment be right, then that decision was clearly a question of bias.
	
	
	The observation made by Hunt AJA does not assist Mr Potier to establish actual or apprehended bias on the part of the trial judge. Clearly, it would have been preferable not only in Mr Potier’s own interest but in the interest of efficient trial management for Mr Potier to have had the benefit of legal representation. His Honour was clearly conscious of that, given that he had been careful to ensure that Mr Potier understood what the consequences of not withdrawing the Birks point might be. The fact that, by reason of the withdrawal of counsel and the refusal of an adjournment, he would not have a legal representative going forward in the trial could quite readily be seen as likely to cause difficulty in the efficient running of the trial.
	
	
	However, the refusal to grant an adjournment involved no appellable error. His Honour, by that stage, had been able to form a view as to the complexity of the trial and the ability of Mr Potier to understand and express the case he was seeking to put to the jury; and took those matters into account in refusing the adjournment.
	
	
	Thereafter, the trial continued with Mr Potier representing himself. At the conclusion of the day’s hearing on 15 September 2006, Mr Potier made a further application that the jury be discharged on the grounds of prejudice occasioned to Mr Potier by his counsel.
	
	
	In the context of this application Mr Potier said that he had reviewed matters of the previous day and that it appeared clear that Mr Healey, Mr Lowe and Ms McGowan did “have prior knowledge of Carlos” before they asked the questions and that they did know what A was going to say. The basis for this submission was not made clear. It directly contradicts what was said by Mr Healey (in Mr Potier’s presence) when Mr Healey made the initial objection to the “Carlos” answer. (Mr Healey’s position on that occasion, as noted earlier, was that he had instructions that Carlos was a former cellmate and that what was on the relevant page of the transcript was nonsense.)
	
	
	On 18 September 2006, Mr Potier pressed his application for the discharge of the jury. He said:
	


The basis is your Honour in the simplest terms Mr Healey, as your Honour recalls, asked the witness “A” about Carlos and following on from that there was considerable difficulty as we all know. The belief that I had, and I think the Crown and everybody else, was that there was no pre-warning of what the significance of the evidence Carlos was going to give. It turns out upon my reviewing of the very central brief that the Crown provided that it was very clear about the significance of Carlos and I freely admit that I missed it, but nevertheless it exists and counsel should have picked it up and I am concerned that it has created a problem.


	
	His Honour expressed the opinion that it had not created a problem because he had told the jury to disregard it. He further stated that it formed no part of the Crown case against Mr Potier and that, having looked at Mr Healey’s evidence, he was of the view that Mr Potier wished to take advantage of this. His Honour’s view was that it was not a matter that would cause him to discharge the jury.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor, in the course of the discussion on this application, referred his Honour to a contemporaneous note of 20 January 2002 by A (MFI 20) in which there were words to the effect “a thousand dollars offered to have Carlos whacked” as supporting the credence of the answer that A had given on 6 September 2006.
	
	
	For the same reasons as earlier, no basis for complaint arises out of the above. His Honour had considered the background to the application, including the circumstances in which Mr Potier had (on Mr Healey’s evidence) made a conscious decision to proceed without seeking to adduce before the jury the answer from Carlos to the effect that A thought that Mr Potier had been joking about Carlos. The instructions that Mr Healey said he had been given at the time he asked the question were that the transcript was complete nonsense. There was no suggestion that Counsel had instructions that this was an area to be avoided in cross-examination because there had been allegations that Mr Potier had offered money for Carlos to be killed.
	
	
	Even if this was an instance where the compressed time for preparation by Counsel had caused an unwise question to be asked, the means for dealing with the problem caused by the answer had been well and truly canvassed over the course of 6/7 September 2006. His Honour’s assessment was that in the circumstances it was not necessary for the jury to be discharged because the effect of the warning given to the jury (and his refusal to allow further questions on that topic) would remove the potential prejudice. Reasonable minds might differ on that question. However, no appellable error (or bias) is there disclosed and in light of the whole of the evidence before the jury, it cannot be concluded that there was any miscarriage of justice in the trial having proceeded as it did after the giving of the Carlos answer.

●   the trial judge putting Mr Potier in an “impossible position” following the withdrawal of his legal team in September 2006 (by forcing the trial to continue but denying access to the Crown brief and associated material) [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 16]

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow Mr Potier access to Crown brief and subpoenaed material or to material before the Court; [grounds 3 & 4] [AWS 16] [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 13]

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow appellant any time to master the 22,000 pages of material [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 12]


	
	The above grounds appear broadly to be a complaint as to the effect of his Honour’s refusal to grant an adjournment of the trial following the withdrawal of Mr Potier’s legal representation. His Honour had clearly taken into account Mr Potier’s involvement in the giving of instructions as something indicating his familiarity with the matter. Moreover, this was the second time that the incidents in 2000 were to be put to a jury. Mr Potier must have been aware of what was being put against him in relation to those incidents.
	
	
	Insofar as the complaint extends to a complaint to allow Mr Potier access to the Crown brief or subpoenaed material, this involves a misrepresentation of what occurred.
	
	
	Complaint is made about the trial judge’s refusal to allow Mr Potier access to subpoenaed material. The issue arose on 7 September 2006 after Mr Potier had taken over the cross-examination of A. At the close of the day’s hearing, in the absence of the jury, Mr Potier sought access to the subpoenaed documents. His Honour asked which documents and Mr Potier’s response was that he was going to have to read them all. His Honour made it clear that he needed to keep the documents under the Court control so the documents could not leave the Court without his permission. His Honour indicated that if there was reason to call on a document he could do so and he would be given it. He said that Mr Potier could certainly have access to documents. The difficulty was that Mr Potier had not identified particular documents to which he wished to have access. There is no appellable error disclosed by that ruling.
	


Bail

●   the trial judge’s refusal to grant bail so that Mr Potier could conduct his defence adequately; [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 14]


	
	Mr Potier complains that his Honour refused a request for bail for the purpose of enabling Mr Potier to conduct his defence adequately. Mr Potier refers in his submissions to the making of a bail application in circumstances where he had no way of contacting his intended witnesses because he was in custody.
	
	
	At the time of the second trial, s 9D of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) precluded the grant of bail to a person in respect of a serious personal violence offence, if the person was a repeat offender, unless the court was satisfied that exceptional circumstances justified the grant of bail. Mr Potier was at the time serving a term of imprisonment for the same very serious personal violence offence (as defined in s 9D(4)(a)) for which he was now being tried. Exceptional circumstances were therefore necessary to be shown for bail to be granted in respect of the subsequent offence. Mr Potier did not point to any such exceptional circumstances. Nor did he identify any error of discretion in the refusal of bail. Appellable error on the part of the trial judge was not established.
	


“Carlos” incident


	
	This group of complaints relates again to the Carlos incident. Again, I will consider them broadly in the order in which they arose in the course of the trial. Some of the complaints overlap with those I have considered under the previous headings.
	


“Blackmail”

●   the trial judge’s conduct in “blackmailing” Mr Potier to withdraw the note handed to Mr Healey of Counsel after the “Carlos matter” was raised “and thereby give up his Right of Appeal to this Court on His Honours Rulings” and refusing to permit the defence to correct the false impression that the “entirely unpredicted” evidence of A (on the Carlos matter) had created; [ground 4 - bias]

●   the trial judge informing Mr Potier, without knowing contents of note that had been sent to his solicitor for Counsel putting on record his concerns about Carlos matter and judge’s ruling that he had two options – to conduct the defence himself or to withdraw contents of note; [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 12]


	
	These complaints, which overlap but which I have set out separately as the varied formulations raise slightly different issues in some respects, go to the fact that the trial judge made it clear to Mr Potier, through Mr Potier’s then counsel, on 6/7 September 2006 the likely consequences, in terms of his continued representation by counsel at the trial, if Mr Potier did not withdraw the note to which Mr Healey had made reference.
	
	
	Insofar as complaint is made that his Honour did so without knowing the contents of the note at that stage, nothing turns on this. Mr Healey had informed his Honour in general terms that an issue had been raised as to whether Mr Potier’s chances of acquittal had been compromised. There was reference to a note that had been handed up. The nature of the issue, as it was explained to his Honour, was that a complaint had been made as to Mr Healey’s conduct of the matter in relation to the asking of the Carlos question. His Honour did not need to see the contents of the note, nor was it relevant that it might have contained other instructions, in order to form the view that it was appropriate to draw to Mr Potier’s attention that if the note (or whatever complaint it contained as to Mr Healey’s conduct of the defence) were not withdrawn then Mr Healey might be forced to withdraw. Mr Healey had informed his Honour in effect that this was the position.
	
	
	Mr Potier apparently perceived this, at the time, as blackmail, having regard to his discussion in conference with Mr Healey. That accusation is untenable. His Honour was quite properly seeking to make clear to Mr Potier that he could not assume that the trial would be adjourned if his Counsel were to withdraw and that he therefore understood what the consequences of not withdrawing whatever were the allegations that had put Mr Healey in a position where he considered he might have to withdraw. No bias is there shown.
	
	
	Whether or not the relevant question was one that might have given rise to a Birks ground of appeal, the accusation that his Honour was “blackmailing” Mr Potier to withdraw such a ground of appeal has no foundation.
	
	
	Mr Potier maintains that if his Honour had allowed continuation of cross-examination on the Carlos issue, then there would have been no need for him to write the note in the terms that he did to Mr Healey. That is speculation at best. Mr Potier says that the note dealt with two matters – the Carlos question and the consequences of the ruling that no further questions could be asked. Read onto the transcript the note was as follows:
	


Reference is made to the fact that the Crown raised the Birks issue in relation to the Carlos evidence, this was raised by Mr Potier as part of his ground of appeal relating to the Judge’s rulings but it is not clear how it is maintained that the Crown’s conduct amounts to a ground of appeal against his Honour’s rulings.


	
	Mr Potier complains that he was informed by the Judge (who at that stage did not know the contents of the note that Mr Potier had given to his solicitor) that he had two options – to conduct the defence himself or to withdraw the contents of the note. Again, no error is shown in that exchange. His Honour was putting Mr Potier on notice of the potential consequences if he did not withdraw the note (whatever that note might have said) in circumstances where his Honour was being informed by Mr Healey that if the note, relevantly, raised issues as to his competence as counsel and might cause him to have to withdraw.
	


Refusal to discharge jury

●   the trial judge’s refusal to discharge jury once “Carlos” matter came to jury’s attention; [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 11] – even after Crown informed Court that a R v Birks ground of appeal had been created [AWS 16]


	
	After his Honour refused the adjournment application on 7 September 2006, Mr Potier’s next application was for the jury to be discharged. His Honour refused that application. The fact that the Crown may have thought that there might be a potential Birks ground of appeal is irrelevant to the question whether his Honour erred in not discharging the jury at that point.
	
	
	The question whether to discharge the jury is one within the trial judge’s discretion. It has been recognised that the test requires a high degree of necessity in preventing a miscarriage of justice (Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 432; Williams v The Queen [2000] FCA 1868; (2000) 119 A Crim R 490 at [19]).
	
	
	In Crofts v The Queen, Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 440):
	


No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact.


	
	The underlying principle is that an accused must receive a fair trial according to law.
	
	
	His Honour, in the discussion with Counsel on 6 September 2006, clearly had regard to the impact that the unexpected (though not unsolicited) “Carlos” answer would have on the fairness of Mr Potier’s trial and whether a judicial direction to disregard that evidence was likely to overcome its apprehended impact. What is clear from his Honour’s observations is that he was not persuaded that the giving of that answer was necessarily inconsistent with the case that Mr Potier’s Counsel indicated he was seeking to run (namely, that A was someone who made up stories) and he considered that the answer that had been given was something that was a risk taken in cross-examination (and in that sense had been a result of the course adopted in cross-examination).
	
	
	His Honour acceded to the course that Mr Healey had indicated he had instructions to pursue, namely to adduce evidence from A on the voir dire that would be consistent with Mr Potier’s case that A made up stories. Mr Healey then, after having had the opportunity to take instructions from Mr Potier, chose without explanation not to pursue the course of adducing that evidence before the jury. His Honour was entitled to infer that a forensic decision had been made at that stage not to seek to ameliorate the unexpected damage that might have been done to the defence case.
	
	
	It is clear that his Honour recognised that the Carlos answer was potentially prejudicial to the defence (it being described as an unfortunate development in the case) but accepted the Crown submission that it could be remedied by an appropriate direction to the jury and gave a strongly worded direction for the jury to disregard the answer. It is recognised that in considering the principle of fairness account may be taken as to whether any prejudicial effect may be overcome by an appropriate direction (Samadi v R [2008] NSWCCA 330; (2008) 192 A Crim R 251; Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53); and that a jury is generally likely to follow an instruction to ignore evidence that has been struck out (R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329; see also: R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 and Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414).
	
	
	In those circumstances no error in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion not to discharge the jury has been identified. Nor has any bias been demonstrated in the making of that decision.
	


Refusal to disqualify himself for bias

●   the trial judge’s refusal to disqualify himself for apprehended bias following the withdrawal of Mr Healey of Counsel; [relied on for both grounds 3 & 4]] [AWS 13]


	
	Complaint is made as to the trial judge’s refusal to disqualify himself for apprehended bias. This related to the application, made after the refusal to grant the adjournment and the withdrawal of Mr Healey as counsel, by Mr Potier that the judge disqualify himself on the basis of apprehended bias. The basis for the apprehension of bias was identified as being his Honour’s refusal to discharge the jury and his refusal to grant an adjournment after the withdrawal of Mr Healey. That was also dismissed. It follows from the conclusion that nothing leading up to this ruling gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias that the mere fact that this application was refused does not in itself demonstrate bias. Nor was any error identified in the making of this decision such as would warrant appellate intervention.
	


Manner of withdrawal of counsel on 7 September 2006

●   the trial judge allowing the defence team to withdraw in front of jury (after the Carlos matter raised) and refusing to allow Mr Potier to address on those matters; [ground 4 – bias] [AWS 16]

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow appellant to address jury as to reasons why defence team had withdrawn [ground 4 – bias] [AWS 16]


	
	The Crown raised with his Honour whether or not he might invite Mr Healey and Ms McGowan to withdraw in front of the jury, referring to Greer’s case (R v Greer (1992) 62 A Crim R 442) where the Court considered that no injustice had been done by the withdrawal of counsel in front of the jury for the reason that the jury might speculate some unfairness to the accused if counsel “simply disappeared”. His Honour expressed some doubt as to whether this was the best course and whether it would abate the possibility of jury speculation.
	
	
	His Honour sought Mr Potier’s view on that issue. Mr Potier did not demur from the proposal that the withdrawal of counsel take place in front of the jury. He said that he agreed that the jury should have some form of explanation as to why there was a withdrawal.
	
	
	It may be inferred that his Honour did so in order to prevent jury speculation that some unfairness to Mr Potier had been occasioned by the withdrawal of counsel. Whether or not such speculation was likely, there was a rational basis for making that ruling. It does not evidence bias nor was it suggested that there was an error in his Honour’s exercise of discretion.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s real complaint seems to be that he was not permitted to address the jury “fully” on the reasons for counsel’s withdrawal. He expressed a desire to do so but without waiving legal professional privilege. His Honour warned Mr Potier that if he took that course (of “full disclosure”) and put anything to the jury that was contrary to the truth, the Crown might call Mr Healey to prove that it was false. Mr Potier took issue with the suggestion that any explanation he might give to the jury would be false.
	
	
	His Honour refused to allow Mr Potier to address the jury as to why Counsel had withdrawn. It is apparent that his Honour considered that to permit Mr Potier to do so would in all probability lead to the re-opening of the Carlos issue and its amplification in the minds of the jury to the potential disadvantage of Mr Potier. Mr Potier’s complaint of bias in this regard cannot be sustained; nor was any error identified in the exercise of discretion in that ruling.
	
	
	I note that when the basis for Mr Healey’s withdrawal was subsequently explored on the voir dire, it became apparent that Mr Potier’s explanation for Counsel’s withdrawal would likely have given rise to the very outcome his Honour had predicted, since Mr Potier’s version of events at that stage differed markedly from that of Mr Healey.
	


Further questions on Carlos issue

●   the trial judge’s direction that defence be barred from asking witness A further questions on Carlos matter; [relied on for both grounds 3 & 4] [AWS 12; 16-17]


	
	Mr Potier complains that he was denied the opportunity to ask further questions on the Carlos matter – both to put the matter in context and to prove that A was lying and making up stories. He maintains that if his Honour had allowed continuation of cross-examination on the Carlos issue then there would have been no need for him to write the note to Mr Healey in the terms that he did. (Mr Potier points out that his note dealt with two matters: the asking of the Carlos question and the consequences of the ruling that no further questions could be asked.)
	
	
	However, as the transcript makes evident, the opportunity for A to be questioned as to the Carlos answer was afforded to Mr Potier (in the absence of the jury), which meant that any further adverse answer was not given in the presence of the jury. The purpose of the questioning that his Honour allowed to be pursued on the voir dire (as to whether A had referred the Carlos matter to the authorities) went to the credence A had placed in that matter. However, as noted earlier, that line of questioning was not pursued at the conclusion of the voir dire or at a later stage. Nor was any application made to tender the answer given by A on the voir dire in evidence at the trial. Instead it appears that a forensic decision was made to press for the discharge of the jury, rather than pursue such line of questioning.
	
	
	The refusal to permit further questioning on this aspect of the matter, i.e., the Carlos answer, does not bespeak bias. Rather, his Honour made it clear that he was seeking to prevent unfairness to the defence by preventing further potentially prejudicial evidence to be adduced on that matter. It was the decision of the defence not to pursue the foreshadowed line of questioning that would have revealed to the jury that A had not reported the Carlos threat to the authorities and that A had thought Mr Potier was joking in relation to that matter. There may have been sound forensic reasons for not so doing – the Crown has pointed to other statements recorded in the transcript that might have lent credence to the Carlos answer; moreover, the Crown had foreshadowed an intention to re-examine A in order to re-establish his credibility if the defence continued with the Carlos line of questioning. Nevertheless, neither error nor bias is demonstrated by his Honour on this issue. Mr Potier must be taken to have made a forensic decision not to pursue such questioning at the relevant time, through Counsel.
	


Rulings re witnesses/cross-examination


	
	I consider under this heading, Mr Potier’s complaints as to rulings made in relation to various of the witnesses or potential witnesses, including further complaint as to the cross-examination of A. In summary, no error or bias is shown by those rulings – his Honour making it clear that Mr Potier would be permitted to challenge A’s character but, for particular reasons which his Honour articulated, refused to allow particular areas of questioning.
	
	
	At the outset I note that while Mr Potier still had the benefit of legal representation, Mr Healey identified those of the Crown witnesses at the first trial that Mr Potier wished to be produced for cross-examination, those being: Mr Wakeham, (the relevance of whose evidence relating to a suggestion by Ms Conway that she had received a phone call from somebody supposedly threatening her family); Mr Finlay (who had carried out the Optus webtrace), and Ms Hosie (the de facto partner of a prison inmate (Mr Basso) to whom Ms Conway said moneys had been given at the direction of Mr Potier to arrange for Ms Oswald and Mr Wakeham’s murder before M became involved).
	
	
	One week after Mr Potier had assumed the conduct of his defence, he raised the problem of how he would be able to communicate with his witnesses. He said that he had no ability to obtain proofs from them and had no ability to bring them to Court. The explanation for there being no proofs of evidence of the defence witnesses prior to the trial (at a time when Mr Potier did have legal representation) was not clear.
	
	
	For the most part, the Crown arranged for those witnesses whose evidence was in the Crown brief to be available to give evidence at the trial. In some instances the Crown did not, or was unable or unwilling to, do so, as will shortly be seen. Mr Potier has raised complaint in respect of this both as to the manner in which the Crown conducted the case having regard to its duty of fairness (ground 7) and as to the conduct by the defence of his case (ground 5).
	
	
	Mr Potier makes particular complaint about rulings in relation to various of the witnesses or proposed witnesses: the former wife of A; Mr Wakeham; and Mr MacKechnie. Complaint is also made that his Honour refused to allow legitimate areas of cross-examination of A. I consider those complaints in groups relating to the particular witnesses.
	


A’s ex-wife

●   the trial judge requiring Mr Potier to disclose details of the defence case (relating to the former wife of witness A) while the Crown case was ongoing; [ground 4 - bias] [AWS 13]

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow A’s ex wife to be called as a rebuttal witness; [ground 4 - bias] [AWS 13,14,18]

●   the trial judge’s refusal to permit Mr Potier to call the former wife of witness A as a witness (elsewhere reference is to the trial judge’s refusal to allow him to call all of his defence witnesses); [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 13, 18]


	
	These complaints, which to an extent overlap, all relate to a witness identified by Mr Potier as A’s ex-wife. Mr Potier said that he wished to call her in order to demonstrate that A’s evidence at the trial that he was still married to her was a lie. A’s answer had been: “She is still my wife”.
	
	
	This was linked to a line of questioning that Mr Potier wished to pursue in relation to the contents of a The Sunday Telegraph article that had been written about A in which reference was made to A having led a “double life”, with a wife and a mistress who believed that he was no longer married to the first wife. The relevance of the former Mrs A’s evidence in this regard was peripheral in the extreme.
	
	
	Whatever the jury might have considered as to the morality of conduct of that kind it does not have a close relationship to the kind of conduct that Mr Potier wished to suggest A had now engaged in – namely duplicitous behaviour with a view to obtaining a reward or benefit while he was in prison. More relevant in that regard might be thought to be that he was serving a sentence for fraud – a matter of which the jury was aware and his Honour gave a clear caution as to the acceptance of A’s evidence as a prison informant. Other than to the extent that a lie as to whether he was still married might have cast doubt on his credibility, there was no suggestion that A’s ex-wife had any relevant evidence to give on the issues in Mr Potier’s trial.
	
	
	His Honour made it clear that he considered any evidence A’s ex-wife might give would be irrelevant to the trial. No error has been shown in relation to that decision. Nor does the ruling demonstrate any bias.
	
	
	This complaint is linked to Mr Potier’s complaint that he was not permitted to put into evidence the contents of The Sunday Telegraph article, which I consider in due course.
	


Mr Wakeham

●   the trial judge’s refusal to require the Crown to call Mr Wakeham (T 359); [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 19]


	
	Complaint is made as to his Honour’s refusal to require the Crown to call Mr Wakeham. I have referred above to the indication given by Mr Healey that Mr Potier wanted each of Mr Wakeham, Ms Hosie and Mr Finlay available for cross-examination. The Crown indicated that it had no way of contacting Ms Hosie and that all it had was her evidence from the first trial. His Honour asked Mr Potier to explain what relevance evidence as to the money bore to the content of the telephone calls. Mr Potier’s position was that Ms Conway had stolen the money. The Crown indicated it had tried to locate Ms Hosie in the past and would still continue to do so. No complaint seems now to be made as to the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine Ms Hosie.
	
	
	The Crown then said Mr Wakeham would not be called. The Crown prosecutor indicated that he had considered the defence’s request and the authorities and that the Crown was not going to call him. Mr Healey indicated that he would consider the position.
	
	
	His Honour did not make a ruling requiring the Crown to call Mr Wakeham and it does not appear that he was ever asked to make such a ruling.
	
	
	Mr Wakeham had given evidence in the first trial. Mr Potier apparently wished to cross-examine him as to allegations that he, Mr Wakeham, had made threatening telephone calls to Ms Conway. No error on the part of the trial judge has been pointed to in this regard. There is no basis for Mr Potier’s complaint on this issue.
	


Mr MacKechnie

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow Mr Potier the right to call MacKechnie in person or by video link (reference being made to the fact that the Attorney-General had funded the cost of Ms Oswald giving evidence); [relied on for grounds 3 & 4]; [AWS 14; 21]

●   the trial judge’s requirement that Mr Potier identify what evidence Mr MacKechnie would give before close of Crown case – see also complaint that defence was obliged to disclose details of defence case to Crown while Crown case ongoing - [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 14]


	
	Mr MacKechnie is a solicitor in Glasgow who was a friend of both Mr Potier and Ms Oswald. After Mr Potier had assumed the conduct of his defence, he indicated that he wished to call Mr MacKechnie to give evidence. The Crown opposed this (on the basis of relevance and cost). His Honour initially ruled against Mr Potier’s application for Mr MacKechnie to attend to give evidence in person (which would have required the issue of a subpoena and the Crown to bear the cost of his travel to Australia for that purpose) or by videolink, on the basis that the evidence was not relevant. His Honour subsequently revisited that ruling and permitted, with the Crown’s acquiescence, a statement sworn by Mr MacKechnie to be read to the jury. The Crown arranged for the statement to be taken by liaison with police in the United Kingdom.
	
	
	Mr Potier’s first complaint is that his Honour refused to allow Mr MacKechnie to give any evidence until Mr Potier had identified what evidence he would give i.e., had requested him to disclose his defence, while the Crown case was ongoing. There is no basis for that complaint. The issue arose in the following context: Mr Potier requested, in the absence of the jury, that a witness he wished to call give evidence by videolink. His Honour said he would have to consider that and would have to know firstly where the witness was and noted that it was very late to make those arrangements so that for technical reasons it might not be possible and he would have to consider the part that the witness would play in the defence in order to possibly to allow that.
	
	
	Mr Potier indicated that the person was a very senior solicitor in Scotland and that he expected that the evidence he would give would be that he knew Mr Potier and Ms Oswald for many, many years; met and spoke to Ms Oswald on many occasions after Mr Potier was taken into custody; and that Ms Oswald told him certain things which he communicated to Mr Potier. This was hardly any forced disclosure of his case let alone one that would have caused any prejudice to his defence.
	
	
	His Honour then said that, for the moment, putting aside the financial aspect, the best thing Mr Potier could do, would be to write down in paragraph form what it is that Mr Potier said the witness would say. His Honour said that if the evidence lay outside what they anticipated, then he would raise the matter with the Crown.
	
	
	The matter was again raised on the next day of the trial, in the absence of the jury. Mr Potier gave to his Honour a confidential note of the proposed evidence. His Honour indicated that if Mr Potier wished the note to be confidential then he would simply indicate that he would not take any steps in that regard and would publish reasons later. Therefore, no prejudice in that having been made available to the prosecution could be asserted.
	
	
	The following day, his Honour considered that the evidence was inadmissible and said that it was impossible to rule in Mr Potier’s favour on his application to allow Mr MacKechnie to be called in person or by videolink unless the Crown saw the note and consented to the document signed by Mr MacKechnie going into evidence. This, together with the refusal to allow Mr MacKechnie to be called in person, is the basis for Mr Potier’s second complaint.
	
	
	His Honour’s initial ruling against the videolink, for reasons that his Honour said he would deliver later, was on the basis of the perceived irrelevance of the evidence. His Honour later revisited that ruling as to irrelevance because he did see some relevance in the evidence albeit that it was of a hearsay nature. Ultimately, his Honour permitted the sworn statement to be read to the jury.
	
	
	In revisiting the initial ruling (that the evidence was irrelevant and hearsay and there was little point pursuing it further because should the Crown object to the evidence he would have to rule it inadmissible) on the following day, (19 September 2006), his Honour explained that his preliminary view had arisen out of the fact that so far in his case three defences had been put forward. His Honour said that the document represented a fourth. As a consequence, his Honour said he was applying the other three defences which he sought of the circumstances and not as he saw the fourth defence. His Honour said it would nevertheless still be inadmissible but that if the Crown raised no objection to it or allowed to go before it by way of a document before the jury, then that would be a matter for the Crown. So his Honour indicated that that matter had reached an impasse that unless Mr Potier was prepared for the Crown to absorb the view that he now put forward as a defence, it would be impossible for him to make a decision in his favour. Mr Potier said he thought it was so important to this defence that he would not wish the opportunity of not presenting it to the jury and was more than happy for his Honour to discuss the matter with the Crown.
	
	
	His Honour summarised what he understood the defence to be as at that point as follows:
	


So far the accused has put forward the defence that the maker of the calls was not him, that the calls are not his.

…

And that is over all of the calls and taped interviews. Secondly, that he would raise a defence of mental ill health, and, thirdly, that A was malevolently arranging a set of circumstances to entrap him or to put words into his mouth and that he was merely humouring A, and a fourth one is that he was, the accused, was playing a trick on A. It wasn’t A misleading him but him misleading A.

Now, the reason he wants this solicitor to be called in his defence by some means or other is that he has been in contact, that is the solicitor, with both Potier and Ms Oswald, he was a solicitor to both of them at some stage and he seems to have implied a personal friend. He has contacted the accused whilst he has been held in custody here. He has informed the accused that Mr Oswald has informed him that she no longer resided in January, or did not reside in January and February in Rhynie, she was elsewhere in the UK. And he was privy therefore to information that she was not in Scotland and in consequence sending A off in the direction of Scotland to do his wishes was a trick being played on A.


	
	His Honour considered the evidence sought to be adduced from Mr MacKechnie had a tenuous kind of relevance, the foundation for that having built up in questions to Ms Oswald to the point that she was not residing in Rynie between the beginning of January and end of February and that Mr Potier wanted the evidence to show that he was possessed of this knowledge so that whatever he was telling A could only be in the manner of a joke and in consequence of which he lacked the necessary mens rea to be guilty of the offence.
	
	
	Mr Potier agreed with his Honour’s suggestion that the Crown be permitted to see the letter in case his Honour might have misrepresented Mr Potier’s position.
	
	
	The Crown then suggested that the Scottish police could interview the solicitor and have a proof of evidence at short notice, which is what ultimately occurred. All of this discussion was in the absence of the jury.
	
	
	The matter was revisited on 22 September 2006. The Crown indicated to his Honour that the Crown would be prepared for the draft affidavit of Mr MacKechnie to be read to the jury and his Honour said that in those circumstances he would not make any attempt to have a videolink. His Honour thought that that would be sufficient. Mr Potier said that he felt the jury should actually be able to see the person so that they could attribute the statement to a human being and judge the truthfulness or otherwise of his evidence by seeing him like all other crown witnesses. His Honour said:
	


Well, I have to balance the inconvenience to all concerned, the fact is that we are in a different time zone, and that it is enormously expensive and takes time to arrange, it might be days and it might be weeks, and the conduct of the trial at present, and the fact that you have raised this but recently, and that all these efforts have been made on your behalf. And taking all of that into consideration I think that the agreement that the Crown gives is the best that can be achieved at this stage. And that is all that I will possibly require of the Crown.


	
	Mr Potier asked for an explanation as to the use that the defence could make of that document. His Honour explained that the document, insofar as it recounted facts related to Mr MacKechnie by Ms Oswald, was hearsay; that the Crown was prepared to waive any objection in relation to the hearsay but had indicated there would be a difficult hole in the submissions Mr Potier might wish to make, were he not to give evidence (that is, that having received that information Mr Potier believed it to be true). His Honour said:
	


His Honour:   Now I’m not making a ruling on this you. Haven’t [sic] indicated to the Court whether you intend to give evidence or not, and you may not in any event give it. I’m not making any ruling, just explaining what the situation is to you as the Crown pass [sic: has] explained it to me. It is a matter for you. But don’t – I don’t want you to think that you are under any constraints to give evidence or not to give evidence. That is entirely a matter for your choice, you know, with respect to the value of that the respective risks and detriments. I don’t want to go into that again. Does that explain that matter to you.

Accused:   It does, your Honour, and helps me a great deal. I just wanted to avoid the possible pitfall of, if I decided not to give evidence and I referred to that affidavit, whether the Crown could hold that against me, which I think was in essence what the issue was.

His Honour:   Let me put it in a nutshell. If you were to say, “I received this information from Mr MacKechnie and in consequence of which I believed Oswald was otherwise than in the United Kingdom or in Scotland, then you will have to be stopped, because you would be giving evidence from the dock”.


	
	No prejudice is shown by the fact that Mr MacKechnie was not cross-examined in person over the videolink. It was not suggested that his evidence should be disbelieved because he had not been cross-examined. Further, insofar as complaint is now made as to the requirement that the defence was obliged to disclose details of the defence case to the Crown while the Crown case was ongoing, by reference to what occurred (T863-864; T947), there is no basis to this complaint. It was a forensic decision made by Mr Potier in the circumstances set out above to provide details in advance of the evidence that he sought to adduce from Mr MacKechnie.
	


Cross-examination of A

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow further questions of A (after the Carlos matter was raised) to show the true character of A; [grounds 3 & 4] [AWS 21-22]

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow “legitimate areas of cross-examination” of A [ground 3& 4] [AWS 17, 18]


	
	Various areas of cross-examination are the subject of this complaint.
	
	
	One area related to the content of an article from The Sunday Telegraph (MFI 25), which related to A’s fraud conviction. Mr Healey showed A a copy of that article. A’s response was that almost all of the factual matters contained in the article were “false, misleading and created by lie creators”.
	
	
	Mr Healey questioned A as to various matters referred to in the report, such as whether or not he had repaid the moneys ordered by the District Court. A agreed that he had not repaid any of the moneys. A said that he understood the allegation against him was that he had received funds and disbursed them on his living expenses and he denied it. A said that he did not receive any of the funds. His Honour then rejected a question as to whether or not he was maintaining two homes. The relevance of that question to the proceedings was not apparent. It seems to have been put as going to A’s credit. There was no error in rejecting the question.
	
	
	In the same context, Mr Potier refers to discussion between Mr Healey and the trial judge as to the proposed questioning by Mr Healey of A’s health, in the context of a voir dire, held on 4 September 2009 in relation to the application for suppression of A’s name. Reference was also made to an appeal A had brought from his sentencing by the same trial judge. His Honour expressed the view that he was disinclined to have the medical practitioners brought to Court because he considered that it would not bear at all, or very little, on his decision in the matter and having regard to the costs and the disruption occasioned. The Crown noted that the central question on that limited application was whether or not to exercise the discretion to grant a suppression order, the most pressing reason of which was not A’s ill health but that A was a prison informant.
	
	
	His Honour ultimately admitted the medical certificates as business records but was not prepared to waste the resources of both the doctors of the Crown to bring them to Court to give evidence in accordance with those statements and considered that this was not unfair to Mr Healey’s position because it did not bear on the question of protecting the privacy of the witness.
	
	
	The next area of cross-examination about which complaint was made was at T 438-440. The Crown tendered a handwritten note made by A recording details that A said the accused had given to him in preparation for the communication of his wish that Ms Oswald be killed. His Honour queried the basis of the tender, suggesting that it was a self-serving document in the hands of A. The Crown said that it contained information peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused when he was in prison with A. Mr Healey objected to the tender on the basis that it was self-serving; was made in the absence of Mr Potier; and there was no date as to when it came into being and in what precise circumstances. Mr Healey accepted that A could give evidence that certain things were told to him and that he had put them down in the document. However, he objected to A refreshing his memory from the note on the basis that he contended that the original document would have to be produced and that it was unfair to the accused to have a witness of this kind “pulling himself up by the boot straps”. His Honour pointed out that the tender of the document might have that effect, but that there could be no objection to A giving evidence that certain things were told to him by the accused. Ultimately, Mr Healey’s position was that the issue was one of fairness and there would be no basis for objection as long as A did not read from the note directly and he produced the original document.
	
	
	His Honour indicated that A could refresh his memory from the note if it was a contemporaneous document but rejected the tender of the documents (MFI 18 and 19). Complaint is made by Mr Potier as to what then was recorded (at T443) where the Crown made the foreshadowed application for leave for A to refresh his memory by reference to MFI 18, Mr Healey objected if A was going to read the note onto the record; and his Honour permitted him to do so on the basis that it was very much the same thing as refreshing his memory from the notes on an ongoing basis for which leave had already been given.
	
	
	The next complaint related to what occurred when, during the cross-examination of A, Mr Healey handed up MFI 25 which was a copy of an article published in The Sunday Telegraph. Mr Healey was asked to explain the relevance of the document to the defence and he responded that the accused maintained that A was a person who had engaged in duplicitous activities in the past evidenced by the facts relating to A’s convictions and referred to the “facts” set out in the article. Mr Healey accepted that the term “facts” in this context might be journalistic licence at least to some extent. Mr Healey nevertheless sought to rely on the document to supply the jury with knowledge of a man who it was said was duplicitous in his relationship and his home life (if it was correct that he was maintaining two homes as reported in the article and that neither of the parties knew he was conducting a double life).
	
	
	His Honour initially indicated that Mr Healey could cross-examine on those areas but said that he was not entitled to put to A the kinds of concessions contained in the article (T500). After further debate, his Honour rejected any more questions on MFI 25 on the basis that it was designed only to embarrass A, who was not the author of the article in The Sunday Telegraph (T501).
	
	
	The next area of cross-examination referred to was at T538-539 in the context of the examination of A on the voir dire following his “Carlos” answer. It is not clear to what question Mr Potier is there referring. Certainly no question by Mr Healey was rejected at that point in the transcript. Mr Potier’s reference to The Sunday Telegraph article is that it related to threats by A and A’s allegation that his Honour was corrupt.
	
	
	No error in the rulings about which complaint was made has been shown.
	


Public Interest Immunity

●   the trial judge’s grant of public interest immunity to exclude questioning of A if he had made similar allegations about any other wrongdoing while at Long Bay; [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 18]

●   the trial judge’s refusal to allow Mr Potier to ask Detective Sipos if he had signed up A as a police informant; [ground 3 – judge’s rulings] [AWS 18]


	
	Complaint is made that his Honour granted public interest immunity to exclude particular questioning of A (namely as to whether he had made similar allegations about any other wrongdoing while he was in jail) and as to his Honour’s refusal to allow Mr Potier to ask Detective Sipos if he had signed up A as a police informant.
	
	
	As to the first, after Mr Potier had assumed the conduct of his defence and the cross-examination of A resumed, he asked A (on 7 September 2006): “And did you make any other reports to Corrective Services or the police about any other wrongdoing whilst you were at Long Bay?”.
	
	
	An objection was made by Counsel representing the Commissioner of Police, Ms England. His Honour asked the jury to step down and argument as to the objection that had been taken was held in the absence of the jury. His Honour asked Mr Potier what he intended to put to the witness so that he could understand the objection taken by Ms England. Mr Potier referred to a particular entry in some notes that A had prepared which referred to a meeting on 31 January with two named individuals. Ms England asked that the court be closed, and it was.
	
	
	A claim was then made for public interest immunity on the basis that a witness cannot properly be asked to disclose to what, if any, extent he or she may have assisted police in matters other than the one being heard in Court. In support of that claim, Ms England relied on a number of affidavits, two of which were confidential. The confidential affidavits were not provided to Mr Potier.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied as to the claim for public interest immunity, ruled against the question that had been asked and ordered A not to answer it.
	
	
	Mr Potier then indicated that what he sought to ask A was whether he was a habitual or established police or Corrective Services informant. His Honour pointed out that A had already been asked that question by Mr Healey and that A had denied it and that there the matter must end. His Honour did not accept the proposition by Mr Potier that the relevant entry in A’s notes contradicted his earlier denial that he was an habitual or established police or Corrective Services informant but his Honour went on to explain to Mr Potier that the matter he wished to raise could only go to A’s credit and that his Honour did not consider that there was any substantially probative value in that material going before the jury. His Honour’s view was that this material would be confusing and would deflect the jury.
	
	
	Mr Potier submits on this appeal that he wished to question A about meetings with the authorities about other potential offences in order to establish before the jury how such complaints were received and dealt with, and what was their final outcome. He submits that it was reasonable to deduce (from the document which is MHP 8) that A had made other reports. He submits that if, as he suspects, the result was “that the authorities deduced that he was making things up and ignored him”, this was highly relevant to the jury’s assessment of A’s evidence.
	
	
	It is clear that his Honour considered the material that had been put before him in ruling on the question. His Honour rejected the question on the basis of the claimed public interest immunity but also because he considered it to be irrelevant. No appellable error or bias is shown in that instance.
	
	
	It is also clear that what his Honour was encouraging Mr Potier to do was to focus on the case that he had to meet (in particular the accuracy and the validity of the taped conversations and the evidence that A had given). His Honour pointed out to Mr Potier that it would not make any difference to his case if A were a paid informer of the police.
	
	
	His Honour said:
	


I would like you to understand it as well because there are more of these issues. I am trying to keep you focussed on the case you have to meet and to see that you, as it were, put the best case you possibly can before the jury. I can assure you I would not constrain you in any relevant evidence in your cross-examination. But I am going to constrain you in that because first of all there is public interest immunity but much more important than that is that it is irrelevant.


	
	A similar issue arose on 11 September 2006 when Mr Potier, in the absence of the jury, sought clarification from his Ho",2015-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766855,R v Bowman [2015] NSWDC 94,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Steven Bowman (“the accused”) was arraigned on 1 June 2015 on a charge alleging that:
	


“On 31 December 2012 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales (he) did drive a motor vehicle, namely a Holden Commodore, in a manner dangerous to another person, whereby the vehicles involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Kim Barnes was occasioned. “


	
	To this charge the accused pleaded he was ‘not guilty’. The trial proceeded as a trial by Judge, in accordance with the provisions of s 132, 132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986, although the accused required leave to make the application given the timing of it.
	
	
	The offence alleged against the accused is one contrary to s 52A(1)(c)/(5)(g).
	


The Crown case


	
	The relevant events involving the allegation brought against the accused arise from various occurrences on New Year’s Eve 2012 at Narrabri. The accused is alleged to have injured the deceased at about 10 pm that evening. The accused and the deceased were in a domestic relationship and had been for a number of months. They lived together at her home at 81 Peele Street Narrabri. On New Year’s Eve there was a dispute between them at a hotel on Maitland Street Narrabri where they were drinking, the detail of which is not required to be examined at this point. The Crown case was that the accused after various arguments with the deceased back at their residence, went to his motor vehicle parked in the driveway of the deceased’s home. He reversed the vehicle up the driveway and then drove off along Peele Street to the intersection of Clarke Street at a time when the Crown alleges the deceased was at one point sitting on the rear spoiler or on the boot of the vehicle, a blue Commodore sedan registration no. (NSW) BF68TR. The Crown case was that she was doing this either at the time the accused was reversing the motor vehicle or whilst the accused was driving the vehicle away from the front of the home of the deceased. The prosecution alleges that she fell off the vehicle suffering the injuries that lead to her death.
	
	
	The Crown case proceeds on the basis that there was no dispute as to the accused driving the motor vehicle. The critical issues anticipated by the prosecution were establishing relevant “impact” arising from the driving of the motor vehicle in circumstances contemplated by s 52A(5)(g) Crimes Act 1900 whilst the accused was driving “in a manner dangerous to another person”.
	
	
	In proving the case against the accused, the Crown relied upon evidence concerning the dispute that occurred between the deceased and the accused during New Year’s Eve, culminating in the accused deciding to leave the deceased’s premises, shortly before 10 pm, observations of the deceased and the accused before and after she was injured, the accused’s subsequent conduct and representations, the “objective” crime scene evidence arising from the examination of the area where the deceased suffered her injuries, the examination of the motor vehicle, the character and interpretation of the injuries suffered amongst other matters.
	
	
	Although there was a body of evidence of surrounding circumstances to the cause of the injuries suffered by the deceased there were no eye witnesses to any alleged impact. The mechanism(s) for the cause(s) of those injuries suffered in the context of the impact pleaded ultimately were to be drawn or concluded by inference from such facts as could be established. The prosecution relied upon statements and conduct of the accused after the event as evidence of “consciousness of guilt” particularly relevant to negativing “honest and reasonable belief”, or which might otherwise shed light on the circumstances of the alleged “impact”. He told lies about whether he was driving the car, who had driven it and endeavoured to encourage others (particularly Brittany Herring the 17-18 year old daughter of friends) to tell lies about this matter.
	
	
	From the defence perspective there was no issue that at relevant times the accused was driving the motor vehicle. However, it was not conceded that the driving of the accused caused the relevant impact or that the driving was “in a manner dangerous”. It was claimed by the accused in various police interviews that at relevant times he was unaware that the deceased was sitting on the rear of the car.
	
	
	The accused was spoken to by police at the scene shortly after the injuries were suffered by the deceased and also interviewed in two electronic interviews conducted on 1 and 3 January 2013. In those interviews he denied knowledge of the deceased being on the vehicle at relevant times he was driving the vehicle. He stated that the last time he saw the deceased before she suffered any injury was when he saw her in the driveway as he was reversing the motor vehicle. He said he kept a ‘proper lookout’ as he was reversing.
	
	
	A large part of the evidence in the case was not disputed. Many statements of police and civilians were tendered without objection. Annexed to this judgment is the exhibit list.
	


Legal Principles to be applied


	
	This is a trial by Judge alone in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. A trial by Judge, as it is described in the relevant provisions, requires the trial Judge not just to state that the principles of law which were applied in the findings of facts that were made, but also to expose what is described as “the reasoning process” justifying the findings of fact and ultimately the verdict or verdicts returned.
	
	
	All principles of law which are relevant are required to be applied and considered should be identified in the judgment including any necessary warnings that the trial Judge is required to apply in the assessment of the evidence. Where particular warnings are applied a Judge must state, where appropriate, the appropriate warnings or the consequences of them and why a particular verdict has been reached (Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250).
	
	
	So far as the onus and standard of proof is concerned the prosecution bears the burden of proving the guilt of the accused. That burden or onus rests upon the prosecution throughout the trial in respect of all matters requiring proof by the prosecution. The accused bears no onus of proof in respect of matters requiring proof by the prosecution. He is presumed to be innocent of any charge or charges brought against him until such time as that presumption is displaced by the Crown establishing his guilt.
	
	
	The elements that the prosecution must establish are:
	


i.  that the accused was the driver of the vehicle; and

ii.  that vehicle was involved in an impact, namely that the deceased fell from the motor vehicle while being conveyed in, or on, the vehicle,

iii.  that the impact caused the death of the deceased; and

iv. that, at the time of the impact, the accused was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person.

v.  that at the time of the driving dangerously the accused had no honest and reasonable belief that it was safe to drive.


	
	If the Crown fails to establish any one of the five essential facts or ingredients of the offence of dangerous driving you must find the accused “not guilty”.
	
	
	A person drives a motor vehicle when he or she has management and control over its movement, whether by the use of the accelerator or gears, or simply by releasing the brakes and allowing gravity to operate. The driving must be the voluntary and conscious act of the accused.
	
	
	The fourth essential ingredient that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused was driving in a dangerous manner at the time of the impact. The manner in which a person drives a vehicle includes all matters connected with the management and control of the vehicle when it is being driven, including its speed. Whether or not that manner of driving was “dangerous” will depend upon all the circumstances in which it took place. This includes such factors as the time of day, the nature of the road surface, the weather conditions, and the general area in which the vehicle is being driven.
	
	
	A person’s management and control of a vehicle may, in some cases, be potentially dangerous to other persons by its very nature, whatever be the circumstances in which the vehicle is being driven. For example, driving a motor vehicle with no effective brakes is an example of dangerous conduct in the use of a motor vehicle, regardless of where and in what circumstances it is being driven. This is because the ability to bring a vehicle suddenly to a stop is essential to the proper management of a motor vehicle.
	
	
	In other cases, the particular circumstances in which the vehicle is being driven by a person makes the driving potentially dangerous even though the driving may not be dangerous in other situations. For example, driving through a red light in a busy intersection in the middle of a suburban shopping centre on a Saturday morning may be an example of driving which is dangerous because of the circumstances in which the driving occurs. That situation can be compared with driving through a red light on a country road in the early hours of the morning when it is clear that no other vehicle is in the area. In those circumstances driving through a red light might not be considered to be dangerous even though it may be a breach of the traffic regulations. What distinguishes these two examples is the degree of risk of harm to other persons that arises from the manner of driving in the particular circumstances.
	
	
	The manner of driving will be dangerous if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a serious breach of the proper management and control of a motor vehicle and that the breach is so serious that it creates a real danger to another person or persons in the vicinity. The use of a motor vehicle is always potentially dangerous to some degree simply because it can so easily cause injury to another person in its vicinity. That potential can be minimised where the driver exercises proper control and management of the vehicle so as to avoid an impact with any other person or object. Of course drivers are subject to human frailties and not every driver always exercises all the care and skill expected. But that does not mean that a driver is driving dangerously simply because of such a failure.
	
	
	The offence of dangerous driving is made out where the driver so seriously fails to properly control and manage the vehicle that he or she creates a real danger of harm to other persons in or around the vicinity of the vehicle far exceeding that which arises simply from the normal use of a motor vehicle. Driving in a dangerous manner is a breach of the criminal law whether or not it results in any impact because of the real risk of harm that it creates.
	
	
	I am concerned with the risk of harm arising from the manner of driving, rather than the result of the driving when deciding whether the driving in the particular circumstances was dangerous. So in deciding whether the accused’s manner of driving was in all the circumstances dangerous I do not take into account the fact (if established) that there was an impact or the result of the impact, including as it does the death of Kim Barnes. A person can drive dangerously but by pure good fortune or the skill of another driver, avoid any impact with another vehicle or a person or object in the vicinity of the vehicle. On the other hand a driver may collide with another vehicle or a person on or near the road as the result of some unavoidable and exceptional incident even though the person is driving with proper care and attention.
	
	
	The test as to whether the conduct of the driver was dangerous is an objective one. The Crown does not have to establish that the accused knew or realised that he was driving the vehicle in a dangerous manner. His conduct must be judged according to an objective community standard which applies to all drivers of vehicles. That standard does not take into account any personal characteristics of the driver, for example, his or her experience or inexperience as a driver. A person can be driving dangerously even though that person believes that he or she is doing his or her best to avoid a collision.
	
	
	The prosecution must prove a relevant “impact” arising in the circumstances pleaded. Here the prosecution alleged impact caused by falling from the vehicle while the accused drove in a manner dangerous. The “manner dangerous” included his self-admitted driving of the vehicle, failing to keep a proper lookout, the fact at relevant times that the deceased was sitting on the vehicle or was “on” it in some way.
	
	
	The prosecution must also establish beyond reasonable doubt, provided that the accused has discharged the relevant “evidentiary burden”, that the accused did not believe on reasonable grounds in the existence of facts which would not make his manner of driving dangerous i.e. that it was safe for him to back up the driveway and drive down Peele Street in the manner in which he did (CTM v R [2007] NSWCCA 131 (at [67] – [76]), Jiminez v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 572 (at 583)).
	


Consciousness of guilt


	
	The next direction I must give myself concerns the evidence of statements of the accused about whether he was driving his car and his knowledge of the whereabouts of the motor vehicle, which the prosecution alleges were lies, as well as what he said to Brittany Herring about her handling of the car and what she should tell the police about who was driving the vehicle and other matters. The Crown says that he told lies, because he later admitted driving the car at relevant times and other evidence contradicts his initial versions to police in this regard. It also points to what is established from his communications with Brittany Herring before she spoke to police. These representations and his conduct represent evidence of “consciousness of guilt”.
	
	
	A lie is to say something untrue, knowing at the time of making the statement that it is untrue. If a person says something which is untrue, but does not realise at the time that it is untrue, then that is not a lie. The person is simply mistaken or perhaps confused. Even if the person later comes to realise that what he said was incorrect, that does not transform the statement into a lie. To be a lie, the person must say something that the person knows, at the time of making the statement, is untrue.
	
	
	If I find that the accused made the statement I have just referred to, and I find it was a lie, or I conclude that he acted in a way and made representations that reflected a consciousness of guilt, then I must exercise care with which I must approach the task of deciding what significance, if any, this body of evidence, or any particular part of it has. I may take these lies and/or conduct and representations into account as evidence of the accused’s guilt but I can only do that if I find two further things which I will refer to shortly. This evidence can be considered along with all of the other facts that the Crown relies upon and which I find established on the evidence in considering whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown does not suggest that if I found the accused told a lie or conducted himself with a “guilty mind” that this finding can prove the guilt of the accused by itself.
	
	
	Apart from the fact, if established, that the accused made the statements and that they amounted to a deliberate lie, or encouraged others to tell lies or otherwise conducted himself as set out above or conducted himself in a particular way by representations or otherwise, before I can use the lies and/or conduct as some evidence of the accused’s guilt I must find two further matters proved.
	
	
	First, I must find that what the accused said that what amounts to a lie relates to an issue that is relevant to the offence the Crown alleges that the accused committed. These matters, either singularly or taken together in part or whole, must relate to some significant circumstance or event connected with that alleged offence. The Crown says these matters are relevant because the lie or lies and other conduct established that the accused was seeking to cover up for what he had done.
	
	
	Second, I must find that the reason the accused told this lie or acted in a particular way was because he feared that telling the truth might reveal his guilt in respect of the charge he now faces. In other words, he feared that telling the truth and/or encouraging others to tell the truth would implicate him in the commission of the offence for which he is now on trial.
	
	
	I must remember, however, that people do not always act rationally, and that conduct of this sort, that is, telling a lie and/or in other respects, may sometimes be explained in other ways. A person may have a reason for lying quite apart from trying to conceal his guilt. For example, a lie may be told out of panic; to escape an unjust accusation; to protect some other person; or to avoid a consequence unrelated to the offence, even if that consequence is a fear of criminal prosecution for some other crime or wrongdoing.
	
	
	If I think that the lie and other conduct may have occurred for some reason or reasons other than to avoid being implicated in the commission of the offence for which the accused is now on trial, then that evidence cannot be used as evidence of the accused’s guilt. If that is the case, I must put it to one side and focus my deliberations upon the other evidence in the case. Even if it can be used in part or in total to support proof of guilt it has to be considered with other findings on matters relevant to proof of guilt or otherwise.
	


Inferences


	
	As the judge of the facts I am are entitled to draw inferences from facts that I decide are established by the evidence. The drawing of inferences is something we do in our everyday lives, although perhaps less consciously than I will in my deliberations.  An inference is a conclusion or conclusions drawn from the existence of a combination of facts.  I must not draw an inference unless it is a reasonable inference that can be rationally drawn from the evidence that I accept.
	
	
	I must be careful about drawing inferences. Especially where the inference is about guilt, or the existence of an element of the offence. When drawing inferences about guilt or the existence of an element to be proven by the prosecution, that is an inference or conclusion adverse to the accused, I must not draw that inference unless it is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	There may be a number of inferences that can be reasonably drawn, some adverse to the accused and some not adverse to the accused (ie: inconsistent with guilt or the existence of an element). In such a situation I must not draw the inference adverse unless I am satisfied of two things:
	



	
	I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all inferences favourable to the accused can be excluded; and
	
	
	the only inference that can be drawn beyond a reasonable doubt is the one or ones adverse to the accused.
	



	
	Unless I reach that point I would find the element is not made out and that the accused is not guilty where proof of it depended upon the drawing of relevant inferences.
	
	
	So long as there remains an inference reasonably open that is favourable to the accused that cannot be excluded beyond a reasonable doubt I must find the element not made out and find the accused not guilty.
	


Expert evidence


	
	In this case, Dr Duflou has been called as expert witnesses. He is a qualified and experienced pathologist. An expert witness is a person who has specialised knowledge based on that person’s training, study or experience. Unlike other witnesses, a witness with such specialised knowledge may express an opinion on matters within his or her particular area of expertise. Other witnesses may speak only as to facts, that is, what they saw or heard, and are not permitted to express their opinions. There is no dispute Dr Duflou is an expert.
	
	
	Of course, the value of any expert opinion is very much dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the material which the expert used to reach his or her opinion. It is also dependent upon the degree to which the expert analysed the material upon which the opinion was based and the skill and experience brought to bear in formulating the opinion given. It may depend upon the confidence with which an opinion is expressed. Another relevant matter is the number of differing opinions or conclusions given by the expert in relation to the same subject matter. Experts can differ in the level and degree of their experience, training and study, yet each can still be an expert qualified to give an opinion where that opinion is based on that witness’s specialised knowledge.
	
	
	The expert evidence is available as part of all the evidence to assist me in determining the circumstances and possible mechanisms for causing relevant injuries and the cause(s) of the pattern of injuries contributing to death. Here there is no doubt that the deceased died from injuries suffered on Peele Street Narrabri.
	
	
	The expert evidence in general terms has not been challenged. Accordingly, if it is not inherently unbelievable, I would need to have a good reason to reject it.
	


S 165 (1) (b) warning regarding Brittany Herring.


	
	The prosecution relies upon evidence of this witness to establish representations and conduct of the accused as evidence of consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	s 165 of the Evidence Act provides that:
	


“ .. evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies,

.. evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,”

may be unreliable.


	
	I am invited to approach the evidence of Ms Herring applying this warning in mind given her belief that she was driving a vehicle unlicensed and was endeavouring to assist the accused to cover up his connection with his motor vehicle at the time when he may have believed or suspected that impact or contact with the deceased that may have caused her injuries as they were known on 31 December 2012. She may have had her own interests or those of her parents to protect in giving accounts that might implicate the accused in some way.
	


Silence in court


	
	The accused did not give evidence. The accused bears no onus of proof. The accused is presumed to be innocent until I have been satisfied by the Crown that he is guilty, if indeed I am so satisfied. Consistent with this, the accused is entitled to elect to say nothing and to make the Crown prove his guilt. The accused in this trial has chosen, as is his right to do so, not to say anything in Court. An accused person cannot be compelled in Court to say anything.
	
	
	I cannot not draw any adverse inference against the accused because he has exercised his right to silence in Court. I cannot interpret it in any way as being an acknowledgment on his part as to the accuracy, veracity or strength of the Crown case. I should not be tempted to reason that the accused has remained silent in Court because he is guilty. Such reasoning is prohibited and I must not engage in it. Such a process or means of reasoning is entirely inconsistent with the burden of proof resting upon the Crown.
	
	
	I must not speculate as to why the accused has not given evidence. Furthermore, I must not treat the accused’s election not to give evidence as being capable of filling any gaps in the Crown case that I may perceive to exist. As it is he was extensively questioned by police on two occasions shortly after relevant events.
	


Evidence in the trial


	
	I have taken all the evidence into account but cannot quote all relevant parts. A great deal of the evidence in the trial was produced by tender of statements without need for witnesses to be examined or cross examined. This was particularly true of most of the “civilians” who provided statements to the police. Those witnesses were categorised as; those who saw the deceased (with or without) the accused at hotels in downtown Narrabri; Cathy Smith, Mark McMahon, Wendy Jane Weakley, Geoffrey Raymond Brown, David Roy Sutton, Graham Ross Richardson, Richard John Moore, those present in the vicinity of 81 Peele Street Narrabri (including neighbours and their guests); her sons Matthew Graham Edwards, Joshua Keith Edwards, Haydan James Ryman and neighbours etc Robert Kerr, Shaun Thomas Kerr, David Patterson, Kerrie Evelyn Patterson, Allan James Pym. A number of police officers were called to give oral evidence, but only a few were examined or cross examined at any length. Many of them merely identified their statements which were tendered. There would appear to be little dispute with much of the evidence in the Crown case concerning the activities of the accused and the deceased in the afternoon of New Year’s Eve and the early evening, the activities of the accused and the deceased a short time before the deceased was injured and the accused’s contact with police, statements to them and other events affecting him in the course of the police investigation in the late hours of New Year’s Eve and during 1-3 January 2013. This was reflected in the submissions which I summarise later.
	
	
	The first group of witnesses whose statements were tendered, in conjunction with those accounts given by the accused consistent with their recollection, were concerned with the movements of the accused and the deceased in the township of Narrabri, during the afternoon and evening of 31 December 2013. 
	
	
	The accused and the deceased during the afternoon and early evening attended upon the Namoi Hotel and then Tattersall’s Hotel in Maitland Street Narrabri, approximately one and a half to two kilometres (according to the scale on Exhibit A) from the residence of the deceased and the accused. The deceased was also seen at the Tourist Hotel apparently after she and the accused separated. The accused and the deceased were seen together first that afternoon when one witness described the deceased at about 3.30 pm as being “extremely happy” and “the happiest that she had seen her in a long time (Cathy Smith a friend of 29 years). She said that during the afternoon of New Year’s Eve the deceased became “heavily intoxicated” and in the witness’ presence the deceased had about 8 schooners of full strength beer.
	
	
	She saw the deceased sometime after 7.30 pm at another hotel, the Tourist Hotel and the deceased was “visibly upset and crying”. She said that she had had an argument with the accused and he had threatened her. When an offer was made to contact the police she said “No I will just hide”. I point out there is no independent evidence of any threat to the deceased by the accused.
	
	
	Other witnesses saw her throughout the evening, happy at first but then very intoxicated, including a man who eventually stayed at the deceased’s home after she had been found injured in Peele Street sometime after 10 pm. One witness, Geoffrey Brown, saw the deceased and the accused together in a happy mood, but later saw her around 8.30 pm distressed, unable to find her car and being anxious to obtain a taxi cab. Her car had been picked up by one of her sons. Before that occurred David Sutton, who was working at the Tattersall’s Hotel Bottle Shop, saw the accused in the back beer garden, and then saw the deceased “staggering” in the beer garden appearing to be “affected by drugs or alcohol”. She apparently came in and out of the beer garden while the accused was there. He saw no argument between the accused and the deceased.
	
	
	The licensee of the Tourist Hotel saw the deceased at one point before 9 pm “obviously intoxicated by the way she was staggering” and appearing in a distressed state. She made a claim that she was afraid to go home because she would “get bashed” but did not seek any further assistance. She made no specific allegation to that person against the accused. He placed the deceased’s intoxication at that time as “about 9-10” out of 10. It would appear that she had her last drink sometine before 9 pm. At 11.15 pm a blood sample was taken at Narrabri Hospital ante-mortem showing a reading of 170 gms per 100 mls of blood (0.170).
	
	
	The taxi driver who drove the deceased home from the Tourist Hotel said that she was in a distressed state, and drove her to Peele Street, when he asked her if she was “alright” she mumbled something he could not understand. She was asked if she wanted to go to the police but she did not effectively respond.
	
	
	Her two sons and a friend were at home when the accused arrived by himself having left the deceased in town at Tattersall’s Hotel. The friend (Haydan Ryman) said that when the accused came home to Peele Street sometime after 9 o’clock, as I would understand the chronology, he appeared “pretty calm” and the witness did not think he was intoxicated although he had been drinking.
	
	
	He said the deceased arrived 10 or 15 minutes later and “looked stressed” and was “crying”. When she saw the accused she “started going agro towards him” and said words, “I fucking hate you” which were heard also by neighbours. The deceased was aggressive towards the accused, but there is no evidence from any witness of any aggression from him. She pushed him up against a wall while he was sitting on a chair and the witness described her as being unable to “stop carrying on”. He heard “stuff smashing inside the house”. He then left.
	
	
	The deceased’s two sons Mathew Edwards and Josh Edwards, one nineteen, the other twenty four years of age, gave evidence that the accused came home first. He told Mathew that the deceased, the mother, was still at the pub and said he left her because “she was saying she hated me”.
	
	
	He described his mother returning to the house about 20 minutes later, telling the accused she hated him, crying, pushing him in the chest while he was sitting down causing his head to hit the glass window. The accused said, “I haven’t done anything to you Kim, I don’t know why you reckon you hate me”. She followed the accused around the house as he walked away from her, and she was “fairly drunk”. He said she was “staggering a bit” and when she drank normally “little things can set her off”. He described his mother as “going off her head” and he left the house leaving the accused and his mother in the house, observing the accused’s blue Commodore and his white work ute, parked respectively in the driveway and at the front of the house.
	
	
	Joshua gave a similar account to his brother concerning the accused coming home, his mother coming home about 20 minutes later and telling the accused that she “fuck’n hate you”. He described the accused being pushed, looking angry but not engaging the mother. He did not think the accused was “crazy or would hit her”. He left the house as well and saw nothing more.
	
	
	There was evidence from neighbours who either heard things during the course of an argument at the home of the deceased after she returned from the hotel, or saw her on the roadway. The most detailed evidence was from Robert Kerr, a man to whom the accused referred as having spoken to after he discovered that the deceased was injured on the road.
	
	
	He heard her crying, saying “You left me there,” and her also saying words similar to “You have been cheating on me”. She continued to yell words similar to this. At one point he walked up the stairs of his house and looked across to the neighbouring garage of the deceased and could see her legs off the ground, she was sitting on the car facing the road, he could only see her ankles and could see the “bumper” of the car but “could see exactly what car it was”. This is a critical piece of evidence on the prosecution case.
	
	
	He said:
	


“I recall thinking at the time how silly it was her sitting on the car. The arguing had stopped at this time so I wasn’t really that worried. I continued walking inside and placed some trays of food on the kitchen bench. I’d only just began (sic) to sort through things when I heard a car revving very loudly and spinning its wheels in the gravel out the front.”


	
	He went outside and he saw the deceased “lying face down” on the roadway out the front of another house. He got his torch, went to look at the deceased who was bleeding from the face and he rang triple O for an ambulance. He gave evidence of the ambulance arriving, I accept that the accused spoke to Robert Kerr while awaiting the ambulance.
	
	
	His son, Shaun Kerr, heard the deceased accusing the accused of leaving her behind, and of having an affair by “sleeping” with someone. The accused was not yelling. He saw the accused move the deceased’s car at one stage and she was accusing him of “stealing” her car. He got out of her car and gave her the keys to it . Then he saw the accused drive his white HiLux van down the street.
	
	
	At this stage he saw the deceased moving around near her property. She was still yelling and he could hear something being thrown against tin, later on a couple of minutes later he heard another car back out from underneath the house and heard it spin its wheels out the front of their house. He said “I then heard a thud and the car continued on, it didn’t stop or anything”. He later saw the deceased lying on the ground and she was obviously injured. Triple O was called to arrange the ambulance and he saw the accused in the vicinity of Fraser and Peele Streets, at one point talking to the occupants of a Nissan X-Trail car. Exhibit A shows the next cross street to where the deceased was found is Fraser Street a distance of less than 100 metres, possibility no more than 40-50 metres, and the next cross street further away is Clarke Street, another 150-200 metres approximately.
	
	
	At various times he saw people talking to the accused and saw the ambulance arrive. One of Mr Kerr’s guests at his home that night had heard the deceased say “I hate you, I hate you”, and she sounded “really upset” and was “crying”. Similar evidence appears in the statement of that person’s wife, who heard a female voice saying “I hate, I hate you” and she was “yelling, swearing at someone”. She said she saw a white dual cab ute leave and a person with a white singlet on a mobile phone out the front of the Kerr’s house, and when she and her husband left she did not see anybody on the road. Another neighbour at about 10 o’clock that night heard a male voice yell “Get in the fucking car”. Whether this was the accused is impossible to say. Then about 5 minutes later heard a siren. He does not know where the voices came from.
	
	
	Civilian witnesses who gave oral evidence included Brittany Herring, Darryl Farrar, Jeania Page and Michael Page, whose evidence was concerned with matters relating to the conduct of the accused after the deceased was injured and the handling of his motor vehicle by Brittany Herring, and her step father Michael Page after the accused had parked it around the corner from Peele Street in Clarke Street, some short time after the deceased was injured.
	
	
	Both Ms Herring and Mr Farrar were young people, as I would understand it 17 or 18 years of age at the time. The Pages were close friends of the accused. Michael Page in one part of the evidence described as the accused’s “best friend”. They lived in the same street as the deceased, but at the other end of the street at 13 Peele Street, near what was described as the “Public” school. The deceased was known to them. The accused in his interview described the deceased accusing him of having an affair with people who I took to be Ms Herring and Ms Page amongst others and there was general support for this from persons who saw her earlier in the evening and heard her yelling out at 81 Peele Street. This would appear to be an allegation that would appear to be untrue and reflective of her “distressed”, irrational and/or intoxicated state.
	
	
	Ms Herring gave evidence of various phone calls and text messages between herself and the accused it would appear occurring after the deceased was injured, from about 10.01 pm onwards. There was specific evidence given by Detective Beddoes concerning phone charge records of calls made by the accused to Ms Herring and the call ultimately to Moree Police Station by the accused, which call was made at about 10.07 pm. This is confirmed in a statement made by Sgt Ward. The accused identified himself and complained that he had had a fight with his girlfriend and “she has threatened me with a knife, I tried to leave and she has followed me onto the road”. He told that Police Officer “I don’t want to go back there when she is like this”. The accused said he would go down to the house when the police arrived, which in fact he did. He rang Ms Herring according to the call charge records at 10.01 pm and spoke to her for 150 seconds, or at least that was the length of the call. The text messages are set out so far as times and content are concerned in Exhibit J6. It is appropriate to incorporate its particulars into the judgment.

	Ms Herring’s evidence was that the accused rang her and asked her to take control of his blue Commodore vehicle and amongst other things at various times by phone message or SMS messages asked her to wipe the car down and to “burn it”. She also said that when he first rang her he asked her to take him to Warialda because he had had a fight with “Kim” and wanted to go to his “sister’s place”. There appears no record of this call unless it is a call at 9.55. On the other hand it is consistent with the accused wanting to get away from ‘Kim’. He also said to her Kim was accusing him of sleeping with her, her sister and her mother. This appears true. She was at a party on the other side of town (at Zeia Wall’s place at Thurlagoona Drive Narrabri) and when rung by the accused she was driven by her “brother”, Mr Farrar, to near the intersection of Fraser and Peele Streets where she saw and spoke to the accused. He gave her his car keys.
	
	
	Her evidence was that she drove the vehicle from where the accused parked it in Clarke Street to a paddock next to her parents place in Peele Street, Mr Farrar driving to the same paddock in his own motor vehicle. She was unlicensed and was concerned about getting into trouble for that. In fact she did get into trouble from her step father who was very angry about her driving the car.
	
	
	She alleged that when she had control of the car she received more than one SMS message, including a message telling her to tell the police presumably that “Craig” (who lived on her parents property) was “driving the car” and “Kim was chasing it”. She said that the accused told her to “get rid of it and burn (the car)”. She said she got a cloth and wiped the dust off the car. She said she had been asked to “wipe the dust off the car”. She thought there may have been a “crack on the wing” or the “spoiler”. She received later messages from the accused when she returned to the party she was attending on the other side of Narrabri sometime before midnight after leaving the blue Commodore at her parents place, including a verbal request by the accused for her to go down to the police station. This request was made after which the accused when speaking to her passed the phone to a police officer. She denied that she wiped down the car to remove her own finger prints to cover up the fact that she was driving. A cloth was recovered by police but has no forensic scientific value.
	
	
	She also gave evidence that the accused told her that “Kim had hit her head” but this appears to be after he had spoken to a police officer at the scene or Mr Kerr. There are other particular details of her evidence referred to in submissions of the accused’s counsel. The prosecution opened its case by referring to an admission allegedly made by the accused to Ms Herring, about which she gave no evidence. She was a somewhat distressed witness and not particularly impressive. There are reasons to believe she at relevant times was covering up not just for the accused.
	
	
	Her account about going from a party in Narrabri after 10 o’clock to meet the accused to pick up the blue car was supported by her brother Mr Farrar, although he was not privy to many of the conversations and sheds little light on the extent of the communication between the accused and Ms Herring. He confirmed also that his half-sister drove the Commodore to near her parents place and he also confirmed that she wiped down the dust from the car including the front quarter panels and the sides of the car and the back quarter panels. He was driving a Nissan X Trail vehicle. He confirmed also that her step-father was very “pissed off” about Brittany driving unlicensed. He gave evidence that Brittany spoke to the accused twice, once when she picked up the car and again when they were returning the party they had left and the ambulance was at the site. He also confirmed that Brittany asked him when they had returned to the party to take her to the police station but he could not because he had been drinking. He had little recollection of the scene where the deceased was found other than seeing some people in that area and seeing a person lying on the ground. When the blue Commodore was in the paddock he said he saw “hand marks” and/or “slide marks”, but saw no damage to the car. He suggested a body impression on the boot but the extent to which his interpretation of what he saw was, or was not, infected with subsequent information was not explored or pressed. The Crown conceded in submissions that his observations of the state of the car were also consistent with activities of the deceased before he drove the car that evening described by the accused in his interviews with police.
	
	
	Mrs Page and her husband confirmed their knowledge of the accused, the taking of the Commodore sedan to the paddock near their home and the arrival of their daughter with Mr Farrar driving a Nissan X Trail. She also confirmed her husband being very upset with Brittany driving the car.
	
	
	She said that the accused arrived with police later on looking for his car, by which time she was aware that her husband had moved the motor vehicle to another location near the school down the street where it was recovered by police at a later time. It was common ground in the police evidence and the evidence of Mr and Mrs Page that Mr Page was quite hostile towards the police when they arrived but he ultimately showed them where the car was. He told the police that he was “trying to protect his daughter”.
	
	
	Mr Page in his evidence confirmed these essential matters, the arrival of the Commodore driven by Brittany, abusing her for driving the car, later taking the car to another place. He said that when he drove the car to the primary school he wiped down the steering wheel to wipe off finger prints. As I understood his evidence he was endeavouring to wipe his own finger prints off the wheel because he was concerned that he would get into trouble having had some drinks on New Year’s Eve. Brittany told the father that she was driving the car because the accused was concerned that the deceased “was going to smash the car”. Although this is second hand hearsay, it is inconsistent with aspects of Brittany’s account
	


Police evidence


	
	I have already referred to evidence from a police officer of the conversation had with the accused by telephone at 10.07. The first police message broadcast about any incident at Peele Street Narrabri was at 10.12 pm. It advised police of a domestic incident and that “Kim Barnes” had threatened the accused with a knife and he was waiting nearby. When police arrived the deceased was being treated by ambulance officers already and at that point her body had been moved because she was now lying face up “in the middle of the road” as it was described. There is no precise evidence as to exactly where the deceased was lying, which direction she was facing, or where she was in relation to particular markings on the road later identified in the exhibit B series of photographs. There is a blood stain on one part of the bitumen, which when seen in long shot has next to it a number of items of “resuscitation” commonly used by ambulance staff. One photograph in Exhibit B (B 9) displayed not only the stain but what appeared to be human hair in it as I understand the evidence. Although there is no photograph or diagram to confirm this I understand the deceased was found close to, possibly on, the blood stain. I could draw no safe conclusion as to the direction in which she was facing, what position her body was in or anything of the sort after she first hit the ground and come to rest. But she was seen by a police officer facing in a “southerly” direction, the direction towards which the accused drove . The first civilian to see her saw her face down, but later observations, as I said, showed her moved to be face up. I have seen a video of the area, Peele Street is a wide street, with a bitumen central surface and apparently wide gravel verge and then grass to respective property lines.
	
	
	The accused when he first spoke to the police was asked “What has happened, it looks like Kim has been run over”. The accused said, “I had an argument with Kim and I walked away. I phoned my friend Brittany Herring to come and get my car”.
	
	
	Over the telephone the accused rang Brittany Herring in the presence of the police officer and the police officer spoke to her using the accused’s phone. She confirmed the accused had phoned her and that she had come to get the car. When asked by the police officer where the car was she said, “I don’t know where it is, they got their friend Craig to drive it”. She described Craig as a person who lived with her parents. The accused was cooperative and went with the police to Michael Page’s place, but Mr Page told the police to “fuck off” and said that he did not know where “Craig” was. Constable Barnes who had these first dealings with the accused said, “He did not appear to be affected by intoxicating liquor … his actions appeared normal at the time, he was talk active (sic) and friendly”. Constable Kirk produced a log setting out key times, including the setting up of a crime scene at 3.19 am (when the accused was at the police station) as a result of which a crime scene officer took various photographs which are in evidence and videoed ultimately the site. The photographs were taken in darkness and in early morning light. The video recording of the scene (Exhibit F) is taken in early daylight. Exhibit C is a scale plan. It shows the driveway of 81 Peele Street to be approximately 14 metres from the building alignment. The blue Commodore was parked in front of or in the carport apparently. The accused is alleged to have reversed into Peele Street swinging the rear towards the nearby dead-end. Tyre marks in the driveway are not measured. On Peele Street there are various tyre marks but only two appear clearly related (Numbered 1-3 and 2-4). 1-3 is 20 metres long (on the near or passenger’s side of the vehicle), 2-4 (on the driver’s side) is approximately 11 metres long. These positions assume the movement of the vehicle away from 81 Peele Street in a south (westerly) direction. They both start in loose gravel. They could be from the same vehicle. Other tyre marks near the position of the blood stain or leading up to it are not in alignment with 1-3, 2-4 and there is no opinion or other observational evidence that explain them. They may be entirely unrelated. The blood stain (shown in B8, B9) is approximately 31 metres from the commencement of the tyre marks 1 and 2. The blood stain, relying on the scale, is approximately 61 metres or more from where the Commodore commenced its journey, making allowance for the arc of reversing (if indeed shown by the tyre marks).
	
	
	Another police officer saw the deceased still alive at this time lying on the ground “facing a southerly direction and her feet a northerly direction”, but by this time she was being treated by paramedics. This would place her body facing ‘roughly’ in the direction of the movement of the accused’s car, as the street appears to run in a SW/NE direction.
	
	
	That police officer spoke to the accused, who confirmed that police had been called in relation to a “domestic argument which also involves a knife” and that he was “involved in the domestic argument with a lady”. The accused was examined on his fists and palms and there were no obvious injuries on his hands. There is no evidence of injury to the deceased by physically striking her.
	
	
	That officer, Constable Hinshelwood, examined the scene and saw various skid marks, reflected in the schematic plan drawn to scale by the Crime Scene Officer. He also observed a number of gold colour dollar coins scattered in the bitumen road surface “(near to) where Kim Barnes had been lying”. The location of various coins is shown in Exhibit C, although his record was that the coins included 20 cent coins. Ultimately, not a great deal turns upon this given the original observation of the coins was in darkness with the aid of torch. The coins are consistent with falling from the deceased’s person but in the majority stretch out away from where her body was found, in the direction of the car’s movement.
	
	
	Another constable who arrived at the scene spoke to the accused, and when asked “What happened?”, the accused said:
	


“We were at the Namoi Hotel for drinks and walked to the Tourist Hotel Kim and I had an argument at the pub. I left and walked home. About 10 pm Kim came home in a taxi and started yelling abuse at me about sleeping with other people. I packed up some of my things and put them into my car. She threatened me with a knife. I left and walked down the street. I called a friend to come and pick up my car”.


	
	It was this version in part that the accused texted to Brittany after she had retrieved the accused’s car and left it at her parent’s place, as shown in Exhibit J6.
	
	
	When asked where the car was he said it was at “13 Peele Street”. When asked why the deceased was bleeding he said “I’m not sure. Maybe she thought it was me in the car and tried to stop the car from leaving”. The accused told this police officer, Constable Davies, that he had had a “few” drinks of alcohol but she was “very intoxicated”. Constable Davies was present when the accused and Senior Constable Kirk went to see Michael Page, the accused saying at that address that he thought the car had been brought there. Later on she was present when Michael Page showed police where the blue Commodore was, explaining that he had driven it back of the school because he “didn’t want my daughter getting into trouble”. The accused voluntarily went to the Police Station and was interviewed by police by electronic interview in the early hours of 1 January (Exhibit K). He was interviewed again in a much lengthier interview on 3 January at the township of Warialda (Exhibit L). I will deal with other conduct of the accused reflected in Exhibit J6 in the further consideration of the matter.
	
	
	During the first interview the accused is coherent, straight forward, immediately responsive to questions, stating that he was “sober”. He was apparently so, not seemingly affected at all be alcohol at that point. At one point one of the officers said he was asleep in the waiting room or the interview room prior to the interview, but this was consistent with the hour and no doubt the fact that he was waiting for police to speak to him. It was clearly indicated to him he did not have to remain in the police station unless he wished and his involvement was entirely voluntary.
	
	
	Before the conduct of the electronic interview on 1 January the accused gave a general outline of what had happened to Detective Beddoes, who later conducted the first electronic interview which in general terms; outlined the argument with the deceased at her home, he deciding to leave the home later because of her attitude, she producing a knife, walking away from the location and asking a friend to pick up his car. That friend was “Craig”. During all this time, of course, the deceased was being treated at Narrabri Hospital. She was then airlifted to Sydney where she subsequently died from her injuries in the early evening of 1 January 2013.
	


Interviews with the accused


	
	The accused as earlier mentioned gave two electronic interviews to the police, one at 3.22 am on 1 January 2013 conducted at the Narrabri Police Station and a second lengthier interview on 3 January 2013 at the Warialda Police Station. There was evidence in the trial that the accused’s sister lived at Warialda.
	
	
	He gave an account in the first interview being with the deceased throughout the afternoon of New Year’s Eve drinking some beers, walking home from downtown Narrabri to the deceased’s home and the deceased arriving approximately 20 minutes later in a taxi cab, telling him that she “fuckin’ hated (him)”, him packing up to leave, she behaving erratically and at one point, when moving one of the cars, threatening him with a knife and threatening to kill him, then, when he finally got into the blue Commodore to drive away she hitting the car and otherwise trying to prevent him leaving.
	
	
	He said in respect of his driving of the vehicle that the last time he saw her she was in the driveway of the house, at one point “walkin’ up the driveway as I was spinnin’ off” (Q 36). During this interview he was asked about the disposal of the Commodore, admitting that he asked Brittany, the daughter of his “mate” to take her car, but he denied asking her to “burn the car”.
	
	
	He said “If you burn the car that proves that I am guilty. I don’t wanna burn the car, because if youse look at the car, cause I’m accused of running her over and you will see if my car is that low and you look at the front, you can possibly say, well, he couldn’t possibly run over her because it is that low … it would have dragged her and, up the road whatever, so why would I say I want to burn the car” (Q 173 – 174). This sentiment was reflected in earlier (private) SMS messages to Brittany.
	
	
	At one point he said with considerable feeling when asked about burning the car after a pause, “I love that car” (Q 168). He said that the only damage he was aware of was some damage to the “back spoiler”, which he believed had been aggravated by the deceased striking his car.
	
	
	He said the deceased was “well and truly intoxicated”. He described her at various points “jumping on the bonnet, sitting on the bonnet, sitting on the boot, sitting on whatever” (Q 196). He said as far as his reversing was concerned:
	


“(I) took off hundred mile an hour spun the wheels. Like, I know she was drunk and whatever but she would have to be quick to run there and jump on the back of the car, cause like I was doing like 50 mile an hour out that driveway. That’s just a figure of speech” (Q 196).


	
	In the second interview he said (at Q131-139):
	


“Well last time I saw her it happened that quick … She was there (indicating) and I’ve reversed out the driveway with me head over me shoulder and then I drove off. The last time honestly I seen her sitting in the, I don’t know, I can’t recall if she’s ran up beside me or what. But last time I seen her she was sitting in the driveway. (Q. Sitting …?) or standing in the driveway … (which is ) 50 or 60 feet (long) … I wouldn’t say (I reversed) at normal speed, but I was reversing pretty quick. (Q. Did you take off immediately after reversing?) Pretty much so, yes, by the time I stopped and put it in drive I just planted me foot … spun the wheels … (the driveway) is gravel … the wheels were spinning (to start off) on the gravel.”


	
	He said inter alia in the first interview:
	


“I swear black and blue she was still in the driveway. She was jumpin’ all over the car when I was in it” (Q 195) and “I had just come out straight away, locked it in drive and just planted the foot and she’s still in the driveway”.


	
	He said in answer to Q 200, “Like, if she did get on the back of the car, like, I swear that she was in the driveway, but if she did I did not know, but I am telling you, I am like, I know the mind plays silly things (sic) in adrenaline but I am positive she was in the driveway when I was drivin’ (sic)”
	
	
	In the second, lengthier, interview the accused reiterated the account he gave by and large to police in the earlier interview, giving more details about his movements earlier in the night, who he saw in town at the hotels and when he returned home. He gave specifics of allegations made against him by the deceased concerning having affairs with various people which allegations I take to be untrue. No attempt was made to lead evidence from relevant witnesses, particularly Brittany and Ms Page that the allegations were true. He gave more detailed evidence of moving his white ute, and then driving away in the blue vehicle. He described in detail what the deceased had said to him, and the attempts she made to stop him driving away in the Commodore. He said that he “thought” she had the knife and was threatening him as he walked back to get in the Commodore. He said that she was “punching the car” and that he locked himself in the car because he did not want anything bad to happen (Q 94). He gave details of her oscillating moods (Q 114), and said that whilst he thought it was a knife it could have been a screwdriver, he saw the “shine” which was “silver” (Q 115). He explained the pre-existing damage to the spoiler (Q 116-117).
	
	
	In that interview he described (at Q 128) how at one point she was at the front of the car whilst he was in the Commodore and he said, “I’ve thought, yes, now (is) me chance (sic). And I started the car up, looked over my shoulder like that reversed out the driveway. Put my foot down spun the wheels drove up”. Then he described about how he drove the car to the point where he said he subsequently met Brittany, near the corner of Clarke Street and Peele Street (Q 128). I have earlier referred to Q 131-139.
	
	
	He said in answer to Q 141: “ … ‘cause I just like, planted it. I’m out of here like, the adrenaline was pumping. Its all I was thinking was I better get out of here or she’s going to kill me … I didn’t look back, I, I didn’t look. (Q Did you look up the driveway as you drove away?) No, I was concentrating on driving out of there”. He drew a plan of the movement of the car which is exhibit L 2.
	
	
	He agreed that he had driven the car to Brittany, and confirmed the police account of the visit to Michael Page to recover his car. He gave confirmatory details of where he last saw the deceased as he was driving out the driveway (at Q 195 – 198) saying “(T)he last time I seen her she was in the driveway”.
	
	
	He said that he remembered things “clearly” and the only “blurry spots” was when he was trying to get out of there to “save me life”. He said the deceased was “just psycho that’s what I thought I got to get out of there while I can” (Q 214, 219).
	
	
	Some matters arising from Brittany’s statement were put to him. Some he agreed with, some he denied. He confirmed she was concerned about not having a driver’s license (Q 238 – 239). He said in fact in relation to various text messages that were exchanged that he was told by Brittany that “Dad and Craig are going to burn the car” and he said in reply “No don’t burn it drop it off down the police station and they’ll have a look”. In cross examination of Brittany she confirmed that she received a message that the car should be taken to the police station, which is shown in Exhibit J6. Although no “message” was received by him, he did send two messages to Brittany while with the police and before being interviewed about giving the car to the police intact.
	
	
	The police put to the accused that the accused had driven the car spinning the wheels when the deceased was “on the vehicle”.
	
	
	He said:
	


“I honestly did not (know). Last I seen her she was in front of me when I was reversing out the driveway. Like, if she was on the boot I would have stopped for sure and that is certain. I would not have drove away like the way I did if she was on the boot. Yeh we had our arguments but I loved her … I did not know she was on the boot. If she was on the boot and I’d seen her fall off I would have stopped then and there. But I admittedly I didn’t look in the rear view as I drove away but I did not know if she was on the boot. The last time I seen her she was in the driveway and that is the god’s truth” (Q 265).


	
	He denied that he asked anyone to wash down his car, but said the deceased had been “jumping all over the car” (Q 272 – 276). He said that perhaps Brittany had wiped down the car to remove her own fingerprints. He was closely questioned about the character of his altercation with the deceased before he drove away. As the case was conducted nothing has turned upon matters raised with the accused in that aspect of the interview. The reasons for the accused leaving and the threat of violence to him by the deceased have no bearing upon the objective assessment of his driving, other than providing a reason for driving the way he did. No issue of “necessity” was raised by the defence.
	
	
	He did say, however, in answer to a particular question: “Well youz are saying that she did (fall off the car). I assume that she chased after me up the driveway and fell over. I, that’s what I’m saying, I don’t know exactly what happened”. When it was squarely put to him that she had fallen off the car at Q 332, he said, “I didn’t see it, it didn’t. I don’t know if she did. But, yeh you say she did so she did. But that’s the only way that I can assume that she got those injuries was falling”.
	
	
	He was also asked some questions about phone records available to the police which involved some suggestions that did not reflect the reality of the length of those calls. He had seen the deceased lying on the ground with the neighbour Bob Kerr. He like Mr Kerr said that she was face down. When police put to him propositions regarding she being seen at one stage sitting on the boot with her feet dangling over he said, “It’s like, when you mentioned it … say that she was sitting on the back of the car with her legs hanging over the boot. If I was to drive off and she fell off wouldn’t she fall and her head, her feet would be facing the direction I drove off. That’s, so um, whether the witnesses say seen her sitting on the boot, yes but I can’t say. Can’t see how she would fall and land face plant in the direction I drove if she was sitting backwards” (Q 386). Although this answer was not the subject of any comment in the case, it suggests the accused, when he first saw the deceased on the ground, saw her lying facing in the direction in which he had driven. At that point the accused said he wished to speak to a solicitor but to all intents and purposes the subject matter of the interview had been exhausted.
	


Post mortem examination


	
	The deceased was declared 'brain dead' in the early evening of 1 January and a post mortem examination was conducted on her at 9.15 am on 3 January 2013.
	
	
	Blood samples had been taken ante-mortem (shortly before midnight) showing a blood alcohol reading at that time of 0.170 grams per hundred millilitres of blood, but no detection of other drugs including amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, opiates and a range of other possible drugs. This screening test for other drugs, however, subject to the qualification that the screen was “to detect toxic levels of poisons” and minor drug levels nor all specimens had been tested.
	
	
	The most significant injuries of which the doctor reported were laceration and abrasions of the face, fracturing of the anterior and middle cranial fossae of the base of the skull and fracturing of the facial bones with limited subdural bleeding. The brain showed multiple contusions predominantly on the left and there was pronounced brain swelling. There were multiple rib fractures on the right and extensive grazing involving the front of the trunk, both forearms and knees. The injuries are not typical of an impact of a standing pedestrian with a moving vehicle and it was said in the report that it was possible that the deceased’s alcohol intoxication may have contributed to the events and likely also caused instability and slowed reflexes.
	
	
	The relevant pathology summary was:
	



	
	Multiple blunt force injury consistent with fall forwards to the ground.
	
	
	Extensive base of skull fracturing.
	
	
	Various forms of neuropathology.
	
	
	Multiple rib fractures on the right.
	
	
	Fracture of clavicle on the right.
	
	
	….
	
	
	…. alcohol intoxication.
	



	
	There had been organ donation before the autopsy. The report contains considerable detail of the site of injuries to head and neck, trunk, left and right upper extremities, left and right lower extremities. There was no histology reflecting existing pathology. There was extensive reporting on macroscopic examination of the brain as well as microscopic examination of the brain.
	
	
	The Doctor was shown Exhibit B in his evidence in chief, particularly photographs 8 and 9 showing a blood stain on the roadway, B9 showing “human (?) hair” attached to the staining. He said it did not necessarily depict the point of impact of the deceased with the road, rather where blood from the face would have been deposited on the road.
	
	
	He said he was not aware of a point of impact, could not say where the body had been at any given time however, the grazing of the face reflected movement of the face along the surface of the road, the distance he conceded in cross examination he could not say. In cross examination he said the movement of the body would have included movement through the air which, of course, cannot be reflected in the interpretation of the injuries and the distance of that was a matter of speculation.
	
	
	With regard to injuries on the face, referring to his figurative drawings in exhibit M 1, injuries numbered 2, 4, 6 and 8 all have a degree of directionality reflecting movement of the head. But whether the movement was from the top of the head to bottom of the head against a surface, or the bottom of the head to the top of the head he could not say. He said it was consistent, however, with falling forwards to the ground. He said that the bitumen tarmac could have caused these injuries.
	
	
	He noted the fracture to the right clavicle could be the result of falling with an outstretched arm, but this was just one mechanism of multiple mechanisms to cause that injury. He noted injuries to the palmer surface of the hands consistent with the hands being outstretched.
	
	
	He said the fractures of the ribs could be caused by two possibilities, a blow to that part of the body when stationary or moving by a moving object or the body moving and striking a stationary object.
	
	
	Two scenarios were raised with the Crown. One suggesting the deceased seated on the back of the vehicle and falling “off the back” as the motor vehicle moved forward.
	


“A. Um, they could be. The vehicle would certainly have to accelerate I think. I think a fall off the car without movement of the vehicle would be extremely unlikely to cause these injuries both in the nature of the grazing type injuries and then the severity of the internal injuries, but if this occurred while the vehicle was moving at some speed, and I can't tell you what that speed would be, even as a broad estimate, then, yes, it could cause those injuries.” (p146/27 – 32)


	
	He was asked if the injuries were consistent with the deceased after it had backed out of the driveway and when it stopped and then accelerates “and (she) is running behind or the acceleration of the car brings her forward and she falls”:
	


“A. It could. Again, I think it would have to be at some reasonable speed as a minimum. I don't think that an average running speed would be sufficient to cause these injuries and I think one of the problems is that there is no real indication of the body being dragged for a distance. Certainly the feet don't show dragging type marks. That is not to say, of course, that there wasn't. I didn't see the shoes, as an example, if there were shoes.” (p146/39-44).


	
	He was asked in cross examination:
	


“Q. Can I just ask you, in relation to the first scenario where I think the Crown has put to you that the deceased was seated on the back of the car and as the car has accelerated off fallen off and had an impact with the roadway, would you not expect in that scenario that the first impact of the body would be likely to be the feet?

A. I don't know. I mean, I think it's possible that there could have been a fall over forwards (indicates) ‑‑

A. If the deceased falls forward, there is every possibility I think that you would land forwards first with your feet following. I am certainly not excluding the possibility that the feet landed on the ground first and there was some tumbling motion as well. For that matter, it could have been in a slight sideways motion as well, that's entirely possible, but I don't think that landing on feet would be necessarily a view that I would prefer over any other.

HIS HONOUR

Q. The problem is you didn't see the shoes?

A. No, well, that's that added problem as well.

Q. You mentioned that as a qualification or issue?

A. Yes.” (p149/8-14, 29-42)


	
	He was unable to indicate which of the two scenarios was more likely, he did not see the shoes that would give some indication of whether the feet had stuck the ground first or not. There were no “dragging” injuries to the feet. His views were expressed in terms of possibilities, likelihoods or not. He said he could not estimate, even as a “broad estimate”, what speed of movement could cause the injuries.
	
	
	With regard to the blood alcohol level he pointed out that it would contribute because it would slow reflexes, people who are intoxicated get into “compromising” situations. So far as the significance of the blood pooling was concerned, he believed that it represented where the body come to rest, but could not say what distance the body had travelled along the ground to that place and need not have been the point of impact. He could not estimate how far the body may have been airborne before impact with the road.
	
	
	So far as falling off the car facing in the direction in which the car was travelling, he could not say whether that was more likely. He described the movement of the body as involving a number of “complex” movements.
	
	
	The Detective-in-Charge (Detective Clinton Oxenbridge) observed the vehicle on examination in “good condition” and “reasonably clean”. He, “did not observe any obvious damage to the vehicle apart from some cracks on the rear spoiler which appeared to be stress cracks. The spoiler fillings also appeared to be loose.” There was other evidence that the vehicle was mechanically sound with no defect of the vehicle found to have contributed to the events causing the death of the deceased. There are a number of photographs of the vehicle taken showing areas of “fluorescence” on the vehicle and other markings, including fingerprint marks but nothing apparently emerges from this. Nothing was said about the matter in submissions
	
	
	It was found on inspection that the rear driver’s tyre was under inflated to “22 psi”. (I assume for what it is worth “normal” pressure would be in the range of 32-36 psi). The accused was interviewed by this detective at Warialda. The accused prepared a plan, as he had during the first interview, which accorded with the general physical evidence. During that interview he had described the deceased at one stage removing air from a rear tyre to try and stop him from leaving.
	


Outline of the submissions of the parties

Crown submissions


	
	The Crown’s submissions were succinct. It submitted by reference to the interviews given by the accused there was no dispute that he was driving the motor vehicle. It submitted in relation to driving in a manner dangerous that the combination of the movement of the vehicle as admitted by the accused in his interviews and his awareness of a person on the boot of the car at that time constituted, if established, driving in a manner dangerous.
	
	
	With regard to issue of “impact” it was submitted by reference to s 52A(5)(g) that the Crown case was that the impact was caused by the deceased falling from the vehicle and relied upon the evidence of Dr Duflou, the details of the autopsy report and the physical evidence, particularly the photographs and the plan of the site to support that proposition.
	
	
	With regard to the scenario of “falling” from the vehicle the Crown particularly took the Court to Dr Duflou’s evidence at p146/27 ff (quoted above), in combination with the observations of Mr Kerr of seeing the deceased sitting on the rear of the vehicle, before the vehicle was moved.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that there were no eye witnesses and even with the benefit of Dr Duflou’s evidence and the physical evidence there were “gaps” in the evidence.
	
	
	With regard to other possibilities such as her jumping on the back of the car, the Court would bear in mind that he had reversed at speed and then driven off at speed.
	
	
	Ultimately, by reference to the scenarios put to Dr Duflou and the evidence he gave (particularly at p146-147) the Court would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the impact as particularised by the Crown caused the death of the deceased. The driving in a manner dangerous as alleged by the Crown was a serious breach of the proper control of the vehicle. The Crown said directly that to accelerate harshly with a person on the boot of the vehicle objectively was driving in a manner dangerous. However, it was conceded that apart from Mr Rob Kerr’s observation it was “speculation” as to how where the deceased was positioned in relation to the car as there were “gaps” in the evidence.
	
	
	It was conceded by the Crown that the accused had said at various points in his interviews that he was not aware of the deceased being on the boot. This it was submitted raised the issue of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. The accused it was conceded had met the relevant “evidentiary burden”. This issue, as the case had been conducted, was acknowledged by the Crown to turn upon the issue of whether the accused was aware, or reasonably ought to have been aware, that the deceased was on the boot.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that it had to disprove this aspect. It submitted the arguments that were against the position of the defence were as follows: Firstly, as to the accused’s honesty in his belief, the Crown’s relied upon Brittany Herring (and Mr Farrar’s evidence in support), being asked to wipe down the car and in fact doing that. Further, the account the witness had given about the circumstances in which she was given the key to the car to drive away, the phone records and the chronology of events from the police statements concerning their arrival at the scene, were consistent with the accused not having an honest belief in facts that would make his actions innocent. The claim by Ms Herring of being asked to wipe down the car was confirmed by the evidence of Mr Farrar and his observation of her wiping down the car.
	
	
	Further, there were the lies he told about who was the driver of the car endeavouring to suggest someone else had driven the car and being asked to wipe down all the car was not consistent with her simply wiping off her finger prints.
	
	
	In relation to the other “limb”, as it was described, of this issue concerning the “reasonableness” of the accused’s belief, the Crown pointed to his admitted driving of the motor vehicle and reversing up the driveway, and then driving off at some speed from outside the house in Peele Street, in circumstances where the deceased was acting “irrationally”. Amongst other things it was argued by the Crown he ought to have taken reasonable steps to ensure that she was not in any way connected to the car or able to climb onto the car. Particularly the Crown referred to the fact that he did not check his rear vision mirror as he drove down Peele Street although he had said looked to the rear of the car as he reversed the car.
	
	
	The Crown conceded there were gaps in the evidence as to the circumstances of the driving of the accused, conceding amongst other things that the physical appearance of the car, the damage to the spoiler, for example, was explained by the accused in his interview.
	
	
	It was conceded by the Crown that there was some support for his version of events both from the observations of civilian witnesses and the observations of police, particularly in relation to the irrational conduct of the deceased and other surrounding circumstances.
	
	
	Ultimately, it was submitted that the injuries were consistent with the deceased falling from the car, although it was conceded that the observations of Mr Farrar of the markings on the car were consistent with the deceased having climbed onto the car in the manner as described by the accused, not necessarily falling from or off the car as the Crown submitted was the case.
	


Defence submissions


	
	Ms Kluss submitted that the issues in the trial were directed at:
	


i.  the nature of the impact,

ii. whether the accused was driving in a manner dangerous

iii. the issue of honest and reasonable mistake of fact in relation to this last aspect.


	
	With regard to the nature of the impact it was submitted that the evidence, does not disclose clearly precisely the mechanism by which the deceased was injured and that various scenarios that were raised with Dr Duflou were speculative. His evidence was heavily guarded and could not make any conclusions of substance with certainty.
	
	
	With regard to driving in a manner dangerous one would need to have regard to the time of day of the driving, the width of the road, the fact that it was night time, the fact that the car was driven at a dead end of a street, no other cars on the road, the fact that the accused last saw the deceased standing in front of the motor vehicle, but certainly not in the way of the car and the precautions the accused took. He acted reasonably when reversing and had no need to check his rear vision mirror as he drove off having regard to all relevant circumstances.
	
	
	Submissions were made about Dr Duflou’s evidence and particularly his characterisation of the movement of the hands of the deceased falling forward not being consistent with the deceased sitting on the rear of the car as it moved away. Ultimately the mechanism for causing the injuries of the deceased was a matter for speculation.
	
	
	The issue of honest and reasonable belief was concerned with the manner of driving of the vehicle and it was submitted that both at the time of the driving and immediately afterwards the accused did not know that the deceased had had any contact with the car.
	
	
	The proven conduct of the accused showed that he had not wanted any confrontation with the deceased, there was no doubt that he walked home from the hotels to avoid dispute, it was the deceased who argued with him when she arrived home, he did not fight back when she was aggressive towards him, there was nothing about his manner that indicated any antipathy towards her.
	
	
	It was submitted that his conduct from the time the police arrived and he was in their presence was entirely consistent with an innocent state of mind, he voluntarily remained with them and was interviewed.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of the significance of any “lies” and other conduct one would need to consider the chronology of events, his account of relevant events supported by a number of witnesses including Mr Kerr senior, his son Shaun, the chronology of phone calls.
	
	
	It was submitted that the Court could not be satisfied the accused asked Ms Herring to wipe down the car. In any event the evidence showed the accused was not aware as to what had happened. Such lies as he told the police were to be considered in the context of his cooperation with the police, and later messages on New Year’s Eve to Ms Herring requesting the production of the car and telling her that the car was not to be damaged.
	
	
	In fact his first interview with the police on the morning of 1 January included confirmation by him of subsequent investigations by the police concerning what messages he had sent including his assertion that he had told Ms Herring to drop the car off at the Police Station and not to burn it, denying that he had asked her to do that.
	
	
	With regard to the “consciousness of guilt” evidence, not only was it not necessarily consistent with him having what at law was “consciousness of guilt” as to the circumstances in which the deceased had been injured, but he had other reasons to distance himself from the vehicle including the fact that he had self admitted drinking alcohol himself.
	
	
	So far as his interviews were concerned many of the matters that he raised with the police were confirmed by independent evidence. These included ceasing contact with the deceased at the hotel to walk home, speaking to the sons about what had happened, the intoxication of the deceased, her irrationality, moving his work car before he moved the blue car, his SMS messages to Ms Herring, calling the police about what had earlier happened and other matters. His versions in his interviews were consistent with him honestly and reasonably believing that the deceased was not connected to the car in any way. The prosecution had not proven that this was not the situation.
	
	
	Matters raised with the counsel for the accused about the alleged lies made were answered by seeking to put the untruths in a particular context, including submissions made that text messages to Ms Herring suggesting a false account to be given to the police concerning the driving of the car were directed at protecting her rather than himself.
	


Consideration


	
	The accused’s admissions, the post-mortem evidence and related opinion evidence and opinions, the physical evidence of the scene, including police observations of the deceased’s driveway and that section of Peele Street from outside 81 Peele Street towards the intersection of Clarke Street where the Commodore was driven by the accused, the photographs, video and plans of those areas and some civilian evidence establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused at relevant times was driving the motor vehicle and that in some way it and the deceased came in contact with each other, causing her ultimately to fall to the ground and occasioning the injuries that directly contributed to her death.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that prosecution has established that the deceased was sitting on boot of the car or elsewhere on the rear of the car, as the accused was reversing up the driveway. This in my view is most unlikely. None of the physical evidence, including the distance the deceased was found from where the car started reversing, supports this proposition reasonably. I am satisfied positively that the accused reversed in circumstances where she was neither on the car, nor behind the car nor in any position of immediate danger. I do not accept she was hanging onto the vehicle at that point.
	
	
	It is clear that the deceased was heavily intoxicated, erratic and irrational and did not want the accused to leave her premises. Before he commenced reversing the vehicle she had tried to stop him leaving in a range of ways, including threatening to let down a rear tyre which she had partially done.
	
	
	In assessing his departure from the driveway to Peele Street and then his driving along Peele Street. I note that at that time it was dark, there would appear to be no other traffic on the road (which would have been easily seen), the area of Peele Street in which this driving occurred had no pedestrians, other than at one point the deceased whose positioning on the road cannot be identified, the section of road into which the accused reversed was at a “dead-end” of the street and alcohol has not been shown to be a factor in the driving of the accused. The accused had checked the rear of his car as he reversed and the accused could not reasonably expect someone to jump onto his car as he manoeuvred the vehicle forward along Peele Street.
	
	
	The accused explained in the interview that he reversed at some speed, causing pronounced tyre marks at least at the commencement of the reversing manoeuvre and then stopped the vehicle in Peele Street facing in a roughly south-westerly direction towards the intersection of Clarke Street and then drove off at some initial speed, at least, leaving tyre marks in the loose gravel on the street. I have quoted the detail of his account of the driving given in his two electronic interviews. His account of his movement of the vehicle accords with the physical evidence.
	
	
	Both the prosecution and the defence can only point to various possibilities as to the mechanics of the cause of injuries suffered by the deceased. Other than she had a heavy fall striking her skull, moving at more than normal running speed causing longitudinal injuries either from foot to head or from head to foot, including injuries to her clavicle and hands consistent with endeavouring to break her fall, nothing else is particularly clearly shown. There is no reliable evidence as to how those injuries occurred, other than that it was not caused by the accused car striking the deceased head on or by direct collision with the vehicle. The injuries to the right chest and ribs remain unexplained to some extent.
	
	
	Generally speaking, either when moving she came into contact with a stationary or moving surface or while stationary she came into contact with a moving object.
	
	
	It is a reasonable possibility that the deceased at one point, unbeknownst to the accused and unseen by the accused, grabbed hold of the rear spoiler as the accused drove off and she was pulled or propelled forward striking the ground, or that she was in contact with the rear of the vehicle, or the side of the vehicle towards the rear causing her to be propelled to the ground. I note no relevant ‘impact’ damage to the vehicle. The Crown’s scenario to support particulars of the driving manner dangerous is based upon drawing an inference as to the position of the deceased on the rear of the car from the last independent sighting of her. Sitting on the rear of the vehicle before it started reversing provides the least likely explanation as to why she was found in the middle of Peele Street, over 30 metres from the entrance to her driveway, a considerable distance from where the vehicle exited the driveway. It would be more likely she would have fallen off while the car was reversing or when it suddenly stopped. There are no drag marks in the driveway or on the road. How she got to the position at which she appeared at rest involves a number of other reasonable possibilities, including actions by her unbeknown to the accused in her intoxicated erratic state.
	
	
	One of the issues critical to the determination of the verdict is that the totality of the evidence is unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt a particular circumstance in which the deceased came in contact either with the car or the road.
	
	
	The accused in terms of his account of his driving of a motor vehicle gave generally consistent accounts in the two interviews. Various aspects of the version that he gave to police in the electronic interviews are confirmed by a range of witnesses whose reliability is not in question. He described the deceased as being intoxicated, hysterical, variously angry and irrational all matters confirmed by a range of independent sources, including the deceased’s own sons. His accounts include reference to the movement of other cars before his own, confirmed by Shaun Kerr. His “admissions” as to his driving are direct and generally consistent. This is to be taken into account in considering his earlier lies and conduct attempting to distance himself from the relevant events.
	
	
	None of the witnesses describe the accused as being aggressive towards the deceased beforehand (although one said he appeared angry at one point). In fact they confirm that the deceased was aggressive towards the accused. Police inspecting the accused’s hands and body saw no injuries consistent with any force used by him against the deceased. The accused described the deceased at one point starting to let down the tyre pressure in the tyre at the rear of the motor vehicle. This is confirmed by the physical examination of the motor vehicle. The accused specifically described the deceased as saying that she “fuckin hated (him).” This is confirmed from a number of sources. The accused described the deceased as striking the car with the hands telling him not to go, consistent, or at least not inconsistent, with what witnesses described as her conduct in the time leading up to the accused departure from the premises. Her actions may not have left any damage on the car before the accused started driving.
	
	
	Although the accused admitted to drinking alcohol during the afternoon there is nothing in the evidence of the observation of the accused shortly after relevant events to suggest that he was in fact ostensibly affected by alcohol. Nor was it suggested that alcohol consumption on his part had any role to play. I notice that no attempt was made to breathalyse him or to take a blood sample from him in the evidence presented to this court. The issue was not raised in any real way in the electronic interviews.
	
	
	Neither does the evidence establish that any conduct of the vehicle by the accused was directed at the deceased any way. There is no doubt on the totality of the evidence that the accused was anxious to get away from what he perceived to be a dangerous situation for himself created by and irrational person heavily intoxicated but as I earlier pointed out this aspect of the matter is not relevant to the objective assessment of the character of his driving.
	
	
	The accused’s conduct immediately after the event was clearly designed by him to distance himself from the circumstance that he discovered, after the event, that the deceased was seriously injured. He told lies on a number of occasions to the police initially. He also asked Brittany Herring to “cover up” for him in a range of ways, wiping down the car and asking her to tell the police someone else had driven the car and a possible scenario as to how the deceased was injured. But in the context of the direction set out above in respect of “consciousness of guilt” ultimately I do not regard that body of evidence as evidence that can be taken into account in establishing his guilt of the particular offence that he is charged. Clearly, he realised after the event that he must have in some way caused severe injury to the deceased having seen her lying on the road. He initially sought to distance himself from the driving of the vehicle knowing this but was unclear as to how that had happened. His lack of knowledge of what had happened is not only explicit in the account he gave in the first electronic interview and subsequently, but is consistent with some contemporaneous statements made at the scene to Brittney Herring and others. In a text message to Brittany Herring at 12.09 am on 1 January (after speaking to Police) he wrote “Yeah but they wanna look at me car they reckon I hit her so if they C the car they wik (sic) know I didn’t: This is consistent with the accused not knowing how the deceased was injured. Likewise his suggestions to Brittany in three text messages between 11.28 pm and 12.25 am that “Kim chased” the vehicle. In any event, within a short period of time afterwards, so far as driving the car was concerned he had admitted he was the driver. In my view he fully cooperated with the police at a critical time of the investigation and was entirely straight forward, materially supported in a number of respects by independent or objective evidence.
	
	
	I do not accept the evidence of Brittney Herring that the accused told her to burn the car. I accept that he asked her to take the car to her parent’s place and may have asked her to wipe it down. This is consistent with an initial reaction without thinking things through when he realised the deceased was injured. In any event, he did not ask her to wipe down just the back of the car or any particular part of it. If he believed the car had struck the deceased in some way this is consistent with not knowing where that occurred. Of course, it may also be concerned with not bringing attention to any one part of the vehicle. These are competing explanations. As to burning the car I do not know where the suggestion came from. Judging from the reaction of Mr Page it may have come from him. But it is clear from the text messages sent by the accused that when the suggestion was obviously raised with him, he did not want the car burnt. In fact he wanted the car produced to the police for them to inspect it believing he had nothing to hide even though he was also at that point denying driving the car and suggesting to Ms Herring another version. A text message from Brittany at 12.42 pm told the accused that “Mum said they (were) not burning (the car)”. But they weren’t prepared to drive it to the “the cop shop”. This has a connotation that the suggestion came from the Pages.
	
	
	Ultimately, there is no relevant damage to the car. There was some damage to the rear spoiler. In part, this was explained as a pre-existing matter. In any event it is as consistent with the deceased sitting on the rear of the car when the car was stationary as when it was moving. It could be consistent with grabbing onto the spoiler, already weakened by pre-existing damage to it while the car was moving. Mr Farrar saw markings in the dust on the car when it was parked in the paddock next to the Page’s home consistent with hand and slide marks, but again this is just as consistent with the deceased being on the car when it was stationary and getting off the vehicle at that time as purportedly sliding off the vehicle when it was moving.
	
	
	The problem with the hypothesis that the deceased was sitting on the back of the car at the time that it reversed up the driveway is that if the sudden movement of the vehicle caused her fall it was likely she would have fallen off well before the position in which she was ultimately found. For her to fall off the rear of the vehicle as the accused began driving in Peele Street, having already reversed out of the driveway, given the position that she was found and giving due deference to the uncertainty of the conclusion of Dr Duflou as to the mechanism for causing the deceased’s various injuries, I have difficulty accepting as a fact (whether established beyond reasonable doubt or on balance) that in her intoxicated state she could have stayed on the boot of the car over the distance that the vehicle must have travelled before she would have fallen off. Further, there were no sounds heard consistent with her being carried for a distance on the car unwillingly, such as call to stop or screams. She certainly was not incapable of vocalising her views and opinions from the time she arrived back home from the hotel.
	
	
	The state of the evidence is such that she may have fallen off the vehicle at some point having been seated upon it at a later time when it stopped Peele Street or she may have attempted to jump onto it grabbing onto the rear spoiler and then losing her grip as the car commenced to drive along Peele Street. The account of the accused does not exclude the deceased following the vehicle or anticipating its movement and grabbing at the spoiler as it moved forward in Peele Street. She may have even come into collision with part of the car, as it was moving forward Peele Street, causing her to sprawl to the ground forwards. The medical evidence does not give up any one explanation more likely than another. The probability is she fell in a “forwards” motion, but she might have fallen face forwards away from the moving vehicle. It would be difficult, but not impossible, to fall forwards if sitting on the rear facing away from the front of the vehicle.
	
	
	Other aspects of the collateral conduct of the accused when and where he gave Ms Herring the car key, when and where he spoke to her and the like, referred to in passing in submissions are not matters of significance. Any specific chronology to be gleaned from civilian witnesses is necessarily vague or unsatisfactory in its precision.
	
	
	In the context of considering the driving of the accused, the prosecution has not established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not have the relevant honest and reasonable belief that it was safe to drive as he did. In this regard it requires examination of all aspects the manner of driving of the accused including whether it is established at relevant times that the deceased was ‘on’ the car. I am not satisfied that the accused was aware or ought to have been aware she was on the car. Given I discount as a fact established or reasonably possible that the deceased sat on the rear of the car as it was reversed, and that it would have been difficult, almost impossible, to have had the time to sit on the rear of the car as it drove down Peele Street away from outside 81 Peele Street, I am not able to conclude beyond reasonable doubt she sat on the rear of the vehicle while it was moving. I cannot determine with any confidence any particular modus of the control of the vehicle contributing to her fatal injuries. There is not reasonable evidence of trying to “shake her off” the car. I have concluded that the accused’s account of what he did, supported by physical and other evidence, is at least reasonably possible and that it is at least (in that sense) honest, notwithstanding his early lies and other conduct. It was reasonable for him to continue driving up Peele Street without checking his rear view mirror before continuing to do so as he admitted. He said he was concentrating on what was in front of him as he drove which is consistent with proper management of the vehicle in all the circumstances. It was not reasonable for him to expect that she would in some way attach herself to the rear of the vehicle.
	
	
	Ultimately, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at prosecution has established that the accused drove in a manner dangerous and/or that relevant “impact”, as pleaded and particularised, has been established.

		22 June 2015",2015-06-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766857,Brett Richardson v Regina [2015] NSWDC 246,"Judgment


	
	Brett Richardson (the appellant) appeals against the convictions entered by Mr Connell LCM on 3 December 2014 at the Sutherland Local Court.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded not guilty to one count of Affray pursuant to section 93C(1) Crimes Act 1900, and one count of Recklessly Causing Grievous Bodily Harm pursuant to section 35 (2) of Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate convicted the appellant of both counts. In relation to the charge of Affray the magistrate ordered that the appellant enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months pursuant to section 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In relation to the charge of Recklessly Causing Grievous Bodily Harm the appellant was ordered to perform 450 hours of community service and to pay compensation in the sum of $5,013.90 to the victim, Erin Brighten.
	
	
	On the appeal, Mr Macedone, solicitor appeared for the appellant and Ms Roatz, solicitor, appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, the respondent in the proceedings.
	
	
	On 25 April 2014 the appellant attended licensed premises known as ‘The Sting Bar’ on the Kingsway at Cronulla (the premises). The licensee of the premises, Pasquali Traino was a friend of the appellant. At about midnight, Mr Traino had cause to remove a patron, Luke Provan from the premises. At or about the time of Mr Provan’s removal, Mr Traino asked the appellant to “watch his back” as he was concerned that Mr Provan had been using the drug which is commonly known as “ice”.
	
	
	Mr Provan was removed from the premises by a security guard and Mr Traino. After being restrained for a short period Mr Provan broke free from the security guard and started to threaten and to throw punches towards the security guard, the appellant and the people nearby that included Mr Traino. The appellant, the security guard and Mr Traino were then engaged by Mr Provan in a fight. In the course of that fight the victim Ms Brighten, pulled the appellant’s shirt and he responded by striking her with his right hand in the face causing her to fall to the ground. She suffered a broken jaw and the defence conceded that her injuries amounted to grevious bodily harm.
	
	
	Immediately after striking Ms Brighten, the appellant quickly approached Mr Provan and punched him in or about the head a number of times and then procceded to knee him in the abdomen about 3 times in quick succession. During those strikes Mr Provan was being punched by the security guard and Mr Traino and the security guard were trying to get hold of him. After a short time other security guards pulled the appellant out of the fracas and escorted him inside the premises at about the time when Police arrived.
	


The Relevant Law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows:
	



	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31];
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22];
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24];
	
	
	The Court is obliged to give the judgement which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance: Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [23].
	



	
	Section 418 Crimes Act 1900 provides:
	


(1)   A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.

(2)   A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:

(a)   to defend himself or herself or another person, or

(b) …

(c) ….

(d) ….

and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.


	
	The statutory test for self-defence was considered in R v Katarzynski [2002] NSWCCA 613. The questions to be considered by the tribunal of fact when self-defence is raised are:
	



	
	is there a reasonable possibility that the accused believed that his or her conduct was necessary in order to defend himself or herself (or another); and
	
	
	if there was, is there also a reasonable possibility that what the accused did it was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he or she perceived them?
	



	
	The first question is to be determined from a completely subjective point of view considering all the personal characteristics of the accused at the time he or she carried out the conduct. The second question is determined by an entirely objective assessment of the proportionality of the accused’s response to the situation as the accused subjectively believed he or she faced. The prosecution negatives self-defence if it proves beyond reasonable doubt that either:
	



	
	the accused did not genuinely believe that it was necessary to act as he or she did in his or her own defence (or that of another); or
	
	
	what the accused did was not a reasonable response to the danger, as he or she perceived it to be.
	



	
	Self-induced intoxication is relevant to the first question to be considered, that is whether it was reasonably possible that the accused believed it was necessary to do what was done in self-defence, but not to the second question: R v Katarzynski at [21].
	
	
	Care must be exercised in analysing cases involving self-defence to avoid the “unreality of dissecting into minute detail” events that occurred in a short period of time: R v Conlon (1993) 69 A Crim R 92 at 97. Further the self-defence need not be the sole state of mind on the part of the accused at the time he or she acted, but must be the dominant state of mind on his or her part: R v Viro (1978) 141 CLR 88 at 127.
	


Material considered on the appeal


	
	Tendered before me was the Crown bundle (Exhibit 1), which comprised of the transcripts the Local Court proceedings on 19 November 2014, 3 December 2014 and 4 February 2015 together with the 16 exhibits that were before the Local Court.
	
	
	The events that became the subject of the charges occurred outside the front entrance of the premises and were captured on CCTV footage taken from across the road. The footage that became Exhibit 16 in the Local Court was a crucial piece of objective evidence in the case. I would describe what I saw in the footage as follows.
	
	
	Mr Provan was forcibly removed from the premises by a security guard and Mr Traino. When the three men reached a point on the footpath close to the road, Mr Provan was forced to the ground by the security guard and that caused Mr Traino to stumble away from them. The security guard was then restraining Mr Provan who was on his knees with the security guard above him and placing downward pressure on the upper part of his body. At this time the appellant is on the footpath and standing behind the security guard and Mr Traino.
	
	
	At about this point Ms Brighten approached Mr Provan and spoke to him. She effectively remained in close proximity from that point in time onwards.
	
	
	Mr Provan continued to struggle and forced his way to his feet. Mr Traino and the appellant tried to lift Mr Provan’s feet off the ground in an effort to assist the security guard to restrain him, but that was unsuccessful. Mr Provan got to his feet with the security guard still having hold of him. Mr Provan was then approached by Ms Brighten, who spoke to him again. At this point the appellant was standing directly behind the security guard and in close proximity to Ms Brighten.
	
	
	Mr Provan then turned around and pushed the appellant, whilst the security guard still had a hold of him around the abdominal region. Mr Provan then completely broke free from the security guard’s hold and moved to the right of the picture. At this time he was pursued by Ms Brighten who was trying to push him away from the other men. At about this time both the appellant and security guard raise their hands with the palms facing outwards towards Mr Provan in an effort to calm him. Mr Provan then pushed Ms Brighten aside and threw 2 punches in the direction of the appellant and the security guard. The appellant moved to Mr Provan’s right and retreated slightly. The appellant then approached Mr Provan quickly and applied a forceful kick to Mr Provan’s lower leg.
	
	
	The appellant withdrew slightly after kicking Mr Provan and at this point he came into contact with Ms Brighten. She had her hands extended in front of her as if she was expecting to take the impact of the appellant who was backing into her. She then took hold of his shirt at the point where her hands had come into contact with him which was about in the middle of his back. She pulled him back in the same direction that he had been travelling; using his momentum against him. The appellant turned to his left and with his left hand broke the hold that she had on his shirt. The appellant raised his right hand towards Ms Brighten and was facing her. He paused, very briefly, and then struck her forcefully in the face with his right hand. She immediately fell heavily face first to the ground.
	
	
	The appellant then immediately turned his attention back to Mr Provan. He approached him quickly and kicked him. He then punched him a number of times around the head and then proceeded to raise his knee into Mr Provan’s abdomen on three occasions in quick succession. At that time, the security guard also threw a number of punches towards Mr Provan. Mr Traino and a number of other security guards joined in restraining Mr Provan. The appellant was pulled away from Mr Provan by other security guards and escorted inside the premises.
	
	
	Mr Provan continue to cause difficulties, but was eventually subdued by Police.
	


Analysis of the magistrate’s reasons and Consideration


	
	The hearing of the matter was considerably shortened by agreement between the parties. The only witnesses to give oral evidence were Mr Traino and the appellant, with the other statements being admitted without objection.
	
	
	The magistrate gave very careful and cogent reasons that referred extensively not only to the oral evidence, but to the documentary evidence as well. From my independent review of the evidence I unreservedly agree with the reasons set out by the magistrate at T2.10-T3.50 of the proceedings on 3 December 2014.
	
	
	The magistrate then noted the evidence in the statement of Nathan Wilson, who was not cross-examined, that included the statement “this guy wearing the black shirt has gone towards the female had given her two punches to jaw area knocking her to the ground”.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that the appellant gave a recorded interview to the Police, in which he maintained that he acted in self-defence. The magistrate noted that much of what was in the appellant’s record of interview at pages 5 and 6 was consistent with the CCTV footage. He noted a number of matters in the record of interview that were favourable to the appellant, including that:
	



	
	Mr Provan was being aggressive and wanted to fight; and
	
	
	the appellant had put his hands up with his palms facing outwards trying to calm Mr Provan down.
	



	
	I would pause to note at this point that there were a number of crucial matters asserted by the appellant, particularly at page 6 of the record of interview that were not supported by the CCTV footage, including that:
	



	
	Mr Traino and Mr Provan were involved in a scuffle;
	
	
	Mr Traino had fallen to the ground because Mr Provan had hold of him; and
	
	
	that the appellant had been kneeing Mr Provan in the abdomen when the appellant “felt someone either choke me or grab at my face or grab my shirt” and “Certainly…I felt a force grab me from behind”.
	



	
	The magistrate found that the appellant’s evidence was consistent with the CCTV footage to a point, in that Mr Provan was aggressive and difficult to control. The magistrate noted the appellant’s evidence that the kick applied to Mr Provan was an attempted leg sweep, that he feared he would be dragged down and king hit and that he felt scratching on his face. The magistrate noted that the CCTV footage showed Ms Brighten pull the appellant’s shirt but not touch anywhere near his face. The magistrate noted the appellant’s evidence that he believed that he might end up on the ground and get a kicking and that he spun and struck out at a person in an “instant reaction”. The appellant said in evidence that he was defending himself and Mr Traino, but not the other security guards. The magistrate noted the appellant’s evidence in cross-examination that he was intoxicated, but not to the extent that he could not reason properly.
	
	
	The magistrate noted the appellant’s evidence in cross-examination that he denied that there were 2 actions in dealing with Ms Brighten, in that he used his left hand to break her hold on him and then he struck her in the face. The magistrate noted that the appellant accepted that he turned and struck the person with no attention to who he was hitting and that he did not say anything to that person.
	
	
	The magistrate noted that the appellant’s evidence was inconsistent with the CCTV footage in that the security guards had a partial hold on Mr Provan at least when the appellant returned his attention to Mr Provan, punching him in the head and kneeing him in the abdomen.
	
	
	The magistrate recorded the appellant’s evidence to the extent that he was very fearful for his safety and that he believed that the security guards needed the assistance that he gave to subdue Mr Provan. The magistrate found that the appellant said that Mr Provan used the words “I’m going to kill you” towards him, for the first time in the witness box and that they were a belated addition to his evidence.
	
	
	The magistrate recorded that in cross-examination the appellant denied punching Mr Provan in the head, saying instead that he was attempting to get Mr Provan in a headlock. The magistrate recorded that the appellant denied being pulled back from the fracas by a security guard, but that in his view of the CCTV footage that was clearly shown.
	
	
	The magistrate then set out the elements of the offences. The magistrate concluded that the elements of the offences had been made out, beyond reasonable doubt and then turned to the question of self-defence, first setting out the statutory test and the law as to how it was interpreted in R v Katarzynski. No complaint was made about these legal directions on behalf of the appellant.
	
	
	The magistrate then set out in a detailed fashion what he saw on the CCTV footage. I read the magistrate’s reasons on this issue after I prepared my own summary set out at [16]-[22] of this judgment. I am in substantial agreement with what is set out by the magistrate and the inferences that he drew from the footage, with one exception.
	
	
	The magistrate found that the appellant was acting lawfully in trying to protect his friend Mr Traino and at times himself up and until the time he struck Ms Brighten. In my view the CCTV footage shows that when Mr Provan broke free from the security guard he threw punches towards the appellant and the security guard and that there was no threat to Mr Traino. The appellant gave evidence that he saw Mr Provan involved in a scuffle with Mr Traino and that Mr Traino fell to the ground. Presumably this evidence was the basis for his perception of the threat to Mr Traino. However, put simply, neither of these matters in fact occurred.
	
	
	At T10.15-35 the magistrate found that the CCTV footage established that the appellant turned and saw Ms Brighten before punching her with a closed fist and that his actions were reckless. I would respectfully agree with the magistrate’s interpretation of the CCTV evidence and his conclusions on this point. Whilst it happened quickly and in the heat of the moment, the CCTV footage clearly in my view depicts the appellant pausing, albeit very briefly, facing Ms Brighten and then striking her. Accordingly, I do not accept the appellant’s evidence on this point. The magistrate also found that the appellant punched Ms Brighten, and forcefully so. He did so notwithstanding the appellant’s evidence that he struck her with an open palm and that he denied it was a punch. The magistrate seems to have at least in part relied on the statement of Mr Wilson about this. On this point, the magistrate had the advantage of seeing and hearing the appellant give evidence and make the relevant denial. Even though the magistrate did not make an express finding as to credit or demeanour, I am satisfied that he was in the best position to make that finding and I would not overturn it.
	
	
	At T10.35-45 the magistrate found that the appellant’s response to Ms Brighten pulling his shirt was disproportionate to any threat that he may have perceived and accordingly he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that self-defence had been negatived in relation to the charge of Recklessly Inflict Grevious Bodily Harm. I would respectfully agree with the magistrate on this point also. I would add that I do not accept the appellant’s evidence that he feared being taken to the ground and king hit or given a kicking. The only aggressor to anyone on that night was Mr Provan and at the relevant time he was in front of the appellant. Ms Brighten was trying to calm Mr Provan down for some considerable time in the course of the events that occurred. I do not accept the appellant’s evidence that he did not see her or hear her doing so, before she pulled his shirt. The CCTV footage clearly showed her presence and on a number of occasions she was in close proximity to the appellant. Her evidence was that she was speaking to Mr Provan and the other men trying to de-escalate the situation.
	
	
	At T10.45-11.30 the magistrate found that after Ms Brighten fell to the ground the appellant looked back and saw Mr Provan being held by Mr Traino and the security guard. The appellant approached quickly and kicked Mr Provan weakening the hold that Mr Traino and the security guard had on him. The magistrate noted that at that time Mr Provan’s T-shirt was over his face and it was at that time that the appellant punched him a number of times in the head before raising his knee into his abdomen on a number of occasions. The magistrate concluded that the appellant “went from a protector to an aggressor and a violent one at that by the end of the melee”. The magistrate was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that by the punching of Mr Provan to the side of the head and administering the three knee strikes the appellant was not acting in self-defence or defence another, but was just being violent and his actions were totally out of proportion to any perceived threat from Mr Provan at that point in time. Again I would respectfully agree with the magistrate’s conclusions.
	
	
	I generally found that the appellant’s evidence on this point less satisfactory than other parts of his evidence which I have in the course of these reasons already rejected. First, the CCTV footage does not support the appellant’s version that he was trying to place Mr Provan in a headlock. Second, the appellant denied punching Mr Provan in the side of the head at the time when his T-shirt was over his face when the CCTV footage clearly showed him doing just that. The appellant even refused to concede that the CCTV footage depicted him punching Mr Provan at that time. Finally, the appellant denied that he was pulled away from Mr Provan by other people and further did not accept that the CCTV footage showed that to occur.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having conducted an independent review of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of both offences with which he was charged for the reasons articulated by the magistrate and for the reasons that I have added.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders I make are as follows:
	



	
	Appeal dismissed.

2766859,Drysdale v R [2015] NSWCCA 135,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	SIMPSON J:    I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Appellant was indicted to stand trial on eight counts of sexual offences arising from an encounter with the Complainant on the afternoon of 18 November 2012. The counts alleged acts in the order in which they are said to have occurred on that afternoon.
	
	
	Count 1 was    an assault and commit act of indecency. Count 2 was attempted sexual intercourse without consent. Count 3, charged as an alternative to Count 2, was an assault with an act of indecency. Counts 4 and 5 were sexual intercourse without consent. Counts 6, 7 and 8 were assaults with acts of indecency.
	
	
	The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on all counts except count 3. They found the Appellant guilty of the offence charged on count 3. The Trial judge did not record a conviction but sentenced him to a 2 year bond under s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The Appellant appeals on one ground only:
	


The verdict of the jury that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in count 3 in the indictment is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence given the verdicts of not guilty of the offences charged in the other counts in the indictment, being counts 1-2 and 4-8.


	
	Leave is required to argue this ground. I consider that the issue raised justifies leave being granted. I shall therefore refer to the Applicant for leave as the Appellant.
	


Crown case at trial


	
	The Appellant who was aged 21 years and the Complainant who was aged 18 years were both employed casually for a company that provided entertainment to children at parties. They met for the first time at Centennial Park on 18 November 2012 when a promotional photo shoot was scheduled by the owner of the Company.
	
	
	Following the photo shoot the Appellant, the Complainant and another employee had coffee at a café in Surry Hills. The Appellant was a graduate from the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts and the Complainant was interested in being an actor. The third member of the group had attended the same Academy for three years with the Appellant.
	
	
	After the third member of the group left the Appellant invited the Complainant back to his house in Zetland to assist her with monologues she was preparing for an audition at NIDA.
	
	
	When they arrived at the house they walked through the living room where the Appellant’s housemate, Ms Annabella McHugh, was sitting watching television. The Appellant took a movie from a shelf in the living room for him and the Complainant to watch on his computer in his bedroom.
	
	
	The Complainant’s evidence was that they sat either side of the Appellant’s bed with his laptop computer in between them and began watching the movie. After a short time the Appellant then tried to kiss her and pull her close to him. She said, ""I'm really sorry but I've probably given you the wrong idea. That's not why I'm here."" She said to the Appellant that she should probably leave but he asked her to stay and she did so.
	
	
	The Complainant said then that after they had each performed a monologue for each other she thanked the Appellant and said that she should probably go as it was getting late. As she was gathering her possessions to leave, the Appellant said words to the effect, ""Well I've helped you, now what about me?""
	
	
	The Appellant then grabbed her by both wrists with both his hands, threw her onto the bed and said words to the effect, ""Do you really think somebody as small as you can get away from someone like me?"" The Appellant then started to remove the Complainant's leggings and underwear despite her trying to prevent him from doing so.
	
	
	What then occurred formed the basis of count 1 being an indecent assault. It involved the forcible removing by the Appellant of the Complainant's clothing and the grabbing and squeezing by the Appellant of her breasts.
	
	
	What then happened formed the basis of counts 2 and 3 in the alternative. The Complainant’s evidence was that after removing his own clothes while she remained naked on the bed the Appellant, who had an erection, climbed on top of her, one leg on each side. She said that she ""had my hands on my vagina so that he couldn't penetrate me."" Her legs were closed really tightly. The Appellant was rubbing his penis in the region of where her vagina was and she said “he was pretending that we were having sex"". She asserted that he put her legs over her head which made it easier for him to get closer to her and he continued to thrust his hips towards her vagina. No penetration occurred. The jury convicted him of assault with an act of indecency in respect of the acts described in this paragraph, but found him not guilty of attempted sexual intercourse without consent.
	
	
	The Complainant said that the Appellant flipped her over onto her stomach and inserted a finger into her vagina. That was the basis of count 4 being sexual intercourse without consent.
	
	
	The Complainant said that the Appellant then flipped her over onto her back again and placed two fingers inside her vagina. That constituted count 5.
	
	
	Simultaneously with placing two fingers inside her vagina the Appellant took the Complainant’s right hand, placed it onto his penis, held her hand and used his hand on top of her hand to masturbate himself to the point of ejaculation. That constituted count 6 being a charge of indecent assault.
	
	
	The Complainant said that they then lay together on the bed for about ten minutes with the Appellant lying behind her in a spooning position. During that time the Appellant said, “I feel we have this really strong connection”. They then spoke about plays that they liked.
	
	
	The Complainant gave evidence that the Appellant then digitally penetrated her vagina and used his own hand to masturbate whilst reciting lines from Macbeth. This constituted count 7 being sexual intercourse without consent.
	
	
	The Complainant then gave evidence that after the Appellant had digitally penetrated her he squeezed her breasts and rubbed his penis between them. He then returned to masturbating and ejaculated for a second time, before checking the time and saying to the Complainant that it was late and that she should leave. That behaviour constituted count 8 being a charge of indecent assault.
	
	
	The Complainant’s evidence was that when she left the Appellant’s house she did not think that Ms McHugh was still there although Ms McHugh gave evidence that she was. At the door she said to the Appellant, “Nice to meet you. I've got to go.” The Crown case, to explain that remark, was that the Complainant said it so she could get away.
	
	
	She then drove her car straight to her mother’s house in Paddington. She did not tell her mother what had happened at that time but she did say to the mother:
	


It just really sucks, mum, that boys just never want to be friends.


	
	Later that night the Complainant spoke by telephone to a friend called Josh Anderson. She said she had been seeing him in a romantic capacity although he was not her boyfriend. She told Mr Anderson that the Appellant had “forced himself” onto her.
	
	
	The following day the Complainant rang her employer at the children’s party company, Ms Christina McLeod. She said to Ms McLeod words to the effect:
	


Christina, this is what happened with Michael. He has forced himself onto me and he has assaulted me.


	
	Complaint was first made to the police on 29 November 2012, that is, 11 days after the incidents complained of.
	


The Appellant’s case


	
	The Appellant’s case of what happened that afternoon up to the time at which they lay down on the Appellant’s bed and began to watch the movie largely accorded with the Complainant’s evidence. Thereafter, the Appellant said after about 10 or 15 minutes, touching of fingertips began, followed shortly thereafter by kissing. The Appellant's evidence was that after about a minute of kissing, the Complainant pulled away from him and said ""wait, listen, I just don't want to have sex today"".
	
	
	The Appellant's evidence was that he said ""OK"", they kissed a few more times and then went back to watching the movie. After another five to ten minutes they returned to kissing. Shortly afterwards he paused the movie. At this point she took hold of his shirt and said again: ""I don't want to have sex today"". The Appellant asked her why that was. His evidence of her response was as follows:
	


I don't remember the exact entire conversation but the two things that stood out in that short conversation that we had after that was that she said 'I like the idea of having sex with you, I Just don't want to have sex today'.

His evidence continued:

At that point I said, 'OK, well, we don't have to have sex we can just do this and maybe other stuff.


	
	On the defence case, they kissed again. He said that he was confused and that she noted his confusion and said, ""I think I should probably go"". He persuaded her to stay and they started kissing each other again, her lying on top of him whilst he was on his back and then they began to touch each other's genitals for the first time, at first over their clothes and then underneath.
	
	
	The Appellant gave evidence that they undressed down to their underwear. While kissing, he placed his hand under the Complainant's underwear and ""sort of started to play with her clitoris, there was no objection to do so, over a period of about 20 minutes or so"". The Appellant gave evidence that ""over the course of that 20 minute period, [the Complainant] indicated to me on three different occasions that she was having an orgasm.""
	
	
	The defence case is that thereafter the Appellant lay on his back and they continued kissing before the Complainant masturbated him for about five to ten minutes until he ejaculated onto his stomach. She then went to the bathroom and brought back some toilet paper for him.
	
	
	On the Appellant's evidence it was after this that they started talking about acting, and later each got dressed and performed a monologue. This took 40 to 45 minutes according to the Appellant.
	
	
	After the monologues were completed they kissed again, ""quite passionately"", and the Appellant's evidence was that because ""it felt like there'd been a really nice coming together over the last sort of 40 minutes"", he pulled back and said ""let's have sex"". He thought he saw her nod. They continued kissing, before undressing each other. He took a condom from a set of drawers and opened the wrapper, at which point the Complainant said, ""Look, no way, I don't want to have sex"". He said, ""Oh, OK, it's just that I thought that you - never mind, let's just do what we were doing before.""
	
	
	The Appellant's evidence was that after kissing for a further time, while lying on his bed, he walked his knees up either side of the Complainant's body and put his penis between her breasts. After about 15 seconds he moved back, of his own accord, and they returned to their previous positions on the bed.
	
	
	He then attempted to pleasure the Complainant through masturbation by digital penetration rather than clitoral stimulation, and after about five minutes she said, ""OK I think we can stop now"". He stopped, they kissed a few more times, then at his request she masturbated him for a short period and he ejaculated a second time. Once again she went to the bathroom and came back with toilet paper and he cleaned himself up.
	
	
	Afterwards, the two of them lay on the bed talking for five to ten minutes before the Appellant looked outside and noticed that it was dark. He checked the time and said, ""It's just after eight we should probably get you home"". He thought she did not take this well. The two of them got dressed and he saw her out. Ms McHugh was still in the living room watching television when the Complainant left the premises.
	


Legal principles


	
	The principles in relation to unreasonable verdicts have been comprehensively analysed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 especially at [23] and [34]. Subsequently, in R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299 Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) said:
	


[135]  …But it seems to me that, where the circumstance said to create unreasonableness is inconsistency, then a new dimension is added to the conventional M test. The issue is not only whether the verdict was open “upon the whole of the evidence”. It is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on one or some counts, whatever (if anything) can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals, and whatever insight can be gained into the jury’s thinking and reasoning. It is only where the only reasonable explanation for the acquittals is doubt about the Complainant’s veracity that an appellate court would be obliged to take the approach taken in Jones (and in Norris).

[136] In my view an appellate court ought to exercise caution before concluding that the explanation for differential verdicts is compromise. Inherent in that conclusion is the further conclusion that the jury has acted contrary to its duty, and contrary to the instruction it has been given. The criminal justice system depends upon its faith in juries adhering to their obligations, as explained to them, and acting in conformity with those obligations: …


	
	In Dungay v R [2010] NSWCCA 82 Giles JA (RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreeing) said:
	


[9] Gleeson CJ and Hayne and Callinan JJ said in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [34], in relation to asserted inconsistency of verdicts, that “[t]he ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury’s decision”. Unreasonableness is determined according to the test in the joint judgment of Mason CJ and Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 493, namely, whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Their Honours said in MFA v The Queen at [35] that this test “must be applied in deciding whether a conviction on one or more counts of sexual offences, when the accused was acquitted on other counts, is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”.

[10] In TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151 it was pointed out that M v The Queen also recognised that a verdict must be set aside if on any other ground there was a miscarriage of justice. It was suggested that where the unreasonableness is because of asserted inconsistency of verdicts there is a “new dimension added to the conventional M test”, going beyond the quality of the evidence and extending to the significance for the guilty verdict of the verdict of acquittal: see at [119]-[135] per Simpson J, Latham J agreeing at [204]. The wider inquiry “include[s] matters outside the evidence, such as the impact on the reasonableness of the verdict of guilty of what may be discerned to be the explanations for the acquittals”: at [128].

[11] It is not necessary to explore whether there is truly an addendum to the test derived from M v The Queen, or only an additional dimension within that test. Consistency or inconsistency of verdicts will always come down to what was open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence. Examination of the evidence, with an appreciation of how it was presented and left to the jury, will reveal whether there is a rational explanation for a verdict of guilty on one count and a verdict of not guilty on another count. In MFA v The Queen, for example, it was held at [36] that there was an explanation in the evidence of the differences between the verdicts, and that it was therefore open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of guilt on two counts notwithstanding unwillingness to convict on the other counts.

[12] If a rational explanation cannot be discerned, it can be said that it was not open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in coming to the guilty verdict, or it can be said that there was otherwise a miscarriage of justice. The formulation will rarely be of moment, and is not in the present case. Ultimately, as Wood CJ at CL pointed out in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [237], on reviewing the entirety of the case the court may maintain a comfortable satisfaction as to the guilty verdict upon the evidence separately considered concerning it.


	
	In Osland v R [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 McHugh J said:
	


[120] When there is no legal or technical inconsistency in the verdicts, a conviction can only be set aside where the inconsistency in the verdicts demonstrates that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the two different verdicts. In such a case, the Court of Criminal Appeal sets aside the conviction because it is unsafe or unsatisfactory.

Submissions


	
	The Appellant made two principal submissions concerning inconsistency. First, he said that a conviction on count 3 could not sit with an acquittal on count 2 alone. This was because the act that constituted those counts was the same. If the act itself was not attempted intercourse, as the jury found, then it was not an assault with an act of indecency.
	
	
	Secondly, he said that a conviction on count 3 could not sit with an acquittal on all of the other counts together. This was because the jury must have had doubts about the Complainant’s account of what happened overall. Part of those doubts was that he did the act or acts said to constitute the attempt to have sexual intercourse that was the basis of count 2 and in the alternative count 3. There was no rational explanation for differentiating between count 3 and the other counts.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Appellant bears the burden of establishing inconsistency of verdicts, and it is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the conviction on count 3 demonstrated that in a 'word on word' case such as the present the jury required evidence other than that of the Complainant before they convicted. Here, the jury found support in the Appellant’s evidence because the Appellant acknowledged that the Complainant had specifically told him that she did not want to have sex with him on that day and in that context the word “sex” was plainly understood to mean penile vaginal sexual intercourse. Despite that, the Crown submitted, the Appellant on several occasions on his own evidence tried to persuade her into having sex of that nature with him.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that, although the Appellant’s evidence did not admit the acts the subject of counts 2 and 3, this did not cause the jury not to be satisfied the acts did not occur. This fact, together with the evidence that the Appellant was aware of the Complainant’s lack of consent to penile/ vaginal sexual intercourse provided support for the Complainant’s evidence on the issue of lack of consent.
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to part of the Complainant’s evidence that was also specifically identified to the jury by counsel for the Appellant. The Complainant’s evidence was in relation to counts 2 and 3:
	


He was thrusting them [his hips] towards my vagina and he wasn’t physically penetrating me, but he was rubbing his penis in the region of where my vagina was and he was pretending we were having sex.

Counsel for the Appellant then said to the jury:

Now I would suggest to you that what the Complainant has disclosed there in terms of pretending to be having sex is not an attempt to engage in sexual intercourse. Having said that, if you accept her evidence that I have just read out to you, yes, I accept that that discloses an indecent assault and you would find Mr Drysdale guilty of count 3 in the alternative to count 2…


	
	The Crown submitted that the acquittal on count 2 with the conviction on count 3 meant that the Crown did not satisfy the jury at the time the Appellant committed the act described by the Complainant (thrusting his hips towards her vagina) that he intended to penetrate the Complainant’s vagina with his penis. In that way those two verdicts were not inconsistent.
	


The verdict was unreasonable


	
	The Appellant’s submission that the conviction on count 3 was inconsistent with the acquittal on count 2 must be rejected. Whilst attempted intercourse is likely to contain within it an assault with an act of indecency, proof of the latter will not necessarily be proof of the former. The Complainant’s own evidence was that the Appellant was merely pretending to have sexual intercourse with her. That evidence was sufficient to enable to the jury at least to have a doubt that the Appellant was not attempting intercourse.
	
	
	However, if the jury believed beyond reasonable doubt that the Complainant was not consenting to the act being performed by the Appellant and that he knew she was not consenting (or was reckless or had no reasonable belief in her consent) count 3 would be made out. Those two verdicts seen in isolation are not inconsistent. That was also made clear by what the Appellant’s counsel said to the jury, set out at [46] above.
	
	
	However, different considerations arise when the other acquittals are considered.
	
	
	A reading of the Complainant’s evidence and the Appellant’s evidence demonstrates clearly that the two accounts of the time in the bedroom cannot stand together. Indeed, that was precisely the point the Crown made in his final address to the jury where he said at the outset:
	


You will notice that the two versions are in fact radically different and there is not a lot of common ground between them. The evidence of [the Complainant] and the Accused cannot stand together, they can’t both be true. Somebody is lying to you.


	
	At the hearing on appeal Senior Counsel for the Crown said:
	


Whilst the accounts given by the Complainant and the accused could not possibly stand together it is to be noted that the accused’s account omitted … much of the sexual activity.


	
	The two accounts given of events in the bedroom that afternoon can be reconciled to a small degree. What are said to be counts 7 and 8 fit largely into the account of events given by the Appellant after they had lain together and talked for a short period time towards the end. What cannot be reconciled is the account of how the sexual activity commenced including the acts which were said to constitute counts 2 and 3.
	
	
	The jury either rejected the Complainant’s account of the events or had sufficient doubt about them that they could not convict on counts 1-2 and 4-8. On a case involving word against word, and where there were other problems in relation to the Complainant’s case including the evidence of Ms McHugh, the Complainant’s actions and demeanour during and after the events, and the lack of early complaint, it seems likely that the jury rejected the Complainant’s version of events.
	
	
	As the Appellant submitted, a number of matters put forward by the Complainant were inherently unlikely on the assumption that her account of a lack of consent to the acts was correct. These included the Appellant saying after he had, on the Complainant’s evidence, indecently assaulted her a number of times, “I feel that we’ve got this really strong connection”; the Complainant and Appellant lying quietly on the bed in a spooning position talking about plays they liked for about 10 minutes; that following those 10 minutes the Appellant digitally penetrated her without her consent whilst reciting lines from Macbeth; that while the Appellant was forcefully removing her clothes, squeezing her breast hard, holding her down and thrusting his hips with an erection towards her vagina she merely said to him “I think you’ve got the wrong idea”.
	
	
	Even if the jury simply had doubts about the Complainant’s version, no rational explanation can be found for the conviction on count 3 when, in particular, the jury acquitted on counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 which, on the Complainant’s description, occurred in a continuous fashion over a short period of time.
	
	
	The Crown’s explanation for the conviction in relation to count 3 should be rejected. The Appellant’s acceptance in his evidence that the Complainant said she did not want to have sex meaning penile/vaginal sexual intercourse provides no support for the conviction in relation to count 3. On the Complainant’s own evidence the Appellant accepted her refusal of penile/vaginal sexual intercourse by simply pretending to have sex with her whilst lying on top of her but not penetrating her (as she said) nor seriously attempting to penetrate her. That provides a clear explanation why the jury acquitted on count 2. It says nothing about why the jury convicted on count 3.
	
	
	To justify the conviction on count 3 the Crown submitted that the jury must have found that the Appellant knew that the Complainant did not consent to an act of “pretence sexual intercourse”. The proposition has only to be stated to be rejected. It is, in any event, inconsistent with the acquittal in relation to count 8 which involved a different form of “pretence sexual intercourse”.
	
	
	Her lack of consent was not, as the Crown appeared to accept, a refusal to engage in any form of sexual congress. It was a refusal to engage in penile/vaginal sexual intercourse. The only way the jury could have convicted on count 3 was to have accepted the Complainant’s evidence that the Appellant lay on top of her with an erection thrusting his hips towards her vagina but not to have been satisfied that immediately before that act he forced himself upon her by the forceful removal of her clothing and the grabbing and squeezing of her breasts, and not to have been satisfied that immediately thereafter he flipped her onto her stomach and inserted a finger into her vagina, and then flipped her onto her back and placed two fingers into her vagina. Finally, the jury would not have been satisfied that the Complainant was forced to masturbate the Appellant to the point of ejaculation.
	
	
	Those acts all took place together over a very short period of time and the jury acquitted in relation to all of them except, apparently, the Appellant rubbing his penis in the region of her vagina. There was nothing in that act that distinguished it from the other acts of which the Complainant alleged a lack of consent. Whether the jury rejected that the whole account by the Complainant (except the Appellant’s act of his rubbing his penis in the region of her vagina) or whether it simply had doubts about her evidence, it ought to have reached the same conclusion in relation to the act that caused the conviction on count 3.
	
	
	The absence of any objective evidence supporting the conviction in relation to Count 3 is highlighted by the acquittals in relation to the counts where both the Complainant and the Appellant are likely to be describing the same event such as counts 6, 7 and 8. The acquittals on those counts must mean that the jury at least had doubts that the Complainant was not consenting to those acts. That makes it the more difficult to understand how they could have convicted in relation to an act which the Appellant said did not happen at all during the course of the afternoon.
	
	
	The Trial Judge made a number of references in his Remarks on Sentence to the difficulties in trying to understand the jury’s verdict in this regard and in trying to find facts consistent with the jury’s verdicts which included not only the conviction verdict but the acquittal verdicts. Further, although the trial judge found that the Appellant was reckless as to the Complainant’s consent with regard to count 3 he only imposed a bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as noted earlier. There is no Crown appeal from what must be regarded as almost the most lenient sentence that could have been imposed and one that would ordinarily be considered as manifestly inadequate for an offence of the description given by the Complainant. It may be inferred from that sentence when coupled with his Honour’s remarks on sentence that he too was troubled by the verdict.
	
	
	That is a matter which can be taken into account: McCann v R [2014] NSWCCA 79 at [25]. So, too, can the length of the jury deliberations when compared with the length of the trial: McCann at [24]. In the present case the trial took 4 days and the jury deliberations took 5 days. These matters provide support for the submission that the jury verdicts are irreconcilable and were reached as a compromise.
	
	
	In my opinion, the guilty verdict on count 2 should be set aside.
	


Conclusion


	
	An issue arises, by reason of the sentence imposed on the Appellant, whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear the application for leave to appeal and, if so, what order should be made in the circumstances. Section 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides:
	


(1)  A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court:

(a)  against the person’s conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone, and

(b)  with the leave of the court, or upon the certificate of the judge of the court of trial that it is a fit case for appeal against the person’s conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal, and

(c)  with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction. (emphasis added)


	
	Section 10(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:
	


(5)  A person with respect to whom an order under this section is made has the same right to appeal on the ground that the person is not guilty of the offence as the person would have had if the person had been convicted of the offence.


	
	Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction despite the Appellant not having been convicted of the offence. Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act contemplates orders that the verdict of the jury can be set aside in cases where the verdict is unreasonable. That is the result here of the finding that the verdicts were inconsistent.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Uphold the appeal.

3. Set aside the verdict of the jury in relation to count 3 and direct a verdict of acquittal.

2766860,R v Towney; R v Simon [2015] NSWDC 218,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Pierce Towney and Tyler Simon for an armed robbery. Pierce Towney is still only 18 and Tyler Simon has just turned 19 a few months ago. They committed the armed robbery on 3 December last year. Armed robbery is a serious crime. We can tell that because parliament fixed a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment to the offence by s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	When a judge is sentencing a person, the judge has to give reasons for the sentence. That usually means that the judge has to refer to what happened in the crime and also refer to any factors personal to the offender. The judge can also refer to the victim impact statement. Obviously the judge also takes into account the evidence before the judge and the arguments presented.
	
	
	First I should start with what happened. Pierce Towney and Tyler Simon were drinking on the night of 2 December 2014. They were also taking methamphetamine. In the early hours of the following morning they went for a drive with Kym McIntosh. They went to the township of Harrington where there is the Harrington Minimart. That is operated by a family, a man and his wife. Their daughter lives with them. They open up the store early deliberately for people who want to call in and do their business early in the morning.
	
	
	When Pierce Towney and Tyler Simon were driving by they saw that there were people in the store. Pierce Towney said to Tyler Simon “That could be a quick little job.” They did not stop, but went on. They stopped for a while elsewhere and then agreed that they would go back and rob the store.
	
	
	Meanwhile, back at the store, the husband had been downstairs since a quarter past four. His wife had joined at ten to five.
	
	
	Pierce Towney and Tyler Simon arrived about 5 o’clock. Tyler Simon armed himself “with a metal tyre brace of about 25 centimetres in length”. Pierce Towney had a knife that he had taken from his home. They covered their faces with their shirts, put their hood over their heads and socks on their hands. They confronted the couple a bit after 5 o’clock. Pierce Towney pointed the knife at the man saying, “Give us the fucking money! Give us the money!” They were both at the counter, both waving their weapons. The wife started screaming for help and the man said, “I don’t have any money. Get out!”. Gamely, but perhaps unwisely, the man moved around towards them with a set of metal scales.
	
	
	Both the offenders retreated. The man threw the scales at them, but after a short distance “Towney stopped running and turned back to the victim. He held the knife in front of him and said, ‘No, fuck you, I am going to stab you.’” Tyler Simon also stopped and turned back. Pierce Towney lunged at the victim with the knife. Fortunately, he missed. There was a fight. The victim was struggling to make sure he was not stabbed. The victim ended up on his back still holding Pierce Towney’s wrist “using all of his strength to keep the knife from him as Towney tried to force it towards his face whilst punching him to the head with his other hand”.
	
	
	In the meantime Tyler Simon went back into the store. The wife was in there, obviously in a distressed state. In response to that, Tyler Simon “waved his weapon over her head and dropped it onto her shoulder. He then walked to the counter, grabbed the cash register and left the store”. The register itself was worth just under $1,000 and it contained $1,800. The couple’s daughter was woken up. She went out onto the balcony. She heard a man calling out, “I will stab you, you cunt!”
	
	
	Both men got away and drove off. The man got up from the ground “and realised he had sustained a bloodied nose, numerous abrasions to his face, legs and hands, and swelling/bruising to his face/head”.
	
	
	The offenders bought some alcohol and then split the money between them.
	
	
	Police were called to the scene and established a couple of crime scenes. On 22 December they arrested both men. Both men admitted in interviews what they had done, but each of them did not name his co-offender.
	
	
	As I said, one of the things which a judge takes into account is the impact of a crime on the victim. In this case the man involved provided a victim impact statement. It graphically illustrates the kind of impact which these crimes have on their victims. I propose to read it -
	


“The robbery and assault by the offenders at Harrington Mini Market has had a huge impact on the running of our business and a very different outlook on life. Before the robbery took place myself, my wife and our family had a relaxed look on life and felt comfortable in running our business and providing our customers an early morning opening at 4.30am in the morning to cater for early morning fishermen and workers.

This is no longer able to happen as we are trading later and our doors are fully closed to the public, only opening the doors upon identifying the customer. The doors now open at 6 o’clock as we no longer feel confident in opening any earlier while still dark. Opening early was something that we had been doing for 14 years and felt safe having our doors opened at that time every morning.

Before we start our morning, it’s now a routine that we spend time looking for anything that may be suspicious before coming downstairs to open the shop, which was not something we felt the need to do previously. It is very hard to walk downstairs to open our business as the robbery and assault is still fresh in our minds and plays a big part of our everyday living, trying to forget and get through the day without thinking back to that morning.

We have had new locks installed upstairs on the living premises as the whole family feel unsafe, which we had never worried about or felt unsafe in our own home before now.

We tend to overreact to noises, being suspicious of customer’s appearances and motives. My wife will not do the early morning opening as she is so scared of being downstairs alone. It’s a hard thing to do every morning to face opening, but we have to open the doors to make a living. Previously working the shop was something the whole family used to enjoy doing but now it is a hard task to make that effort to do so and hope you get through the day.

The robbery has had an effect on our family as we are unable to feel safe anywhere at home or at work. We have become very resilient of others around us and find it very hard to trust just anyone.

It has had an emotional impact on our financial situation as the new trading hours have had an effect on our small business. We have been trading for 14 years with our turnover declining and feel that we will have difficult times ahead in these hard economic times.”

I repeat, that illustrates the long-term impact which crimes such as these committed over a few minutes can have on the lives of other human beings.


	
	I turn now to say something about each of the offenders. Mr Towney was arrested on 22 December 2014 and has been in custody since then. His sentence will date from then. As I said, he is now 18 and will turn 19 next month. He has a criminal record. He already has a record for an armed robbery committed in April last year. He got a bond from the Children’s Court in July last year. Earlier on he had committed an aggravated break, enter and steal. In February of 2009 he had received a bond for that as well. I should add that when he committed this crime, Pierce Towney was on conditional liberty. He had been on parole since 23 August 2014.
	
	
	There is a pre-sentence report prepared by Corrective Services (Community Corrections) which said that when he was being supervised by Juvenile Justice his response to supervision was unsatisfactory. He noted a dysfunctional upbringing and that his parents’ relationship “was marred by alcohol and cannabis abuse”. In recent years domestic violence also became an issue between his parents, who separated about three years ago. Pierce Towney moved to Moree where his father lived. He came back to Taree in 2014 but started getting involved in binge drinking and heavy drug use and mixing with people who were also committing crimes. He stopped school midway through year 10 but has been studying whilst he has been in detention. He started alcohol and cannabis when he was 13, then went onto heroin and methamphetamines more recently.
	
	
	Mr Towney has had some psychological assistance whilst he was in juvenile detention. He understood that his crime was related to getting money for his drug habit. He expressed remorse to the authors of the report “and verbalised some insight into his offence, acknowledging the correlation between his drug dependence and his current circumstances.” Mr Towney said that he was prepared to get some help. The author of the report thought that his time in adult gaol “appears to have been the catalyst for some insight into” his criminal behaviour.
	
	
	Helpfully Ms J Crofts, who appears for Mr Towney, obtained a psychological report from a clinical psychologist, Miriam Wyzenbeek. She recorded some of the same information as the pre-sentence report did, but she also added that Pierce Towney had been helping around the home since his mid-teenage years because his mother had had a stroke. That was one of the reasons he moved back in 2014. Ms Wyzenbeek noted Pierce Towney’s account that he had “grown up surrounded by alcohol, drug use and crime”. He said that “both parents consumed alcohol on a regular to daily basis and both parents smoked cannabis daily.” Both parents have spent time in custody.
	
	
	As to Mr Towney’s drug habit, he had an addiction to methamphetamine which cost about $350 a day when he committed this crime. He said that he would not take drugs when he was released, but was ambivalent about whether or not he would take alcohol. The psychologist noted that he “did not demonstrate remorse towards his prior criminal activities and he tended to minimise the seriousness of these crimes by explaining them as primarily being property related and thus to his mind, victim-free”. That is one of the reasons that I have read out in full the victim impact statement. Ms Wyzenbeek noted that Mr Towney “expressed ambivalence and reluctance to participate in an intervention program directed at addressing his offending”. She thought that he would need “motivational interviewing”.    
	
	
	It is obvious, as the psychologist observes, that the drug problem is directly related to his crimes. She thought it was very important for him to participate in some form of assistance when he was released. There are a number of factors Ms Wyzenbeek pointed out which suggests that he is at high risk of re-offending. She recommended some programmes in custody which might assist, such as the Gurnang life challenge programme and Getting SMART.
	
	
	Ms Crofts called her client to give evidence. He confirmed the reason for going back to Taree in 2014 was to help with his mother. He remains in touch with his father by phone, except recently when there has been some miscommunication and loss of contact probably because of a changed number or a malfunctioning phone. He acknowledged feeling bad about what he had done and the effect on the victim. Mr Towney said that he is not taking drugs in custody and that he is probably the youngest at the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre, or one of the youngest, where he is currently in custody. He wants to stay away from Taree and the influences on him there.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Mr A Baker, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, he acknowledged his history of drug use and said that whilst he was in Moree with his father he did not commit crimes apart from continuing to take drugs. He said that prison is full of violence but he was ambivalent in cross-examination about whether or not he would stop taking alcohol when he is released.
	
	
	Turning to Tyler Simon, he has a far more extensive criminal record. He turned nineteen a few months ago. His criminal record includes an aggravated break, enter and steal, car theft, again more aggravated break, enter and steal, larceny, stealing from a dwelling house, assault and property damage. He received control orders from the Children's Court regarding a lot of these offences and has spent time in juvenile custody. He was also engaged in a police pursuit in 2014.
	
	
	Mr M Giles, who appeared for Tyler Simon, also pointed to the pre-sentence report that had been prepared for his client. He had been raised by his grandparents since he was about a year old. Much of his life he has not had contact with his parents. He moved out of his grandparents’ home in about October last year and went back to the Taree area. He was expelled from year 6 and did not undertake secondary education at all, which has obviously impacted on his literacy and numeracy skills. He had one job for a few months but, to his credit, has been employed whilst in prison in the furniture industry sector and was described as a good worker. He wants to keep working when he is released.
	
	
	Mr Simon too has a history of drug and alcohol use. He started cannabis when he was as young as eight and was drinking daily from the age of twelve. He explained that “he was supplied those substances by criminal family members and older peers”. He added that “his family would ‘use’ him to commit crime during his formative years, the proceeds of which subsequently funded their addictions”. He remained abstinent from drugs whilst he was in juvenile detention but on his return to Taree he was introduced to methamphetamine “again by family members”. By the time he committed this crime he was using that drug about three times a week. He attempted residential treatment in 2011 but discharged himself. He also had a gambling problem.
	
	
	Mr Simon was diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder when he was nine and conduct disorder, not to mention the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He had support from his grandmother and “was case managed by an extensive psychiatric and paediatric team to address his deteriorating and concerning violent and antisocial behaviour,” but he said that “as soon as he ceased school and commenced using substances, he failed to adhere to his medication regime or attend follow up appointments”.
	
	
	He said that “most of his friends and family are now in custody”. He wants to spend time with his partner when he is released. She is regarded as a positive influence. The author of the report thought that Mr Simon’s “attitude remains antisocial and he has advised of no desire, or indeed intention, to engage with community treatment providers”.
	
	
	Mr Giles tendered a report from the respected forensic psychiatric Dr Richard Furst. Dr Furst obtained much of the same history but noted “a wish to enter a rehabilitation centre in the future, if possible”. He acknowledged feeling sorry for what he had done. Dr Furst thought that Tyler Simon appeared “to be somewhat institutionalised and conduct disordered”. Dr Furst diagnosed Tyler Simon with a substance use disorder, being alcohol and amphetamines, a conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, an acquired brain injury and perhaps borderline intellectual function. He noted the “dysfunctional family” and thought that he was subject to childhood abuse and neglect. He recommended that drug and alcohol counselling be provided in custody and he thought that he was “a good candidate for a custody-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs/anger management programs”. Dr Furst suggested EQUIPS. He thought that Mr Simon was at a high risk of re-offending and will require additional community support including structured drug and alcohol counselling when he is released. He has the support of his partner and his grandparents and Dr Furst noted that Tyler Simon “wants to work in the future and was open to engaging in further rehabilitation”. Dr Furst observed that the “risk of re-offending could be reduced to some degree if he adheres to the treatment recommendations outlined”. It would include remaining abstinent from alcohol and drugs over the long term.
	
	
	Mr Giles called his client to give evidence as well. He emphasised his early plea of guilty. Tyler Simon acknowledged that he did not read or write well and that the taking of illegal drugs will cause him more trouble with the police. He said that he is prepared to go to rehabilitation on parole and referred specifically to Balund-a and Yetta Dhinnakkal at Brewarrina. It seems to me, from enquiries I asked my associate to make, that the programme at Balund-a would not be appropriate because it is for offenders on parole, but the programme at Yetta Dhinnakkal at Brewarrina may well be an option. He expressed a desire to undergo that programme and then he wanted to return to his grandparents’ to live. He too expressed sorrow for what he had done and to the victims. He acknowledged that he needs to stay away from illegal drugs and that he is being supported by his partner.
	
	
	When cross-examined by Mr Baker he acknowledged his gambling problem. The debts he incurred were mainly related to his drugs. He left the earlier residential rehabilitation programme because an uncle had died and was not able to get back in. He acknowledged that he is not taking any medication for the conditions that he was diagnosed as suffering from and would be prepared to take them now. Mr Giles obtained evidence from him to the effect that he had probably been misunderstood about not wanting to do rehabilitation.
	


HIS HONOUR: Gentlemen, just whilst I think of it, the psychiatric report for Mr Simon and the psychological report for Mr Towney - sorry, Ms Crofts and Mr Scott, Corrective Services make it very clear that material like that is very helpful for them in the classification of inmates. I usually direct that they be sent to a fax number or e-mail address that my associate knows so that the classification process can be assisted by the authorities having those. Sometimes they are sent with them into prison. But I don't do it without you getting instructions. So when I have finished the remarks on sentence, you may wish to, because they should be listening to what I am saying, get some instructions. Some people don't want that material around but I would strongly recommend it because the Corrective Services have made it very clear that they don't have access to that sort of material. They get my remarks on sentence eventually and they get the presentence report but not the sort of material that I’m referring to which contains history, diagnoses, professional opinions about them which are of a great help.


	
	I was assisted by Ms Crofts, Mr Giles and Mr Baker in their submissions about how I sentence these young men. All acknowledged two things. One is that they had to spend more time in fulltime custody. I agree with that. There is no choice about that, given the seriousness of their crime. The second common theme was that the guideline judgment given by the Court of Criminal Appeal for armed robbery in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 was relevant. The guideline in that case delivered by the Chief Justice at 380 ([165]) said that sentences for armed robbery offences of a particular type “should generally fall between four and five years for the full term”. His Honour had identified earlier (at [162]) common features of armed robbery offences which come before the courts.
	
	
	Mr Baker commenced his submissions by helpfully addressing those factors, including some additional factors referred to by the Chief Justice at [170]. In respect of Mr Towney, Mr Baker emphasised that Mr Towney in regard to point (i) had two serious previous offences but fairly acknowledged that there is a valid question as to the meaning of the expression “little criminal history”. The other factors were fairly standard, with the exception of factor (iv) which referred to little, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof.
	
	
	In Mr Towney’s case, there was a lot more than limited actual violence. I am very aware here that I am not sentencing Mr Towney for a robbery with wounding, a more serious offence. Although the victim was injured, it was not regarded as a wounding and does not fall into that category. I am also aware that I am not sentencing him for an attempted wounding with intent which is also a more serious offence but what I am sentencing him for is the actual violence involved in threatening and physically assaulting the victim of the crime with a knife in his hand. The victim sustained some actual bodily harm, falling short of a wounding and falling short of grievous bodily harm. These are factors which make it more serious than the standard case or the common case referred to in the guideline judgment. Additionally, Mr Towney was not alone: there were two offenders, and the effect on the victims was significant. I take that into account, appreciating that the victim impact statement was not verified but it, as I said, is not at all unusual for that to be a consequence of an armed robbery.
	
	
	So far as Mr Simon is concerned, Mr Baker pointed to his very lengthy criminal record which certainly did not classify as “no or little criminal history”.
	
	
	I return to Mr Towney. In his case, but not in Mr Simon’s case, Mr Towney was on conditional liberty for a very similar offence. Mr Baker suggested that the sentences should be at the high end of the Henry range, bearing in mind the features of Mr Towney’s offending involving the assaulting behaviour with the knife, the company and the conditional liberty. In Mr Simon’s case, he had an extensive criminal record and was in company. They shared the funds between them. Arguably, said Mr Baker, they should receive the same sentence. Mr Baker argued that their remorse was limited by a strong prosecution case. He also argued that Mr Towney’s prospects of rehabilitation could not be described as “good” and therefore attract that as a mitigating factor. He reminded me of what Simpson J had said in the Henry guideline judgment about demonstrated rehabilitation. He thought that the special circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio between a non-parole period and a full sentence were limited.
	
	
	In respect of Mr Simon, Mr Baker fairly acknowledged that, despite serving other sentences and an available starting date of this sentence as later this year, it would be fair to commence his sentence from 22 April 2015, and in due course I will do that.
	
	
	For her client, Ms Crofts emphasised his early plea and acknowledged the aggravating feature of being in company and the extent of the actual violence involved. She drew my attention to the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission and she emphasised the insight which her client has into the relationship between taking drugs and offending behaviour. She pointed out that her client is prepared to undertake rehabilitation and that this is his first time in adult custody. Dealing with Mr Baker’s submission about whether her client’s prospects could be described as “good”, she addressed that very comprehensively, arguing that her client had demonstrated some remorse and insight, and that he had had the mixed benefit of having six months in adult custody to appreciate what it was like. Her client was using the time to work in custody, which was a good sign, and had positive plans for his release including more education. She submitted that the progress was demonstrated. Whilst any of those alone may not be regarded as demonstrating good prospects, together she argued that they are. I think there is some force in her submission, and on balance I would find in her favour.
	
	
	Mr Giles again emphasised his client’s early plea and the remorse expressed. He drew my attention to evidence about his client’s intellectual functioning and acknowledged the use of the tyre lever was serious but pointed out that his client wants to undergo rehabilitation.
	
	
	Both offenders, I should add, are from indigenous backgrounds and I need to take that into account in the way that the authorities have said that it can. Both of them are obviously from backgrounds which have affected them as boys and young men and brought them to where they are now. In particular, in Mr Simon’s case it seems that he was introduced to illegal activity as a youngster.
	
	
	Both Ms Crofts and Mr Giles argue that there were special circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio between a non-parole period and a full sentence. Normally that is for three-quarters. That is, an offender must spend 75 per cent of his or her sentence in fulltime custody and 25 per cent on parole. In Mr Towney’s case there were the good prospects of rehabilitation which I have reluctantly, but I think correctly on balance, found and the fact that he must be given an opportunity as a young person to rehabilitate himself. It is also his first time in adult custody, which I think is a factor relevant for me to take into account. Mr Giles emphasised his client’s age, background and his need for drug rehabilitation.
	
	
	I come now to the sentences which I need to impose. I think, given what I have described, that both sentences should be the same. Mr Towney was more violent but Mr Simon was still armed with the tyre lever which he assaulted, even though not seriously, one of the victims with. Both men were in each other’s company. Mr Towney was on conditional liberty but Mr Simon had a lengthy and serious criminal record. Both men shared the proceeds. However, I also accept Mr Baker’s submission that the seriousness of these offences lies at the high end of the scale for the guideline judgment. I regard the appropriate sentence in each case as being one of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	I do propose to accept the submissions that there are good reasons to adjust the non-parole period down from the normal 75 per cent. I propose to fix a non-parole period of two and a half years in each case. That means that each young man must spend two and a half years in fulltime gaol but then can spend two and a half years in the community continuing with the rehabilitation that they hopefully have commenced whilst in prison.
	
	
	Pierce Towney, I convict you of the offence of armed robbery. I sentence you to five years in prison. That will commence on 22 December 2014 and expire on 21 December 2019. I fix a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 21 December 2014 and to expire on 21 May 2017. I recommend to the Commissioner of Corrective Services that consideration be given to your participating in the Yetta Dhinnakkal programme at Brewarrina.
	
	
	Tyler Simon, I convict you of the offence of armed robbery and I sentence you to five years imprisonment. That will commence on 22 April 2015 and will expire on 21 April 2020. I fix a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 22 April 2015 and to expire on 21 October 2017. I also recommend to the Commissioner for Corrective Services that consideration be given to you participating in the Yetta Dhinnakkal programme at Brewarrina whilst you are in custody.
	


HIS HONOUR: A number of things. First, and take time all of you, (1) have I made all the formal orders that I need to make? (2) Please check the mathematics. Each of you, separately, check the mathematics and then by all means compare notes and tell me if there’s any errors. (3) Ms Crofts and Mr Scott, if you would get instructions on sending the documents. I do not fix parole, do I?

BAKER: It’s over three years.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Crofts, you're on your feet.

CROFTS: I am, your Honour, if I may, just in respect of the mathematics for my client. I believe your Honour may have misspoken. You started my client’s non-parole period on 21 December when it should have been 22 December.

HIS HONOUR: You are right.


	
	The non-parole period for Mr Towney commenced 22 December 2014 and expires 21 May 2017.
	


CROFTS: That’s the second point, your Honour. It’s with regret to my client but your Honour did say a non-parole period of two and a half years, so I believe it should be 21 June, a month later.

HIS HONOUR: You are quite right.


	
	Mr Towney’s non-parole period will expire on 21 June 2017.
	


CROFTS: I should point out I’m very happy to be wrong about that but that’s my maths.

HIS HONOUR: No, no, thank you. You are quite right and that is consistent with your duty to the Court. I make it clear to the offenders and the members of their family that you have a duty to the Court in that regard and I thank you for discharging that.

CROFTS: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It would have been picked up anyway sooner or later.

CROFTS: Of course, your Honour, yes. Other than that, your Honour, I am content with those orders. In respect of the report, your Honour, I have sought instructions. My client would not like his report to be faxed. I realise I don't have to give a reason but I will just in the sense that he is a young man and in giving that report he said certain things on the expectation it would only be used in this forum.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, it what?

CROFTS: He said certain things on the expectation he was told it would only be used for the purposes of sentencing.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROFTS: And the wider implications of letting Corrective Services know all the material that’s in there is not a decision he is prepared to make at this time.

HIS HONOUR: I understand. That’s why I offer the choice.

CROFTS: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Scott?

SCOTT: Your Honour, in relation to Mr Simon, I’ve conferred with Mr Crown and we’ve got no issue with the orders and the dates. We believe that is correct.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you.

SCOTT: In relation to the report of Mr Simon, he has no objection to that going to the Department of Corrective Services.

HIS HONOUR: All right, thank you. I will direct my associate to send the report. You are for Mr Simon, so in your case the report will be Dr Furst, a copy of exhibit 2, my associate will send to Corrective Services in respect of Mr Simon. My orders will contain the recommendation for Yetta Dhinnakkal as well.

CROFTS: Thank you, your Honour.


	
	Pierce Towney and Tyler Simon, you have committed a very serious crime together, which is why you have got five years. I have given the reasons and explained it, which I have to do. You are familiar with that, judges and magistrates giving reasons. It is a big sentence for young men like you but you committed a very serious crime, and you heard what I read out, the impact that it had on the victims to your crime. But instead of fixing your non-parole period at three-quarters, I have fixed it at half that, two and a half years. So that, Pierce Towney, you are eligible for release on 21 June 2017 and, Tyler Simon, you are eligible for release on 21 October 2017. Do you understand? Okay. That is because your sentences started at different dates. Whether you get released is up to the Parole Authority, not me. Okay? Now, perhaps what the most significant thing I have done is recommend that, if possible, that they refer you to this Yetta Dhinnakkal in custody which may well help you in dealing with issues and may well get you onto the straight and narrow. It looks to me, looking around the Court, that you have got a lot of family support here behind you and that, plus these programmes in custody, I am hoping will get you back on the straight and narrow. But you have got to serve the time for what you did. That was very serious and it is up to you two now to sort that out. Do you understand?
	


HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else?

SCOTT: No, your Honour.

CROFTS: No, your Honour.

		28 September 2015",2015-06-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766863,Nash v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWDC 144,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff by statement of claim filed on 7 May 2013 brings proceedings for damages for unlawful arrest (paragraphs 3 to 7 of the statement of claim), assault and battery (paragraphs 8 and 9 of the statement of claim) and malicious prosecution (paragraphs 11 to 16 of the statement of claim) arising out of the circumstances in which he was arrested on 13 October 2011 and charged with two offences:
	



	
	Driving under the influence of alcohol / drugs pursuant to s 12 Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW); and
	
	
	Resisting an officer in execution of duty pursuant to s 546C Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	



	
	These proceedings were heard in the Gosford Registry of the District Court on 10, 11 and 12 November 2014. That was insufficient time to complete both evidence and submissions. The proceedings were stood over for the parties’ submissions to 11 February 2015. As the parties did not make submissions on quantum on that occasion, further submissions on damages were made on 23 March and 28 April 2015.
	
	
	The plaintiff claims damages, including aggravated damages and exemplary damages, for each of the causes of action (see paragraphs 17 to 18 of the statement of claim). I shall first set out each of these causes of action and the defences pleaded.
	


Unlawful arrest


	
	The particulars of the unlawful arrest are as follows:
	


“4.3 The officer tackled the plaintiff and attempted to coerce him to the ground.

4.4 The officer pinned the plaintiff to the ground using his knees.

4.5 The officer threatened the plaintiff with capsicum spray and handcuffs.”


	
	The statement of claim pleads that the arrest in question commenced with Senior Constable Michael Hicks calling out to the plaintiff from his vehicle words to the effect that he was under arrest. (Compliance with s 201 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) (“LEPRA”)) is an issue raised on behalf of the plaintiff). Senior Constable Hicks then entered the plaintiff’s premises at Bellevue Street, Shelly Beach, NSW, took hold of the plaintiff with the view of restraining him (paragraph 3.3 of the defence) and, because the plaintiff allegedly “hurried away from the officer, tried to evade and escape the officer and resisted the officer” (paragraph 3.4 of the defence) tackled the plaintiff to the ground.
	
	
	The defendant claims that at the time of these events occurring, the officer did not know that this was the plaintiff’s home address (defence, paragraph 3.1).
	


Assault and battery


	
	The plaintiff particularises the assault and battery in question occurring on 13 October 2011 as follows:
	


“9.3 One act of assault was the officer grabbing the plaintiff.

9.4 One act of assault was the office tackling the plaintiff.

9.5 One act of assault was the officer pinning the plaintiff to the ground using his knees.

9.6 One act of assault was the officer threatening the plaintiff was capsicum spray and handcuffs.”


	
	The defendant’s pleading responds:
	


“7. In response to the particulars set out at paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim, the Defendant:

7.1 admits that the Plaintiff was arrested at [address], Shelly Beach, NSW although denies that the officer knew this to be the Plaintiff’s home address,

7.2 admits that the arrest occurred at around 6:45pm on 13 October 2011,

7.3 admits that the officer took hold of the Plaintiff and tried to prevent the Plaintiff from moving away and that a scuffle resulted,

7.4 admits that the Plaintiff was taken to the ground by the officer,

7.5 says that the officer was lawfully justified in his actions and that only reasonable force was used, and

otherwise denies the paragraph.”


	
	Additionally, the defendant denies that the plaintiff suffered any injury, loss and damage as alleged (paragraph 8 of the defence).
	


Malicious prosecution


	
	It is not in dispute that the plaintiff was charged with the offences as set out above, and that the charges were dismissed by the Wyong Local Court on 18 May 2012. The facts relied upon for absence of reasonable and probable cause are identified in the statement of claim as follows:
	


“14.1 The facts alleged in prosecution of the charges did not satisfy the elements of the charges.

14.2 The facts alleged in the prosecution of the charge [sic] were not the true facts.

14.3 The police officer referred to in paragraph 4.2 was aware the plaintiff had not committed a criminal offence.”


	
	The facts relied upon to establish malice are pleaded as follows:
	


“15.1 Instigating the said prosecution other than for the dominant purpose of upholding the criminal law.

15.2 Maintaining and continuing the said prosecution other than for the dominant purpose of upholding the criminal law.”


	
	Particulars, including a claim for special damages (parts of which was abandoned at the hearing), are set out at paragraph 16.
	
	
	The defendant’s denial is set out at paragraphs 10 to 14 of the defence. The defendant additionally pleads, in relation to each of the claims, the following facts:
	


“17.1 the officer was lawfully entitled to require the Plaintiff to undergo a breath test in accordance with section 13(1) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act (NSW) 1999 [sic],

17.2 The officer activated the lights and sirens of the police vehicle to signal to the Plaintiff to stop the vehicle, pursuant to section 13(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act (NSW) 1999 [sic],

17.3 The Plaintiff was aware of the presence of the officer, or the officer reasonably believed that the Plaintiff was aware of his presence, at all times,

17.4 The Plaintiff failed to stop his vehicle and/or attempted to evade the officer.”


	
	The defendant relies upon s 99(2) of LEPRA and identifies the offences that Senior Constable Hicks believed the plaintiff had committed were driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or any other drug in breach of s 12, and resisting an officer while in execution of his duty pursuant to s 58 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Additionally, the defendant relies upon s 99(3) of LEPRA, s 6 Police Act 1990 (NSW) and ss 230 and 231 of LEPRA (paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 of the defence respectively).
	


Preliminary observations


	
	Claims for damages arising out of arrests by the police often arise where police officers have to make split-second decisions based on the visual evidence before them: McIntosh v Webster (1980) 43 FLR 112 at 123, cited in Woodley v Boyd [2001] NSWCA 35 at [37] by Heydon JA. The factual scenario may demonstrate police being called to a scene by concerned third parties and/or in circumstances of danger, poor visibility, urgency or injury to persons or property.
	
	
	None of those factors were present here. This is relevant in terms of the plaintiff’s complaint as to the speed, lack of warning and lack of explanation for his actions given by Senior Constable Hicks.
	
	
	Similarly, the location in which events take place may be a relevant factor. Police may be given a greater degree of latitude when making decisions if the events occur in a dark or dangerous location.
	
	
	The location of these events is significant, for three reasons. First, the very short distance between the Shelly Beach Golf Club, which Senior Constable Hicks observed the plaintiff’s car to pull out from, and the plaintiff’s home (approximately 150 metres away) is relevant to the issue of how much prior warning the plaintiff had that he was being followed (the questions of when the lights and sirens were activated, and how far the plaintiff was into the familiar routine of parking at his home when this occurred, are also important). Second, these events took place in the quiet suburban street where the plaintiff and his wife live, and not in a place where danger was at any appreciable level. Third, these events occurred at approximately 6.30 pm and Exhibit B shows that they all occurred in daylight, in circumstances of clear visibility, which is a relevant factor in relation to the accuracy of the witnesses to the events.
	
	
	The physical characteristics of the plaintiff and defendant are also of relevance when determining disputed issues arising from the evidence concerning the circumstances in which Senior Constable Hicks wrestled the plaintiff to the ground.
	
	
	The plaintiff at the time of arrest was a 53-year-old real estate agent and a member of the Shelly Beach Golf Club, the premises from which he travelled to his home on the night in question. As the medical evidence (see Exhibit 5 and Exhibit J) notes, he is a middle age man who looks his age, but was “a fit and healthy man before the incident” (report of Professor Dennerstein, page 9). As Exhibit B shows, on the day of these events, he was neatly attired and looked like the professional businessman that he was. The plaintiff had visited the golf club to find out his seeding and scheduled play-off time for the golf club championship the following weekend.
	
	
	The premises at which these events occurred were the family home which the plaintiff shared with his wife of many years, and a property they had owned for approximately 10 years. The location of their home in a quiet family suburb is of some limited relevance.
	
	
	The defendant had been a member of the NSW Police Force for approximately 12 years (T 154) and agreed that he was younger, taller and fitter than the plaintiff (T 188). To my observation, when he was in the witness box, Senior Constable Hicks was well over 6 feet tall, and powerfully muscled. When I saw him sitting in the same witness box as that in which the plaintiff had given evidence, the difference between them, in size and fitness was immediately apparent. I also note that a neighbour of the plaintiff who witnessed the arrest described Senior Constable Hicks in the Local Court proceedings as “a big policeman” who “jumped out” of his car and “pursued” the plaintiff.
	
	
	As a trained observer, Senior Constable Hicks would have taken into account the plaintiff’s size, age and apparent respectability of appearance (T 188 – 9) when determining the degree of force necessary to arrest him.
	


The circumstances of the plaintiff’s arrest


	
	On the day in question, Senior Constable Hicks had commenced duty at 3:00pm. By 6:30pm, three and a half hours later, he had breathalysed a number of motorists without any positive result (T 154-155).
	
	
	At 6:30pm, when the plaintiff left the golf club and walked to his car and drove out, Senior Constable Hicks, who was driving a yellow fully marked police vehicle in a northerly direction along Grandview Street (namely in the opposite direction) passed, on the inside lane, a vehicle making a right hand turn into Bonnyview Street (T 192). It was during this manoeuvre that Senior Constable Hicks observed the plaintiff’s red Holden Commodore at the intersection coming from the golf club car park. He continued north along Grandview Street, intending to make a U-turn and pursue the plaintiff’s vehicle. He could not however do so immediately due to the presence of a series of vehicles coming in the opposite direction (T 195), including a taxi which had come from a parked position in Grandview Street (T 185). By that time the plaintiff’s vehicle had entered Bonnyview Street and driven a distance of less than 100 metres to the intersection of Bellevue Street, which meant he was between 40 and 50 metres from his home at this time.
	
	
	The plaintiff turned left into Bellevue Street and drove 40 to 50 metres to his home, turning to the driveway and parking his vehicle outside a double garage. Although the precise time that Senior Constable Hicks activated the sirens which automatically operated the in-car video and flashing lights on the police vehicle was hotly contested, it is clear from the in-car video (Exhibit B and T 156) that he was never sufficiently close to the plaintiff’s vehicle to be able to request the plaintiff to pull over. Indeed, the plaintiff’s vehicle is not visible on Exhibit B at all until it is stopped in the plaintiff’s driveway, at which time the plaintiff was entering his home by the side gate. This must mean that the plaintiff had already entered his home street at the time that Senior Constable Hicks activated the lights and sirens, and was traversing the 50 metres to his home when that event occurred.
	
	
	Mr Quickenden submits, and I accept, that the lights and sirens activation, even allowing for the gap between the activating of the lights and sirens by Senior Constable Hicks and the sound being picked up by the in-car video, could not have been turned on until the plaintiff was within seconds of turning into his own driveway.
	
	
	The siren alerted a neighbour across the road, Mr Robert Ford, as well as the plaintiff’s wife who was at home. It was unexpected, and both looked out from their respective upstairs windows. Mr Ford gave evidence at the Local Court proceedings as follows:
	


“Q. Could you tell her Honour what you observed in relation to the matter that we’re here about today?

A. I wasn’t long home from work. I work at Thornleigh at the end of the freeway and I was sitting down in the lounge room and I heard a siren which I immediately knew as a police car not an ambulance or a fire engine. I thought that’s very unusual because we’ve got a very quiet street, Bellevue Street so I stood up. And then I noticed my neighbour’s car pull into the driveway and he got out of – out of the car, went to the side of his house through the gate and started to walk down towards the back of his house. And then a yellow police car arrived and a big policeman jumped out and pursued my neighbour down the side of the house and he--

Q. The neighbour is the defendant--

A. Bernard, yes. And he – he grabbed him in a bit of a bear hug and I observed my neighbour putting his arm up and of course I thought to myself, god, what’s he done? Is he – you know, is he – you know, I’m going of course – I’m going – anyway I know exactly where it was because if you stand up, I’m on the second floor and you look down, there’s two windows on the side of Bernard’s house and the policeman grabbed him under the second window which was about maybe one or two paces from the corner of the house, and I was going god, I was you know a bit jumpy and I immediately rang a friend of mine and said, “What should I do,” and he said --

Q. Well I’ll stop you there, only because it’s not relevant your Honour. Did you observe the defendant moving from his car towards the gate?

A. Yes, I saw him move with the car.

Q. How did he move?

A. Well he left the car and walked to the gate, opened the gate and walked down the side.

Q. Any suggestion that he was running?

A. No, he might have been walking you know, at a good gait but he wasn’t certainly running.

PEARCE: Yes, nothing further your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Any questions in cross-examination?

Q. Yes, you say that you’d heard the siren which – that’s what first attracted your attention?

A. Because I’ve lived in that street for nearly 11 years and I don’t think I’ve ever heard a police car siren.

Q. You heard the siren and that--

A. Yes.

Q. --attracted your attention?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that when you stood up?

A. Yes, straight away.

Q. You’re in the lounge room?

A. Yes I was.

Q. What made you look out the front window?

A. Well I wanted to see what the police car was doing in my street.

Q. Okay, and--

A. Because it’s only a very small street.

Q. --was that, you stood up and then you saw Mr Nash’s car pull in his driveway?A. Yes.

Q. And did you take your eyes off that car, did you look up the street to see where the sirens--

A. No.

Q. --were coming from?

A. No.

Q. So you’re watching Mr Nash?

A. Well I just saw the car, this all happened in a very short period of time and I – and then he got out of his car and as I said, went through the gate, went down the back and then he’d no sooner been through the gate then the police car pulled up.

Q. Thank you, if you just answer my question.

A. Sorry, I thought I was.

Q. You saw Mr Nash get out of his car?

A. Yes.

Q. And he walked towards the side gate?

A. Yes.

Q. He didn’t actually go through the side gate because the police car had pulled up by then, haven’t they?

A. I wouldn’t have thought so. I – I – no, no because he – he was walking down the side of his house and as I said, I know exactly where the policeman got him because he grabbed him in the bear hug and – because it was right under the – the last window.

…

PROSECUTOR: My only question is, and I put it to--

…

Q. --Mr Ford that Mr Nash didn’t go through the side gate?

A. Well I don’t know how he can get around the gate, but I – I observed him the same as I’m looking at you, it’s as clear as that. Don’t forget I’m looking down so I’ve got a very, very clear and precise picture of what happened and he went through the gate and was walking down the side when the policeman came after him and he grabbed him at the – right under the second window. That’s how I knew exactly where he grabbed him.”


	
	This transcript was tendered by agreement, as Mr Ford is now deceased. This means there can be no evidence as to what prompted him to telephone for advice about what to do. Although this evidence was not permitted in the Local Court, it would have been relevant to these proceedings. The fact that Mr Ford told the Local Court he was “going god, I was you know a bit jumpy and I immediately rang a friend of mine and said, “What should I do”” is an indication of the speed and ferocity of Senior Constable Hicks’ actions.
	
	
	On turning his vehicle into the plaintiff’s driveway, Senior Constable Hicks called out to the plaintiff saying, “just here sir” and “you’re under arrest”. While there is some dispute about how far along the side of the plaintiff’s house he was at the time, it is clear that the plaintiff was on his own property.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks jumped out of the police vehicle and ran towards the plaintiff, placing him under what Mr Ford called a “bear hug”, with the intention of controlling him to require him to undergo a breath test (T 212). He continued to tell the plaintiff that he was “under arrest”.
	
	
	The transcript of the in-car video is as follows:
	


“Hicks: Just here sir

Hicks: I said just here

Hicks: You’re under arrest, you’re under arrest

Nash: What are you doing?

Hicks: You’re under arrest

Nash: What do you mean I am…?

Hicks: You’re under arrest

Hicks: Whose house is this

Nash: This is private property

Hicks: Whose house is this

Nash: Mine

Hicks: Show me your licence… You must be kidding me

Nash: This is my house

Hicks: You’re under arrest mate

Nash: You just assaulted me, ai.

Hicks: I said you’re under arrest

Nash: [untranscribable]

Hicks: Stand there and show me your driver’s licence

Nash: [untranscribable]

Hicks: Whose house is this?

Nash: Mine… This is my house

Hicks: Thank you

Nash: This is my house… This is my house … [untranscrible] with me.

Hicks: [untranscribable]”


	
	Mrs Nash came onto the scene less than a minute after the arrival of Senior Constable Hicks. Her evidence of events, which is not challenged, identifies him as not only having overpowered her husband physically, but of being “really angry” and “yelling”:
	


“Q.  When you say the back of the house, where were you when you saw something?

A.  I'd gone down the side ‑ like through the gate down the side and to the ‑ to the back corner of the house and as soon as I got to where the side of the house finishes, that's when I saw the policeman and Bernard.

Q.  You saw the policeman and Bernie, did you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How long was it from the time you saw the police vehicle until the time you was the policeman and Bernie?

A.  Less than a minute.  30 seconds maybe.  40 seconds.  Less than a minute.

Q.  What did you see?

A.  A police man had one arm round Bernard's throat and had pulled Bernard's arm up his ‑ up the back.

Q.  What positions were they in?

A.  They were standing up.

Q.  Did you hear any conversation at that point?

A.  When I came around the side, I could hear a man yelling that I didn't ‑ it wasn't Bernard and then I ‑ as I got around to the thing, the policeman yelled at me sort of‑‑

Q.  You'll have to say, to the best of your recollection, what he said but before that, you said that when you came around the side you heard a man yelling.  You knew it wasn't Bernard's voice.  Is that correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  What was the person saying when you say he was yelling?

A.  I think it was, ""You're under arrest"" or‑‑

Q.  You think, yes.  Is that all you can remember?

A.  About that until he spoke to me.

Q.  Then you were approaching them, were you?

A.  Well, I'd walked around and then I sort of was a bit stunned to see what I was seeing and the policeman then said to me ‑ or I think Bernard might have said, ""Can you tell this guy who I am?"" and then the policeman said ‑ he sort of yelled it at me, ""Do you know this man and does he live here?"" and I said, ""Yes, I know him, he's my husband and, yeah, he lives here"".

Q.  Did you notice anything about the police officer at that point?

A.  He just looked really angry.

Q.  What makes you say that?

A.  Well, because he was yelling at me.  I think a couple of times he said ‑ you know, I thought maybe he didn't believe me but he ‑ he sort of said that twice and he just looked angry.

Q.  What else did you observe?  What did you observe after that?

A.  The policeman sort of tripped him to the ground and put his knee in his back and just said, ""You're under arrest.  You're under my control.  You're under my control"", he just kept repeating that.” (T 128-129)


	
	By the time she was at the scene, both the plaintiff and Senior Constable Hicks were in the backyard close to the back western corner of the property. It is clear, from her description of what was said, that Senior Constable Hicks had not yet told the plaintiff what he was under arrest for.
	
	
	Mrs Nash told Senior Constable Hicks that she was the plaintiff’s wife and Senior Constable Hicks acknowledges that he then “thought” the plaintiff must therefore be at his residence (T 218). He then tripped the plaintiff to cause the plaintiff to fall to the ground so that he could put his weight on him, including putting his knees onto the plaintiff’s back, so that he could control the plaintiff (T 217). He believed the plaintiff was trying to get into his house on the property and he wanted to resist his efforts to do so (T 217).
	
	
	The conversation which occurred between Senior Constable Hicks and the plaintiff once they were out of range of the recording in the vehicle is in issue. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff’s wife went to the motor vehicle and obtained the plaintiff’s driver’s licence. After Senior Constable Hicks looked at the licence, which included a photograph of the plaintiff (T 166-164), he released the plaintiff from the ground.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks still had not informed the plaintiff why he was under arrest:
	


“Q.  Did you respond to that?

A.  I said, ""Who's this person?"".

Q.  Did she respond to your question?

A.  She said, ""That's my husband"".

Q.  Was Mr Nash silent at this point, or was he saying anything?

A.  I don't ‑ I can't recall.

Q.  After the woman told you that this was her husband, did you do anything?

A.  I was still saying that he's under ‑ he's under arrest.  I was using my ‑ sorry.

Q.  Did you ask her anything?

A.  Eventually I asked for his driver's licence.  I wanted his driver's licence.

HER HONOUR

Q.  You said, ""eventually"".  How long afterwards?

A.  I was in the middle of using my police radio to call for assistance whilst trying to ‑ but that was after Mr Nash was on the ground.” (T 162)


	
	Senior Constable Hicks then told the plaintiff “I want you out the front of the house” (T164). Senior Constable McKay arrived as they were “almost about to walk out the front” (T 164). Senior Constable Hicks told the plaintiff:
	


“Q.  What did he say, and what did you say?

A.  I told him that he was under arrest and he was not free to come and go as he pleases, he's under my control and he's got to do what I say.  But he said he wasn't under arrest.  He said he's not under arrest, and flatly refused to come out the front of the property” (T 165)


	
	Why was the plaintiff under arrest? Senior Constable Hicks went on to explain:
	


“Q.  Did you have any further conversation with him about the topic of coming out the front?

A.  Yes.  I told him several times that I wanted him out the front of the house to process him.

Q.  Did you tell him why you wanted to process him?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What did you tell him?

A.  After I'd seen that he was at his place of abode, obviously I knew I couldn't breath test him.

Q.  Why was that?

A.  Legislation prevents me from breath testing him on his place of abode.

Q.  You knew that, and what did you do?

A.  I informed him that it was my belief that he was under the influence of alcohol, I could smell it on him.

Q.  Did he say anything when you said that to him?

A.  He said, ""Yeah, so"".” (T 165)


	
	However, he gave a different explanation in cross-examination:
	


“A.  I wanted to breath test him and he was running away from me.

Q.  That's why you arrested him, wasn't it?

A.  I was arresting him for hindering me.

Q.  But when you put the bear hug on him, that was for the purpose of requiring him to undergo a breath test, wasn't it?

A.  I don't understand the question.

Q.  You see, at the time you put a bear hug on Mr Nash, you hadn't had the opportunity of making any assessment of his state of sobriety, had you?

A.  No.” (T 211)


	
	In examination in chief, Senior Constable Hicks claimed that it was his observations of the plaintiff’s “demeanour” after he had “got in the wrestle” with him which had led him to believe the plaintiff was under the influence of alcohol:
	


“When I first got in the wrestle with him, immediate you smelt the strong smell of alcohol.  We were contained in that side part of the fence, and there's a fence, and the wall, and it was coming off him, the smell of alcohol.  And his whole demeanour, he was red in the face, his speech was slurred, he had the general intoxicated person style of language and demeanour.” (T 165)


	
	I have set out the above answer despite it being objected to. He was asked to give specifics of how the words were mispronounced and gave the following explanation:
	


“All the words he was saying to me were coming out that, I believe, in a manner that, to me, inferred that was he was affected by alcohol.”


	
	Senior Constable Hicks was unable to give specific examples of these words, and the conversation took place after, and not before, he had called out to the plaintiff that he was under arrest, and taken him into a bear hug.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Senior Constable Hicks added a claim that the plaintiff was unsteady on his feet.
	
	
	None of the objective evidence supports either of these contentions. The few words spoken by the plaintiff that can be heard from Exhibit B were not identified by Senior Constable Hicks as sounding intoxicated, and it was not put to the plaintiff that his language at this initial encounter was that of an intoxicated person. As to the plaintiff’s steadiness on his feet, the evidence of Mr Ford, Mrs Nash and observations of the plaintiff’s behaviour in the second part of Exhibit B do not support this assertion. The golf club video confirms that the plaintiff only drank three light beers, and Mrs Nash did not say her husband smelled of alcohol. Senior Constable Hicks’ evidence as to the basis for his belief that the plaintiff was intoxicated is hard to credit.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks was in a difficult position. He had just arrested a man in his own home, in front of his wife, in circumstances where no breath analysis test could be performed. Although Senior Constable Hicks attempted in cross-examination to assert Mrs Nash had not been there until later, it is clear from Exhibit B that she was present (T 202). He had called for back-up and another police officer was now present. It was at this stage that the plaintiff said that he wanted to speak to his brother, who was a solicitor. Senior Constable Hicks initially would not permit this:
	


“Q.  You wouldn't let Mr Nash speak to his brother, is that correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Why didn't you do that?

A.  I was still trying to contain the situation and contain him and get my other officers to come and help me.

Q.  You were asked to speak to Mr Nash's brother on the telephone?

A.  No.

Q.  Weren't you?

A.  No.

Q.  Mrs Nash asked you to do that?

A.  No.” (T 246)


	
	Senior Constable Hicks denied that he was angry at this stage (T 246), or indeed at any stage of these events.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks then made a decision to charge the plaintiff as follows:
	


“Q.  Did the conversation about Mr Nash smelling like a brewery produce in him ‑ I'll withdraw that.  After the conversation about the brewery, if I can put it that way, did you make it to the front of the house?

A.  We went out the front of the house after I told him that I wasn't going to breath test him.

Q.  What did you say when you said, I told him I wasn't going to breath test him, what did you say to him?  Doing the best you can, do you recall the words you used.

A.  I said to him, I want to ‑ my intention is to issue you with a field court attendance notice for driving under the influence of alcohol.  You're at your place of abode, so I can't breath test you.” (T 166)


	
	What was the evidence for this? The evidence of the plaintiff’s demeanour all occurs after the words of arrest. Had Senior Constable Hicks had an opportunity even to observe the plaintiff’s car before it pulled into the drive? This requires me to determine the degree to which he had both the plaintiff’s car, and the plaintiff, under observation before these events:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s car: Although I am satisfied from Exhibit B that the plaintiff’s car cannot be seen until it is parked into the driveway, Senior Constable Hicks refuted this (T 188 - 9), claiming that the reproduction of the film was inadequate (T 189), that the sun distorted images (T 189 – 90), that it could not be seen “on that laptop” (T 190), and that he had a better view than the in-car video (T 190). He also disputed the distance from the plaintiff’s home to the club, asserting at T 190 that it was a distance “less than 500 metres” rather than 150 metres (the fact that it was 150 metres appears to have been conceded at a later stage by Mr Hutchings). He was reluctant to concede the evidence of the traffic he had to pass while making a U-turn to follow the plaintiff. Not until T 199 was Senior Constable Hicks prepared to agree with Mr Quickenden as to when he turned on his lights and sirens, which sirens (allowing for feedback delay) can first be heard as his car turns into the plaintiff’s street. This means that after seeing the plaintiff’s car exit the golf club, he was not within hailing distance of the car again until, as the in-car video shows, the plaintiff parked his car in his driveway. He would not have been able to see the vehicle for most of this period. This means that there was nothing in the manner of the plaintiff’s driving which would have alerted a police officer, and I note that Senior Constable Hicks agreed he did not investigate or charge any road offence in relation to the plaintiff’s driving (T 200).
	
	
	The plaintiff: Although Senior Constable Hicks stated that he saw the plaintiff’s face as the window was down, and the plaintiff appeared to notice him, he acknowledged that if this was the case he would have given such evidence in the Local Court, or noted it in the COPS report, neither of which he had done. I do not accept this evidence.
	



	
	Returning to the circumstances at the plaintiff’s home on the day in question, the plaintiff was eventually permitted to speak to his brother, and Senior Constable McKay obtained the plaintiff’s fingerprints. Constable McKay can be seen on the video walking around the back of the premises with the plaintiff (T 233), and he agreed that he had the plaintiff under observation for a few minutes at least (T 233). He did not assert in his evidence, or note, that the plaintiff was unsteady on his feet or slurring his words.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks’ explanation for the plaintiff not appearing to stagger or be unsteady, as is clear from Exhibit B, is that the plaintiff sobered up after speaking to his brother (a solicitor) on the telephone, an explanation he had also given in the Local Court (T 243). Counsel appearing at the Local Court put to him:
	


""Q.  But, you see, you don't sober up, if you're affected by alcohol, because you talk to your brother.  That doesn't mean that you can stand there steady as we observed in the video, you agree with that?

A.  I beg to differ."" (T 243)


	
	This explanation from Senior Constable Hicks is completely implausible. It must substantially undermine his credit as an honest and reliable witness. (Other examples, including his dismissal of Mr Ford’s evidence at the Local Court on the basis that Mr Ford was a liar (T 248) and his claim that the golf club deliberately and dishonestly withheld incriminating CCTV, are set out in more detail below).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks was asked why he did not discontinue the arrest when it was apparent to him that the plaintiff was in his own home and could not be breathalysed. His answer is evasive:
	


“A.  It wasn't necessarily ‑ I still had to confirm his particulars.  I had a driver's licence in front of me, I had the wife saying it was, he was her it was, he was her husband but, once again there, I have still got to confirm ‑ I had a driver's licence in front of me but I still have to confirm it.  He is still with me until I can confirm it myself as to whose house we are at and whether or not he is entitled to be there and all the—” (T 216 – 217)


	
	However, Senior Constable Hicks had earlier agreed that the photo licence showed the plaintiff’s photograph as well as the address of the property on which he was standing. Mrs Nash had fetched her car keys from the house to unlock the car to hand over the licence and Mr Nash’s mother was also present. Although he claimed not to know the street address or number of the house at which he was carrying out the arrest (which I do not accept as he had radioed his whereabouts for back-up), Senior Constable Hicks’ suspicion that the plaintiff was not the Mr Nash who lived at this house with Mrs Nash was without any basis.
	
	
	Additionally, over the whole of this period, Senior Constable Hicks continued to restrain the plaintiff physically, although the likelihood that the plaintiff would flee from his own house, where his identity was known, was remote. His avowed purpose was to stop the plaintiff going into his own home, although the reason why this would have been such an unwelcome development was never explained.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks told the Local Court he restrained the plaintiff physically for around 10 minutes, going on to say it was for:
	


“A good period of time.  Like I say, the entire time until he got the - spoke to his brother on or he spoke to someone on the phone.  I was right on top of him one stage there to prevent him from getting inside.  I think I tripped him over and I was on top of his back, saying, 'I don't want you to go inside.  We are staying right here' so about, maybe ten minutes, I'd say, I was right in his face, trying to contain him.” (T 220)


	
	The plaintiff was obviously suffering injuries as a result of this prolonged restraint, and complained of pain in his left shoulder. Senior Constable Hicks called an ambulance (T 186). Senior Constable McKay required the plaintiff to provide fingerprint identification. Senior Constable Hicks wrote out a Court Attendance Notice for the plaintiff to attend court for driving under the influence.
	
	
	No charge was made at the time in relation to resisting arrest. This was added at a later date (T 170). Mr Quickenden submits that it was added because of Senior Constable Hicks’ knowledge of the weakness of the charge in relation to driving under the influence.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks’ quest for evidence in support of the charge of driving under the influence also led him to visit the golf club and to seek the CCTV for the day in question.
	


Senior Constable Hicks’ letter to the Shelly Beach Golf Club


	
	On 24 November 2011, Senior Constable Hicks visited the golf club for the purposes of obtaining evidence in relation to the driving under influence charge. He took with him a letter which stated as follows:
	


“[New South Wales Police, Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command letterhead]

To The Licensee/Secretary Manager,

I am officially placing a form of demand upon you as the licensee/secretary manager, to supply to me the following information.

This form of demand is in accordance with section 110 of the Liquor Act / section 58 of the Registered Clubs Act.

The information is required in the investigation of the following offence:

- Permit Intoxicated person

The required information/documents are:

Video footage from 4:00pm on the 13/10/2011 until 7pm on the 13/10/2011 covering the location/s of: All area’s [sic] of the interior of Tuggerah Lakes Golf Club around the bar area and carpark.

[Michael Hicks’ signature]”


	
	Three aspects of this letter are relevant:
	



	
	Senior Constable Hicks obtained assistance in the writing of this letter from another member of the NSW Police Force;
	
	
	The legislation referred to was not in force at the time;
	
	
	The letter did not state that the information was required in respect of the charges laid against the plaintiff notwithstanding that this was in fact the purpose of the letter as Senior Constable Hicks admitted; and
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks agreed in cross-examination that he was not authorised to investigate such offences.
	



	
	As to (c) above, his statements at T 236-237 are relevant:
	


“Q.  You misrepresented to the Golf Club why you wanted information, via this letter, didn't you?

A.  The Club asked me for the letter.

HER HONOUR

Q.  Sir, that's not the question.

A.  Sorry.

Q.  The question is, whether they asked you for the letter or not, what is being put to you is that the contents of that letter misrepresented your true purpose which was not to carry out this investigation but‑‑

QUICKENDEN: Yes.

Q.  It wasn't to carry out the investigation of permit an intoxicated person.  It was to carry out the investigation in relation to the DUI charge, wasn't it, Senior Constable?

A.  It would have been for both.

Q.  You say it was both now, Senior Constable, do you?

A.  No, I'm not saying it was both.  My intention was to get the footage in relation to the drinking of Mr Nash but, had it have shown more, obviously I would have passed it on to the licensing police.”


	
	The club released the relevant video, which is Exhibit H in these proceedings. It was not used in the Local Court for the prosecution case. In the course of cross-examination, Senior Constable Hicks explained that it was not used because it was not all the footage, and accused the club of withholding footage:
	


“Q.  You said that that was relevant to your investigation, to calculate the number of drinks he had?

A.  It became apparent after speaking to the General Manager of the Golf Club that they weren't happy with me and they didn't want to supply me with the footage.  The footage I was told I was going to be supplied with was different to the footage that I was supplied with.

Q.  You don't think you got all the right footage?

A.  Exactly.

Q.  You think the Club deliberately didn't give you the right footage?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Withheld information from you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What did you do about that, Senior Constable?

A.  Nothing.” (T 238)


	
	Senior Constable Hicks did not tell the court the facts and matters upon which he based this allegation against the golf club. It is a serious allegation to make, and one which does not reflect well on Senior Constable Hicks.
	
	
	As is set out above (T 243) the CCTV in Exhibit B showed the plaintiff to be steady on his feet shortly after the arrest. The CCTV footage of the plaintiff at the golf club makes it clear that the plaintiff was not unsteady on his feet or affected by alcohol in any visually perceivable way before the arrest as well. There is nothing in his demeanour from this CCTV to suggest he is affected by alcohol in any way, nor was any submission to this effect put by Mr Hutchings.
	
	
	Notwithstanding this exculpatory evidence (which was withheld from the legal representatives of the plaintiff at the criminal proceedings) the prosecution was maintained and continued until 18 May 2012, when it was dismissed by the magistrate at the Local Court.
	


The disputed issues of fact


	
	Counsel for the plaintiff identifies the issues in dispute as follows:
	



	
	Whether or not the plaintiff knew he was being pursued by the police;
	
	
	Whether or not the plaintiff heard the words “just here Sir”;
	
	
	Where the bear hug was first inflicted;
	
	
	Whether or not the plaintiff realised a police vehicle was partly on his property before the bear hug;
	
	
	The form of the physical contact between the plaintiff and Senior Constable Hicks until about the time that the plaintiff’s wife could see the duo;
	
	
	What was said by the plaintiff in the backyard;
	
	
	Whether or not the plaintiff was affected by alcohol such that he was driving under the influence;
	
	
	The time Exhibit 4 was prepared;
	
	
	Credit of the main witnesses;
	
	
	In the context of these proceedings, Senior Constable Hicks’ evidence should not be accepted where it is contradicted by any other witnesses.
	



	
	Counsel for the defendant identifies the contentious facts and issues as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff is not a man of credit in that he “had the temerity” to assert that he had never been before the court charged with a drink driving offence as he had been convicted of a low range PCA offence 35 years ago on 10 May 1979 when he had been fined $400, disqualified from driving for 21 days and obliged to hold a restricted licence for six months.
	
	
	Additionally, on 4 June 2000, the plaintiff was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm following an altercation with his wife. Those were dismissed. These two matters must cast doubt on the credit of the plaintiff in face of his “frank dishonesty in the face of the court” (written submissions, paragraph 31) and in the absence of corroboration, where contradicted, the plaintiff’s evidence ought not to be accepted.
	
	
	Additionally, there were significant inconsistencies in his evidence which were “inexplicable” (written submissions, paragraph 35). This included whether he had observed the police vehicle (T 17), his failure to observe the lights or hear the sirens or to understand that the policeman wished to stop him, as opposed to some other person (written submissions, paragraphs 81-85), and his explanation for not submitting to the arrest and his credit and demeanour generally.
	


Credit issues


	
	The disputed facts in this issue may largely be resolved without determination of the credit of either the plaintiff or Senior Constable Hicks, in that the objective evidence of reliable witnesses (Mr Ford, Mrs Nash and Constable McKay) and CCTV footage and Local Court transcript establish most of what occurred.
	
	
	I have set out, in my narrative of facts above, some of my reasons for not accepting the evidence from Senior Constable Hicks as to what took place. The evidence of the plaintiff as to what happened is, with one exception, of little assistance, in that he was grabbed in a bear hug by Senior Constable Hicks and kept under his physical control for about 10 minutes, in circumstances where his ability to understand what was happening was limited.
	
	
	That one exception is his explanation as to when he saw the police car. His response that he did not see the police car is explicable in the sense that he explained that he did not think its presence was anything to do with him. As a member of the community with only limited prior experience with the police, his reaction was to assume it was nothing to do with him. Similarly, although attracted by the sound of the police siren, neither Mr Ford nor Mrs Nash gave evidence that they thought that the police car presence in their quiet street had anything to do with them.
	
	
	Other issues are raised as to the plaintiff’s asserted lack of credit, but they have little to do with the facts of this case. The plaintiff’s two prior experiences with police, one in 1979 and one in 2000, would not have given him cause to assume that a police car entering his street with lights and sirens was following him. While his failure to recall his 1979 PCA offence and his 2000 dispute with his wife are not to his credit, these failures are not related to the events in these proceedings. I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s account of these events is generally accurate and consistent with the independent objective evidence. By contrast, I do not accept the evidence of Senior Constable Hicks unless it has been corroborated.
	
	
	An additional submission was made that not only had Senior Constable Hicks given evidence which should be accepted, but that his duties as a constable needed to be taken into account when determining not only the defences, but also disputed issues of fact and the credit of the witnesses. My findings in this regard are next set out.
	


The duty of the constable


	
	Mr Hutching’s written submissions (at [202] – [212]) set out the duty of a constable to prevent and investigate crime, to enforce the criminal law and to act as a peace officer (New South Wales v Tyszyk [2008] NSWCA 107 at [106] – [111]). Additionally, the mission and function of police officers are set out in s 6 Police Act 1990 (NSW). The mission is “to establish a safer environment by reducing violence, crime and fear” and the functions include doing “anything necessary for, or incidental to, the exercise of its functions”. The police services referred to in s 3 of that Act identify services for the prevention and detection of crime, protection of persons from injury or death and emergency services. Mr Hutchings submits that the duty of a constable “was appropriately at the forefront of SC Hicks’ mind (at all relevant times)” (written submissions, paragraph [212]. Additionally, Senior Constable Hicks was entitled to enter the premises because he was not told it was private property, and asked to leave.
	
	
	The transcript of the in-car video makes it clear that Senior Constable Hicks called out “you’re under arrest” to the plaintiff while he was on what the plaintiff told him was “private property”. I am satisfied that Senior Constable Hicks came on to what was obviously private property for the purpose of effecting an arrest, although I consider the relevance of this to be tangential at best.
	
	
	The common law and statutory entitlements for police to enter private premises are set out in Clowser v Chaplin; Finnigan v Sandiford [1981] 1 WLR 837 (HL) at 842-843, cited in Hume v R (1999) 106 A Crim R 411 at [26]. In Hume v R, Kennedy and Ipp JJ referred to Dobie v Pinker [1983] WAR 48, where two police officers pursued a suspected driver’s vehicle onto his residential property to require him to undergo a preliminary test. It was held in that case that police officers had an implied right of entry to private premises to effect an arrest or for other lawful purposes until the same was revoked by the occupier.
	
	
	The plaintiff in these proceedings does not assert that Senior Constable Hicks was trespassing. However, that is not the issue. At the time that Senior Constable Hicks called out to the plaintiff that he was under arrest, the plaintiff had not failed to comply with the request to pull over under lights and sirens, as these had not been activated at a time when he could or should have done so.
	
	
	Nor did Constable Hicks have any “duty of the constable” evidence that the plaintiff had consumed alcohol at all, beyond the fact that he had been seen exiting a golf club which held a liquor licence. The evidence relied upon by Senior Constable Hicks to found his belief for the arresting of the plaintiff and the bringing of charges, namely smelling alcohol on the plaintiff’s breath and claims of an unsteady gait, related to the period when he was already on the plaintiff’s premises, and not to his observations beforehand.
	
	
	Accordingly, I do not accept Mr Hutchings’ written submissions that the duty of a constable was appropriately at the forefront of Senior Constable Hicks’ mind at all relevant times. It was conceded that there was nothing about the plaintiff’s appearance or manner of driving to arouse any suspicion of wrongdoing. Senior Constable Hicks had been stopping people exiting the golf club for the previous three hours for the purpose of administering an alcotest, and that was the sole reason why he followed the plaintiff.
	
	
	The provisions of ss 3 and 6 Police Act 1990 (NSW) did not warrant Senior Constable Hicks taking the course that he did, and Mr Hutchings’ submissions to the contrary are rejected. Additionally, Mr Hutchings has not taken into account the plaintiff’s submission that Senior Constable Hicks failed to comply with s 201 of LEPRA, in that he failed to advise the plaintiff of his reasons for arrest until well after Constable McKay had arrived.
	
	
	The basis for the “duty of a constable” submission, and whether it is pleaded as a defence to one or all of the plaintiff’s claims and/or in relation to credit, has not been precisely set out. Some of the issues set out in the written submissions are identified in relation to the defence to the claim for malicious prosecution. There is no statutory defence to any of the claims pleaded by the plaintiff of the kind attempted in paragraph 17 of the defence filed in these proceedings, or by reason of the matters raised in paragraphs [202] – [212] of Mr Hutching’s submissions. Such a claim would be novel.
	
	
	If the basis for those submissions is to reflect the absence of malice of Senior Constable Hicks (see paragraph 17 of the defence, the text of which is set out above) or some other element in one or more of the causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff, the basis upon which these statutory provisions are relevant should be identified with precision. That has not been done.
	


The claim for unlawful arrest


	
	The power to arrest is set out at s 99 of LEPRA. Mr Hutchings submits that Senior Constable Hicks arrested the plaintiff for the purpose identified in s 99(3A), namely to ensure the appearance of the plaintiff before the court (written submissions, paragraph 217) and he discontinued the arrest on the earliest opportunity, namely once he established who the plaintiff was. Once the plaintiff had ceased to resist, Senior Constable Hicks informed him of the reason for the arrest which is sufficient to comply with s 201 of LEPRA.
	
	
	These submissions do not take into account the length of time that the plaintiff was physically restrained without being told why (about ten minutes), or the principal complaint of the plaintiff as to the unlawfulness of the arrest, namely to identify the reason for the arrest until well after the plaintiff had been released. It is clear from the in-car video, which covers the period from the time Senior Constable Hicks told the plaintiff he was under arrest and put him in a bear hug, the plaintiff had no idea why he had been stopped on his own property by this police officer, and that he continued to be unaware of the reasons why until some time later.
	
	
	It is common ground between the parties that Senior Constable Hicks put the plaintiff into what both Senior Constable Hicks (T 209) and Mr Ford called a “bear hug” and that he did so immediately (see the evidence of Mr Ford at Exhibit A). The plaintiff gave a similar description (T 20). Senior Constable Hicks conceded (T 209) that the arrest occurred at the point of the bear hug, which immediately followed the words “you’re under arrest”, as the in-car video shows. Senior Constable Hicks conceded that the first statement “you’re under arrest” had been made before he got out of the vehicle. That arrest continued as the plaintiff tried to get free, and it was in those circumstances that Senior Constable Hicks tripped him to the ground where he contained him.
	
	
	While there is no requirement for the defendant to intend to act unlawfully or to cause injury, in that the tort may be considered as akin to one of strict liability (Ruddock v Taylor (2005) 222 CLR 612 at [140]), Constable Hicks should have had a suspicion held on reasonable grounds at the time of arrest that the plaintiff was driving while intoxicated. Does this mean that his reasons for arresting the plaintiff changed and, if so, what was that change?
	
	
	The sole basis upon which Senior Constable Hicks held that suspicion was that he had seen the plaintiff leave the premises at the local golf club at 6:30pm, this being premises which were licenced. While the mere fact that the plaintiff was driving may give rise to a proper basis to stop him and breath test him (s 13 Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW)), that is insufficient to warrant physical arrest and restraint unless the plaintiff is attempting to flee.
	
	
	Additionally, the only intention Senior Constable Hicks had was to request the plaintiff to undergo a breath test, but the plaintiff was not running away; he was on private property which, if it was his, precluded the taking of the breath test. The problem was not that he had run away, as I am satisfied that he was already on his own property before Senior Constable Hicks arrived. The problem was that the plaintiff would not “come over” to Senior Constable Hicks, and leave the private property, so that a breath test could be conducted. Senior Constable Hicks said in chief:
	


“Q.  You have given evidence that when you were at 57 Bellevue Street, you informed Mr Nash that he was under arrest?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Why did you do that?  What was the reason for your arresting of Mr Nash?

A.  I'd chased after him with the intention of submitting him to a random breath test.  I'd ask him to come over towards me for the purpose of the breath test.  Him leaving me, he was not allowing me any opportunity to explain myself to him what I wanted him to do.  Him running away, is hindering me in trying to submit him to a breath test.” (T 182)


	
	Mr Quickenden submits that Senior Constable Hicks did not have that suspicion until after the arrest, and draws my attention to T 211-212 where an inconsistent description was given:
	


“Q.  Is that correct, senior constable?

A.  I wanted to breath test him and he was running away from me.

Q.  That's why you arrested him, wasn't it?

A.  I was arresting him for hindering me.

Q.  But when you put the bear hug on him, that was for the purpose of requiring him to undergo a breath test, wasn't it?

A.  I don't understand the question.

Q.  You see, at the time you put a bear hug on Mr Nash, you hadn't had the opportunity of making any assessment of his state of sobriety, had you?

A.  No.

Q.  I want to put to you a summation of your evidence of what took place after you put the bear hug on Mr Nash; do you understand that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You say there was grappling?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Mr Nash was trying to get out of your hold?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You say he was trying to move down the side of what turned out to be his residence?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You say that you couldn't stop him doing that, don't you?  Initially, you couldn't stop him?

A.  The effort I was putting into him wasn't working.

Q.  You determined at a point to trip him so you could place him on the ground and, in effect, put your weight on him; isn't that correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That's what you did?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You tripped him over and you leaned on him?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That was effective?  He was under your control?

A.  I was still struggling with him.

Q.  You wouldn't agree that you were all over him at that point?

A.  No, I was still struggling with him.

Q.  Do you remember saying this in the Local Court, page 45.  If I can put to you that there were questions about what you did.  This question was asked of you:

""What was the closest proximity that you got to Mr Nash when you were having this struggle?  How far away were you from him?""

Do you recall that being asked?

A.  No, I don't recall.

Q.  Do you recall you answering ""I was all over him""?  Do you remember giving that answer?

A.  I don't recall giving that answer but I obviously gave that answer.

Q.  That was asked by the police prosecutor of you.  Do you recall that?

A.  No.”


	
	Senior Constable Hicks was not entitled to arrest a person to force him to come out of his home so that he could legally carry out a breath test. What he was attempting to do was to lure the plaintiff off his property with the intention of requiring him to undergo a breath test there, as he conceded at T 213:
	


“Q.  When you said, ""Just here, sir,"" did you want Mr Nash to come off the property onto the nature strip?

A.  I wanted him to come towards me.

Q.  That would have meant coming towards the nature strip, wouldn't it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  In other words, it would have meant him coming off that property that he was on, wouldn't it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Because you were fully aware at that point that if that was Mr Nash's home, you couldn't breath test him, weren't you?

A.  Sorry, the question again, if?

Q.  You were fully aware when you said to Mr Nash, ""Just come here, sir,"" that you couldn't breath test him if he was at his own home?

A.  I can't breath test him at his home address; yes, I'm aware of that.

Q.  You were aware of it when you said to him, ""Just here, sir,"" weren't you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It occurred to you, didn't it, that that could well be Mr Nash's home?

A.  Yes.”


	
	I am satisfied from the evidence of Mr Ford and the in-car video that Senior Constable Hicks called out “Just here, sir” to lure the plaintiff outside the gate in circumstances where he knew that this respectively attired middle aged gentleman was more than likely to be the occupant of the home, and to be proceeding to his own front door with the purpose of entering his own home. Senior Constable Hicks already knew that he could not breathe test the plaintiff at his home address.
	
	
	I am further satisfied from the very short intervals between saying “Just here, sir” and “You’re under arrest” that Senior Constable Hicks was giving the plaintiff little or no time to comply with his directions. As was described by Mr Ford, these events happened literally within seconds.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks’ evidence endeavoured to identify three separate parts to the arrest, namely the bear hug, followed by the struggle, followed by the tripping of the plaintiff. This is contrary to the evidence of Mrs Nash, whose evidence on this issue was not challenged (T 128). Mr Quickenden also submits (written submissions, paragraph 41) that it is contrary to common sense, in that a person of the plaintiff’s age and build would have difficulty breaking the hold and standing or running away further. All the evidence points to Senior Constable Hicks keeping the plaintiff under restraint until he could decide what offence he could be charged with. The actual words identifying the charge under s 12 Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW) were not spoken until Senior Constable Hicks was in the process of filling out the necessary paper work. The charge of resisting arrest was not added until the next month, and I am satisfied that the plaintiff was not informed of any such charge at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	Section 201(1) of LEPRA (replaced from November 2014 by Pt 15, Sch 2 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment Act 2014 (NSW)) requires an officer using the power of arrest to give reasons as soon as is practicable: McCarthy v New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 153 at [68] – [79], noting (in bold) the statement by Viscount Simon in Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 at 587 – 8 that “If the citizen is not so informed, the policeman, apart from certain exceptions, is liable for false imprisonment”. The question of when it is “reasonably practicable” after the power of arrest is exercised is a question of fact.
	
	
	On the facts in this case, I am satisfied that Senior Constable Hicks’ failure to advise the plaintiff of the reasons for arrest was because Senior Constable Hicks had not yet determined what those reasons were. He became “angry” (to use Mrs Nash’s word) when he saw the plaintiff entering what was very likely to be his home, which meant that he could not be breath-tested. He gave way to that anger and grabbed the plaintiff in a bear hug.
	
	
	The arrest then continued to be one of unnecessary force. Senior Constable Hicks’ evidence was as follows:
	


“Q.  Senior Constable, you tripped over Mr Nash.  Isn't that correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were on top of his back.  Isn't that correct?

A.  His ‑ he was on his ‑ I think he was on his left shoulder, left side, lying down, with his stomach face more towards the ground but I was on his right side and his back.

Q.  Are you saying, in answer to my question, ""No, I was not on top of his back""?

A.  No.

Q.  You're not saying that?

A.  No.

Q.  You were on top of his back.  Is that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You had your knees in his back, didn't you?

A.  I had my weight on him with my knees, yes.

Q.  The idea of that was to pin him to the ground, wasn't it?

A.  It was to prevent him from getting inside.

Q.  But by doing that, to prevent him from getting inside, you were pinning him to the ground?

A.  Yes.” (T 217)


	
	The arrest was continued despite corroboration from the plaintiff’s wife that the plaintiff was at his own home (T 216-217) where Senior Constable Hicks knew he could not require a breath test (T 208).
	
	
	I am also satisfied that, contrary to the defendant’s submissions, the evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff did not fail to stop his car after Senior Constable Hicks activated lights and sirens (defendant’s written submissions, paragraph 240).
	
	
	Further, I am satisfied that the exigencies of the moment (Woodley v Boyd at [37]) played no part in these events. What Senior Constable Hicks was observing was an apparently respectable member of the community opening the front gate of what was likely to be his own home. Contrary to the submissions of the plaintiff, there was no “agony of the moment” requiring him to arrest the plaintiff for the purpose of administering a breath test.
	
	
	The arrest power is one of last resort. This was made clear in the Attorney General’s Second Reading Speech (Hansard, 17 September 2002), introducing LEPRA:
	


“I turn now to powers relating to arrest. Part 8 of the bill substantially re-enacts arrest provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 and codifies the common law. The provisions of Pt 8 reflect that arrest is a measure that is to be exercised only when necessary. An arrest should only be used as a last resort as it is the strongest measure that may be taken to secure an accused person's attendance at court. Clause 99, for example, clarifies that a police officer should not make an arrest unless it achieves the specified purposes, such as preventing the continuance of the offence. Failure to comply with this clause would not, of itself, invalidate the charge. Clauses 107 and 108 make it clear that nothing in the part affects the power of a police officer to exercise the discretion to commence proceedings for an offence other than by arresting the person, for example, by way of caution or summons or another alternative to arrest. Arrest is a measure of last resort. The part clarifies that police have the power to discontinue arrest at any time.”


	
	In addition, I am satisfied that not only was the arrest unlawful, but that his detention following arrest was unlawful.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there is nothing in ss 114 - 117 of LEPRA permitting the continued detaining of the plaintiff in the extremely forceful manner employed by Senior Constable Hicks.
	
	
	The claim for wrongful arrest is made out.
	


The claim for assault and battery


	
	An arrest may be unlawful without necessarily being violent. However, where the arrest is unlawful, the plaintiff is entitled to resist it. In Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 at 591, Viscount Simon explained that:
	


“… it is the corollary of the right of every citizen to be thus free from arrest that he should be entitled to resist arrest unless that arrest is lawful”


	
	Although the claims for assault and battery are brought separately, I am satisfied that the immediacy of Senior Constable Hicks putting the plaintiff into a bear hug was such that he literally had no time to “apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence”: Fagan v Metropolitan Commissioner of Police [1969] 1 QB 439 at 444. I am satisfied, however, that Senior Constable Hicks used unreasonable force to detain the plaintiff. First of all, he put him in a bear hug and secondly he tripped him to the ground and pinned him with his knees. He knew at the time that he did so that he could not administer a breath test to the plaintiff if he indeed resided in his home, as the plaintiff had been quick to tell him (see the reference to “This is private property” in the transcript of the in-car video).
	
	
	Another reason for the plaintiff struggling was that Senior Constable Hicks did not tell him why he was being arrested.
	
	
	The amount of force used by Senior Constable Hicks (which included wrestling the plaintiff to the ground and keeping him physically confined for around 10 minutes) is completely disproportionate to his concerns about the plaintiff driving under the influence.
	
	
	Mr Quickenden did not seek to separate the claims for assault and battery but put them on the basis that the plaintiff was the victim of a sustained physical restraint of some violence. I am satisfied that the claim (insofar as there is a claim for battery) is made out.
	
	
	This brings me to the plaintiff’s claim for damages for malicious prosecution.
	


Malicious prosecution


	
	There is no dispute that the criminal proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff, as both the charges for driving under the influence of alcohol and resisting arrear were dismissed. The issues in dispute are:
	



	
	Whether the defendant was the “prosecutor” who initiated and/or maintained the proceedings;
	
	
	Whether he initiated and/or maintained the proceedings without reasonable and probable cause (see A v New South Wales (2007) 230 CLR 500); and,
	
	
	Malice.
	



	
	Both parties agree that the standard of proof is to the Briginshaw standard (Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336): Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd (1992) 67 ALJR 170. Counsel for the defendant asserts that any allegation of malicious prosecution is “a very serious allegation” (written submissions, paragraph 274) and that the burden of proof on the plaintiff is a heavy one and “a difficult burden to discharge” (written submissions, paragraph 277). While I note these submissions, I do not understand the defendant to assert that any heavier burden than that imposed by s 140 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) or the Briginshaw test to apply.
	
	
	I shall deal with each of these elements in turn.
	


Who was the prosecutor?


	
	In Davis v Gell (1924) 35 CLR 275 Isaacs ACJ asked the question at 283, “who was the prosecutor”, noting that it was a question of fact which depended upon the circumstances of the case. It is not in dispute that the defendant charged the plaintiff with the following two charges:
	



	
	A breach of s 12 Road Transports (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW); and,
	
	
	Resist officer in the execution of duty pursuant to s 546C Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	



	
	Did the defendant have control over the conduct of the hearing, including the gathering of the evidence?
	
	
	The defendant was cross-examined at T 244-245:
	


“Q.  You were the only investigating officer?

A.  That's right.

Q.  You were the only witness for the prosecution in the proceedings?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were responsible for charging Mr Nash?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were responsible on the day of prosecution for the prosecution?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were there during the whole of the prosecution?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Notwithstanding having exhibit H in your possession, you continued with the prosecution of drive under the influence, didn't you?

A.  Yes.”


	
	Additionally, although the defendant acknowledged it was not part of his duty to investigate breaches of the Liquor Act 2007 (NSW) or licencing laws (T 234), he was the author of the letter to the golf club requesting the supply of CCTV evidence implicating the plaintiff, a matter particularised as going to the malicious continuation of the proceedings. This is indicative of his control of the evidence for the case. There is however no evidence that he had influence over the conduct of the hearing or the maintaining of the charges, which the defendant submits is fatal (written submissions, paragraphs 285 to 287).
	
	
	The identification of the appropriate defendant in the case of malicious prosecution is not always straight forward. In Landini v State of New South Wales & Ors [2008] NSWSC 1280, Hall J noted at [957]:
	


“[957] In Johnston v Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2006] NSWCA 218, Basten JA, with whom Giles and Santow JJA agreed, stated:

36. That a person who is not legally a party to a prosecution may nevertheless be sued is beyond doubt. In Davis v Gell (1924) 35 CLR 275 at 282, Isaacs ACJ stated:

For the purposes of this form of action the law looks beyond theory and regards the person in fact instrumental in prosecuting the accused as the real prosecutor. It enables the person innocently accused to treat his virtual accuser as party to the criminal charge … . The substance and not the legal form must in all cases govern, and while, on the one hand, a person giving information to the police is not necessarily the prosecutor yet, on the other, the mere fact that the police conduct the prosecution does not exclude him from that position.”


	
	The New South Wales Court of Appeal pointed out in New South Wales v Landini [2010] NSWCA 157 at [59] as follows:
	


“[59] The joint judgment in A v New South Wales pointed out that “[t]he identification of the appropriate defendant in a case of malicious prosecution is not always straightforward. ‘To incur liability, the defendant must play an active role in the conduct of the proceedings, as by “instigating” or setting them in motion’” (at [34] citing John G Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed (1998) LBC Information Services at p 676). Their Honours continued:

[35] In Martin v Watson [1996] AC 74), a woman made an allegation that her neighbour had indecently exposed himself to her whilst standing on a ladder in his garden. She went to a police station and complained. A detective constable laid an information against the neighbour. At a hearing before the Magistrates’ Court, the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence, and the charge was dismissed. The House of Lords held that, since the facts relating to the alleged offence were solely within the complainant’s knowledge, and that as a practical matter the police officer who laid the information could not have exercised any independent discretion, the complainant could be sued for malicious prosecution, and upheld an award of damages against her. The complainant had “in substance procured the prosecution” ([1996] AC 74 at 89). The police officer to whom the complaint was made had no way of testing the truthfulness of the accusation ([1996] AC 74 at 89). Lord Keith of Kinkel quoted with approval a statement by McMullin J in the Court of Appeal of New Zealand (Commercial Union Assurance Co of New Zealand Ltd v Lamont[1989] 3 NZLR 187 at 207–208), that a person may be regarded as the prosecutor if he puts the police in possession of information which virtually compels an officer to bring a charge.”


	
	The point made in the plaintiff’s submissions at paragraphs 100-101 that the defendant in substance procured the prosecution and further maintained it, in that he sought additional evidence in the form of the CCTV footage from the golf club. That evidence, which was exonerating of the plaintiff, was not produced at the criminal proceedings, but that is not fatal in relation to the issues of control of the litigation as identified by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Landini, or by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Cosentino v Kent [2009] QCA 355 at [43] (where the action was brought against the complainants rather than the police officers or prosecuting body).
	
	
	The principles first enunciated by the House of Lords in Martin v Watson [1996] AC 74, which is referred to by Mr Quickenden in his submissions at paragraph 100 and by both Landini and Cosentino, are now accepted principles. The submission by Mr Hutchings that the proceedings should have been commenced against the prosecutor, or that evidence should have been led as to who was the prosecutor and who was responsible for the prosecution being maintained beyond a point at which they ought to have been withdrawn, needs to be seen in the context of the plaintiff’s allegation that the prosecuting authority (who Mr Quickenden asserts is Senior Constable Hicks) provided facts which were untrue (such as the indicia of alcohol consumption) and the circumstances in which the Senior Constable Hicks, and not the prosecutor, obtained the CCTV footage from the golf club. That means that the person with the relevant beliefs and malice is Senior Constable Hicks, not the prosecutor. Whether it was the prosecutor’s decision not to use the footage at the criminal proceedings, or that of Senior Constable Hicks, is irrelevant.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Senior Constable Hicks had the requisite control both of the laying of the charges and the maintaining of the prosecution of the plaintiff. He agreed he was responsible on the day for the prosecution, and that he continued the prosecution notwithstanding having Exhibit H in his possession.
	


Absence of reasonable and probable cause


	
	The relevant test is set out by A v New South Wales at [76]-[77] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ as follows:
	


“[76] The absence of reasonable and probable cause will not in every case be shown by demonstrating that the prosecutor had no positive belief that the accused person was, or was probably, guilty. In particular, references to belief in guilt, or more properly, the absence of belief in guilt, will very likely prove distracting in any case where the prosecutor may not be supposed to know where the truth lies. A case where the prosecutor acts on the statements of others is one example of such a case.

[77] There are three critical points. First, it is the negative proposition that must be established: more probably than not the defendant prosecutor acted without reasonable and probable cause. Secondly, that proposition may be established in either or both of two ways: the defendant prosecutor did not ""honestly believe"" the case that was instituted or maintained, or the defendant prosecutor had no sufficient basis for such an honest belief. The third point is that the critical question presented by this element of the tort is: what does the plaintiff demonstrate about what the defendant prosecutor made of the material that he or she had available when deciding whether to prosecute or maintain the prosecution? That is, when the plaintiff asserts that the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause, what exactly is the content of that assertion?”


	
	The Court further stated at [80]-[81]:
	


“[80] In cases where the prosecutor acted on material provided by third parties, a relevant question in an action for malicious prosecution will be whether the prosecutor is shown not to have honestly concluded that the material was such as to warrant setting the processes of the criminal law in motion. (There may also be a real and lively question about the objective sufficiency of the material, but that may be left to one side for the moment.) In deciding the subjective question, the various checks and balances for which the processes of the criminal law provide are important. In particular, if the prosecutor was shown to be of the view that the charge would likely fail at committal, or would likely be abandoned by the Director of Public Prosecutions, if or when that officer became involved in the prosecution, absence of reasonable and probable cause would be demonstrated. But unless the prosecutor is shown either not to have honestly formed the view that there was a proper case for prosecution, or to have formed that view on an insufficient basis, the element of absence of reasonable and probable cause is not established.

[81] The expression ""proper case for prosecution"" is not susceptible of exhaustive definition without obscuring the importance of the burden of proving the absence of reasonable and probable cause, and the variety of factual and forensic circumstances in which the questions may arise. For the reasons given earlier, it will require examination of the prosecutor's state of persuasion about the material considered by the prosecutor. That should not be done by treating the five conditions stated by Jordan CJ in Mitchell v John Heine as a complete and exhaustive catalogue of what will constitute reasonable and probable cause. First, to focus upon what is reasonable and probable cause distracts attention from what it is that the plaintiff must establish — the absence of reasonable and probable cause. And secondly, because those conditions are framed in terms of belief about probable guilt, they are conditions that, for the reasons already given, do not sufficiently encompass cases where the prosecutor acts upon information provided by others.”


	
	An honest but mistaken belief in the guilt of the plaintiff will not be sufficient: Skrijel v Mengler [2003] VSC 270 at [327].
	
	
	Mr Hutchings submits (written submissions, paragraph 294) that the plaintiff must establish the negative proposition, namely that the defendant “did not believe there was a proper case for prosecution”, and relies upon the fact that the defendant was not cross-examined on this issue. Additionally, the plaintiff did not take what Mr Hutchings calls the “customary step of tendering the police brief” (Hamod v New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 375 at [33]; State of NSW v Hathaway [2010] NSWCA 184 at [180]) and that these omissions are “fatal” (written submissions, paragraph 298) to the plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim, because the Court cannot know what the prosecutor had before him/her as evidence, what he/she made of it, and what he/she determined in reliance upon that material. The defendant submits it was the plaintiff’s obligation to tender the brief, cross-examine the defendant on its content, to identify and cross-examine any other person “said by the plaintiff to be the prosecutor” (in other words, the actual prosecutor) and to make submissions concerning the adequacy of the material. Not only was the defendant not asked what he could have done to further investigate the matter, he was not asked about the content of the brief, and there was no attempt made to demonstrate what was contained in that brief (written submissions, paragraph 299-303).
	
	
	For there to be reasonable and probable cause, it is necessary that:
	



	
	The person bringing and maintaining the charge must believe that the accused is probably guilty of the offence;
	
	
	This belief must be founded upon information in the possession of the prosecution pointing to such guilt, and not upon mere imagination or surmise;
	
	
	The information, consisting of things observed by the person bringing or maintaining the prosecution, should consist of observations of the prosecution himself, or of things told to him by others, which he must believe to be true;
	
	
	This belief must be based upon reasonable grounds; and,
	
	
	The information possessed by the prosecutor and reasonably believed by him to be true must be such as would justify a man of ordinary prudence and caution in believing that the accused is probably guilty.
	



	
	What the plaintiff must do is to establish that one or more of these conditions do not exist: Mitchell v John Heine & Son Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 466; Nye v New South Wales (2004) ATR 81-725. It is not necessary, however, to establish every one of them. Mr Quickenden submits that Senior Constable Hicks never formed an honest belief that the plaintiff was driving under the influence of alcohol, or that he was resisting arrest, that his evidence as to the indicia of the plaintiff’s alcohol level was contrived, and that the circumstances of his obtaining of the CCTV footage from the golf club are indicative of his knowledge that there was no or no sufficient evidence for the maintaining of the prosecution.
	
	
	The plaintiff has listed the following evidence as being evidence of the defendant’s absence of reasonable and probable belief:
	



	
	Senior Constable Hicks’s evidence was non-specific on the point (see Exhibit B as there was no slurring or mispronouncing of words). Senior Constable Hicks conceded the plaintiff did not appear under the influence of alcohol when in the front yard as shown by Exhibit B.
	
	
	Mrs Nash’s evidence about the plaintiff’s state of sobriety.
	
	
	The absence of evidence of Senior Constable McKay about the plaintiff’s state of insobriety. Senior Constable McKay’s evidence supports the plaintiff and his wife’s evidence.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence about his sobriety.
	
	
	Exhibit H (CCTV of the Golf Club).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks knew he had no objective test of the plaintiff’s sobriety (no breath test, no breath analysis and no sobriety test (T 208 line 42)).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks did not have sufficient opportunity to assess the plaintiff’s driving, for example weaving or speeding.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks knew he had no corroboration of his indicia of alcohol from Mrs Nash, or most importantly, Senior Constable McKay.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks acknowledges his own inconsistent observations about the plaintiff’s state of sobriety (back yard and front yard (T 242 line 22) and sobered up after talking to his brother (T 243 line 34)). This was necessary to get around Exhibit B and no corroboration from Senior Constable McKay.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks acknowledges the plaintiff was not unsteady on his feet until after the struggle (T 223-224).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks was shocked (T 222 line 25) at the home and upset (T 222 line 38).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks knew the plaintiff was challenging his behaviour (T 227 line 43).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks did not believe his evidence of the observations at the scene was satisfactory because he embarked on an investigation at the Golf Club (T 234 line 40) (Exhibit H). After obtaining the flash drive, which is now a DVD, this information did not support the plaintiff was under the influence. Senior Constable Hicks attempts to avoid this by saying the Golf Club deliberately withheld information (T 238 line 12). Senior Constable Hicks did not follow up this alleged fraud on the part of the Golf Club.
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks acknowledged the DVD (Exhibit H) did not support the charge as it was not used (T 39 line 10). Further, it did not evidence the plaintiff was unsteady on his feet (T 240 line 20).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks recognised second part of Exhibit B in front did not show the plaintiff was unsteady on his feet (T 42 line 22).
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks’s version that the plaintiff talked to his brother and sobered up is fanciful (T 243 line 34).
	



	
	The defendant submits that the plaintiff’s failure to stop his car after the lights and sirens were activated was sufficient for the defendant to form the view that the plaintiff was seeking to evade a breath test. My findings of fact are as set out above and I do not accept the version of events given by Mr Hutchings at paragraph 308 of his submissions.
	
	
	As to the resisting arrest charge, the defendant submits that the plaintiff could have come to the kerb to speak to Senior Constable Hicks after Senior Constable Hicks called out that he was under arrest, or stopped in his front yard rather than continued down the side of his house. He could also have asked Senior Constable Hicks to leave, in which case Senior Constable Hicks would have been a trespasser when he came onto the plaintiff’s property. The defendant poses the question, “what controversy was there that the plaintiff had resisted the arrest? The issue appeared to be an accepted fact in the proceedings” (written submissions, paragraph 316-317), which I take to be an assertion that there was reasonable and probable cause by reason of this asserted “accepted fact”.
	


Mr Hutching’s “trespass” argument


	
	Although the plaintiff does not bring a claim of trespass, Mr Hutchings submits that the plaintiff could have asked Senior Constable Hicks to leave the premises, in which case he would have been a trespasser, and that this would be an important factor in the plaintiff’s favour, the inference being that failure to raise the trespass issue undermines the plaintiff’s claim.
	
	
	There have been several cases in the United Kingdom where police officers pursued a person onto his own property for the purpose of making an arrest. Some have arisen from the arrest of persons suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol. In Morris v Beadmore [1981] AC 446 at 465, Scarman LJ stated that the legislation permitting the arrest of drunken drivers must be read as taking into account the overriding intention, “even in its desire to stamp out drunken driving, to pay to the fundamental right of privacy in one's own home, which has for centuries been recognised by the common law.""
	
	
	In Australia, the common law is largely replaced by legislation, and the options open to the person pursued onto his property by the police depend on the legislation as well as the facts of the case (see, for example, Louis v State of Tasmania [2001] TASSC 154 at [29] – [30]).
	
	
	In Drage v Western Australia [2015] WADC 20 Staude DCJ summarised the relevant provisions and cases in Western Australia as follows:
	


“[114] The legislative provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure Act relating to entry of a place may be taken to have been enacted in the light of the common law which was summarised by Lord Scarman in Clowser v Chaplin; Finnigan v Sandiford [1981] 1 WLR 837 (HL), 842–843:

“It is that, as a general rule, the courts will not construe an enactment conferring a power of arrest without warrant as impliedly authorising a power of entry into private premises for the purpose of effecting the arrest. If it be parliament’s intention to confer a power of entry, the draftsman must ensure the power is expressly conferred. Parliament is not to be presumed, in the absence of express words, so to intend, unless the implication is irresistible, which would be rare indeed.”

[115] This dictum was cited by Wallwork J (Kennedy & Ipp JJ) in Hume & Anor v R [1999] WASCA 64 [26], by reference to Dobie v Pinker [1983] WAR 48. Dobie v Pinker was concerned with the operation of s 66 of the Road Traffic Act in circumstances where two police officers pursued the respondent’s vehicle to the point where the respondent brought it to a stop on his residential property. It was held that the police officers were entitled by s 66 to enter upon private property in order to require a suspected driver of a motor vehicle to undergo a preliminary test. On the evidence the respondent did not expressly or impliedly revoke the police officers’ implied authority to be upon his property. It was held for the purposes of s 66 that the police officers had an implied right of entry to private premises to effect an arrest or for other lawful purposes until the same was revoked by the occupier (Wallace & Kennedy JJ).”


	
	In Drage v Western Australia, the plaintiff submitted that any implied licence for the police to enter his property for the purposes of the Road Traffic Act 1974 (WA) was revoked, because he told them they were trespassers and to leave. The plaintiff relied upon the findings of fact and law by the magistrate (who referred to Hume v R). Staude DCJ rejected that submission, noting:
	


“[119] The power of a police officer to enter a place is now provided by s 132. It is no longer to be found in an implied licence, revocable at the occupier’s will. Where, for the purposes of exercising a power of arrest pursuant to s 128, a police officer enters a place pursuant to s 132(2), s 31 applies to require the officer to identify himself or herself in accordance with s 11 to a person who appears to have the control or management of the place and to inform that person of the purpose of the entry unless to do so would, amongst other things, jeopardise the purpose of the entry, in which case the police officer must as soon as practicable after entry, identify himself or herself to the occupier and, relevantly, inform the occupier of the reason, and the statutory authority, for the entry.”


	
	Whether or not the plaintiff had complained of trespassing, and/or whether or not the police officer knew he was trespassing, this issue of trespassing is of no relevance to the question of absence of reasonable and probable cause, or indeed any other issue in these proceedings.
	


Absence of honest belief


	
	I am satisfied that Senior Constable Hicks did not form an honest belief that the plaintiff was driving under the influence of alcohol. He pursued the plaintiff for the purpose of administering a random breath test and became angry when he saw the plaintiff enter residential premises which were more likely than not to be his own home. Instead of accepting that he was no longer in a position to administer an alcotest, Senior Constable Hicks first attempted to persuade the plaintiff to come out from his home by saying “Just here, sir” and then entered the plaintiff’s premises and took the plaintiff into a bear hug for the purpose of arresting him.
	
	
	Further, when it became clear that the plaintiff was indeed on his own home property, Senior Constable Hicks proceeded to charge him. He added a further charge of resisting arrest in circumstances where I am comfortably persuaded from all of the evidence set out above that he was aware of the weakness of the charge of driving under the influence.
	


Failure to tender the police brief


	
	Mr Hutchings takes the point (written submissions, paragraph 297) that the plaintiff did not take what he calls “the customary step” of tendering the police brief and that the plaintiff has failed to prove absence of reasonable and probable cause in respect of either charge. It is submitted that this submission is “fatal to the plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim” (written submissions, paragraph 298). As I have set out elsewhere in this judgment, Senior Constable Hicks was in fact the person who instigated or set in motion the prosecution in the manner explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in New South Wales v Landini at [59] and Cosentino v Kent at [43], so I shall not deal with this issue further.
	


Conclusions concerning absence of reasonable and probable cause


	
	I am comfortably satisfied that at all relevant stages from the moment that Senior Constable Hicks called out to the plaintiff “You’re under arrest” he knew he had no reasonable or probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for any offence, let alone a driving offence. I am also comfortably satisfied that when the additional charge of resisting arrest was preferred against the plaintiff, Senior Constable Hicks, who was aware of his obligations as a police officer and knew that the circumstances in which he attacked the plaintiff in the manner that he did constituted an excessive use of force, did so in circumstances where he had no reasonable grounds to suspect the plaintiff had committed an offence for which he could be convicted.
	
	
	As I note in more detail in the section of this judgment in relation to malice, I consider it to be a pertinent observation that Mrs Nash described Senior Constable Hicks as being “angry”. I am comfortably satisfied that Senior Constable Hicks allowed his anger to override his better judgment and that he arrested the plaintiff in circumstances where, with the benefit of material reflection, he should not have done so. More importantly, he persisted with the laying of a further charge, and when he sought further evidence from the golf club in an endeavour to prove that the plaintiff had consumed an excessive amount of alcohol, this was because he knew that the claim against the plaintiff was lacking in evidence. The video material from the golf club, which was exculpatory of the plaintiff, was withheld from him at the criminal proceedings, but this is irrelevant, in that this may well not have been the decision of Senior Constable Hicks. The relevance of the video material provided by the golf club is that Senior Constable Hicks (who set the prosecution in motion) knew of it, and yet persisted with the continuing of the prosecution.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established absence of reasonable and probable cause.
	


Malice


	
	Proof of malice will be established if the court can find that the dominant purpose of the prosecution was other than the proper invocation of the criminal law (State of New South Wales v Abed [2014] NSWCA 419; New South Wales v Zreika [2011] NSWCA 340).
	
	
	“Malice” is a broadly based concept. It can include, for example, revenge, but it is not necessary to identify precisely what the malicious motive was. Mr Quickenden drew my attention to the following passage from Trobridge v Hardy (1955) 94 CLR 147 at 163-164 per Kitto J:
	


“…That is a method which follows the route — I see no difficulty in calling it the indirect route — of proving that the defendant's conduct is not to be explained by the existence of a right motive. Evidence which tells against the probability that a right motive was the sole or predominant cause of the conduct goes to provide a foundation on which the jury may reason, through the presumption that there must be some explanation of what the defendant did, to the conclusion that he must have been actuated by an inadmissible motive of some kind or other. An example may be found in the case of evidence which shows that the defendant in an action of malicious prosecution had no reasonable or probable cause. That is a question for the judge, though in order to answer it he must accept any findings of the jury on relevant questions of disputed fact. The jury's findings on such questions may have importance, not only for the judge on the question he has to decide, but for themselves on the question of malice which it is for them to decide. They may find that facts were known to the prosecutor such that a reasonable man who knew them would not believe in the guilt of the accused. That may seem to them to make it improbable that the prosecutor in fact believed in the guilt of the accused, although, as they should recognize, there is always the possibility that a belief which appears unreasonable may nevertheless be honestly held, either because the person concerned pursues an unreasonable train of thought or because he is forgetful of or inattentive to factors in the situation, the absence of which would make his belief reasonable. If they think it more probable than not that the prosecutor lacked a belief in the guilt of the accused, they are justified in taking the next step of concluding that the prosecution was not instituted from a genuine desire to serve the ends of justice and is not to be satisfactorily explained save on the supposition that the prosecutor was actuated by an indirect or improper motive. If so, they may legitimately make a finding of malice, even though they may not feel able to say precisely what the malicious motive was. Thus the issue is found, not by the direct persuasion of the primary facts proved, but by the indirect persuasion of the presumption that there must be some rational explanation to account for the acts complained of plus the proved unlikelihood of the defendant's having acted from a proper motive.”


	
	The defendant submits that the plaintiff had not established that either Senior Constable Hicks (who set the prosecution in motion) or the prosecutor did not believe in the charges (written submissions, paragraph 330), let alone that either of them was mistaken in any belief, or had an indirect or improper purpose.
	
	
	The defendant’s written submissions on this issue are very general. Mr Hutchings stated that on the pleaded case and the evidence led “malice cannot be established” (written submissions, paragraph 319) because the plaintiff had failed to identify the dominant purpose (written submissions, paragraphs 320-324). There was “simply no basis in the evidence” to impute any such motive to Senior Constable Hicks (written submissions, paragraph 326) as the plaintiff could not even demonstrate that Senior Constable Hicks was “mistaken in his belief, let alone an indirect or improper purpose [sic]”. It is submitted that the plaintiff has not established that Senior Constable Hicks “did not believe” in the charges he preferred and that the claim of malicious prosecution accordingly “must fail”.
	
	
	The plaintiff submits that the evidence of motivation other than the invocation of criminal law came from the fact that Senior Constable Hicks was angry, in that he was having what Mr Quickenden called “a bad day at the office” after spending three hours stopping vehicles to perform alcotest with negative results. The extent of physical force he used was out of all proportion and an indication that he had lost all perspective. There is some support for this in Exhibit B and the incredulous tone of Senior Constable Hicks when he says “You must be kidding me” when he was told that the plaintiff is indeed on his own property, and that Senior Constable Hicks is on “private property”. The fact that the plaintiff was on his own property is, Mr Quickenden submits, something which Australian law regards as significant (Kuru v New South Wales (2008) 236 CLR 1; New South Wales v Ibbett (2006) 229 CLR 638).
	
	
	While the plaintiff does not have to prove a specific form of malice, or actual motivation, I am satisfied that there is in fact evidence that Senior Constable Hicks had a motive other than the performance of his duties as a constable.
	
	
	All of the evidence points to Senior Constable Hicks having an ancillary dominant improper motive as early as the time that he charged the plaintiff with the first of the two offences. I am satisfied that he continued to display the same improper motive at the time that he laid the second charge, at the time that he wrote the letter to the golf club and at the time that these proceedings were listed for hearing in the Local Court.
	


The plaintiff’s failure to file a Reply particularising malice


	
	In the defendant’s written submissions, the defendant points out (paragraph 7) that the plaintiff did not file a Reply particularising malice. However, Mr Hutchings did not object at any time to the leading of evidence as to malice, and his submissions in relation to malice do not refer to the failure to file a Reply as being a fatal defect. Proceedings in country registries are conducted with a degree of informality, including informalities in pleadings, as a result of the absence of case management other than by timetables filed in directions hearings before Registrars.
	
	
	Taking those practices into account, and having regard to s 63 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), I am of the view that the failure of the plaintiff to file a Reply, in circumstances where there is no objection taken to the leading of evidence as to malice, should not be countered against the plaintiff.
	


Conclusions concerning malice


	
	Taking all of the above matters into account, I am comfortably satisfied that the plaintiff has established malice. The plaintiff has thus established each of the five elements necessary for the tort of malicious prosecution.
	
	
	The plaintiff has been successful in all the claims he has brought. This brings me to the issue of damages.
	


Damages


	
	There were problems in relation to the parties’ submissions as to damages as follows:
	



	
	The defendant’s written submissions for the proposed (but vacated) hearing of 15 December 2014 did not address damages at all.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s submissions in reply were therefore brief, and unnecessarily referred to non-economic loss under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), although s 3B specifically excludes intentional torts. Mr Quickenden’s submissions generally noted that damages were “at large”, but the claims for aggravated and exemplary damages were rolled up in one set of “aggravating factors”.
	
	
	There was uncertainty as to what claims for special damages, out of pocket expenses and legal costs of the prosecution were to be pursued.
	
	
	The defendant was taken by surprise by a claim for exemplary damages on the basis of the conduct at the trial.
	
	
	Neither party addressed on the question of interest, and the plaintiff did not deal with potential overlap between the heads of damage claimed for the respective causes of action.
	
	
	Neither party provided a Schedule of Damages. This is a common problem in country registries, where case management Notices of the kind supplied in the Sydney registry are not used.
	



	
	The plaintiff has now provided a schedule as to the range of damages in relation to the unlawful arrest, battery (assault) and malicious prosecution claims as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Unlawful arrest
			
			 
			 
		
		
			
			Compensatory damages
			
			
			$100,000
			
			
			Range $80,000 to $120,000

			Total
			
			
			$370,000 + special damages of $558.80 + $4,400 (see Exhibit L)
			
			 
		
	


General damages


	
	The claim for general damages in relation to the unlawful arrest and the assault are set out in paragraphs 9 to 11 of the plaintiff’s further submissions on damages. These are identified as follows:
	



	
	The violent nature of the arrest. Senior Constable Hicks took hold of the plaintiff in a bear hug (T 159 line 27). Senior Constable Hicks used his training to unbalance the plaintiff, trip the plaintiff and put the plaintiff on the ground. Senior Constable Hicks pushed his knee into the plaintiff (T 172 line 15 and T 217 line 35);
	
	
	Shock (T 21 line 37);
	
	
	Humiliation (T 23 line 17);
	
	
	Embarrassment (T 25 line 26);
	
	
	Pain including feeling his shoulder was dislocated (T 21 line 40);
	
	
	Off work for 10 days;
	
	
	Physiotherapy (T 34 line 45);
	
	
	There is a summary of the medial evidence in the earlier submissions. This was more than a transient injury. The plaintiff’s left shoulder, bruising and premature hip replacement caused pain, discomfort and inconvenience to the plaintiff; and
	
	
	The photos of the plaintiff in exhibit D (T 39 line 39) indicate the injuries were significant.
	



	
	I have set out below the quantum of general damages for each claim, and considered the claims for aggravated and exemplary damages for each claim separately.
	


Damages for assault and battery


	
	The plaintiff sought medical assistance following these events. Dr Mahaliyana’s notes confirm multiple bruises and abrasions on his upper limbs, a swelling in his left knee and shoulder pain. He still had a slight limp on 7 December 2011. He was referred for physiotherapy and prescribed anti-inflammatory medication. He was still suffering pain when seen by Dr Scullin on 23 June and 29 September 2012, although this was complicated by the unrelated condition which led to his right hip replacement.
	
	
	Additionally, he suffered humiliation and mild Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood was diagnosed on 9 September 2013. The ongoing criminal prosecution was, however, the principal cause.
	
	
	Taking into account the range of damages generally awarded for such claims, I accept that the plaintiff’s claim for $15,000 general damages and $10,000 aggravated damages (discussed in more detail below) is a reasonable amount for the sustained and serious nature of the assault.
	


Damages for wrongful arrest


	
	As Mr Hutchings points out in his written submissions, this claim overlaps with the assault claim.
	
	
	Damages for wrongful arrest are generally higher than damages for use of force during that assault, because of the nature of the claim. The circumstances in which a person may be wrongfully deprived of their liberty and reputation by a police officer are regarded as particularly serious. The arrest power is one of last resort and to be used sparingly.
	
	
	However, the nature of the offence, and the circumstances of the arrest put the plaintiff’s claim at the very bottom of the scale. The plaintiff was not kept in custody. I accept Mr Hutchings’ submissions that the amounts claimed by the plaintiff are outside the range.
	
	
	In Zaravinos v New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 320 an award of $25,000 was made, which included aggravated and exemplary damages. That claim related to heavy-handed behaviour and included detention of the plaintiff for several hours. The plaintiff’s arrest involved ten minutes of being under restraint and occurred at his own home. He was not taken to the police station, or handcuffed, or detained for long periods, or questioned in a record of interview.
	
	
	Taking into account the factual situation of the arrest, as well as the medical evidence relating to the plaintiff’s feelings of humiliation and embarrassment, I propose to award the same sums for the wrongful arrest as for the assault, namely $15,000 general damages and $10,000 aggravated damages.
	


Damages for malicious prosecution


	
	The principles concerning the award of damages for claims for malicious prosecution are set out in New South Wales v Riley (2003) 57 NSWLR 496 at [127], Houda v State of New South Wales [2005] NSWSC 1053, New South Wales v Ibbett (2005) 65 NSWLR 168 at [11]-[12], [21], [123]-[124] and [218] and Coyle v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWCA 95.
	
	
	In New South Wales v Riley at [131] Hodgson JA noted that it was “extremely difficult to quantify damages for hurt feelings” but that where the hurt to feelings was caused by wrongdoing going beyond what his Honour called “ordinary human fallibility”, it would be a mistake for the court to under-compensate the plaintiff. How should the court approach the question of the range of damages for a plaintiff? Should separate sums be awarded for each of the causes of action, and what allowance should be made for overlap? What regard should be had to other awards made for damages for claims of a similar kind? Neither party has addressed this issue.
	
	
	As to the general range of damages sought by the plaintiff, the defendant’s written submissions on damages (at paragraph 10) merely state that:
	


“The authorities make it plain that modest sums are awarded (and not the large sums sought by the plaintiff).”


	
	The principal source of the plaintiff’s humiliation and embarrassment was the fact that the prosecution continued. It was seven months before the charges were heard and determined in his favour. Those charges were laid and maintained without any evidence to support them.
	
	
	Taking into account the facts as I have found them, I consider an appropriate award for general damages would be $50,000. For reasons set out more fully below, I also propose to award aggravated compensatory damages. The amount that I propose to award, having regard to the facts summarised below, is $20,000.
	


Aggravated damages


	
	I have awarded aggravated damages in relation to each of the plaintiff’s claims for damages. These are my reasons for doing so.
	
	
	General damages are awarded for hurt to feelings caused by wrongdoing that goes beyond “ordinary human fallibility” (New South Wales v Riley at [131]). After an award of general damages has been formulated, aggravated damages may be assessed (see New South Wales v Radford (2010) 79 NSWLR 327), but the award of aggravated damages “must only be for the difference justified by this approach, that is, an award of so much as is necessary to bring the damages up to the upper end of the available range” (New South Wales v Riley at [133]).
	
	
	Aggravated damages are “in addition to damages” (McDonald v Coles Myer Ltd (t/as K-Mart Chatswood) (1995) Aust Torts Reports 81-361 per Powell JA) for which general damages are awarded, in that the manner in which the conduct is effected may lead to an award of aggravated compensatory damages, as may the subsequent conduct of the defendant, if it tends to show that the defendant is persevering in the charge. This may also include the conduct of the proceedings.
	
	
	The conduct relied upon by the plaintiff in the claim for aggravated damages as to the unlawful arrest and assault claims is as follows:
	



	
	The unlawful arrest took place at the plaintiff’s home;
	
	
	The unlawful arrest took place in front of members of the plaintiff’s family (T 142 line 39) (wife, mother and daughter);
	
	
	The unlawful arrest took place in front of at least one neighbour (Mr Ford);
	
	
	The plaintiff’s neighbours can be assumed to have been aware of the siren and position of the fully marked police vehicle partly on the plaintiff’s property;
	
	
	On 18 May 2012 the plaintiff was charged with resisting arrest arising out of the same incident (T 36 line 24);
	
	
	The arrest did not have to be violent;
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks was a bigger, fitter and younger man than the plaintiff. Exhibit B evidences Senior Constable Hicks being an imposing figure of authority in the incident at the plaintiff’s home. See exhibit B, particularly at the front of the premises, where Senior Constable Hicks’ manner is inappropriate and authoritative;
	
	
	The plaintiff was fingerprinted at his home in the front yard;
	
	
	Concerned about his reputation (T 34 line 1);
	
	
	The assault/unlawful arrest did not stop but continued at the point where Mrs Nash informed Senior Constable Hicks the plaintiff was her husband and he was at his home (T 216 line 45);
	
	
	Senior Constable Hicks and the defendant attempted to take the moral high ground during the hearing and assert the plaintiff:
	



	
	Tried to evade Senior Constable Hicks;
	
	
	Had a reputation for being intoxicated at the Golf Club (T 45 line 30);
	
	
	Had been charged with a PCA offence;
	
	
	Had been charged with an apprehend violence offence;
	
	
	Tendered his criminal history;
	
	
	It was not put to the plaintiff that he tried to evade Senior Constable Hicks. No evidence was called to establish the plaintiff had a reputation for being intoxicated at the Golf Club. Although the PCA offence and apprehended violence offence may have been relevant on credit issues the cross examination went beyond that relevance.
	



	
	The circumstances of the plaintiff’s arrest alarmed not only the plaintiff’s wife but Mr Ford, who was shocked by what he saw. It was high-handed and contumelious conduct by Senior Constable Hicks, and his continued unnecessary restraint of the plaintiff is relevant both to the claims for assault and for wrongful arrest.
	
	
	The conduct relied upon by the plaintiff as to the claim for aggravated compensatory damages in relation to the malicious prosecution claim is as follows:
	



	
	Senior Constable Hicks was the sole person behind the prosecution (T 244-245);
	
	
	The prosecution continued from 13 October 2011 until 18 May 2012 (i.e. a period of about 7 months);
	
	
	The charge of resisting arrest was added to the prosecution later on the 18 May 2012. This was after Senior Constable Hicks ascertained the plaintiff was pleading not guilty;
	
	
	Senior Constable Hick’s evidence that the plaintiff’s disposition improved after talking to his brother (a solicitor) is illogical and incredible (T 242-243);
	
	
	As set out in the plaintiff’s undated earlier written submissions in paragraph 65 where Senior Constable Hicks misrepresented his intentions to the Golf Club (see exhibit G) and evidence (T 234 line 41 and T 236-237);
	
	
	The plaintiff gave evidence of a friend of his (Matt Jones) saying to the plaintiff that he had heard the plaintiff had lost his licence and would lose his job as a result of the incident (T 46 line 5).
	



	
	Senior Constable Hicks’ conduct in both bringing and maintaining the charges went well beyond what Hodgson J called “ordinary human fallibility”. The conduct set out by Mr Quickenden as set out above is evidence of Senior Constable Hicks acting in a high-handed and contumelious fashion, in circumstances where he not only knew that the evidence consisted of his claim that the plaintiff appeared drunk, but that this evidence was not supported by CCTV which he withheld from the plaintiff’s legal representatives at the criminal proceedings. This is a clear case where aggravated damages should be awarded.
	


Exemplary damages


	
	The relevant principles for exemplary damages are helpfully set out by Hodgson JA in New South Wales v Riley at [136]-[138] as follows:
	


“[136] Mr Maconachie submitted that, in awarding exemplary damages, the primary judge acted contrary to the principle that exemplary damages are an exceptional remedy which are rarely awarded: Gray v Motor Accidents Commission (1998) 196 CLR 1 at [12] and [20]. He submitted that such damages are awarded only where there is ""high-handed, insolent, vindictive or malicious conduct"" amounting to or exhibiting a ""conscious wrong-doing in contumelious disregard of another's rights"": Whitfeld v De Lauret & Co Ltd (1920) 29 CLR 71 at 77, Gray at [14]. Contrary to the view of the primary judge, the present case had little similarity with Adams v Kennedy (2000) 49 NSWLR 78: in that case, there was no provocation, no apprehension of danger, and no concern for the victim's well-being. The provocation could preclude exemplary damages: Fontin v Katapodis (1962) 108 CLR 177 at 187; Lamb v Cotogno (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 13. Further, some of the primary judge's reasons were themselves erroneous: Constables Wallace and Heinjus did not exceed orders given by their commander, and the view that there was a falling away of grounds to justify detention was contrary to the finding that detention was justified under the Mental Health Act.

[137] Mr Toner relied on the submissions set out earlier in relation to aggravated damages. He submitted that the arrest was in breach of procedures laid down to prevent arbitrary arrests; the arresting police exceeded orders given by Sergeant Wilson; the application of physical force was entirely out of proportion to the limited threat, if any; forceful detention persisted after the reason for it fell away; the police conduct was high-handed; comparisons with Adams v Kennedy were justified; and the primary judge did not ignore ""provocation"".

[138] In my opinion, as made clear in Gray, while ""conscious wrong-doing in contumelious disregard of another's rights"" describes the greater part of the field in which exemplary damages may properly be awarded, it does not fully cover that field. Similarly, malice is not essential: Lamb v Cotogno. Conduct may be high-handed, outrageous, and show contempt for the rights of others, even if it is not malicious or even conscious wrong-doing. However, ordinarily conduct attracting exemplary damages will be of this general nature, and the conduct must be such that an award of compensatory damages does not sufficiently express the court's disapproval or (in cases where the defendant stood to gain more than the plaintiff lost) demonstrate that wrongful conduct should not be to the advantage of the wrong-doer.”


	
	Exemplary damages are claimed in relation to each of the causes of action. However, analysis of the basis of the claim shows that specific aspects of the conduct of Senior Constable Hicks have been identified. In those circumstances, I propose to examine the bases upon which the claim is based, rather than examine the entitlement of the plaintiff to exemplary damages for each cause of action.
	
	
	I shall first examine the claim for exemplary damages as set out in paragraph 18 of the statement of claim, which identifies the following conduct by Senior Constable Hicks:
	



	
	Unnecessarily grabbing the plaintiff;
	
	
	Unnecessarily tackling the plaintiff;
	
	
	Unnecessarily pinning the plaintiff to the ground;
	
	
	Unnecessarily threatening the plaintiff with the use of capsicum spray or handcuffs;
	
	
	The assault occurring in view of members of the public including the plaintiff’s family and neighbours.
	



	
	The claim about the capsicum spray and handcuffs was abandoned during the hearing. The other particulars all relate to the circumstances of the plaintiff being forcibly seized by Senior Constable Hicks. There is no reference to the arrest or prosecution as matters warranting exemplary damages.
	
	
	As to the circumstances in which the plaintiff was the victim of an “assault”, there are two further problems. The first is that these particulars are identical to the particulars of aggravated damages set out at paragraph 17 of the statement of claim, for which the plaintiff also seeks damages. While no objection was taken to the rolling up of a claim for aggravated and exemplary damages in McCarthy v New South Wales (in that leave was not granted in relation to a damages award where aggravated and exemplary damages were rolled into one sum), this seems an undesirable practice, particularly since the quantum of exemplary damages should not be determined until after the awards of general and aggravated compensatory damages are determined.
	
	
	The second, and more important, defect is that these particulars do not identify the necessary features outlined by Basten JA in Talovic v New South Wales [2014] NSWCA 33 at [39] – [40]:
	


In deciding to award exemplary damages, the trial judge correctly noted that the purpose of such an award was “to punish the defendant for conduct showing a conscious and contumelious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights and to deter it from engaging in similar conduct in the future”, referring to XL Petroleum (NSW) Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil Australia Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 12; 155 CLR 448 at 471: trial judgment at [228]. The judge also bore in mind that “conduct may be high-handed, outrageous, and show contempt for the rights of others, even if it is not malicious or even conscious wrongdoing”: at [228]. As authority for that proposition the judge referred, appropriately, to State of New South Wales v Riley. The relevant reference was in the judgment of Hodgson JA at [138]. However, the trial judge did not stop to note the conclusion reached by Hodgson JA at [142] in rejecting a claim for exemplary damages in that case. Further, although the trial judge referred to State of New South Wales v Delly [2007] NSWCA 303; 70 NSWLR 125, he did not refer to the remarks of Ipp JA at [25] approving the further reasons given at [115]-[117].

The factors which the judge took into account – at [229] – were all factors concerned with the plaintiff, namely that he was “asleep in his own bed, was causing no harm to anyone and was at no risk of harming himself and was woken by two police officers who searched his unit …”. There was no express finding (nor could there have been) that the police acted with malice. Nor was there any express finding of contumelious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights. A fair reading of the evidence of both constables provides no sufficient basis for any relevant finding in order to justify exemplary damages. That part of the award should be set aside.”


	
	Matters of this kind may be the basis of a claim for aggravated damages (see a similar list in Carter v Walker (2010) 32 VR 1 at [287]) but the basis for a claim for exemplary damages must be that the conduct of the defendants is conduct of the kind described by Basten JA as set out above (compare, in this regard, the basis for the claim for exemplary damages in Carter v Walker at [293].
	
	
	In submissions, Mr Quickenden submitted that these matters amounted to disregard of the plaintiff’s rights. In Talovic v New South Wales at [158], Tobias AJA explains the way in which conduct amounting to a disregard of rights must be established:
	


“There was no finding by his Honour, for example, that Constable Manoukian or Constable Sturevski disregarded Mr Talovic’s rights. It was certainly not put to them that they were not acting in good faith. Even if they were mistaken as to whether or not there were reasonable grounds for forming the belief that Constable Manoukian said he held, that is a totally different matter from concluding that he showed a conscious and contumelious disregard for Mr Talovic’s rights. It was not suggested to Constable Manoukian or Constable Sturevski that their conduct was high-handed or outrageous or that it showed contempt for the rights of Mr Talovic. There was no justification whatsoever for reaching the conclusion that their conduct should be described in that fashion. His Honour clearly erred in awarding exemplary damages.”


	
	I am similarly satisfied that Senior Constable Hicks, while behaving over-zealously in the apprehension of the plaintiff, did not do so in contempt for the rights of the plaintiff. He was under the apprehension that the plaintiff was trying to avoid a breath test. The circumstances of the arrest are not sufficient to warrant an award of exemplary damages.
	
	
	The plaintiff at trial sought exemplary damages on other bases, and in particular on the maintaining of the prosecution after it was apparent that there was insufficient evidence. Although never tendered, it would appear that particulars of the facts and matters relied upon for the claim for exemplary damages were set out in correspondence. One of those particulars was read onto the transcript and is as follows:
	


“QUICKENDEN: Your Honour, it's a legitimate part of the factual matrix and this has been particularised in particulars that were requested and we said this:

""At a time subsequent to the arrest, the police officer attended upon the Golf Club at which the plaintiff attended during the hour prior to his unlawful arrest.  The police officer gave a false document to the secretary and manager of the Shelly Beach Golf Club, alleging a breach of a certain liquor legislation and demanded the supply of CCTV evidence implicating the plaintiff.  As a result, members of the Golf Club became aware of the incident between the plaintiff and the police.  This will be advised.  The plaintiff is""‑‑

HUTCHINGS: The difficulty, your Honour, is that that response is meaningless without this letter.  This letter that is relied upon for that purpose has just been provided to me at the bar table during this senior constable's cross‑examination.

HER HONOUR: Look, with all due respect, what you are obliged to do in particulars is to provide an outline of the case you have to make.  Not to identify the name of the witness who is going to give it or the source of the information.  You could have‑‑

HUTCHINGS: I am not suggesting that's the case, your Honour.” (T 235)


	
	As I went on to indicate at T 235, I consider this letter to be sufficient particularisation for cross-examination in relation to this particular, although it is unclear whether this particular was in fact provided as a particular of exemplary damages or for damages generally.
	
	
	The first objection raised by Mr Hutchings was that this was not particularised in the statement of claim. However, in cases such as these, the question is the manner in which parties conduct their cases, rather than “the niceties of the pleadings” (Carter v Walker at [43], reducing but still permitting a claim for exemplary damages for conduct by police).
	
	
	The circumstances in which this letter was sent under pretext of investigating a potential licensing offence, in circumstances where Senior Constable Hicks was not authorised to do so, are certainly regrettable, and a matter for aggravated damages. Nevertheless, this was an attempt by Senior Constable Hicks to obtain evidence inculpatory of the plaintiff. Had the CCTV showed the plaintiff ordering and consuming alcohol at a level likely to be in excess of the amount consumable to give a positive reading, it may have been material relevant to the criminal proceedings.
	
	
	Does the failure to tender the CCTV at the Local Court, or to advise the plaintiff that it had been obtained, warrant the award of exemplary damages? The plaintiff’s failure to obtain, and tender, the prosecution brief must undermine such a claim. The basis upon which the decision was made to maintain the prosecution after this document was obtained, and the circumstances and reasons in which it was not tendered at the Local Court, or provided to the plaintiff, are unknown. In those circumstances, this claim has not been made out.
	
	
	An additional particular relied upon for exemplary damages was added, albeit in a brief fashion, in the plaintiff’s submissions on damages dated 7 April 2015. Counsel for the plaintiff outlined this as follows (plaintiff’s written submissions of 7 April 2015):
	


“The defendant has failed to appreciate the significance of SC Hicks conduct in this context by trying to justify it. This is relevant on the issues of damages. As stated in paragraph 118 of the plaintiff’s written submissions on damages the defendant’s conduct, including conduct at the trial of the action, is relevant to any assessment of general or aggravated damages (Fleet v District Court of NSW & Ors [1999] NSWCA 363, Spautz v Butterworth (1996) 41 NSWLR 1 and McDonald v Coles Myer Limited (1995) Aust Torts Reports 81-361).”


	
	In oral submissions on 28 April 2015, Mr Quickenden also drew my attention to his reference to the same principle in relation to a claim for aggravated compensatory damages in paragraph 14 of his submissions of 20 February 2015, which was as follows:
	


“In New South Wales aggravated damages are also available where the conduct of the defendant was insulting or reprehensible and inflicted outrage upon the plaintiff's feelings. This is a form of compensatory damages where a person is held up to ridicule or otherwise suffers mentally to a greater extent than the mere physical injury and damage would indicate. (Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (1966) 117 CLR 118 at 151)”


	
	In oral submissions, Mr Quickenden also relied upon the cross-examination of the plaintiff as to his prior criminal history and reputation for drunkenness in the golf club (T 45 line 30)
	
	
	Mr Quickenden’s submissions on this point took the defendant by surprise, as did his oral submissions in support on 28 April 2015, and Mr Hutchings sought leave to adduce further evidence and submissions to reply. To avoid further delay, in proceedings where the issue of damages had already resulted in several adjournments, I made a ruling that I would not award either aggravated or exemplary damages on this basis, and said that I would give reasons in my judgment.
	
	
	My reasons are as follows. Conduct of litigation in the adversarial system by a party, or that party’s legal representatives, is frequently robust. Accusations of reconstructed or false evidence may be made, and submissions may be made which are highly unflattering. However, mere robust defence (which is what occurred in these proceedings) is not sufficient to warrant such an award. Accordingly, no allowance should be made for exemplary damages on this basis either.
	


Special damages


	
	Medical expenses of $558.80 and legal costs in relation to the prosecution of $4,400 (Exhibit L) are not the subject of mathematical or causative challenge.
	


Concluding remarks


	
	A summary of the damages awarded is as follows:
	



	
	Assault and battery (including aggravated damages)   $25,000
	
	
	Wrongful arrest (including aggravated damages)   $25,000
	
	
	Malicious prosecution (including aggravated damages) $70,000
	
	
	Special damages (medical and prosecution costs)   $4,958.80
	


TOTAL: $124,958.80


	
	There will be judgment for the plaintiff for the total sum set out above.
	
	
	The parties have not addressed me on interest. I grant leave to the parties to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the mathematically agreed sums for interest, as well as to confirm the issues of whether interest is to be sought in relation to the legal costs claimed and advise of any changes to the amount of out of pocket expenses for medical treatment. I have also granted liberty to apply in relation to costs.
	


Orders


	
	Judgment for the plaintiff.
	
	
	Liberty to the parties to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the mathematically agreed sum for judgment including any claim for interest.
	
	
	Defendant pay plaintiff’s costs.
	
	
	Liberty to apply in relation to order 2, interest and costs.
	
	
	Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		06 August 2015",2015-06-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766867,York v Morgan [2015] NSWDC 109,"Judgment


	
	This is an application by the plaintiff pursuant to s 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) to extend the limitation period of one year for the commencement of defamation proceedings under s 14B of that legislation.
	
	
	The plaintiff, who at all relevant times has acted for himself, commenced proceedings in the Parramatta registry of this court by statement of claim filed on 6 May 2014 (as amended on 4 March 201), pleading a claim for defamation against the defendants as follows:
	


“4. Defendants falsely stated in both internal and external school report that Mr York on a number of occasions exposed his penis to students in a weekly swimming program. As a result of Defendants’ affirmative statements of fact, Mr York has incurred substantial loss of reputation and severe emotional distress. Mr York employment has ended with the DEC as a result of the statements and the loss of his reputation.

…

5. Defendants negligently or maliciously published false, defamatory statements of fact about the Plaintiff, a school teacher. The false statements include, but not limited to: (a) Mr York engaged in conduct which could amount to misconduct; (b) in that, more than one occasion Mr York undressed in the presence of students attending a weekly swimming program; and (c) Mr York exposed his penis.”


	
	The plaintiff has at all relevant times had difficulty identifying the precise form of the publication (or publications), but is nevertheless able to set out in his pleading the imputations which he asserts are likely to arise, namely:
	



	
	Falsely accusing Mr York of child abuse; and
	
	
	Stating Mr York engaged in conduct which could amount to misconduct; and
	
	
	Stating Mr York on more than one occasion undressed in the presence of students attending a weekly swimming program; and
	
	
	Stating Mr York exposed his penis to students; and
	
	
	Portraying Mr York as being a Paedophile.
	



	
	As the dates for these publications fall three weeks outside the limitation period, the plaintiff filed a notice of motion on 2 April 2015 seeking leave to extend the limitation period to the date upon which proceedings were commenced, namely 6 May 2014.
	


The relevant principles


	
	Section 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) provides:
	


“14B Defamation

An action on a cause of action for defamation is not maintainable if brought after the end of a limitation period of 1 year running from the date of the publication of the matter complained of.”


	
	The limitation period may be extended in accordance with s 56A:
	


“56A Extension of limitation period by court 

(1) A person claiming to have a cause of action for defamation may apply to the court for an order extending the limitation period for the cause of action.

(2) A court must, if satisfied that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within 1 year from the date of the publication, extend the limitation period mentioned in section 14B to a period of up to 3 years running from the date of the publication.

(3) A court may not order the extension of the limitation period for a cause of action for defamation other than in the circumstances specified in subsection (2).”


	
	The statutory provisions are a difficult hurdle for a plaintiff to overcome. The principles are summarised by Hislop J in Cassar v Network Ten Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 680 at [16] as follows:
	


“[16] It has been held in respect of s 56A (or its equivalent in other States) that:

(a) the burden that must be discharged is to establish that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff to have commenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within one year from the date of the publication — Noonan v MacLennan [2010] QCA 50; [2010] 2 Qd R 537; Rayney v Western Australia (No 3) [2010] WASC 83 at [41];

(b) the onus rests with the plaintiff — Rayney [41], Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676; Carey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2010] NSWSC 709; (2010) 77 NSWLR 136 at [45];

(c) the test is objective — Noonan [20], Carey [48];

(d) it is a difficult hurdle for a plaintiff to overcome unless there are some unusual circumstances — Rayney [41];

(e) if the plaintiff proves the fact then the court is obliged to extend time. Extension in these circumstances is mandatory — Ahmed [28], Carey [45];

(f) section 56A limits the period of extension to an extension “of up to three years running from the date of publication”. This has been described as involving the exercise of a discretion in the sense of involving a normative judgment — Ritson v Gay and Lesbian Community Publishing Ltd [2012] NSWSC 483 at [24], [25].”


	
	As Beazley JA noted in Carey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2012) 84 NSWLR 90 at [55], the test does not direct attention to whether it was reasonable not to have commenced proceedings, but instead requires the court to be satisfied that it was “not reasonable” to have commenced the action prior to expiry of the limitation period.
	
	
	The harshness of the test has been remarked upon in a number of judgments, notably Rayney v State of Western Australia (No 3) [2010] WASC 83 at [41] and Wookey v Quigley (No 2) [2010] WASC 209. It is irrelevant that a plaintiff is in poor health, or lives in a remote rural community where access to legal advice is limited, or seeks alternatives to commencing proceedings to find out who has defamed him. All of those factors are present in this case. Indeed, the facts of this case are a particularly good illustration of the hardships caused to plaintiffs who essentially know only in general terms what was said, where there is doubt as to when and to whom the statement was made, and who have limited resources and little in the way of skilled legal assistance.
	
	
	The problem is that the legislation requires, as Kenneth Martin J notes in Wookey v Quigley (No 2) at [47], that where a person does not know the content of a publication, and only knows of its existence in circumstances where they suspect it may be defamatory, that person “would ordinarily be expected to take prompt steps to obtain access to the publication”. What Kenneth Martin J does not say is how those steps should be taken, but it is clear from decisions such as Noonan v MacLennan [2010] QCA 50 and Pingel v Toowoomba Newspapers Pty Ltd [2010] QCA 175 that those steps require the commencement of proceedings. In Pingel v Toowoomba Newspapers Pty Ltd the court held that even attempts to obtain an apology or retraction under the uniform legislation, in the form of an Offer of Amends, was not an excuse for failing to commence defamation proceedings within one year of publication.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s explanation for this three week delay (apart from his ill health and lack of legal advice) is that he thought that he had to exhaust his remedies in other courts to find out about these publications, there being proceedings between the parties in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales (Stephen York and NSW Department of Education and Communities [2015] NSWIRComm 1011), as well as through employment-related administrative procedures relating to the circumstances in which he sought to response to the complaints in question. He also thought he had one year from the date he found out about the publication, and not from the date of publication. His mistaken interpretation of the law is no excuse, as Keane JA noted in Noonan v MacLennan [2010] 2 Qd R 537 at [22]:
	


“[22] Consideration of the issue of reasonableness must commence from the position that the Act lays down strict time limits for the commencement of proceedings for damages for defamation. No doubt the legislature was moved to fix these strict limits for good reason. These limits are part of the law of the land to be observed by all persons save where s 32A (2) is engaged. And on any view of s 32A (2) of the Act, it operates by reference to what is reasonable. Mere ignorance of the strict time limits fixed by the Act cannot afford a reasonable basis for not complying with them. Generally speaking, ignorance of the law has never been thought to be a reasonable basis to relieve a person of the consequence of non-compliance with the law.”


	
	One of the few exceptions is where the plaintiff is unaware of the publication, or unable to identify the publisher or prove publication (Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676 at [52]). Simpson J went on to say that another exception may be where the plaintiff is engaged in “non-litigious processes to vindicate his or her rights” (at [52]), which at first sight would appear to give some hope.
	
	
	Unfortunately, her Honour’s observations on this issue have not met with approval in other courts. The fact that a plaintiff is pursuing other avenues of redress is irrelevant: Ritson v Gay and Lesbian Community Publishing Ltd [2012] NSWSC 483 at [13]-[27]. This is reinforced by the Queensland Court of Appeal’s decision in Pingel v Toowoomba Newspapers Ltd, where an application for extension was refused although the plaintiff was engaged in precisely the kind of activity that Simpson J appears to have been referring to, namely negotiating an Offer of Amends. (Applegarth J, dissenting, noted at [178] - [180] the inconsistency between refusal to extend time and the policy of the legislation to promote alternatives to litigation). Using what Simpson J called “non-litigious processes” to vindicate a plaintiff’s rights is thus an insufficient basis for an extension of the limitation period.
	
	
	Where a plaintiff discovers that a defamatory publication exists, but cannot prove, prior to the limitation period expiry, who said it, or what was said, or whether it is actionable, what should he or she do? A plaintiff has three options:
	



	
	Bring an application for pre-action discovery against a wide range of persons (Snezana Angeleska (Known As Slaveska) v State of Victoria and Others (According To The Attached Schedule) [2015] VSCA 140 at [119] – [126]; Han v Australian Kung Fu (Wu Shu) Federation Inc [2011] VSC 498 at [22]). This could be an expensive and time-consuming process, and the risk would be that the correct person might not be identified before the limitation period expires.
	
	
	Throw caution to the winds and commence proceedings in the hope of discovering further publications, either by an application for leave to administer interrogatories as to publication (Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd [1982] 1 NSWLR 294) or, if there is at least one publication to go on with, to bring further applications during the conduct of the proceedings: Riske v Oxley Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1611. This would be an expensive course if the wrong defendants were sued.
	
	
	Although it may sound like a course which is contrary to natural justice, a plaintiff can commence proceedings and simply not serve the statement of claim on the defendants. In Hunter v Hanson [2014] NSWCA 263 at [72] the Court acknowledged that a plaintiff who feared to commence proceedings in case the publication was made on an occasion of absolute privilege was thereby facing the “high” test under s 56A if he failed to commence proceedings; a plaintiff in those circumstances was therefore “between Scylla and Charybdis”. The court held (by majority) that the course taken by the plaintiff of commencing proceedings but withholding service for one and a half years (rather than serving them within the one-month period to effect service) was entitled to do so. However, this requires the court to continue to extend the time for service of the statement of claim, which not all courts may be prepared to do.
	
	
	Wait until one or more of the defendants publish further material within time (preferably on the Internet). This would require a grant of leave under s 23 if previous proceedings had been commenced, but would not require leave if proceedings had not been commenced (Leech v Green & Gold Energy Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 999 at [8]). The defendant cannot be heard to complain about failure to bring prior proceedings: Moran v Schwartz (No 3) [2015] WASC 215 at [52] – [74].
	



	
	The strict test in s 56A has in fact been substantially undermined by modern technology, due to the failure of the legislation to implement the single publication rule. As a result, limitation arguments (particularly against media, website or social media publishers) are now much less common, because of the ease and continuous nature of electronic publication. There is a fresh publication with every download, which means there is no single date of publication of the kind traditionally the case for print media. If any of these publications had been available on the Internet, this application would not have been necessary. For example, in Leech v Green & Gold Energy Pty Ltd, a plaintiff defamed on the Internet since 2007 (well outside even the 3-year limitation period) simply restricted the claim for damages to the year prior to commencing proceedings; no reduction of those damages for the delay in commencing proceedings was considered necessary by the trial judge, nor did the trial judge comment on the plaintiff’s dilatoriness in commencing proceedings.
	
	
	However, the plaintiff in these proceedings took none of these steps, and the test under s 56A (“not reasonable” to have commenced proceedings) must therefore be applied.
	


“Not reasonable” to have commenced proceedings


	
	It is not in dispute that proceedings are not maintainable without an order extending time. The plaintiff must therefore satisfy the court that it was not reasonable for him to have commenced proceedings by 12 April 2014.
	
	
	The statement of claim filed in these proceedings did in fact identify the statements made by Mr Morgan to the Performance and Conduct Unit of the Department of Education and Training in paragraphs 19, 23 and 25. This included Mr Morgan’s conduct, in or about April 2013, in altering the words of the original complaint from “one occasion” to “a number of occasions” and adding in the allegations of misconduct which lay at the heart of this unmeritoriously altered complaint, namely that the plaintiff exposed his penis to students. This had never formed a part of the original complaint, which had only been of the student seeing the plaintiff undressing in the inadequate sports changing room cubicle provided to the plaintiff for that purpose, a complaint that had been resolved in favour of the plaintiff.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff was sufficiently aware of the publications in question prior to the expiry of the limitation period, notwithstanding the fact that he only recently obtained the actual publication upon which he bases this claim, this being information he obtained on subpoena (which is in itself another problem: Miller v R L Polk & Co (Australia) Pty Ltd, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 4 July 1985). It is therefore not reasonable for the plaintiff not to have commenced proceedings until 6 May 2014, taking into account that he could have done so a matter of weeks earlier and still have been within the limitation period.
	
	
	The plaintiff complains that the defendants were less than frank in providing him with the material he sought. Nevertheless, his submission that this amounts to fraud is not made out, as there was no concealment of the identity of the person making the claim (cf Piscioneri v Reardon [2015] ACTSC 61) and, additionally, the likelihood of vicarious liability of the fifth defendant for the statements of its servants or agents (whoever they may have been) was already known to the plaintiff.
	
	
	The plaintiff submits that the court should exercise its discretion in his favour to extend time. However, s 56A does not afford any such discretion. This means I cannot take into account the fact that the plaintiff lives in a remote rural part of New South Wales, many hours’ travel from the office of a solicitor, or his health problems, or the fact that he thought the 12-month period ran from the date of his first learning of these publications (namely a letter handed to him on 15 May 2013) when in fact the period runs from the date of publication of the matters complained of. Nor can I take into account the unfairness arising from the raising of an allegation already known, from prior investigation, to be groundless, the circumstances of the alteration of that complaint, and the amount of litigation and personal upheaval that this has caused to him.
	
	
	Accordingly, an extension of time cannot be granted, and both the notice of motion and the proceedings should be dismissed.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff filed the statement of claim on 6 May 2014 in the Parramatta Registry. The proceedings were listed on two occasions (26 June and 13 November 2014) before the parties were able to have the matter transferred to the Defamation List in Sydney at the commencement of 2015, a delay of seven months. This delay is no fault of the parties.
	
	
	The defendants have taken a responsible and constructive approach to the conduct of this litigation, as is appropriate given the State of New South Wales’ position as a model litigant. I am indebted to Ms Chrysanthou for her careful and helpful submissions. While costs should follow the event, the exceptional facts of this case, the plaintiff’s ongoing health problems and the circumstances in which he has struggled to respond to a groundless complaint of great seriousness, all warrant a departure from the usual rule. Accordingly, there should be no order as to costs.
	


Orders


	
	Plaintiff’s application to extend time pursuant to ss 14B and 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) is dismissed.
	
	
	Statement of claim struck out and dismissed.
	
	
	No order as to costs.

2766869,R v Hsu [2015] NSWDC 186,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Those involved in the importation of drugs into Australia perform various roles. The Mr Bigs of the drug world often rely on others to perform those essential roles which place them at a much higher risk of detection than those higher up in the hierarchy. In this case the offender, Wei Lun Hsu, was one of those who performed an essential role who was detected for what he was doing. It is not a matter of mitigation when sentencing this offender that there were others higher up in the organisation. His role was significant and he went into this very much with his eyes open.
	
	
	In late May 2014 an unknown person took over a lease of premises at Riverwood. It was to this address that a consignment of what appeared to be LED down-lights was to be delivered. The offender flew into Australia on 21 June 2014 specifically for the purpose of facilitating receipt of the importation. A week after he arrived, an examination of the down-lights was conducted by the authorities. It revealed that there was a very large quantity of methylamphetamine concealed within the consignment, the total pure weight of the methamphetamine being 31 and a half kilos which had at the time a street value of about $10 million.
	
	
	A controlled delivery of the consignment was made to the address at Riverwood. The offender was there at the time, but he did not actually receive the consignment from the police officers posing as delivery drivers. After the consignment was left in the carport, the offender took one of the boxes in a taxi to the area of the Entertainment Centre. He was seen to communicate over a mobile phone and also using an iPad with someone else. As part of that communication he took a photo of the contents of this box. Presumably that was enough to alert someone to the circumstance that police had been involved, because the offender then abandoned the box and headed to the airport to get his prearranged flight home.
	
	
	The offender was arrested before he could get to the airport. In his possession he was found to have four mobile phones, an unused Optus SIM card, an iPad which had apparently had a factory reset performed on it, a photocopy of a Republic of China passport in the name of the person to whom the consignment was to be delivered, and his travel booking for return to his home in Taiwan.
	
	
	The offender was interviewed by police and explained that what he was doing he did at the direction of a man by the name of Ah Cheng, the person who had paid for his ticket to come to Australia. Ah Cheng asked him to move into the premises which had been rented earlier, to take receipt of the goods, to take a box with him to Chinatown to show a friend of Mr Ah Cheng’s, to take the photograph using his iPad which he was observed taking, to send it to Ah Cheng, and then to restore the iPad to its factory setting, presumably after police involvement was detected.
	
	
	This was a significant importation which was fortunately detected by police before that very large quantity of drugs could be distributed to drug users. Drugs are terrible things. They cause misery, they cause crime, and the effects of importations of this size are enormous. It is fortunate, as I say, that these drugs were never distributed to users through the good work of Customs and police. The offender knew of course of the illegality of what he was doing and the whole purpose of his travel to Australia was to facilitate this importation. His role, as I mentioned earlier, was an essential one, even if it was limited and he only acted at the direction of others. It is important to recognise that the Crown has charged him with aiding and abetting the importation, which is a significant indication of the role which the prosecution ascribes to this offender. Nevertheless his conduct was serious indeed.
	
	
	The quantity is remarkable. It is 42 times the threshold of the commercial quantity and the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. Of course, the quantity of drugs involved in the importation is not to be given primary consideration in determining the appropriate sentence, but it remains a very relevant factor in determining what sentence should be imposed.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence before me but relied on the contents of a psychological report prepared at the request of his instructing solicitors. Ordinarily I might have some scepticism about claims made in a psychological report which are not backed up by an offender giving sworn evidence, but not in this case because there is nothing in the psychological report which would seek to explain or excuse the offender’s conduct.
	
	
	He grew up in Taipei, the eldest of four children. He has a close and loving relationship with his parents, who owned a restaurant in which the offender worked from time to time. He has a good work history with only short periods of unemployment in between jobs and was expecting to have a greater involvement in the family restaurant later on. There are no significant issues with drugs or alcohol and there is, as I have said before, nothing to suggest any reason that the offender committed this offence. He was not short of money, he did not have gambling problems, he did not owe debts to drug dealers, and he was not one of those people who lacked moral guidance from his parents as he grew up. The offender’s decision to commit this serious criminal offence appears to have been one which he made very much as a calculated decision in order to obtain some form of financial reward. There is nothing of a psychological or psychiatric nature to explain his wrongdoing. The psychological report does make reference to depression, but accurately in my view attributes that to the fact that the offender has been arrested and is facing a significant sentence of imprisonment in a foreign country.
	
	
	The offender has some limited criminal history in Taiwan for fraud matters. The Crown says he also has an assault conviction, but he denied that to the psychologist, and because it makes no difference to the ultimate result I will ignore any suggestion that he has a conviction for assault.
	
	
	He clearly does not speak English well and that may be understating it. The interview from which the psychological report was produced was conducted in Mandarin - Mr Hsu is assisted by interpreter in court today - and in the psychological report it is reported that the offender relies on Mandarin speaking prisoners to convey information to prison officers. The fact that he is in prison in a foreign country means that his opportunities to speak to his family members over the telephone are limited because of the expense involved, and to receive personal face-to-face visits will be even more limited than would be the case if Mr Hsu was serving a sentence in a country where his family lived. He will thus do his sentence harder than would ordinarily be the case. As the Crown accurately points out however, not too much can be made of this. The offender made the deliberate decision to come to Australia, a foreign country, and commit the offence, and can hardly complain when he is required to serve his sentence in that foreign country.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and in recognition of his willingness to facilitate the course of justice, I will impose upon him a sentence which is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Of course, general deterrence is of significant importance in this sentencing exercise. Ideally I would be sentencing one of the organisers, someone higher up in the hierarchy, but that is rarely the case. But it is important to recognise that the offender does not get a benefit because others more involved in this offence remain free. I have to impose a sentence on this offender for what he did, and even though his role was limited, as I have explained, his deliberate decision to commit this serious crime needs to be marked by a significant sentence so that others who contemplate doing what the offender did may pause. Courts attempt to reduce the problems which drug use results in primarily through imposing sentences which will act as a deterrent to others who facilitate the importation of harmful drugs as the offender did. There should be no mitigation of that principle simply because the Mr Bigs of the drug trade are often difficult to detect and relatively rarely face punishment for their much more serious misconduct.
	
	
	I have been assisted by some comparative cases which both the Crown and Mr Averre for the offender have provided to me. Of course, no two cases are the same, but I have been able to identify the differences between those comparative cases and the present, in particular by noting the difference between the various roles played by the various offenders in those other cases and the offender’s role in this case.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of seven years to date from 21 July 2014, the day on which the offender went into custody. I set a head sentence of 12 years. The non-parole period will thus expire on 20 July 2021, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	Mr Hsu, I am required to explain that sentence to you. I see the interpreter has just done that but let me make sure that you do understand. Your sentence has started from the day you were arrested. From that day you must serve seven years at least in gaol. The earliest possible day you can get out is 20 July 2021. Whether you get out on that day or not depends not on me but on the parole authorities, but you cannot be kept in custody after 20 July 2026.

2766889,R v Biljuh (No 5) [2015] NSWSC 775,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	An issue has arisen whether manslaughter should be left to the jury. It requires determination now, before the commencement of final addresses, so that the parties can address on it if it is to be left. Defence counsel has submitted that it should be left; the Crown Prosecutor has submitted that it should not.
	
	
	The issue of the circumstances in which manslaughter should be left to a jury in a trial on a count of murder has been discussed in a number of recent decisions of the High Court of Australia and in the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State, including R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385, James v R [2014] HCA 6; 88 ALJR 427, and Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317. The latest encapsulation of the question I must answer of which I am aware is contained in the decision of Hoskins v R [2014] NSWCCA 207 at [6]. In short, the question is whether manslaughter is a viable alternative verdict because there is evidence in the trial to support it.
	
	
	In order to answer that question, it is necessary to give an outline of the evidence in the trial.
	
	
	The Crown case is that, at about 7 AM on 14 February 2014, somebody attended at the premises of the home of the deceased, an elderly but by no means frail lady living in the Sydney suburb of Villawood, and deliberately (that is, by way of a voluntary act) asphyxiated her. The Crown case is also that that person is the accused, one of her sons.
	
	
	Death was caused either by strangulation (evidenced by various injuries to the throat of the deceased, including the breaking of a small bone within its internal structure and separately by petechial haemorrhages in a number of locations) or by suffocation (evidenced by a large amount of duct tape that was neatly and very tightly wrapped around the head of the deceased, completely covering her nose and mouth). A forensic pathologist, who was called in the Crown case, was unable to determine which act directly caused death – strangulation or suffocation – but one of them unquestionably did so.
	
	
	She also indicated that, in older people, the bone in question is rather brittle, and she was unable to estimate the degree or duration of force that would have been required to be applied to the throat of the deceased in order to break the bone and inflict the other injuries in that area. She also accepted that the various bruises and lacerations to the deceased may not have been inflicted with a weapon.
	
	
	The other pertinent evidence in the Crown case is as follows. The deceased was found in a granny flat at the rear of her home. Grass was found on and near her body. That, combined with the position of the dress she was wearing, permits one safely to infer that the body had been dragged from the home to the granny flat, thereby coming into contact with some part of the back lawn.
	
	
	A neighbour heard a voice coming from the vicinity of the granny flat that one can infer was that of the perpetrator. The neighbour was very close to the granny flat, but heard no sign of a struggle or any screams or cries of the deceased.
	
	
	There were some injuries to the person of the deceased generally, including her face and her right shoulder, but none that could have been fatal, or that one would expect to have caused unconsciousness.
	
	
	To my mind, the deceased must have been strangled into at least unconsciousness in her home. If it had been otherwise, and the deceased was conscious as she was being dragged to the granny flat, the neighbour would surely have heard struggles or cries. In all likelihood, the duct tape was applied in the granny flat, a proposition supported by the finding of a roll of similar (but by no means identical) tape at Marker H within that structure, although it is true that the possibility that the head of the deceased was taped in the home cannot be ruled out.
	
	
	The fact that the duct tape was applied so neatly leads inevitably to the conclusion that the deceased was either unconscious or dead or (to my mind, a slim possibility) very rigorously restrained at the time of its application.
	
	
	Finally, by way of background, in his opening to the jury, I understood defence counsel to be informing them that there would be no issue that someone murdered the deceased; the only question for their determination would be whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that person was the accused.
	
	
	It is in that evidential and procedural context that it was submitted that manslaughter is available. In support of that, it was submitted that there is a hypothesis on the undisputed evidence that is consistent with the absence of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or death on the part of the perpetrator. That hypothesis was said to arise as follows.
	
	
	The perpetrator strangled the deceased into unconsciousness, but without intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm; perhaps he or she was acting in a rage. Then, he or she bodily dragged a 70-year-old unconscious woman some distance to the granny flat without intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or death. Thereafter, believing the deceased to be already dead, the perpetrator applied the duct tape, not with an intention to kill by way of suffocation, but rather to denigrate the deceased or perhaps to inflict great mental suffering on Mr Nenad Biljuh, another son of the deceased, who lived in the granny flat and whom one would expect would find the body.
	
	
	In other words, the 70 year old deceased was bashed, strangled, dragged and had tape applied to the entirety of her face without an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	In short, it was submitted that it is possible to construct a hypothesis whereby all of these things were done by the perpetrator to the deceased, but without an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. Consequently, it was submitted that manslaughter should be left to the jury.
	
	
	I agree it is possible to construct such a hypothesis. But I mean no disrespect whatsoever to defence counsel when I describe it as a thoroughly fanciful one.
	
	
	To my mind, it is not viable to say that the perpetrator, in strangling an elderly woman into unconsciousness, dragging her some distance, inflicting injuries upon her body and head, and thereafter placing duct tape over her entire face (with the absolutely inevitable consequence that any person still breathing would suffocate) did not, at the very least, intend to inflict grievous bodily harm. Indeed, to my mind there is a very strong case that the perpetrator intended to kill the deceased.
	
	
	In undertaking my analysis, I have borne in mind that, as a practical matter, a trial judge should err on the side of caution in leaving the alternative form of homicide; that the positions of the parties are not determinative of the question; and the principle that, within a continuing course of conduct, there need not be strict temporal concurrence between the necessary mental element for murder and the physical element of a voluntary act causing death: Thabo Meli & Ors v R [1954] 1 All ER 373.
	
	
	In short, on the undisputed evidence in the Crown case, the proposition that the perpetrator merely committed the offence of manslaughter is, in my opinion, simply not viable. There is no evidence in the trial to support it. I do not accept that these acts were able to be committed without an accompanying intention to inflict at least grievous bodily harm. And for me to direct the jury about manslaughter in those circumstances would, I consider, thoroughly bewilder them.
	
	
	It is for the foregoing reasons that I do not propose to leave manslaughter to the jury.

2766891,R v Biljuh (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 774,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Objection has been taken to a question asked by the learned Crown Prosecutor of the accused in the witness box with regard to the timing of, and reasons for, the accused developing very negative relationships with members of his family. Although there was other evidence to that effect in the Crown case, this particular evidence was not part of the Crown case, although I am told that it was disclosed to the accused's solicitors.
	
	
	Each of the parties helpfully took me to the decision of The Queen v Soma [2003] HCA 13; (2003) 212 CLR 299. They made a joint submission that that was the decision upon which I should focus my thinking. That was a case in which a prior inconsistent statement was put to an accused person without objection in the witness box when that statement had not been part of the Crown case. To state things very succinctly, the High Court came to the position that that should not have occurred, because the prior inconsistent statement was relevant and admissible and could have been led in the Crown case.
	
	
	In this case, to my mind, there has not been any (or certainly any substantive) alteration in the position of the accused since the start of the trial. Defence counsel opened on the simple basis that the accused had not murdered his mother, and otherwise made it sufficiently clear that there would be no dispute that somebody else had done so.
	
	
	It is also the case that, in examination-in-chief and in the early parts of his cross-examination, the accused accepted an important part of the Crown case; namely, that the accused had had a very negative relationship with his mother and, perhaps to a lesser extent, with his brother and sister.
	
	
	In other words, it is not a matter of there being a prior inconsistent statement or anything else suggestive of some sort of change of position on the part of the accused. It is simply a matter of the accused maintaining his position, and indeed accepting the position, that he and his mother enjoyed an extremely poor relationship.
	
	
	To my mind, the evidence that is now sought to be adduced, through the accused, was relevant and otherwise admissible evidence that could have been led in the Crown case. For me to permit it to be led in this way now, during the defence case, would be contrary to what was said by the plurality in The Queen v Soma at [31] to [40]; contrary to what was said by McHugh J at [58] to [65]; and inconsistent with what was said by Callinan J at [112] to [113] and at [119].
	
	
	For those reasons, I propose to uphold the objection and reject the last question asked by the Crown Prosecutor.

2766909,Crowe v DPP (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 747,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR:
	


Nature of proceedings

The plaintiff has been charged with the following offences:


	
	That on or about 29 October 2013 she did murder Mahmoud Hamzy.
	
	
	That on or about 29 October 2013 she did cause grievous bodily harm to Omar Ajaj.
	
	
	That between 1 October and 30 October 2013 she did conspire and agree to murder Mohammed Hamzy.
	



	
	In the course of committal proceedings on 10 March 2015, the plaintiff made an application to cross examine a number of prosecution witnesses under s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the s 91 application).
	
	
	On 16 March 2015 his Honour Still LCM refused the plaintiff’s application and delivered his reasons. The committal proceedings were adjourned to 15 April 2015. On 15 April 2015 his Honour committed the plaintiff for trial in the Supreme Court.
	
	
	By a Further Amended Summons filed 26 May 2015, the plaintiff seeks judicial review under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 in relation to the refusal of the s 91 application. The plaintiff seeks to quash the order of the learned magistrate, together with a further order remitting the committal to his Honour to be dealt with according to law.
	
	
	This judgment relates to that Further Amended Summons.
	


Factual background


	
	In order to understand the application, it is necessary to provide the context within which the Crown alleges that the plaintiff’s offending occurred. The following is taken from the Crown Case Statement. It is not a statement of fact per se, but sets out the allegations of fact upon which the Crown relies.
	
	
	The Brothers for Life (BFL) gang was started in gaol by Bassam Hamzy and his cousins, including Ghassan Hamzy and Mohammed ‘Hamoudie’ Hamzy. The BFL became a well known criminal group mostly comprising Islamic males of Afghani and Middle Eastern background.
	
	
	In 2013 the BFL had two main factions, Bankstown and Blacktown. At that time, Mohammed ‘Hamoudie’ Hamzy ran the Bankstown faction and one of the co-accused, Farhad Qaumi had the leadership of the Blacktown faction.
	
	
	When Farhad Qaumi took over the leadership of the Blacktown faction, he was able to control and direct its criminal activities. He did so with the assistance of his two brothers, Mumtaz and Jamil. During his time in charge, the criminal activities of the BFL Blacktown faction comprised shootings at individuals, home invasions, other firearm offences, the supply of prohibited drugs and a “contract murder”.
	
	
	By late 2013, in addition to this offending, the BFL Bankstown and Blacktown factions became involved in a conflict as a result of Farhad Qaumi attempting to exert stronger influence over the entire BFL.
	
	
	A close confidant of Farhad Qaumi during this period was the plaintiff, who also had strong affiliations with members of the Bankstown BFL faction. It is the Crown case that during this struggle between the two factions, Farhad Qaumi and/or his brothers Jamil and Mumtaz, along with the plaintiff were involved in, and directed, other members of BFL Blacktown to commit multiple shootings, including a second murder, in a bid to overpower the Bankstown faction, whose members were primarily of Lebanese background.
	
	
	A large part of the Crown case against the plaintiff depends upon witnesses “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “G”, “I”, “J”, “K” and “L”, who were also members/associates of the Blacktown BFL. Those persons are expected to give evidence about their knowledge of the background and the “general” nature of the activities of BFL Blacktown in the time they were involved such as conducting “drug rips”. In addition, they are expected to give first hand evidence of “specific” criminal offending that they played a role in, along with the relevant co-accused including the plaintiff, as reflected in the counts on the indictment.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that on 28 October 2013 the plaintiff approached Farhad Qaumi and told him that Mohammed ‘Hamoudie’ Hamzy was trying to have him killed. After making some inquiries, Farhad Qaumi told a group of the BFL Blacktown faction, which included witness L, Jamil Qaumi and Mohammed Zarshoy that Mohammed ‘Hamoudie’ Hamzy had to be killed. It was decided that the plaintiff would drive those three persons to Mohammed “Hamoudie” Hamzy’s residence because she had been to the house previously and knew the area well. The plaintiff is said to have advised the group that they would have to wait until later in the evening as Mohammed Hamzy had bail conditions requiring him to be home before 11pm. She also advised that Mohammed Hamzy and his associates always sat in the garage of his home to socialise after the curfew came into effect.
	
	
	At 11.30pm on 28 October 2013 Mahmoud Hamzy and Omar Ajaj had visited their cousin Mohammed ‘Hamoudie’ Hamzy at his residence. They were socialising inside the garage with some other persons including Mehmet Yarar. The plaintiff is said to have driven the vehicle close to the residence. Jamil Qaumi, Zarshoy and witness L alighted from the vehicle and walked towards the residence. When they reached the front of the residence, they ran into the garage and began firing their firearms. As they did this, Mohammed ‘Hamoudie’ Hamzy and Mehmet Yarar ran for a door leading into the house and escaped unscathed. Both Mahmoud Hamzy and Omar Ajaj fell to the ground after being wounded by bullets. Jamil Qaumi is said to have approached Mahmoud Hamzy and fired at least one bullet into his head from close range.
	
	
	Jamil Qaumi, witness “L” and Zarshoy then ran back to the vehicle driven by the plaintiff, which was waiting at the front of the house. The plaintiff sped off in the vehicle and while she did so, Zarshoy fired at least one further shot in the direction of the residence. As they were driving away, the group removed their gloves and balaclavas and placed them into a plastic bag which was handed to witness “L”. They wiped their fingerprints off the firearms and placed them in another bag which was given to the plaintiff.
	
	
	It was against that background that senior counsel for the plaintiff made the following submissions to his Honour in the course of the committal:
	


“TERRACINI: That is in relation to witnesses D, G and I. There is nothing new in the authorities that they put forward, there is nothing new in the authorities that we put forward either by the same token, but this particular type of evidence that we seek to cross-examine on falls within the standard parameters. These are, in effect, co-offenders, criminals in a criminal enterprise specifically in relation to the one that is before the Court. Thirdly, they have got various induced statements or potential indemnities, criminal records, et cetera, et cetera. …

…

TERRACINI: Now, in the circumstances of the type of witness, these are very, very basic matters that are always permitted and if they are going to call informers and co-offenders, and they are – and I think my friend will concede –that they don’t have a case without these witnesses. They are in a percentage term probably 95 per cent of the case against my client and they all fall within the same category. They give different versions and I note that there is a lot of police in the back of the Court, and I don’t want to tell them how to fix up some of their statements, but there are a number of differences in the statements which are significant.

…” (10.03.2015 – T.18)

“TERRACINI I mean, I don’t act for them, I don’t – the point is that these requests are not unusual, they are regularly provided in cases where the bulk of the Crown case comes from criminal informers that are closely related in either a relationship, or an association, or a club style atmosphere.

As we go down, F – I mean that is generally disclosed in relation to all of these witnesses. As we further go down the page, the relationship with the accused, the victim, the co-offender, et cetera, again fairly standard sort of questions.

What we want to be able to do, naturally enough – assume worst case scenario that they are committed for trial, and these fellows give evidence. Because we won’t get a trial until 2016, there is sufficient time if we get certain differences and inconsistencies to make our own inquiries and it creates a significant procedural unfairness that if we don’t get to cross-examine them until trial, we are not in a position to investigate any errors or inconsistencies that are established by questioning. Then that creates problems with the trial process, itself, where we’d almost be compelled to make an application for certain inquiries to be made, and then you’re criticised by the trial Judge saying you should have done them before.” (10.03.2015 – T.20)

“TERRACINI: As a result – and the reason why I mention it because I checked thinking, well, occasionally there is a new case on it, but there doesn’t seem to be. So we are all at ad idem as to what is the test and here it is important to go back to the basis that we are not asking for witnesses to be put forward in the special category. We only need substantial reasons.

As to the fact that some of these witnesses may be intimidated and what have you, that’s just nonsense. They’re all allegedly members of whatever is quite

allegedly a vigorous association of violent people and it is hardly suggested that they are going to be intimidated by coming to Court where the standard procedures are if there was a prospect of that then they can be provided with a screen, or you know, et cetera, et cetera and I just don’t, with great respect, think that is a valid point in relation to the personnel associated in a case like this.

…

Very briefly, the Crown’s just not in a position to say that we are not going to get any benefit out of the cross-examination. History tells us demonstrably that rollover witnesses at times are both inconsistent and self-serving. With respect to 16, the possibility of us being taken by surprise, that is the very point that I adumbrated before to your Honour.

If we do establish some inconsistencies, then we can make inquiries before the trial because we know the extent, both the statement and the cross-examination, we know the extent of the information that we have to meet.

Now, these witnesses are fundamental to the Crown case, and I am not putting it too high They can’t get a conviction without these witnesses and there will be significant warnings given by the trial Judge because they obviously fall within 165 as being potentially unreliable, not just they are criminals generally, but they are involved allegedly in the very same criminal activity with an interest which cannot be denied, with an interest to save their own skins. So potentially unreliable.

In relation to the last paragraph of that page, paragraph 17, I concede that the failure to cross-examine witnesses of this type is always prejudicial where the Crown seeks to say that, in effect, we have to demonstrate undue prejudice. Well, that case does not deal with rollovers and informers. They are in a special category and that is why warnings are given about them.

My final paragraph is the claim by the Crown. We haven’t demonstrated – not demonstrated any prejudice Well, our final submission is we are significantly prejudiced They are basically the only witnesses against us, they all fall within a particular category, and we need to be able to cross-examine them so that we can be in a position to meet the evidence at trial if we are committed.

There is a possibility – there is a possibility that they would be so discredited that we may not even be committed for trial and I have put those details in my submissions – the law in respect of that.” (10.03.2015 – T.21-22).


	
	His Honour delivered judgment in the following terms:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Yes, sure. Okay, well it’s a difficult task in terms of assessing whether there are substantial reasons for requiring witnesses for cross-examination. It requires the assessment of each brief, each witness and each submission for each defendant in situations where they are markedly different.

Let me assure you that I have read the briefs and the submissions and the replies to those submissions at least twice.

The test is set out in s 91 in relation to substantial reasons and in Hanna and Kearney which says that, “The section has as its primary aim the limitation of the time occupied in committal proceedings”. But it also says in Studdert’s judgment:

“The application to cross-examine requires identification and consideration of the objective of the cross examiner and the framework of the prosecution case. To require a witness for cross-

examination without a definite aim but in the hope of eliciting some

evidence that might prove useful to the defence would not constitute

“substantial reasons”. It is for the applicant to clearly define the purpose or purposes of the cross-examination which he seeks.

…

In a number of cases including the reading speeches allusion is made or reference is made to what constitute substantial reasons. That is where cross-examination may result in the discharge of the defendant, where it might undermine the credit of an important witness. Where it may narrow the areas in dispute between the prosecution and defence. Where it might clarify and marshal evidence which is vague and illusory. Where it allows the defendant a proper understanding of the nature of the Crown case or an opinion held by a witness. Where cross-examination may ground a no bill application. To explore an area which slightly to be made an application would be made by the defence for exclusion of evidence. To clarify conflicting or inconsistent stories. To assist in bringing relevant issues into focus. To narrow areas in dispute. To avoid surprise at trial and to gain a precise knowledge of a case against a defendant.”

Let me state generally at the outset, the evidence relied by the Crown is from either co-accused or persons said to be members of the Brothers for Life gang. The majority of those statements are induced and disclosure made by the prosecution. One or two have not been the subject of disclosure but that must be done by the prosecution before trial. There is nothing in my view to demand same at committal level nor should that fact alone justify application to cross-examine. The applicant must clearly define the purpose of cross-

examination sought. The whole purpose of s 91 is to limit cross-examination to legitimate and defined areas assessed against the strength of the prosecution case having regard to the administrative functions the Court is performing in committal proceedings and acknowledge the restrictions imposed by 270 of the Criminal Procedure Act in relation to the power to exclude admissions and matters arising under pt 3.11 of the Evidence Act. Both of which are factors in play in relation to these matters.

It also must be recognised that s 165 of the Evidence Act has restricted operation at committal but is a legitimate assessment task at trial. Any request must be focused to the task and delineated clearly. It cannot be so broad as to defeat examination or the aim for cross-examination.

I note further in relation to the testing of witnesses at trial the majority will be examined separately by a number of defendants and their evidence tested over and over. I intend to examine the alleged offences in the manner they have been grouped.” (16.03.2015 – T.3.47 – 5.6)

In relation to the Hamzy murder an application has been made on behalf of Amanda Crowe. Sought in relation to that matter the calling of “L” and Fazil Bari. The areas of cross-examination are set out in that submission. They are the same for both witnesses and identical. The proposed grounds of cross-examination are membership and or involvement in the group known as Brothers for Life. His precise involvement in the offence, his credibility and history, criminal antecedents, his own criminal activity, inducements, indemnity benefits, any significant inconsistencies between his various statements provided to police. As to the inconsistencies between his evidence and the evidence of other Crown witnesses as to the precise and detailed nature of all alleged conversations with the accused and any co-accused, plus his relationship with the accused, as to his relationship with the victim, as to his relationship with either co-accused, as to his identification of alleged motor vehicles used in the offence. As to his capacity to recall events considering the delay in providing a statement.

The areas of proposed cross-examination are very wide, non-specific, non-exhaustive and it is not my role to sift through and choose those that may be

of relevance. The generic nature of the application in relation to both witnesses is noted. In relation to witnesses, aside from “L” and Bari, but included in the statements of “L” and Bari, is evidence of planning and meetings and conversation, the sourcing of vehicles, the assembly of resources, the arming of shooters, the travel of those shooters, who they were and direct observation of meetings, dispersion of parties and admissions.

It is said while “L” is an induced witness “L” is said to be the shooter with Jamil also present and Zarshoy also present. The areas said to warrant cross-examination in such broad terms are also set out in the application. That is the prospect of discharge, the testing of the reliability of protected witnesses, the testing of credibility of witnesses to clarify issues, to clarify vague assumptions and conflicting and inconsistent statements regarding their exact roles, records, conversations and address the problems related to delay. It is said this will allow the accused to know with precision the case against her and test the evidence of the witnesses. It is said to be crucial for a number of reasons, that is the nature and seriousness of the allegations, the penalty if proven, the assistance in identifying issues that will be in dispute at trial and to promote the efficient conduct of the matter in the Supreme Court following committal. It seems to me that is a one size fits all submission. The cross-examination is too broad and almost amounts to an unlimitable examination. The evidence available to the accused contained in the brief is clear. Clearly set out as to her involvement at each step and there cannot be any surprise in relation to the matters identified. They have been identified with precision. It is a strong Crown case. It is corroborative and it is corroborated by other accounts and surveillance. In my view the request fails to make out substantial reasons to require the calling of a witness for cross-examination and that failure is in both respects.

IN RELATION TO THAT MATTER THE APPLICATION IS DECLINED.

In relation to the Chikolatta Bankstown shootings of 7 November 2013 Ms Crowe’s representatives seek witnesses D, G and I. That submission in terms of the areas of proposed cross-examination and reasons are identical in every respect with that made already in relation to the persons required for cross-examination in relation to the murder of Hamzy.

Again this is not a one size fits all jurisdiction. I rely on the same reasons for dealing with that application to decline the application in this matter. Again it seems to me it lacks specificity, analysis of evidence in the brief and the nature of the test in these proceedings. The case is strong and supported by intercepts.

THAT REQUEST FAILS

A similar application is made in relation to Jamil Qaumi. That application seeks witnesses C and D as to event planning, possession of firearms, the shooting, the events afterwards, credit. The reasons set out for that request is that it will undermine their credit or result in discharge. On the Crown case that is already referred to, that cannot be the case.

In this matter C is said to be present when the vehicle was hired so any evidence he gives is quite restricted. I have made observations already in relation to witness D whose evidence covers a number of allegations. The precise grounds said to fit substantial reasons are not stated. It is rather a shopping list is supplied which lacks direction and focus. Nor is there a clear connection between what is sought and the general list of matters sought to be examined.

IT IS TOO GENERAL AND UNRELATED TO THE PROPOSED CROSS-EXAMINATION TO BE SATISFACTORY AND IN RELATION TO THAT MATTER THE APPLICATION IS DECLINED.” (16.3.2015 – T.7.7 – 8.32)


	
	On 15 May 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) found a bill and an Indictment was filed against the plaintiff and the other co-accused involved in the murder. Although this has not yet happened, the plaintiff will be arraigned in due course with other co-accused named in the indictment in the Supreme Court.
	


Plaintiff’s submissions


	
	The plaintiff submitted that despite the finding of a bill against her by the DPP, the interests of justice required that the committal proceedings be re-opened and that important witnesses upon whom the Crown case depended be available for cross-examination. This was particularly so when these witnesses were persons who had been directly involved in the criminality and who were receiving benefits for providing such testimony. The plaintiff submitted that the rationale behind a committal hearing remained valid. In that regard, she relied upon the observations of Dawson J in Grassby v R [1989] HCA 45; 168 CLR 1 at [19]:
	


“19   The importance of the committal in the criminal process should not, however, be underrated. It enables the person charged to hear the evidence against him and to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. It enables him to put forward his defence if he wishes to do so. It serves to marshal the evidence in deposition form. And, notwithstanding that it is not binding, the decision of a magistrate that a person should or should not stand trial has in practice considerable force so that the preliminary hearing operates effectively to filter out those prosecutions which, because there is insufficient evidence, should not be pursued. Indeed, the significance of the magistrate’s decision is clearly reflected in the requirement now contained in s 41(6) of the Justices Act that the magistrate should discharge a defendant if he is of the opinion that, having regard to all the evidence, a jury would not be likely to convict.”


	
	The plaintiff accepted that the introduction of the “paper” committal was capable of reducing the capacity for the committal to perform its traditional filtering function. Nevertheless, she submitted that s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act with its requirement that a witness should attend to give oral evidence if there were substantial reasons why that should occur in the interests of justice, preserved an important element of the filtering process referred to by Dawson J. This was particularly so where the witness sought to be cross-examined was of critical importance to the prosecution case and where the reliability of that evidence was or might be effectively tested and possibly undermined by cross-examination at an early stage. The plaintiff submitted that in the case against her, the Crown was reliant upon the evidence of five witnesses. Those witnesses were criminally concerned with the matters charged. She submitted that oral examination of these witnesses would not only disclose the details of the Crown case against her and the nature of the supporting evidence but would also enable a testing of those witnesses’ credibility and reliability.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that the “filtering” features of the committal procedure were neither nullified nor reduced by the residual capacity of the Director of Public Prosecutions to file an ex officio indictment. There remained a general right of an accused person to face a committal hearing before any trial on indictment, irrespective of whether an ultimate trial followed a decision by the magistrate to commit or whether a trial followed the Director’s decision to file an ex officio indictment. She submitted that the Director’s capacity to file an ex officio indictment reflected the executive (i.e. non-judicial) nature of the decision to prosecute. It also recognised the potential imperfections in the ordinary course of committal proceedings and deprived the Local Court of what would otherwise amount to a total control over the executive decision to prosecute. The plaintiff submitted that notwithstanding that circumstance, it would be erroneous to conclude that a committal procedure was a secondary or non-essential feature of the justice system, e.g. its operation as a filter against unsuitable prosecutions as referred to by Dawson J in Grassby.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that the laying of an indictment against her by the Director did not “overtake” the committal proceedings. While accepting that the laying of the indictment was not merely confirmatory of any decision made by a magistrate at committal, the plaintiff submitted that the Supreme Court retained jurisdiction to remit the matter to the Local Court. If the Supreme Court did so it would, in effect, invite the Director to reconsider his own executive decision to indict.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that there remained real utility in the orders sought in the Further Amended Summons in that remitting the matter to the Local Court would serve to re-establish the real possibility that she would be discharged at that stage of the process. This was because a magistrate’s decision at the conclusion of a committal proceeding had “considerable force” despite the fact that it did not bind the prosecuting authorities. The plaintiff submitted that to effectively set to one side the prospect of holding committal proceedings on the basis that a bill had already been found, would be to deprive the plaintiff of the real possibility of an early discharge. The plaintiff submitted that this was the reason why the potential availability of a Basha inquiry before trial would not be a sufficient substitute for a committal proceeding heard in accordance with the s 91 application.
	


Consideration


	
	In circumstances where an indictment has been found, the statement of principle in Sergi v Director of Public Prosecutions (Court of Appeal, unreported, 10 September 1991) (Kirby P, Meagher and Handley JJA) remains applicable.
	


“1   Courts of high authority have repeatedly stressed the great circumspection which should be exercised in the provision of relief which would have the effect of disturbing the conduct of a criminal trial. There is no doubt that this Court, as a supervisory court, has a wide jurisdiction to grant such relief where justice requires it. See Barton v R (1980) 147 CLR 75, 96. However, it is a jurisdiction to be sparingly exercised. Lamb v Moss (1983) 49 ALR 533, 545; Bacon v Rose (1972) 2 NSWLR 793, 797; Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230, CA. In part this restraint arises out of an historical respect for the jury which takes charge of the accused once the trial commences. In part, it derives from a recognition by appellate courts of the difficulties attending the conduct of complex criminal trials. In part it follows from the large provisions to challenge a conviction on appeal if at the end of a trial the accused is convicted and still complains about an interlocutory ruling. In part it is based upon a recognition of the dangers of the “fragmentation in the criminal process”. This last consideration was mentioned most recently by Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 328 and 329. It is essential that more than lip service be paid to these injunctions of restraint. They apply in this case.

2   Courts have also taken pains of late to stress the authority of the DPP to find a bill of indictment and the discretion which is there involved separate from the (usually anterior) exercise of discretion to commit an accused person for trial. See Director of Public Prosecutions v Kolalich (1990) 19 NSWLR 520, 527 (CCA). In the present case, the DPP has now found a bill. The order of the magistrate although historically anterior was a necessary pre-condition or a legal foundation for the DPP’s actions – see R v Leslie Robert Butler, CCA, unreported, 16 August 1991 (per Gleeson CJ, p 4). That action stands on its own footing. The decision of the magistrate committing the claimant for trial has, thus, now been overtaken by the DPP’s decision. Any order directed to the magistrate to re-open the committal proceedings could not of itself affect the DPP’s exercise of discretion to find a bill. To the contrary, the magistrate would be entitled unless the DPP elected to withdraw and revoke the bill so found, to regard the re-opened committal as entirely futile. A later finding by the magistrate on a reconsideration of s 6 properly construed that there was no evidence to warrant committing the claimant for trial would leave the DPP’s bill of indictment completely unaffected. The DPP has made it clear to this Court that he intends to present and prosecute his bill when the trial opens. Courts will not usually review the decision of a prosecutor to find a bill, at least in circumstances such as the present. See Grassby v R; R v Woolcott Forbes (1944) 44 SR(NSW) 333, 338 (FC). Therefore the relief sought by the claimant in this Court would not provide a useful basis for any order having the practical effect which the claimant seeks, namely the delay of the commencement of his trial.”


	
	The decision of the Court of Appeal in V v McDonald and Ors [1995] NSWCA 487 (Mahoney, Handley and Powell JJA) is important because it integrates the effect of current legislation with a statement of principle to the same effect as that in Sergi.
	


“In Barton v The Queen 147 CLR 75, the High Court referred to the advantages which committal proceedings provided for an accused person and views were expressed as to the prejudice apt to flow from proceedings commenced by an ex officio indictment or otherwise without appropriate committal proceedings. In Barron: at 222-224; I referred to what had there been said. Samuels JA and Hunt AJA: at 216, 233; and I: at 222-224; considered the weight to be given to the absence of committal proceedings or proper committal proceedings in determining the fairness of the accused's trial. It was the view of all members of the Court that the absence of committal proceedings was a matter to be taken into account but it did not of itself establish that the trial of the accused would be unacceptably unfair. In that case, criminal proceedings based upon an ex officio indictment were not stayed.

In recent times there have been at least two changes affecting criminal proceedings relevant for present purposes. Committals are now ordinarily paper committals: the evidence to be adduced at the trial is reduced to writing, the writing is tendered to the magistrate, cross-examination is allowed only in the circumstances permitted by the magistrate and/or in accordance with the existing legislation, and the magistrate determines whether a case has been made out for committal for trial upon the material which, in the result, is before her. The result of this is that, in some cases, the opportunity to explore the evidence of potential witnesses does not exist: the accused loses both the legitimate opportunity to explore the evidence and its potential ambiguities prior to the trial and he is deprived of the (perhaps less legitimate) opportunity to involve those witnesses in ambiguities, errors or inconsistencies which may be turned to account at the trial.

In addition, the occasions for the exercise of this Court's supervisory jurisdiction have in practice been restricted. As indicated in Jago and in other cases, the assessment of the injustice apt to affect the trial of an accused is to be made generally upon the assumption that the trial judge will do what he can and should do in order to remove or mitigate the suggested injustice at the trial. Provision is now made for the trial court to deal in advance with such of these matters as may appropriately be so dealt with. Directions may be given and steps taken at the pre-trial stage for the purpose of removing or mitigating prejudice affecting the fairness of the trial and, during the course of the trial, special procedures may be adopted for that purpose, eg, by affording an opportunity for cross-examination of a witness in the absence of the jury: see, eg, the case of Joseph Anthony Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337.

The power of this Court to intervene in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction so as to ensure that the trial of an accused is not unacceptably unfair remains to be exercised in appropriate cases. However, as has been pointed out on many occasions, it is not every prejudice suffered by an accused which will render a trial unacceptably unfair so as to warrant the intervention of this Court: see Barron at 226-227. Stated broadly, it is necessary to consider whether, there is in a particular case prejudice such that, notwithstanding what may be expected to be done at the trial or otherwise, the trial will be unacceptably unfair.

In my opinion this is not such a case. Mr Andersen QC, for Mr V, relied essentially upon the absence of (as he claimed it to be) proper committal proceedings. He did not, in his oral argument, press that the absence of the right to cross-examine the child should weigh heavily: it was, I think, seen as unlikely that such an opportunity would exist in proper committal proceedings. Mr Andersen stressed in particular the failure (as he asserted it to be) of the magistrate properly to consider the competence of the child to give evidence and whether the child's evidence should have been excluded from consideration in the committal proceedings. He submitted that in this context there was a case for intervention by this Court.

The mere absence of committal proceedings does not in itself establish that this Court should intervene. As I have indicated, that was referred to in Barron. In the present case an indictment has been found and, as Mr Andersen rightly concedes, that indictment cannot be set aside in the present case. The Court has the assurance of Mr Johnson for the Director that the Director proposes to proceed to trial upon that indictment. In Sergi v Director of Public Prosecutions (Court of Appeal, 10 September 1991, unreported) the circumstances were different but the principle applied by the Court illustrates that matters of this kind are not such as to warrant intervention.”


	
	The approach in V v McDonald & Ors was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Bagshaw v Carter & Ors [2006] NSWCA 113 at [16] – [17] (Ipp JA, with whom Giles and McColl JJA) agreed.
	
	
	A further analysis of the relevant principles was undertaken in Director of Public Prosecutions v PM [2006] NSWCCA 297; 67 NSWLR 46. The background to this matter was that the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against an order by the District Court “remitting an indictment containing one count of aggravated sexual assault (s 61J(2)(d) of the Crimes Act 1900) to the Children’s Court”. The Notice of Appeal sought an order vacating the order made by the District Court. The appeal by the DPP succeeded. In the course of reaching that conclusion, Latham J (with whom Whealy J agreed) said:
	


“82   it is clear that the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) has power to present an indictment regardless of the fact that there may have been some defect in the committal proceedings and the finding of an ex officio indictment in those circumstances will not produce an abuse of process, unless it would result in unfairness to the accused at trial: s 8(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act; s 7 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 and see generally R v Sepulveda [2003] NSWCCA 131; R v Janceski; Grassby v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 1; Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75. Moreover, the Court cannot go behind the issue of an ex officio indictment: Barton v The Queen.

83   Even assuming that the magistrate in the Children’s Court found that there was no evidence to justify a finding of guilt on a “serious children’s indictable offence”, any ex officio indictment issued by the DPP would remain completely unaffected: Sergi v Director of Public Prosecutions (Court of Appeal, 10 September 1991, unreported).

84   By the operation of r 10D of Pt 53 of the District Court Rules 1973 and s 127 of the Criminal Procedure Act, that indictment was presented in the District Court when it was filed in the Registry. Section 130(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act vests the District Court with jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on an indictment, as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused is arraigned. This Court was informed by senior counsel for the respondent that he did not plead to that indictment on arraignment, but again, that is of no consequence given that a plea of “not guilty” will be deemed to have been entered where the accused stands mute: s 155 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

85   Thus, the District Court had jurisdiction to try the respondent on the indictment filed in the Registry. I do not understand the respondent’s counsel to have argued to the contrary. Had the Crown presented that indictment at trial, the submissions by the respondent’s counsel below and in this Court suggest that no objection would have been taken. The submissions to McGuire DCJ proceeded on the basis that the respondent had been deprived of the committal procedures mandated by the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act in respect of the charge of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, being the fact that the complainant was under the age of 16 years.

…

102   I am driven to the conclusion that the ex officio indictment presented at the respondent’s trial was procedurally valid. I can see no other basis for distinguishing between committal proceedings conducted in the Children’s Court and committal proceedings generally, for the purposes of determining the availability and validity of an ex officio indictment. The special procedures thought appropriate to an essentially protective jurisdiction such as the Children’s Court jurisdiction cannot, in my view, displace the undoubted power of the DPP to ensure that a person accused of an indictable offence is brought to trial, in circumstances where that accused has been discharged at committal.”


	
	I am not persuaded that any miscarriage of justice will occur if the committal proceedings are not re-opened and the plaintiff is not allowed to cross-examine the witnesses whom she nominated in the committal proceedings. I have reached that conclusion on a number of bases.
	
	
	Because a bill has been found, there is no practical utility in remitting the matter to the Local Court when it is now in the Supreme Court. There was little specificity in the identification of the issues in relation to which the witnesses were to be cross-examined. It is not sufficient that the nominated witnesses were involved in the criminality. Section 91 still requires “substantial reasons” for why the witnesses should be required to attend and be cross-examined. As the learned magistrate found, the proposed cross-examination was of a wide ranging and very general kind with almost no parameters or boundaries.
	
	
	As the authorities make clear, the fact that a bill of indictment has been found in the Supreme Court weighs heavily in favour of a refusal of any relief in this case. The learned magistrate’s decision to commit the plaintiff for trial has been overtaken by the decision to find a bill. The consequences of that decision were succinctly set out in Sergi and subsequent cases.
	
	
	It is also not without significance that there are available in the Supreme Court pre-trial procedures, which enable significant aspects of the prosecution case to be identified and refined. As is clear from the submissions before his Honour and from the Crown case statement, the plaintiff has already been provided with most, if not all, of the statements taken from Crown witnesses, both induced and otherwise. This would seem to be the very sort of case where there are good prospects of a Basha inquiry being conducted if and when the plaintiff makes such an application.
	
	
	As was pointed out in Sergi, there are powerful policy considerations to the effect that circumspection should be exercised in providing relief which would have the effect of disturbing a criminal trial and which might involve “fragmentation in the criminal process”. In any event, as all the authorities make clear even if the committal were to be re-opened and if his Honour were to find that there was no evidence to warrant committing the plaintiff for trial, this would have no effect on the bill of indictment which has been found.
	
	
	I have concluded that in the exercise of the Court’s discretion, the orders sought in the Further Amended Summons should not be made.
	
	
	In view of that conclusion, it is not necessary to consider the issues raised by s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Were that necessary, however, by reference to the decisions in Hanna v Kearney (Studdert J, 28 May 1998, unreported) and Director of Public Prosecutions v Losurdo & Anor (1998) 44 NSWLR 618 (Priestley and Handley JJA, Sheppard AJA) I would not have been satisfied that the pre-conditions set out in s 91 had been satisfied so as to require the attendance of the witnesses required by the plaintiff for cross-examination. I am not persuaded that the reasons put forward on behalf of the plaintiff amount to “substantial reasons” as contemplated by those decisions and that on this issue, his Honour’s conclusion was correct.
	
	
	The Summons should be dismissed with costs.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


OFFENCE AND SENTENCE

The applicant pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court to manslaughter the day before his trial was fixed to commence for the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez. The Crown accepted the plea to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period.


	
	On 11 November 2013 Price J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, to date from 15 June 2013 and to expire 14 December 2017, with an additional term of 2 years and 23 days to expire on 6 January 2020.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in the application of the principles of totality.

Ground 2 – His Honour erred in inadequately reducing the non-parole period to reflect the finding of special circumstances.

Ground 3 – The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing his sentence with that of his co-offender, Barnes.

Ground 4 – The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	On 12 October 2010 the applicant was at his home, having finished work for the day, with the co-offenders Karl Brown, Brad Trawin-Hadfield, Samuel Lockett and Richard Barnes. Also at home was the applicant’s de facto wife and their children. All five offenders left the home in a motor vehicle belonging to his de facto wife. The group went to a location in Mount Pritchard where the applicant became aware that Brown intended to confront the deceased, who lived next door, over money and text messages sent to Brown by the deceased. The five offenders left the house together. The applicant was aware that a physical confrontation with the deceased was a real possibility.
	
	
	The applicant became involved in the physical confrontation. While so involved, he was grabbed by the deceased and he pushed the deceased. The applicant had his head down in the fight when he heard a loud bang. All the offenders then ran to the motor vehicle at which time one of the offenders shouted at Lockett saying “Why the fuck did you do that?”. One of the offenders then shouted “He shot him”. The applicant noticed that he had pellet wounds from the shot. The applicant was arrested at 8.10pm when he was in the same vehicle. He was taken to hospital where he was treated for his gunshot wounds.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and that he participated by becoming involved in the fight. He did not foresee either death or grievous bodily harm as possible consequences, or that another party to the agreement would employ the violence applied by Lockett, or it being achieved by the use of a gun.
	
	
	The applicant agreed with the four others to assault the deceased, with whom the applicant had no disagreement. When he left the next door house, he was aware that a physical confrontation with the deceased was a real possibility. Although he did not know that a firearm was in the possession of his co-offenders, he realised that the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. He joined in the attack upon the deceased who was outnumbered. He pushed the deceased and continued his involvement in the fight until the shotgun discharged. His close proximity to the deceased at that time is evidenced by the pellet wounds he suffered.
	


SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS


	
	Having made the above findings of fact, the primary judge identified the following matters which mitigated the objective seriousness of the offence. The agreement to assault the deceased was not entered into until shortly before he was attacked. The applicant did not foresee that any of his co-offenders would employ the degree of violence used by Lockett, or that the degree of violence would be achieved by the use of any type of weapon, or that death or grievous bodily harm was a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Although the plea was late, his Honour allowed a discount for its utilitarian value of 12.5 percent.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the sentence proceedings. This required the primary judge to assess his subjective case by reference to general background information and a report from a psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro.
	
	
	The applicant was educated at Toongabbie East Primary School and Macquarie Boys Technical High School where he completed his HSC at the age of 17. He then became involved in labouring and factory work for several years and in other employment where he remained for about four years before his dismissal. He then returned to labouring work. He was aged 29 at the time of the offence and was 32 at the time of sentence.
	
	
	He had a previous criminal record. There was a conviction at the Parramatta District Court on 27 May 2011 for one count of reckless wounding while in company on 4 October 2009. The agreed facts for that offence disclosed serious violence by the applicant. His record also revealed driving offences of a serious nature that were committed on 27 December 2011. The particular significance of these offences is that the applicant was on bail for the deceased’s murder when they were committed.
	
	
	Because of the applicant’s previous offence of violence, his Honour gave more weight to personal deterrence and the protection of society than otherwise would have been the case. His Honour took into account that at the time of the manslaughter, the applicant was on bail for the offence of reckless wounding while in company, and that it was an aggravating factor that the offence was committed while he was at conditional liberty.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that the applicant had been in a de facto relationship for nine years at the time of sentence and had three daughters aged seven, three and two. His fiancé was seriously ill with cervical cancer and was presently undergoing chemotherapy. His Honour took into account those difficult personal circumstances, although he appreciated that they were not “exceptional” so as to be taken into account as a mitigating consideration.
	
	
	His Honour found that by his plea of guilty the applicant accepted responsibility for the part that he played in the death of the deceased and that his plea indicated contrition for the offending. His Honour took the plea into account as reflecting his remorse and that Mr Watson-Munro reported that the applicant expressed deep remorse for what had occurred. His Honour made a finding that the applicant was remorseful and took that into account as a mitigating factor.
	
	
	His Honour was not prepared to make a positive finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. This was because he had engaged in serious offending while subject to bail. His Honour found that the applicant’s disregard on two occasions for his conditional liberty detracted from an optimistic view being taken concerning rehabilitation. His Honour concluded that he was unable to make a positive finding that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour considered that his prospects of rehabilitation remained uncertain.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to what Mr Watson-Munro said about the applicant’s conditions of incarceration. He had been a segregation prisoner for the entirety of his confinement. He noted that the applicant was given a difficult time by Corrective Services personnel and by other prisoners. At the time of the report, the applicant had been locked in his cell for 23 hours a day. The applicant reported to him that he had no friends in gaol.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro made a formal diagnosis of a depressive illness, which was aggravated by the applicant’s conditions of imprisonment. At the time of examination, Mr Watson-Munro found that the applicant was still suffering from “severe depression” with a particular concern referable to active suicidal ideation. The psychologist opined that the applicant required treatment in addition to the psychotropic medication which he was taking and that such treatment should involve cognitive behavioural therapy.
	
	
	There was other material which confirmed that the applicant was held in segregation, had been the subject of a non-association order and was locked in his cell for 23 hours a day. As a result of the conditions of his incarceration, the applicant had little contact with other inmates and was unable to access programs or courses. His ability to exercise and make telephone calls was restricted. His Honour accepted that it was more likely than not that the applicant would continue to serve his sentence under these conditions which were more difficult than the custodial conditions of the general prison population.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that the applicant did not submit that his mental condition was relevant to the commission of the offence but that it made a custodial sentence more burdensome for him. His Honour accepted that submission and that the conditions of his custody would exacerbate his depression. He found that the hardship that the applicant experienced in custody was a matter in mitigation. His Honour was not prepared to find that this reduced the weight to be given to general deterrence because his mental condition had no causal relationship with the commission of the offence.
	
	
	The primary judge was conscious of the principle of parity and referred to it in the sentence judgment as follows:
	


“5   … However, the parity principle is of importance when sentencing each of them and is not confined to sentences imposed upon co-offenders who have committed the same crime. It can also be applied to sentences imposed upon persons who are co-offenders by virtue of having been engaged in the same criminal enterprise, regardless of the charges that have actually been laid against them: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at [136]. However, the significant practical difficulties with this approach are well recognised: Jimmy at [203]; Green at [30].

6   In my view, there is little utility in considering parity with Lockett and Brown who have been found guilty of murder. The roles that they played in the death of the deceased were much greater than the offenders who have pleaded guilty to manslaughter and there is a deal of difference between the maximum penalties for murder and for manslaughter. The question of parity is considered at [25] below. I have firmly borne in mind the principle of proportionality when sentencing all of the offenders: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].

…

25   Both Mr Crown and Mr Brady submitted that when considering the parity principle, the culpability of the offender and Barnes was the same. Although the offender became physically involved in the attack upon the deceased and Barnes did not, the offender was not aware that a firearm was in the possession of his co-offenders, whereas Barnes with that knowledge did not desist from participating in the agreement to assault the deceased and remained ready and willing to assist. I assess them as being equally culpable for the offence. I turn to their subjective cases. The offender is about two years older than Barnes but Barnes' prior criminal offending is marginally more serious than the offender. Barnes, however, is not required to serve his sentence in protection nor does he have a mental condition. In my opinion, the hard custodial conditions under which the offender is to serve his sentence justify a lesser sentence than that to be imposed on Barnes. When sentencing Barnes, I discussed the question of the offender's parity with Barnes at [21] of the sentencing remarks: R v Barnes NSWSC [2013] 1627.”


	
	There was an issue before the primary judge as to the commencement date of the applicant’s sentence. His Honour reviewed the issue as follows:
	


“28   During sentencing submissions, there was some discussion about the commencement date of the sentence. It was initially contended the offender's period of time in custody that was solely referable to the manslaughter was 129 days, but this submission overlooked the offender's sentence for reckless wounding of 2 years imprisonment that commenced on 15 October 2010 and expired on 14 October 2012 with a non-parole period of 12 months expiring on 14 October 2011. The offender was also sentenced on 1 March 2012 in the Parramatta Local Court for ""driving dangerously"" to imprisonment for 14 months 11 days commencing on 27 September 2012 and expiring on 7 December 2013 with a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 27 September 2012 and expiring on 26 June 2013. The earliest date that the offender was to be released on parole was 26 June 2013. The offender was arrested for the deceased's murder on 4 October 2010 and there are 11 days prior to the commencement of the sentence for reckless wounding that are solely referable to the manslaughter.

29   As the offender has served sentences for reckless wounding and driving offences since he went into custody, it is necessary to consider the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59. The offences for which the offender was sentenced in the District Court and Local Court and the offence of manslaughter are discrete and independent acts of criminality. This does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. In the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to commence the sentence on 15 June 2013 being the date that the offender would have been released on parole less the 11 days in custody that are solely referable to the present offence.

30   I find special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term of the sentence being his need for appropriate psychological treatment upon release. I have determined that a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality for the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].”

THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – His Honour erred in the application of the principles of totality.


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour had made a factual error as to the period of time that the applicant had been imprisoned before the imposition of the manslaughter sentence. The applicant submitted that his Honour had overlooked the period from 28 December 2011 to 27 September 2012 when he was in custody serving sentences. This nine month period was for charges of driving while disqualified and dangerous driving. The applicant submitted that the effect of overlooking that period of imprisonment was that the applicant had been in continuous custody since 28 December 2011, not 27 September 2012, to which his Honour referred when reviewing the applicant’s previous custody. The applicant submitted that this oversight must have impacted on the question of the commencement date of the sentence because as his Honour stated, the issue of totality was relevant.
	
	
	In support of the submission, the applicant relied upon R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 481 where the Court said:
	


“11    One of the limiting principles that constrains a sentencing court in seeking to promote the purposes of punishment is the principle of proportionality. Another is the, not-unrelated, principle of totality and it is this principle that operated in the present case. It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616.

…

13   In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending: see for example R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323. This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion: R v Janceski (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 288. The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; (2002) 137 A Crim R 326. Although, it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that a sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ, R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality.”


	
	The applicant submitted that the totality of sentence needed to be informed by accurate information as to the actual incarceration that an offender is subject to. In this instance his Honour did not take into account the two offences of drive whilst disqualified and drive vehicle recklessly or in a manner dangerous for which he also received sentences. Accordingly, his Honour’s assessment of issues of totality and the concurrence and accumulation of sentence were flawed.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s application of the principles of totality to the question of the commencement date of the sentence was infected with error because he failed to take into account that the applicant had spent the period from 28 December 2011 to 27 September 2012, an extra 9 months, in continuous custody.
	


Consideration


	
	There is a preliminary difficulty with this submission in that it is obvious from [28] – [29] of his Honour’s sentence judgment that his Honour was conscious of the principles of totality and proportionality and was also aware of the substantial period of pre-sentence custody which the applicant had served. Being aware of all of those matters, his Honour determined not to backdate the commencement date of the manslaughter sentence beyond 15 June 2013. In that regard, the applicant accepted that the choice of the commencement date for the manslaughter sentence was a discretionary matter for the primary judge.
	
	
	Apart from that difficulty, it is not at all clear that the “error” sought to be relied upon by the applicant did in fact occur. It may well be that his Honour did not specifically refer to each period of imprisonment at [28], but he was clearly aware that the applicant had been in continuous custody since 28 December 2011. He was specifically told this by counsel for the applicant and it was readily apparent from the applicant’s custodial history which was tendered in the proceedings. The “sentences summary” on page 1 of that document made that clear.
	
	
	What his Honour was doing at [28] is clear when one looks at the submissions which had been made on behalf of the applicant by his counsel in the sentence proceedings. By reference to various periods of custody, which he submitted were referable to the manslaughter matter alone, counsel for the applicant submitted to his Honour that the total period in custody referable to the manslaughter offence was 1 year and 129 days. On that basis, counsel for the applicant contended that the manslaughter sentence should be backdated to 11 June 2012 (i.e. the date of his submission 18.10.13 less the 1 year and 129 days). The point that his Honour was making at [28] was that this calculation was not correct since the initial period that he had included in his calculation (i.e. from 4.10.2010 to 14.10.2011) was not referable solely to the manslaughter since the applicant was serving a non-parole period for the wounding offence. It followed that the only period solely referable to the manslaughter was the initial period of 11 days after his arrest and the period since 26 June 2013 when the non-parole period for the driving matters expired.
	
	
	If there were any doubt that his Honour was well aware that the applicant had been in custody from 27 December 2011 it is resolved by what his Honour said at [13]:
	


“… His record also reveals driving offences of a serious nature that were committed on 27 December 2011. The particular significance of these offences is that the offender was on bail for the deceased's murder when they were committed.”


	
	Moreover, at [29] his Honour went on to state that as the applicant had served sentences for reckless wounding and driving offences since he went into custody, it was necessary to consider the principle of totality. His Honour was clearly aware that the driving offences and malicious wounding offence were discrete and independent acts of criminality from the manslaughter.
	
	
	Being aware of those matters, it is clear that his Honour intended to entirely accumulate the manslaughter sentence on the driving matters, except for the eleven days of pre-sentence custody. He gave express reasons for so doing at [29]. It was open to his Honour to do this in the exercise of his discretion. For the applicant to succeed on this ground, he needed to show that it was not open to his Honour to exercise the discretion in the way in which he did. Unless he could point to a specific error (which he could not) it was necessary for him to establish that the discretion was wrongly exercised on a House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 ground. This he has not done.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – His Honour erred in inadequately reducing the non-parole period to reflect the finding of special circumstances.


	
	The applicant submitted that the aggregate period to be served by him, taking into account the earlier sentences for the “driving matters”, amounted to 8 years 23 days with a non-parole period of 6 years. Rounding the sentence down to 8 years, the total non-parole period amounted to exactly 75 percent of the overall term. Accordingly, his Honour’s sentence failed to achieve his stated aim, namely a variation in the statutory ratio to allow him a longer period of parole supervision for psychological treatment.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that at no point in his sentence judgment did his Honour refer to the impact of the overall non-parole period on the period which he had specified for parole supervision. The applicant submitted that this important issue was not given consideration. He submitted that because his Honour had found special circumstances, arising from his need for appropriate psychological treatment upon release, it was important that there be a real reduction in the proportion of time he was to spend in custody as opposed to the period he was to spend on parole supervision.
	


Consideration


	
	It is clear that the basis for his Honour’s finding that there should be a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term for the manslaughter offence was the need for appropriate psychological treatment. If one looks at the manslaughter sentence alone, the finding of special circumstances saw a reduction in the statutory ratio from 75 percent to 68 percent.
	
	
	His Honour also expressly stated that the non-parole period of 4½ years was the minimum period the applicant must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality of the manslaughter offence. The effect of the applicant’s submission is that a finding of special circumstances, on the basis explained by his Honour, required his Honour to take into account not only a reduction in the statutory ratio for the manslaughter offence, but a reduction in the statutory ratio having regard to the total period continuously spent or to be spent in custody.
	
	
	For the reasons already given in respect of Ground of Appeal 1, his Honour was clearly aware of the period of continuous custody served by the applicant. He was also clearly aware that he was accumulating the manslaughter sentence almost fully on those previous periods of incarceration. It is against that background that he specifically found that the non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months was the “minimum period” that the applicant should spend in custody to appropriately reflect the criminality of the manslaughter offence. In those circumstances, it was not necessary for his Honour to refer to the impact of the combined periods in custody on the manslaughter parole period. It follows that his Honour did not err in not doing so.
	
	
	A similar situation arose in Stoeski v R [2014] NSWCCA 161 where Adamson J (with whom Bellew J and I agreed) said that a failure to specifically refer to such a calculation does not necessarily establish error:
	


“53   Furthermore no inference can be drawn from the fact that the sentencing judge did not perform a calculation to ascertain what proportion the sum of the non-parole period and the period already spent in custody bore to the total term of the sentence. Such a calculation would be irrelevant. Nor is such a calculation required by s 44(2) of the Act. His Honour, having found special circumstances and stipulated the ratio between the non-parole period to the total term to be 70%, applied the ratio to the aggregate sentence his Honour imposed …”


	
	It is not only implicit in what his Honour said but express that he regarded 4 years and 6 months as the minimum period the applicant should spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality of the offence. This is in line with the observation of Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Grove and Sully JJ and Newman AJ agreed) in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704:
	


“61    The statutory proportion constitutes a `fetter' or `constraint' (to use the words of the Court in GDR, quoted above) on the exercise of what would otherwise be an unfettered and unconstrained discretion. It does not, however, alter the discretionary nature of the judgment for which the statute provides in s44(1)(b) of the 1999 Act, requiring the Court to fix a non-parole period, subject to s45 of the Act.

62    The issues of law that may arise are the same as those which arise on appeal from other discretionary decisions, including whether or not, on the facts of a particular case, a specific fact, matter or circumstance is, either alone or in combination with other facts, matters and circumstances, capable of constituting ""special circumstances"" of the requisite character, i.e. that it is capable of justifying a variation in the statutory proportion which the legislature has enacted.

63    More significantly, there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.”


	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4 – The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.


	
	It is appropriate to deal with this ground before considering the parity ground since a complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence is otherwise appropriate (England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 per Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreed) at [22]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 269 ALR 115 at [251]; Corda v R [2014] NSWCCA 281 at [59]).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that given the difficult conditions of custody experienced by him and to be experienced by him, together with his mental illness, a sentence of 6 years 6 months and 23 days with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months was manifestly excessive.
	


Consideration


	
	As has been pointed out by this Court on a number of occasions, the task of an applicant relying upon such a ground is a difficult one in that what has to be established is that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321).
	
	
	His Honour referred specifically to the applicant’s conditions of custody and to his mental illness. He specifically found that the applicant’s sentence would weigh more heavily upon him as a consequence and that the conditions in custody would exacerbate his depression. He expressly took these matters into account as part of the hardship that the applicant would experience in custody as a matter of mitigation.
	
	
	What his Honour was also required to do was be appropriately mindful of the value that the community placed upon the preservation of human life and the need to denounce the applicant’s conduct by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the offence. What cannot be ignored is that the applicant joined in a cowardly attack on the deceased, who was seriously outnumbered, in circumstances where he realised that the deceased was exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. At the time the applicant was on bail for the offence of reckless wounding while in company.
	
	
	The applicant has not demonstrated that in all the circumstances the sentence imposed by his Honour was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing his sentence with that of his co-offender, Barnes.


	
	The applicant submitted that the parity principle applied when his sentence was compared with that of his co-offender, Barnes, and relied upon the statement of principle in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 where Dawson and Gaudron JJ said at 310:
	


“Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them.”


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour breached the parity principle, even though the sentence imposed on Barnes of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 2 years was longer than his. The applicant submitted that the reduction of 6 months in the sentence imposed upon him, as compared with that imposed on Barnes, failed to properly reflect the extra hardship that he would endure during his sentence from both the harsh custodial conditions and because of the mental condition from which he suffered.
	
	
	The applicant noted the following similarities:
	



	
	Both had entered a plea of guilty which indicated contrition and remorse which was found as a mitigating factor in both cases.
	
	
	Each was entitled to a 12.5 percent discount for the utilitarian value of their plea of guilty.
	
	
	His Honour found their culpability in the commission of the offence was very similar.
	
	
	His Honour was unable to find in either case that they had good prospects of rehabilitation or were unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	Both were on conditional liberty at the time of the offence (Barnes was on parole for armed robbery and the applicant was on bail for reckless wounding). In both cases, his Honour found this feature was an aggravating factor.
	
	
	Both had prior criminal convictions, which involved gaol sentences.
	



	
	His Honour found that the co-offender Barnes’ criminal record was marginally more serious than that of the applicant.
	
	
	Despite those similarities, the applicant submitted that his was a significantly more powerful subjective case than that of Barnes. The matters he relied upon were that his partner, who had the care of their three children, was seriously ill. He was suffering hardship in custody, above and beyond the general prison population, by virtue of his being in protective custody and because of his mental illness.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that he had a justified sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed on him with that imposed on Barnes. He submitted that 6 months did not adequately reflect the difference in their subjective cases and that his sentence should be appropriately reduced to reflect that difference.
	


Consideration


	
	It is of significance that the same judge sentenced both the applicant and Barnes. He was fully cognisant of their moral culpability and of their subjective cases. Specifically, his Honour was fully aware of the difference in their subjective cases and he reflected that difference by a reduction of 6 months in the non-parole period of imprisonment to be served by the applicant.
	
	
	In such circumstances, where the primary judge has recognised the importance of the parity principle and has given effect to it, this Court has said that it will be cautious and not overly willing to intervene. Disparity which leads to appellate intervention must be “gross, marked or glaring” (Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96 at [39]). In Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95 at [45] – [46] Latham J (with whom Button J and Grove AJ agreed) said:
	


“45   … The imposition of different sentences does not, without more, raise ""equal justice"" considerations. Moreover, a sense of grievance is only ""justifiable"" or legitimate if the application of objective criteria compels the court to that conclusion. The age, background, criminal history and role in the offence of various offenders may justify some disparity: Green v The Queen ; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [31].

46   In particular, as the majority in Green & Quinn make clear,

A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders.”


	
	As already indicated, the primary judge considered the issue of parity when sentencing both Barnes and the applicant. He noted the similarities and differences in their cases. It is not without significance that counsel for the applicant made the following submission to the primary judge:
	


“At the end of the day in my submission it would be a fairly similar sentence [as Barnes’ sentence] in terms of parity issues perhaps taking into account Mr Tuivaga’s onerous conditions leading to a shorter sentence for him.” (Sentence transcript – pp 5-6)


	
	His Honour not only accepted that submission, he acted upon it. After finding the applicant and Barnes equally culpable, his Honour observed that the applicant was 2 years older than Barnes but that Barnes’ prior criminal record was marginally more serious than the applicant’s. After specifically referring to the applicant’s conditions of custody and his mental condition, his Honour concluded that “the hard custodial conditions under which the [applicant] is to serve his sentence justify a lesser sentence than that to be imposed upon Barnes.”
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon the applicant reflected this by having a non-parole period which was 6 months shorter than that of Barnes and an overall term which was just less than 6 months shorter than that of Barnes.
	
	
	While this Court or another Court of Criminal Appeal may have exercised its discretion differently and have allowed for a slightly longer or shorter differential between the two sentences, that is not the test. The difference in outcome between the applicant and Barnes is explicable on the basis of his Honour’s instinctive synthesis of various features in respective cases and the weight to be accorded to them. I am not satisfied that there is a proper basis for the applicant having a legitimate sense of grievance. There is, in my opinion, no gross or marked disparity between the two sentences.
	
	
	This ground of appeal is not made out.
	


Orders


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	That the appeal is dismissed.

Introduction


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence, committed in February 2013, of people smuggling under s 233C of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) by facilitating the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of five or more people who were non-citizens and who did not have a lawful right to enter Australia. He was sentenced on 4 April 2014 to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 6 February 2013. On 12 September 2012 the applicant had been convicted of an offence of people smuggling contrary to s 233A of the Migration Act 1958 and sentenced to imprisonment for 20 months with an order that he be released after serving 10 months and upon giving security by recognisance of $500 and on condition that he be of good behaviour for 12 months. As he had already been in custody for about 20 months, he was very shortly released and deported to Indonesia. The mandatory minimum penalty regime in s 236B applied to the offence of February 2013 and required the imposition of a sentence of at least 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. The maximum penalty was 20 years. If this offence were “a repeat offence”, the mandatory minimum sentence was imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The applicant was, for reasons not presently material, mistakenly sentenced upon the basis that the second offence was a “repeat offence”: it did not actually fit the definition of such an offence prescribed by s 236B(5).
	
	
	The applicant appeals from the sentence upon the ground that the Court acted under the misapprehension that the offence was a “repeat offence” to which the higher mandatory minimum prescribed sentences applied. The Crown concedes the error and the need for this Court to resentence if a lesser sentence is warranted in law, under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) but submits that no lesser sentence is, in the circumstances, warranted.
	


Mandatory minimum penalty


	
	The relevant provision of the Migration Act is seemingly simple –
	


236B Mandatory minimum penalties for certain offences

(1) This section applies if a person is convicted of an offence against section 233B, 233C or 234A.

(2) This section does not apply if it is established on the balance of probabilities that the person was aged under 18 years when the offence was committed.

(3) The court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of at least:

(a) if the conviction is for an offence against section 233B – 8 years; or

(b) …

(c) in any other case – 5 years.

(4) The court must also set a non‑parole period of at least:

(a) if the conviction is for an offence to which paragraph (3)(a) or (b) applies – 5 years; or

(b) in any other case – 3 years.

(5) …

(6) In this section:

non‑parole period has the same meaning as it has in Part IB of the Crimes Act 1914.


	
	At first, the application of this provision was thought to be straightforward. Thus, in R v Pot, Wetangky and Lande (unreported, NT Supreme Court, Riley CJ, 18 January 2011) gave it the effect that, if, after taking into account the usually applicable principles of sentencing both at common law and under part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) an otherwise appropriate sentence would be less than the mandatory minimum sentence and non-parole period, the latter would apply so that what one might call the “conventional” sentence would be increased to the mandatory term. Riley CJ explained this approach as follows –
	


There is no suggestion that by creating the mandatory minimum penalty provided for in s 233C of the Migration Act the legislature intended to undermine those general sentencing principles found in part 1B of the Crimes Act or the relevant common law principles. There is nothing to suggest that it was intended that the requirements of s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act should be read to require a Court to determine the appropriate severity of a sentence by reference to a predetermined base not necessarily reflecting the circumstances of the offending and which may be removed from what the Court would otherwise consider an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances.

The minimum sentence previously applicable was not abrogated by the inclusion of s 233C of the Act. The section simply required a sentence of at least the mandatory minimum to be applied in identified circumstances. The explanatory memorandum expressed the position in these terms:

Mandatory minimum penalties still provide a court with discretion when determining the appropriate sentence providing that the Court does not go below the mandatory minimum sentence and non-parole period. This allows the Court to have regard to the circumstances of both the offence and the offender.

The Court continues to be obliged to have regard to the same general sentencing principles as was previously the case, including determining a sentence of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.

In my opinion, the section provides the minimum sentence that can be imposed in the identified circumstances but does not go so far as to reserve that mandatory minimum sentence only for cases at the lowest end of seriousness for relevant offending, as submitted by the Crown. A clear expression of such an intention would be expected and is not present.


	
	This view, however, was held to be wrong in a number of succeeding cases, in particular in Queensland: Bahar v The Queen [2011] WASCA 249; (2011) 45 WAR 100; 255 FLR 80; 214 A Crim R 417, R v Karabi [2012] QCA 47; (2012) 220 A Crim R 338; R v Nitu [2012] QCA 224; [2013] 1 Qd R 459; (2012) 269 FLR 216; (2013) 222 A Crim R 246; R v Latif; ex parte Cth DPP [2012] QCA 278; R v Selu; ex parte Cth DPP [2012] QCA 345. The explanation for this different approach adopted in all these judgments comes from the judgment of McLure P in Bahar, Martin CJ and Mazza J agreeing, in substance treating the statutory minimum penalty as an indicator of least seriousness by parity of the reasoning concerning the character of the statutory maximum penalty as applying to cases in the most serious category of offending. Her Honour’s explanation for this conclusion started with the point (with respect obviously correct) that the mode of application of s 233C “is solely a matter of statutory construction” (ibid at [39]). Her Honour then discussed the relationship between the Crimes Act and the common law principles of sentencing including the principle of proportionality at [44], observing –
	


[45] The seriousness of an offence is to be determined by taking into account both a statutory maximum penalty as well as any statutory minimum penalty.


	
	Her Honour continued –
	


The High Court in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 referred to the role and relevance of maximum statutory penalties. The majority said (at [31]):

Careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick.

Prima facie, that statement is equally applicable to minimum statutory penalties. See also Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 [26] - [31].

(The passages from Muldrock here referred to concern the requirement to take into account the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period as “two legislative guide posts”).


	
	McClure P then referred to the “presumption … that the legislature does not intend to alter common law rights or doctrines/principles” unless the presumption is “rebutted by clear and unambiguous language or a test to like effect”, concluding that s 233C (the earlier version of s236B, relevantly the same) “makes it unequivocally clear that the Commonwealth Parliament intended to deprive a judicial officer sentencing an offender for a breach of s 232A of both the power to impose [less than the mandatory minimum term]”: [51]-[53]. Her Honour went on to say –
	


Otherwise, there is no positive inconsistency in terms between s 233C and the general sentencing principles in the Crimes Act as supplemented by common law principles. In particular, the sentencing principles are intentionally framed at a level of generality for application within the boundaries of power established not only by the maximum statutory penalty but also the minimum statutory penalty. The statutory maximum and minimum also dictate the seriousness of the offence for the purpose of s 16A(1). It would be positively inconsistent with the statutory scheme for a sentencing judge to make his or her own assessment as to the “just and appropriate” sentence ignoring the mandatory minimum or mandatory maximum penalty and then to impose something other than a “just and appropriate” sentence (whether as to type or length) in order to bring it up to the statutory minimum or down to the statutory maximum, as the case may be. The statutory minimum and statutory maximum penalties are the floor and ceiling respectively within which the sentencing judge has a sentencing discretion to which the general sentencing principles are to be applied.


	
	McClure P’s reasoning, and the above passage in particular were approved in this court by Allsop P (Bathurst CJ, McClellan CJ at CL, Hall and Bellew JJ agreeing) in Karim v R [2013] NSWCCA 23; (2013) NSWLR 268 at [44]. Allsop P added a further reason for his agreement with this construction –
	


There is an independent reason that leads me to favour the construction in Bahar. Equal justice inheres in judicial power, the fabric of the law and the basal notion of justice that underpins, informs and binds the legal system. As Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608 [65], “[e]qual justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect” (emphasis in original). To approach the matter as in Pot would see cases of perceived different seriousness by force of statute given the same penalty. Thus, if a judge thought the relevant offending in one case to be of low seriousness and worthy of a sentence of 6 months, but in another case to be of significant seriousness worthy of imprisonment for 5 years, she or he would be obliged to revise the first sentence to 5, leaving the second sentence at that point also. The statute, and through it the order of the Court, would be the instrument of unequal justice and, so, injustice: R v Green [2010] NSWCCA 313; (2010) 207 A Crim R 148 at 156 [23]; and Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at 466 [4] and 489 [80]. On the other hand, approaching the matter as in Bahar permits all usual sentencing considerations, including parity, to be accommodated, though in a more compressed range, and with the consequence of a general increase in the levels of sentences.


	
	There can be no question but that this Court is bound to adopt the Bahar approach. Nevertheless I wish to take this opportunity to express my respectful disagreement with its correctness, although I do so briefly given that the question was not argued in the appeal (no doubt because it would have been futile to do so).
	
	
	Essentially, (and with unfeigned respect to the eminent judges who have thought otherwise) it is a mistake to import into s 233C a great deal more than the section, in terms, requires. There is nothing in the language of the section which suggests, let alone requires, that it be understood as applying the minimum sentence to cases in the least culpable category of seriousness. The section says nothing about seriousness. It simply requires a sentence to be imposed of at least the specified length. Its ordinary meaning is that, whatever the degree of culpability which might, under the generally applicable law of sentencing, lead to a lesser sentence, the minimum mandatory sentence is to be imposed. A maximum penalty must be understood as meaning that, however grave the culpability of the offender might be, no greater penalty than the maximum may be imposed and is reserved for cases falling into the most culpable category. But there is no logical imperative which requires the minimum penalty to be applied only to cases falling into the least culpable category. The argument from symmetry, though beguiling, is by and large not a useful interpretative tool, legislation being what it is. The supposition that Parliament intended this outcome is a fiction and inconsistent with the Explanatory Memorandum.
	
	
	Furthermore, as is obvious, the current interpretation of the section artificially distorts the sentences upwards. If the considerations which apply in every other serious criminal case would lead to a sentence exceeding the minimum, there is no logical reason why that sentence should be harsher merely because, had the applicable sentence been less than the minimum, it would need to be increased to the minimum level. Accepting that the minimum sentence expresses the legislature’s assessment of seriousness, the section does not, in terms, require more to be done than to impose the mandatory minimum sentence where otherwise the sentence would be less harsh. The present construction erects unnecessary jurisprudence on what is, essentially, a simple arbitrary intervention in the sentencing process. I say “arbitrary” because the minimum sentence takes no account of the actual circumstances of the offence (except, of course, for its essential elements) or the personal situation of the offender; it is, plainly enough, designed as a deterrent with all other considerations to be ignored.
	
	
	The advantage of the Pot interpretation is that it does least violence to fundamental principles of criminal justice, which measures punishment, with regard to the statutory benchmarks, certainly, but necessarily also by reference to the particular circumstances of the offence and of the offender, both of which may vary very significantly from case to case. It also maintains as much as possible the important principle that offenders are not sentenced by the legislature but by independent courts.
	
	
	In Magaming v The Queen [2013] HCA 40; (2013) 252 CLR 381; (2013) 302 ALR 461; (2013) 87 ALJR 1060, the Court dealt with the question whether the prescription of a mandatory minimum sentence for an offence under s 233C(1) was constitutional. French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ observed (at [48]), a propos whether the mandatory minimum penalty was arbitrary and non-judicial, that, as with a maximum available sentence constituting a yardstick of the upper range, “[the] prescription of a mandatory minimum penalty … fixes one end of the relevant yard stick”; see also Keane J at [103], [105]. However, I would not read these passages as directed to the distinction to which I have referred.
	
	
	Since I have entered the lion’s den, I might as well take up the “independent reason” adumbrated by Allsop P in Karim at [45]. I respectfully suggest that this argument is unpersuasive. It is true that, as his Honour observed, to “approach the matter as in Pot would see cases of perceived different seriousness by force of statute given the same penalty”. However, the principle of parity has never justified the increase of a comparative sentence but only a decrease. It is also true that the same penalty would apply to cases of differing seriousness, assessed by reference to varying individual objective and subjective circumstances, but those circumstances are precisely what the legislature has mandated should be ignored in those cases. Imposing harsher penalties in the other cases than the circumstances would (absent the mandatory minimum) warrant avoids the problem of unequal outcomes at the price of unjustly increased harshness. In the example given by his Honour, there can be no getting over the apparent injustice of imposing, in a case of “low seriousness and worthy of a sentence of 6 months”, the mandatory sentence which is more harsh by a very significant margin. To then increase a sentence which, on usual principles, warrants a sentence greater than the minimum but must be further increased because of the distorting effect of the minimum penalty is simply to multiply the injustice. I accept, of course, that the Court must apply the law as it is prescribed by the legislature but I do not see that there is a duty to disguise its inherently arbitrary character by emollient jurisprudence.
	


Facts


	
	The following account is taken from the sentencing judge’s reasons in which his Honour, in substance, set out the statement of agreed facts. One Naghie Karini had arranged for a vessel to carry eighty-eight Iranians from Indonesia with a view to bringing them to Australia contrary to Australian immigration law. The vessel departed from an unknown village on the Javanese shore, with the applicant being the only crew member on board. The vessel was wooden, seventeen metres long, four metres wide with a main deck carrying the bridge with the engine housed below the bridge in the lower deck. There were sufficient life jackets for everybody on board. The applicant, when asked by one of the passengers about their destination, said they were heading “towards Darwin” because, “This is the only route I know. I’ve done this twice before, I’ve taken passengers to Darwin twice”. The passengers believed there was not enough food on board to last the twelve or thirteen days it would take to get to Darwin and showed a global positioning system which they had with them to the applicant to indicate the route he intended to take and the route which the passengers believed should be taken. At this point, a fishing boat was sighted, the passengers were instructed to go below deck, the applicant said he would check with the other boat and, if it had a GPS, he would adjust his heading accordingly. However the vessel did not have a GPS and the applicant continued as before. When queried by a passenger about the heading, he said, “I know Darwin, I go to Darwin two times before. I don’t have GPS, I don’t know way to Christmas Island without GPS … I think four or five days I arrive in Darwin but I don’t have GPS, maybe one day longer”. Eventually, however, the applicant altered his course as requested by the passengers. On 6 February, about midday (some two hours later), the vessel was sighted by a border protection aircraft when it was three nautical miles inside the Australian contiguous zone. It was intercepted by an Australian naval vessel when it was 11 nautical miles from Christmas Island and about 13 nautical miles within the Australian contiguous zone. Sometime later, the applicant and the passengers were transferred into the custody of immigration officers at Christmas Island. He was eventually interviewed by members of the Australian Federal Police but declined to answer any questions.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded from the tendered photographs that the vessel “was not terribly seaworthy” and the applicant, along with the eighty-eight passengers, might be thought to have been in considerable peril. His Honour said that he did not know why the applicant undertook the journey but surmised that it was because of his poverty. Of course, he knew that he was committing an offence against Australian laws and the consequences of interception which he understood would be inevitable. The applicant had the responsibility of insuring that the vessel reached Australia though he was neither given adequate navigational equipment and, perhaps, did not himself have sufficient skills to undertake this voyage competently. The passengers had to assist him. The applicant had not organised the voyage but was aware of the nature of the enterprise. His Honour concluded, “He was set up to take the risks by persons in Indonesia, no doubt who were taking much of the money.”
	
	
	In respect of the applicant’s earlier offence, to which he pleaded guilty, he was the master of an Indonesian vessel, and with two other crew, was taking 57 asylum seekers including men, women and children to Ashmore Reef, when the boat was intercepted. At the time, his wife was pregnant and he was making $1 or $2 a day when he could get work as a fisherman. He was offered the equivalent of AUD50 to undertake a voyage, which was described to him as “a picnic”. The circumstances of the voyage are not presently relevant except that it was accepted by the County Court that, given his background, the lack of experience and where he had grown up and lived, he did believe at first that he was employed to take a group of people on a picnic, thinking that Ashmore Reef was a part of Indonesia and only later became aware that the voyage in fact involved the smuggling of asylum seekers to Australia.
	


Subjective features


	
	At the time of the earlier sentence proceedings (the source for information about the subjective case) the applicant had no prior convictions. He was then 39 years old born in a village in North Buton on Southeast Sulawesi. His parents were fisher folk who were still alive. He has older brothers and sisters and is married with children of his own. He was still living with his parents near the village where he was born when he undertook the first trip. He had left school at the age of 15, worked as a fisherman and married about 2003, as at 2012 with two children aged 5 and 3 years. He and his family lived in a single room in a small block of flats with concrete floor and walls and no running water or electricity, sharing a communal bathroom with five other families and obtaining water from a well attached to the building. The applicant lived in poverty, making $1 or $2 a day when he was able to get work. As mentioned, when he undertook his previous voyage his wife was pregnant. Tragically, that child lived only two days. It is fair to say that the applicant has been a responsible husband and father working very hard for little pay to support his family. It is reasonable to infer that he undertook the present voyage by being offered what for him would have been a substantial sum (given that he was aware of the inevitability and consequences of interception) almost certainly trivial by Australian standards and a tiny proportion of the money paid to Mr Karimee by his passengers. He is now 44 years of age.
	
	
	The applicant has been diagnosed with Hepatitis B which, if chronic, carries a significantly increased risk of developing liver cancer. He is being treated for this condition in custody. The sentencing judge accepted that this illness may make his time in custody “euphemistically…somewhat less comfortable”. His Honour accepted that, although the applicant knew what he was doing, the repeated misconduct was a result of his own appalling circumstances and family situation.
	


Discussion


	
	As the Crown rightly points out – indeed, it is conceded by counsel for the applicant – the fact the applicant has previously offended suggests that greater emphasis needs to be given to the need for personal deterrence. Otherwise, the subjective circumstances are such as to excite the sympathy of the Court. The Crown submits that the accused’s conduct imperilled the safety of the eighty-eight asylum seekers, a number which should be compared with the number required for the offence itself of only more than five people. (The number of asylum seekers is, of course, a measure of the objective seriousness of the offence but I do not think that its significance is usefully informed by comparison with the minimum number required to make out the offence.) The applicant was on conditional liberty for a similar offence. He performed the role of captain but he was not the organiser. His role was vital to the enterprise. At the same time, his poverty was used by the organiser to manipulate him into undertaking the voyage which, he would have known, would involve interception and a lengthy gaol sentence and corresponding separation from his family, his wife and children. It is the certainty of being caught which justifies the conclusion that he was driven to commit the crime by his personal situation, of which the organiser took advantage but, of course, no responsibility. Indeed, the organiser succeeded.
	
	
	Broadly speaking the matters of peculiar relevance to assessing the seriousness of this offence are as follows (adopted from Cita & Anor v R [2001] WASCA 5; (2001) 120 A Crim R 307 at [24], [25] and [28]): the frustration of the legislative and administrative system by which Australia seeks to deal in a fair and orderly way with non-citizens who wish to come to Australia, including, especially, refugees; the considerable administrative burden and expense for the asylum seekers’ care and custody, as well as the costs of detection; and the significant health and quarantine risks associated with the unofficial entry of these people. The Crown also points to the diversion of funds from dealing with the needs of others who have not found the opportunity or money to effect a clandestine entry into Australia and the the exploitation of non-citizens attempting to enter Australia illegally, relying upon the above cited passages from Cita. To my mind, there is no basis for assuming that funds needed to deal with unlawful entrance involve any diversion from caring for the needs of legal immigrants although, of course, it must be accepted, that the extra expense represents funds which would no doubt be available to be used by the government for other purposes. The Crown also submitted that the asylum seekers were exploited by the payment of large sums of money to secure their passage and taking the risks of such a journey. However, whilst making a profit from the desperation of others may be regarded in a general sense as morally repugnant, I do not see how in any particular case or cases this can be seen as exploitative without information about the facts, for example, the ability of the asylum seekers to pay and the actual motive for wishing to come to Australia. These qualifications do not lessen the force of the other matters to which I have referred which demonstrate that the applicant was guilty of a serious crime against Australian law. I would add the important factor that no society can permit people to make a profit out of breaking the laws.
	
	
	Whilst general deterrence is undoubtedly relevant, at the same time, it is necessary to be realistic about it. Whilst ever there is a large number (as plainly is the case) of people with some seafaring experience whose poverty makes even small payments a significant reward, the long line of willing participants such as the applicant will not much be diminished by sentences which, in this country, are regarded as appropriate, even giving full weight to the evident policy of Parliament and the measure of seriousness implicit in the provisions to which I have referred.
	
	
	Given the applicant’s vital role, his criminality cannot be regarded as being in the lowest category, so his sentence must be greater than the prescribed minimum.
	
	
	The applicant has pleaded guilty to the charge which, the Crown agrees, was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. In so far as the Crown case was overwhelming, the plea does not evidence any contrition and there is no other evidence in this regard. It has been held that the general principles stated in R v Thompson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; (2000) 115 A Crim R 104 apply and the range of discount of 10% to 25% is applicable: R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196 at [24]-[28]; R v Otto [2005] NSWCCA 333; (2005) 157 A Crim R 540 at [69]. It is also important to note that the severity of punishment is not measured in a linear way. I propose a starting point of 7 years head sentence, reduced by 25% to 5 years and 3 months. It will be seen that the ratio between the applicable mandatory minimum sentence and the corresponding non-parole period is 5:3, that is, the non-parole period is 60% of the minimum sentence. (A similar ratio of 63% applies to the higher mandatory minimum sentence of 8 years imprisonment.) This might imply a legislative indication of the appropriate ratio between sentence and non-parole period in other cases. However, to apply it in this case would result in a non-parole period of slightly over 3 years and 1 month which, to my mind, is inappropriately low considering the required approach to the significance of the mandatory minimum non-parole period. Accordingly, I propose a non-parole period of 3 years 10 months, commencing on 6 February 2013, the date upon which the applicant came into detention on interception of the vessel by the Royal Australian Navy.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J, for the reasons his Honour has stated. Adams J has undertaken the task of re-sentencing the applicant on the premise that we are bound by the approach stated in Bahar, approved by this Court (sitting with a bench of five) in Karim. In doing so, however, Adams J has expressed his own disagreement with that approach. With unfeigned respect to those who have joined in the approach stated in Bahar, I share Adams J's reservations as to its correctness.
	
	
	The analysis preferred by Adams J finds some resonance in the judgment of Keane J in Magaming at [107], where his Honour described as ""ironic"" the appellant's invoking of the separation of powers to impugn the validity of the provisions fixing mandatory minimum sentences for certain people smuggling offences. Keane J said:
	


""In truth, the institutional integrity of the judiciary would be compromised by accepting the argument that the validity of s 236B(3)(c) of the Act is conditional upon acceptance by a sentencing judge that the sentence enacted by the legislature is no more than is appropriate to that judge's opinion of the culpability of the person convicted of the offence.""


	
	Those remarks reflect an analysis which would hold that a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, while removing the power of the sentencing judge to impose a lesser sentence, does not supplant the function of assessing the appropriate (proportionate) penalty for the offending under consideration. Common to the several judgments in Magaming is an acceptance that that is exclusively a judicial function, albeit one bounded (inter alia) by statutory requirements: see majority judgment at [47]; Keane J agreeing at [100]; and per Gageler J at [61]. The exercise of that exclusively judicial function is bound but not bent by the statute.
	
	
	I appreciate that the High Court in Magaming did not directly address the correctness of that aspect of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal (which, as noted by Allsop P at [40], was not central to the argument). Nevertheless, a measure of tension may be discerned between the unanimous premise of the judgments in Magaming and the principles in Bahar approved in Karim.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

On 15 November 2013 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of importing a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely 2.8959 kgs of heroin, contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. The threshold commercial quantity of heroin under the Code is 1.5 kgs.


	
	On 14 February 2014 Arnott SC DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing 16 May 2012 and expiring 15 May 2019 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 15 May 2023.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – The learned sentencing judge’s rejection of the opinions of Dr Jacmon resulted in a denial of procedural fairness and a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 2 – The learned sentencing judge erred by rejecting Dr Jacmon’s opinions that:

(a)   The applicant was suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time of the offences; and

(b)   The applicant was suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time of sentence.


	
	If successful on these Grounds of Appeal, the applicant seeks an order that the sentence be quashed and that the matter be remitted to the District Court for further hearing and determination.
	


Factual background


	
	There was substantial agreement between the parties as to the facts on which the applicant was to be sentenced. However, the applicant’s role in the offence was not agreed. There was also a contest between the parties as to whether uncharged acts of the applicant could be proved beyond reasonable doubt. These acts were the applicant’s involvement in three other consignments described as containing Fuji film in late April and early May 2012.
	
	
	The Crown’s evidence before his Honour was the Agreed Statement of Facts with the qualifications to which I have referred. Photographs and transcripts of intercepted telephone calls and listening device intercepts supplemented the Agreed Statement of Facts.
	
	
	The applicant, a Chinese National, arrived in Australia on 10 March 2012 from Hong Kong on a three month visa. In April 2012 he rented accommodation at 34 Hollis Avenue, Eastwood. On the afternoon of 18 April 2012 a telephone call between the applicant and Chun Lok Lam was recorded. In that call the applicant referred to “total should be 1400” and that they “both should go over to BJ’s place first”, that the applicant should “get off first and look for the person”, that he would “come over again and that is the safest”. Later that evening another telephone call between those two was intercepted. In it the applicant referred to himself as now “being the runner at every occasion”, and that “quite a few people have come over … We are working as runner for them”.
	


Consignment 1


	
	On 9 May 2012 a consignment arrived by FedEx Airfreight at Sydney Airport from Hong Kong addressed to Ho Chi Man of 2 Eastwood Avenue, Eastwood. A mobile phone contact number, the last three digits of which were 584, was written on the address. Customs officers examined the contents and found it to contain two Fuji film cameras and 18 boxes of Fuji film. Heroin was found concealed inside one of the boxes of Fuji film. The purity of the heroin ranged between 71.9% and 76.2% and accordingly the total weight of pure heroin was calculated to be 1.5635 kgs.
	
	
	On the morning of 11 May 2012 a Federal Police officer, dressed in a FedEx uniform, tried to deliver the package to 2 Eastwood Avenue. An unidentified male at the address said that he did not know anyone by the name of Ho Chi Man and refused to accept delivery of the consignment.
	
	
	When the applicant was arrested on 16 May 2012 he was in possession of two mobile phones. The SIM card for one of those phones was registered to the name and address of someone other than the applicant. A number of text messages were located on the handset, which referred to the waybill number for the consignment and the address at 2 Eastwood Avenue. The other phone when examined, revealed that it had been used to search Google Maps for 2 Eastwood Avenue. After the applicant’s arrest, his residence at 34 Hollis Avenue, Eastwood was searched and the SIM card for the mobile phone service ending in 584 (being the telephone number on the consignment) was found.
	


Consignment 2


	
	On 14 May 2012 a consignment arrived by FedEx Airfreight at Sydney Airport addressed to Lam Man Leung of 136 The Boulevard Strathfield, from Hong Kong. A mobile phone contact number the last three digits of which were 079 was written on the address. Customs officers examined the consignment and found it to contain 10 table-tennis bats. A total of 1.395 kilograms of heroin was found concealed inside the table-tennis bats. The purity of the heroin ranged between 52.9% and 77.5% and accordingly the total weight of pure heroin was calculated to be 822.3 grams.
	
	
	Australian Federal Police officers substituted flour for the heroin. A listening device was inserted in the consignment. On 16 May 2012, an AFP officer dressed in a FedEx uniform tried to deliver the consignment to 136 The Boulevarde. No persons were at home and the officer left a note with contact details including a telephone number to arrange a future delivery.
	
	
	At about 1pm, this AFP officer received a call asking for the consignment to be delivered, not to 136 The Boulevarde, but to the premises at 138. The caller was a co-offender, Shing Yuet Yeung. Mr Yeung was a Hong Kong national who had arrived in Australia in April and had subleased a room at 138 The Boulevarde. Telephone intercept and call charge records indicated numerous calls between Yeung and the applicant in the two weeks before 16 May 2012.
	
	
	At about 1.50pm, acting as a FedEx courier, the AFP officer delivered the consignment to 138 The Boulevarde. Yeung took delivery of it. After he took delivery, there were a number of telephone calls between him and Binh Huy Tran, referred to in the calls as ""Jimmy"". Tran was to collect the consignment at 3pm that day. There were then a number of calls between the applicant and Yeung. In one call at 2.12pm, Yeung asked the applicant if he was coming over and that, ""it's set at 3 o'clock"". At 2.45pm, the applicant arrived by taxi at 138 The Boulevarde. The listening device recorded a conversation between Leung and the applicant in which Leung explained to him that the heroin did not seem right, that it was the wrong weight and consistency to that which he expected and that he had told this to ""the boss of the other side"". Leung said it had no smell and that ""previous ones really irritates the nose"".
	
	
	The applicant was arrested when he left the premises. He was carrying a notebook with the address ""138 The Boulevarde, Strathfield"" written in it. He was also carrying $1,250 in cash.
	


Consignment 3


	
	On 17 May 2012, a consignment arrived by FedEx Airfreight at Sydney Airport addressed to Mr Yeung, 32 Hollis Avenue, Eastwood which was next door to the applicant’s address. A mobile phone contact number, the last three digits of which were 851, was written on the address. The SIM card corresponding to the mobile telephone number ending in 851 was found at 138 The Boulevarde when those premises were searched.
	
	
	Custom officers examined the contents of the consignment and found it to contain a silver coloured plastic trophy. There was a cavity inside the trophy in which eight foil packages of heroin were found. The base of the trophy also had a cavity in it in which another four plastic bags of heroin were found. A total of 1030.6 grams of heroin was found. The purity of the heroin ranged between 48.7% and 50.6% and, accordingly, the total weight of pure heroin was calculated to be 510.1 grams.
	
	
	An examination of one of the phones in the possession of the applicant at the time when he was arrested, revealed that he had dialled the airway bill number for consignment 3. The applicant had accessed the FedEx online tracking system for consignment 3, and had searched the Google Maps App, not for 34 but 32 Hollis Avenue, Eastwood. Further analysis showed that he had sent the address, ""32 Hollis Avenue, Eastwood"", to two other mobile telephone numbers. In the notebook which he had when he was arrested, was written the address, 32 Hollis Avenue.
	
	
	In an intercepted telephone call on 10 May 2012 the applicant told Yeung how to dismantle a consignment containing narcotics concealed within a cup or trophy, similar to the content of Consignment 3. On 11 May 2012 another conversation between the applicant and an unknown male with an Australian mobile phone number was intercepted which talked about the contents of various consignments, including a trophy.
	
	
	The total weight of pure heroin in the three consignments was 2.8959 kilograms. It had a wholesale value of $1,108,375 and a street value of between $2,895,860 and $3,378,480.
	
	
	Intercepted telephone calls between the applicant and several of his associates between 18 April and 11 May 2002 revealed the applicant to have been what the Agreed Statement of Facts referred to as “a key intermediary in an international drug syndicate” importing illicit drugs into Australia. He also trained other people in Australia to carry out the same role. Several calls had the applicant discussing the weight of drugs imported or to be imported and the timing of the arrival of various consignments. They indicated his association with Mr Lam and Mr Yeung, as well as Chun Kit Lam, Bin Je Wang and a person in Hong Kong known only as ""Elder Brother"".
	
	
	On various occasions imported drugs were delivered to all these associates. In conversations the applicant discussed with these individuals the packaging in which the drugs were to arrive in Australia. He also discussed the amount of money he was earning in carrying out his role as intermediary and complained that he had not yet made enough money to ""reach his goal"". He discussed the practice adopted by the syndicate of addressing consignments to premises next door to the intended delivery address.
	


The sentence proceedings


	
	The applicant in the sentence proceedings submitted that he acted as a runner under supervision and direction for $1,000 for each consignment but made nothing. He submitted that his decision to come to Australia was brought about by the relationship with his girlfriend terminating, and a desire for a holiday and to see a friend with whom he had been to school in Australia. The applicant emphasised that he had only $1,250 on him when arrested.
	
	
	His Honour rejected those submissions and set out his findings as follows:
	


“I find, as the Crown submits, that the offender acted as an intermediary in arranging for the consignment of three packages sent from Hong Kong to

Australia, each of which concealed heroin. In performing this role, he travelled

to Australia in early March 2012 for the purpose of involving himself in this

offence with other syndicate members, rented accommodation at 34 Hollis

Avenue, Eastwood - and it will be remembered consignment 3 was addressed

to 32 Hollis Avenue - contacted persons in Australia and overseas to arrange

for the importation of the consignments, including providing addresses to

which each consignment would be sent and providing mobile phone numbers

on which he could be contacted as consignee, acted as a ""lookout"" or ""runner"" when consignment 2 was being delivered to 138 The Boulevarde, instructed Yeung in carrying out his role as an intermediary, tracked consignment 3 from Hong Kong to Australia by accessing the FedEx website, contacted various people in Australia who were to be the ultimate recipients of the consignments, and obtained numerous mobile phones and phone services registered in his own and false names in pursuit of these activities.

…

I agree with the Crown submission that the offender demonstrated a high degree of premeditation and planning. The planning, administration and activity extended over at least three months from 10 March to 17 May 2012. I find he was motivated by profit to undertake the dangerous activities he did.

In short, when taking into account the following factors which I find, it can be seen that the seriousness of the offence committed by him was clearly high: the essential role he played in this well planned series of importations, the amount of the drug, the value of the drug, that he entered into the offence for financial motive and knew what the drug was and the approximate quantity. As the Crown points out, intercepted telephone calls between the offender and others mentioned specific quantities or weights of drug to be concealed in various consignments. Whilst an offender may not in many cases of this type be aware of the amount of drug to be imported, the weight of the importation will have increased significance when he is aware of the amount to be imported, R v Lee [2007] NSWCCA 234 at para [23].” (ROS 7 – 8)


	
	On the basis of those findings, his Honour stressed the importance of general deterrence in respect of offenders who were commercially motivated to import drugs into Australia. His Honour wished to make it clear to “would be traffickers” that the potential financial gains from drug importation would be neutralised by the risk of severe punishment.
	
	
	His Honour took into account in the applicant’s favour that the drugs had not found their way into the community. That having been said, his Honour was not prepared to give that factor substantial weight because of the clear intention on the part of the applicant that the drugs would be disseminated within the community.
	
	
	His Honour took into account the provisions of s 16A(1) and s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth). As part of that process, his Honour made findings concerning the applicant’s subjective case.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the applicant had not given evidence. There was, however, tendered in his case a written statement from him, which had attached to it educational certificates of achievement, photographs of him teaching Taekwondo to children, a letter confirming his work in the laundry in prison and a report from Dr Jacmon, psychologist, dated 12 August 2013. There was also a pre-sentence report dated 6 August 2013 from Ms Merhi, a Community Corrections Officer.
	
	
	By reference to that material, his Honour was able to put together the applicant’s background. He had turned 22 in May 2012 and was aged 23 at the time of sentence. The applicant was born and raised in Hong Kong, coming from a stable and close knit family. Both parents were alive and he had two siblings. Before this offence, he had lived in Australia in 2003 for one year when he completed Year 8. He returned to Hong Kong because his parents could not afford to keep him in Australia any longer. He completed his secondary schooling in Hong Kong. Thereafter, he had remained in fairly constant employment as a waiter, hairdresser, delivery driver and for the two and a half years before the offence, as a Taekwondo instructor. In his written statement he said that he had broken off with his girlfriend before coming to Australia.
	
	
	The statement recorded that from the age of 18 until he went into custody, the applicant was a recreational user of cannabis and a drug similar to cocaine. In 2009 a magistrate in Hong Kong had sentenced him for possessing a dangerous drug and resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty to a 12 months probation order. His Honour considered that those past offences had little relevance to this sentencing exercise, other than to indicate that the applicant was familiar with illicit drugs.
	
	
	In relation to the pre-sentence report, and the report from Dr Jacmon, his Honour said:
	


“He told the author of the pre-sentence report that his involvement in the offence was not for financial gain but to help his co-offender Yeung who was a long term friend and who ""set him up"". He claimed to have been initially unaware his co-offenders were attempting to possess unlawfully imported drugs and, when he did, he felt it was too late to inform the authorities. Dr Jacmon took a similar history. The offender told him that when he came to Australia to get over the break-up from his girlfriend, Yeung asked him for addresses in Sydney where he could send fake goods because he did not want them delivered to his own location. Not thinking that this involved a serious criminal offence he went along with Yeung.

I do not accept this story at all. When the offender came to Australia he arrived in Western Australia, and when he moved to Sydney in April 2012 he rented accommodation at 34 Hollis Avenue, Eastwood. The facts indicate the practice of the syndicate was to address consignments to premises next door to the intended delivery address. Furthermore, amongst other things, the intercepted telephone calls captured the offender discussing the amount of money he was earning for performing his role with the syndicate. In one call he complained he had not yet made enough money to ""reach his goal"".

I might add that what he told Dr Jacmon appears, at first blush in any event, at odds with the explanation provided in submissions by Mr Quinn. In his submissions, Mr Quinn stated that Yeung asked the offender if he wanted to earn $1,000 as a runner for consigning goods containing drugs from overseas. I make this only as an observation because what he told Dr Jacmon and the submission made by Mr Quinn may well be reconcilable and I do not place any weight upon this.

Dr Jacmon expressed the opinion that the offender suffers from a major depressive disorder which is likely to have resulted from the long term break-up with his girlfriend in Hong Kong. He accepted the offender's account that he came to Australia to ameliorate or lessen his distress. He then expressed the view that his depression markedly diminished his capacity for judgment and affected his thinking about the consequences. I reject this opinion of Dr Jacmon that the offender was suffering from a major depressive disorder and that his offending was causally related to it. It is in part based on a false history that he was set up by his friend Yeung. The evidence established, to my mind, the offender knew perfectly well what he was doing as well as the gravity and motive behind his actions. I accept he might have broken up with his girlfriend before coming to Australia and being distressed by this and is now suffering some of the depressive symptoms described by Dr Jacmon as a result of the position he now finds himself in. But I do not think he was confused in his problem-solving and decision-making when he committed this offence. I am not satisfied on the balance of probability that he presently suffers from a major depressive disorder.” (ROS 11 – 12)


	
	His Honour found that although the applicant had been slow in displaying contrition and remorse, a measure of it was now emerging. There was some acknowledgment of the impact of his actions upon himself, his family and the community in the pre-sentence report. His Honour was prepared to make that finding, even though the applicant had not given evidence.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of his re-offending were moderate to reasonable. His Honour based this conclusion on his family support, his consistent work history and the good reports of him since being in custody. His Honour took into account that the applicant would be serving a prison sentence in a country which was not his own, and far away from his family and friends, so that his time in prison would be more difficult.
	
	
	His Honour was prepared to discount the applicant’s sentence because of his plea of guilty as being indicative of his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. His Honour noted that the strength of the Crown case was relevant to that consideration. His Honour did not quantify the extent of the discount. While his Honour accepted that the plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest opportunity, his Honour found that it was entered at a reasonably early stage.
	
	
	His Honour then turned his attention to the uncharged acts upon which the Crown relied to rebut the submission that the applicant’s criminality was limited to his involvement in the three consignments particularised in the indictment. As already indicated, the applicant denied that he had been involved in any of the uncharged acts.
	
	
	The Crown case was that when the applicant was arrested, he had a mobile phone with a number which ended in 834. The Crown submitted that an analysis of the phone revealed the following:
	



	
	He had dialled an airway bill number relating to a FedEx consignment described as “Fuji film instant camera and Fuji film instant film” which had been delivered to 138 The Boulevarde on 26 April 2012.
	
	
	He had dialled an airway bill number relating to a FedEx consignment described in the same way which was delivered to 2/21 Rowe Street, Eastwood on 5 May 2012.
	
	
	He had dialled an airway bill number relating to a FedEx consignment also described in the same way as a Fuji camera and film, which was delivered to 138 The Boulevarde on 7 May 2012.
	


Each of these consignments was found to contain heroin.


	
	His Honour found that the applicant’s involvement in those matters was proved beyond reasonable doubt. Since this finding has not been challenged, it is not necessary to set out the evidence on which his Honour’s finding was based.
	
	
	In taking the uncharged matters into account, his Honour was conscious of the fact that he was only sentencing in respect of the offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty (R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466). His Honour did not take those matters into account as circumstances of aggravation but to place the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty in context and to deny him any claim to mitigation or attendant reduction of sentence to which he might have been entitled if the charged offence had been an isolated incident.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the evidence rebutted any suggestion that the applicant’s criminality was limited to involving himself in three isolated acts confined to a narrow two week period and that he should not be afforded any leniency on that basis. His Honour found that the applicant had involved himself in an ongoing course of planning and activity extending over at least three months for the importation of heroin into Australia.
	
	
	Because his Honour had also sentenced a number of co-offenders, he dealt with the issue of parity. That part of his Honour’s consideration is not relevant to the grounds of appeal and there is no need to set out the reasoning.
	
	
	It is, however, necessary to set out in some detail the report of Dr Jacmon. The consultation, which formed the basis of the report, took place on 11 August 2013 while the applicant was in custody. Dr Jacmon was a qualified psychologist and had a doctorate in education, which included research on the treatment of depression. The report said nothing about an interpreter being used, although it is clear from the sentence proceedings that the applicant required an interpreter. The report did not indicate how long the consultation took. The only test, which was administered to the applicant, was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). This is a test which consists of a series of questions administered to the person being assessed.
	
	
	Relevant parts of the report are as follows:
	


“1. Conclusions

The assessment by testing and clinical interview has gathered considerable

information on Mr Lam's state of mind currently and at the time of the incident

now before the Court. On the basis of the results, the research and the

background the following can be stated:

1.   Mr Lam's day-to-day functioning is being impaired by major depressive disorder at clinically significant levels. The impairment is likely to have resulted from the break up with his long-term girlfriend in Hong Kong. The break up led him to visit Sydney in an effort to ameliorate his distress. A friend whom he had met in Hong Kong asked him to provide addresses for the importations of fake goods from China and he complied. Mr Lam's distress intensified when his friend informed him afterward that the importations did not consist of fake goods but of drugs. Mr Lam's depression is worsened by the effects of custody on him.

2.   The symptoms of major depressive disorder include sadness, marked loss of interest and pleasure in life, decrease in appetite, sleep difficulties, irritability, agitation, fatigue, tension, feelings of worthlessness, and cognitive impairments including (a) difficulties in concentration, memory, problem-solving and decision making, (b) confused thinking and (c) impulsivity. Impairments in concentration, learning and memory remain for at least three years after the appearance of the disorders.

3.   The impairments in para 2 markedly diminish the individual's ability to formulate reasoned judgments. Symptoms of depression particularly confused thought and impaired decision-making coupled with the sadness emanating from the ended relationship are likely to have been prominent triggers to the incident. These symptoms would have militated against his capacity to ensure that he kept away from any illegal activity and not give his absolute trust to his friend's initial assurance that the goods to be imported did not involve the commission of a serious offence.

4.   Mr Lam's actions which led to offending indicated markedly diminished capacity for judgment because there appeared to be little thought given to the consequences, the near certainty of detection and arrest and the need to curb impulsivity.

5.   Mr Lam has reflected on his offending behaviour and the consequences of his actions. He expressed remorse for having offended and took full responsibility for the offending actions. He appreciated the damage that drugs caused to their users. He was particularly sad over the effect of his actions on his parents and brother. He has not told his aged paternal grandparents because he is afraid that the news would distress them and threaten their wellbeing.

6.   Mr Lam's disorder needs treatment to address the symptoms, relieve distress and to enable positive outcomes in the future. Treatment should help safeguard against the manifestation of behaviour that risks offending. … The prognosis for treatment is encouraging because Mr Lam has the support of his family.

7.   Given that deportation is a likely option after he completes his sentence Mr Lam should seek treatment on his return to China.

8.   Completion of treatment and continuation of support by his family should (i) ameliorate the disorders, (ii) markedly reduce the probability of re-offending, and (iii) help Mr Lam lead a lawful and satisfying life.

9.   A lengthy custodial sentence is unlikely to help Mr Lam address his disorder. Psychological treatment on a one-on-one basis as outlined in the treatment plan would be more effective if done over time while Mr Lam is living and working in the community and being supported by his family.”


	
	Dr Jacmon expanded the history received from the applicant as follows:
	


“4.   Background as related by client

Mr Lam was born in Hong Kong. He has an older brother. His parents operate a fruit and vegetable stall at a local market. The family is close and supportive. After completing 12 years schooling Mr Lam joined the workforce. He worked as a casual in several occupations including in a restaurant and as a driver.

In 2010 he met Sham and a relationship developed. The couple did not cohabit but saw each other frequently and their relationship was warm and satisfying. In January 2012 the relationship destabilised and the couple broke up.

Mr Lam became markedly distressed at the break up. His sadness hardly lifted. There was little in his life that drew his interest or gave him pleasure. He felt that his future was hopeless without Sham and blamed himself for the break up. He was restless, irritable and had little energy. His concentration suffered and he had great difficulty in making decisions. He suffered from sleeplessness as thoughts of the break up circled his mind. He was disappointed in himself and felt worthless. He tried to reconcile with her to no avail.

He decided to visit Australia in an effort to put the failed relationship behind him and raise his mood. He gained a visa in March 2012 and came to Sydney. In the next month he rented accommodation in Eastwood. Shortly after arrival he met Yeung who was a friend of his from Hong Kong. Yeung asked him for addresses in Sydney where he could arrange to send fake goods because he did not want them delivered to his own location. Mr Lam did not consider that such a proposal constituted a serious criminal offence and gave him the addresses that he had acquired for him.

Soon after this request was fulfilled Yeung informed Mr Lam that the goods were in fact drugs. Mr Lam became markedly distressed because he realised that he had been led without his knowledge by a friend he trusted into a criminal enterprise. The distress over the break up with Sham which had begun to abate now intensified as he realised the consequences of his actions.

Remorse

Mr Lam expressed remorse for having offended and took full responsibility for the offending actions. He appreciated the damage that drugs caused to users. He was particularly sad over the effect of his actions on his parents and brother. He has not told his aged paternal grandparents because he is afraid that the news would distress them and threaten their wellbeing.

…

Assessment process

Mr Lam's presentation and background indicated depression with anxiety. He was assessed by psychological testing and by clinical interview.

A.    Psychometric assessment

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)

The BDI measures the severity of depressive thinking on behaviour and also indicates the extent of anxiety affecting functioning. Mr Lam's results indicate severe depression and the existence of anxiety.

B.   Clinical assessment

The tests and the background indicated depression. Mr Lam was clinically assessed for this condition on the basis of DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition)) criteria.

(a)   Disorders at the present time

Mr Lam's description of current day-to-day functioning led to the identification of the following symptoms, classified in terms of DSM-5 criteria:

(i)    Major depressive disorder

Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood, or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.

1.   Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day as indicated by subjective report or observation made by others. Indicated.

2.   Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by subjective report or observation). Both indicated.

3.   Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Appetite loss indicated.

4.   Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day observable by others. Insomnia indicated.

5.   Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others). Agitation indicated.

6.   Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. Both indicated.

7.   Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick). Worthlessness indicated.

8.   Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or Indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective report or as observed by others) Both

indicated.

9.   Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal

ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan

for committing suicide. Not indicated.

The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Indicated.

The symptoms as indicated meet at minimum five criteria including at least one of the first two criteria and the last criterion in the same 2-week period. Hence the condition is diagnosed as major depressive disorder.

(b)   Disorders at the time surrounding the incident before the Court

The background indicated depression at the time surrounding the incident now before the Court. Mr Lam's description of functioning at that time indicated the existence of the same criteria for depression as at the present time.”


	
	The matter first came before his Honour for sentence on 15 November 2013. Because of the disputed issues of fact, the Crown advised the court that the matter would have to be adjourned so that witnesses could be called on those issues. The Crown tendered its Statement of Facts, the pre-sentence report, transcripts of telephone calls and photographs. The Crown also handed up its written sentencing submissions. Shortly after that hearing, the report of Dr Jacmon was served on the Crown.
	
	
	The matter next came before the Court on 6 December 2013. It is apparent from the transcript of those proceedings that the matter was reached late in the day and that there was some pressure on both counsel to complete the matter. On that occasion, Dr Jacmon’s report was tendered, together with the applicant’s statement, testimonials, certificates of achievements and a letter from the Metropolitan Remand Centre. At the conclusion of his submissions, counsel for the applicant thanked the court staff for staying back (T.25.46). In addition to its written submissions, which had been placed before the court on the previous occasion, the Crown briefly addressed. The Crown made it clear in submissions that it disputed the factual assertions by and on behalf of the applicant that he had occupied a subordinate role to Yeung and had been led into the offending by Yeung.
	
	
	On that issue, the Crown said:
	


“The Crown does not concede that he occupied a lower role to Yeung. We would say he was senior to Yeung. Ultimately they were occupying the same role in a sense but the character of the telephone intercepts material, I invite your Honour to read those, even the contents of that very first call I think it is, I submit that your Honour should not accept the story that's been given that the offender was recruited by Yeung. The evidence is that the offender came to Australia some time earlier and even this first phone call on 25 April we state he's indicated that he's - sorry, ""I am being the runner on every occasion, it involves some quite intensive participation in the enterprise"" at 25 April and we know that Mr Yeung only arrived in the country four days prior to that on 21 April. So if I can just point to the implausibility of that account of how the offender came to be involved in this enterprise. I'd submit your Honour should reject that account and find that although Mr Yeung and the offender occupied a very similar role the offender was occupying that role at the first instance and then instructed Yeung on how that role was to be performed and there's in particular a listening device referred to in the submissions where the offender is instructing Mr Yeung on how the number on the - the exact address should be changed so effectively it's delivered to the next door and he also in another call instructs him on how to dismantle various items that have been delivered.

The Crown would invite you to reject the version that the offender is in a very difficult financial position. There's no evidence of that before the Court and there's repeated references to the offender making the comment that I've made X amount of dollars, I haven't reached my goal yet. Indeed we see in that first call on p 2 an associate of the offender saying, ""You have made so

much and still not enough"". The clear inference is that the offender had made a significant amount of money by being involved in this enterprise at that point. In the absence of any strong evidence to the contrary your Honour should just reject that submission the Crown submits.

Again in the same line it is submitted that the offender was not a pawn in the operation but occupied a vital link in the international enterprise. This is again evidence in the listening device material, he had close ties with senior syndicate members in Hong Kong and made phone calls to them. He clearly would have had pre-knowledge of the arrival of all six consignments which are referred to in the table. He was provided with the airway bill number, and that goes back to that first entry in his phone on 24 April, which is again only three days after Mr Yeung had arrived in the country. …” (T.27.20 – 28.7, 6.12.13)


	
	The Crown’s written submissions, which were handed up on 15 November 2013, were to similar effect on that issue. They provided more detail as to the importance of the applicant’s role in the drug importation scheme. The written submissions also went into considerable detail as to the applicant’s awareness of the nature of the imported substance and the financial motivation for his offending (AB 312 – 313, 315 – 316).
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – The learned sentencing judge’s rejection of the opinions of Dr Jacmon resulted in a denial of procedural fairness and a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 2 – The learned sentencing judge erred by rejecting Dr Jacmon’s opinions that:

(a)   The applicant was suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time of the offences; and

(b)   The applicant was suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time of sentence. 


	
	It is convenient to deal with both Grounds of Appeal together since they raise the same issue.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that Dr Jacmon, as an expert in the field of depression, had expressed an opinion that his functioning was impaired by a major depressive disorder which likely resulted from the breakup with his girlfriend in Hong Kong. This had led to him travelling to Sydney to ameliorate his distress, had affected his judgment so that he helped a friend to provide addresses for the importation of fake goods from China and his distress increased when he discovered that the importations contained drugs. The applicant submitted that Dr Jacmon had connected the commission of the offence to his depressive condition in that it had diminished his capacity for judgment and therefore had limited his capacity to avoid illegal activity which meant that he placed greater trust in his friend’s assurance that the consignments did not contain drugs. The applicant submitted that the acceptance of the opinions of Dr Jacmon played an important part in his case on sentence in that an acceptance of the opinion in the report must have resulted in a substantially lesser sentence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that during the proceedings on sentence, his Honour gave no indication that he would reject Dr Jacmon’s opinion with respect to his major depressive disorder, both at the time of the offence or at the time of sentence. He submitted that the Crown had not objected to the report at the time of its tender and had not called any psychiatric or psychological evidence to rebut that of Dr Jacmon. The applicant submitted that at no time did the Crown submit that Dr Jacmon’s opinion should not be accepted.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that it was open to his Honour to reject that part of the applicant’s history to Dr Jacmon with respect to the part played by Yeung, but it was not open to his Honour to reject Dr Jacmon’s opinion with respect to his mental state at the time of the offence and at the time of sentence. The applicant submitted that his Honour had an obligation to impose the appropriate sentence based on the evidence properly before him (O’Neil-Shaw v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 42 at [26]). The applicant submitted that where evidence was not challenged or disputed by the Crown and was not inherently implausible, his Honour was not entitled to reject it or fail to act on it, or “at least was not entitled to do so without proper notice to the applicant that he intended to take that course” (O’Neil-Shaw v The Queen at [26]).
	
	
	The applicant submitted that if his Honour had any doubts about the report of Dr Jacmon, he should have communicated those doubts to the parties and his failure to do so gave rise to a denial of procedural fairness. The applicant submitted that the prosecution’s approach to the report of Dr Jacmon was limited to attacking the history taken by Dr Jacmon with respect to Yeung, which was relevant to his Honour’s assessment of the applicant’s role in the offence. The applicant submitted that the Crown made no submissions as to whether the applicant was suffering from a major depressive disorder, either at the time of the offence or at the time of sentence.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that there might be circumstances in which the opinion of a mental health expert relied heavily on an offender’s account of the offending, such that a sentencing judge was entitled to accord diminished weight to the opinion because of the unreliability of the offender’s account. The applicant submitted that this was not such a case. The applicant submitted that once his Honour accepted that the applicant had broken up with his girlfriend, he should also have accepted Dr Jacmon’s opinion as to the continuing effects of the major depressive disorder brought about by that event.
	
	
	In support of those submissions, the applicant relied upon what was said by Emmett JA and Simpson J in Cherdchoochatri v R [2013] NSWCCA 118; 277 FLR 126 where their Honours said:
	


“9   In particular, I agree with her Honour that, in circumstances where the Crown did not seek to test the applicant's evidence concerning the alleged duress, and the sentencing judge did not make clear that the applicant's evidence of duress should not be accepted, the applicant was denied procedural fairness. The sentencing judge did not give any indication of his view of the applicant's evidence of duress by, for example, drawing attention to the apparent absence of any mention by the applicant, prior to his evidence on sentencing, of the alleged duress, such as during his interview with a psychologist, Mr Howard. No suggestion was made to the sentencing judge that the applicant's evidence of duress should not be accepted, though the sentencing judge apparently believed, erroneously, that the Crown had made a submission that that evidence should be given little weight. If, notwithstanding that the Crown made no submission, his Honour proposed to reach a conclusion on the assumption that that evidence was not to be accepted, procedural fairness required that his Honour give the applicant notice of that rejection. His Honour failed to do so.” (Emmett JA)

“47   The present issue is whether, in the absence of notice given by the Crown to the applicant that his evidence was in contest, the judge was entitled to take that course.

…

57   It was also open to the Crown in submissions to signify that it did not ""passively and unquestioningly"" accept the evidence, and did not accept that the judge should do so. The Crown may have drawn attention to the apparent absence of any mention by the applicant prior to his evidence of the events he then recounted. This is where it seems to me that the applicant is on stronger ground. The Crown not having taken that course, it was not unreasonable for the applicant's counsel to proceed on the basis that his evidence was accepted. I have mentioned above ""the first part of the proposition put on behalf of the applicant"". The second part is that, if he were contemplating rejecting the applicant's evidence, then, in the circumstances as they existed, fairness dictated that the judge himself give the applicant notice of that consideration. Such a course is expressly mentioned by Basten JA in the last sentence at [26] in the passage cited above from O'Neil-Shaw.

58   It being apparent that the applicant relied to a significant extent on that evidence, and there having been no opposition by the Crown, fairness dictated that the applicant's counsel be notified that the judge was sceptical about the account given by the applicant. It was not accurate to say, as his Honour did (in the first paragraph extracted above), that the Crown had submitted that little weight should be given to the applicant's evidence. No such submission was made, either in writing or orally. Alerting counsel to the possibility of rejection of the applicant's case on motivation would, at least, have enabled counsel to make further submissions with a view to urging his Honour to accept what the applicant had said. It may even have been possible to call additional evidence in support, for example, from the applicant's wife, or from Mr Howard. …” (Simpson J)


	
	The applicant also relied upon the following observations by Allsop P (with whom Price J agreed) in Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 where his Honour said:
	


“88   It is one thing to discount admissible statements made to a psychiatrist or psychologist if the offender is not prepared to give evidence to the same effect: Qutami at 377 [58]-[59] and 380 [79] and [83] and Palu at 184-185 [40] and 175 [1] and [2] (although care needs to be taken not effectively to exclude admissible evidence by a process going beyond an assessment of weight); it is quite another to lessen the effect of the opinion of a professional psychiatrist, without cross-examination, when that opinion is based on history. In most cases, a psychiatrist will form a diagnosis from what is said to her or him; that is the very nature of the professional expertise being deployed. Part of the professional skill of the psychiatrist is the assessment of the history - how it accords with hypothesised and formed views of the professional. To say that the applicant was manipulating the psychiatrists is to criticise the professional opinions of the psychiatrists and should be put to them. The sentencing judge should not have diminished the weight of the psychiatrists who came to the view that the applicant had some insight into his condition. Further, the submissions of the applicant about her Honour's findings concerning his response to medication have force.”


	
	The applicant submitted that it was not reasonably open to the sentencing judge to reject the psychological case advanced by him that his major depressive disorder was causally related to his offending and that he was suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time of sentence. The applicant submitted that the Crown did not require Dr Jacmon for cross-examination and did not advance an alternative psychological case.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that Dr Jacmon’s opinion should have been accepted and that his mental illness should have been taken into account in accordance with the principles summarised by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]:
	


“●    Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence.

●    It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.

●    It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced.

● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence. …”

Consideration


	
	His Honour’s rejection of the opinion of Dr Jacmon was based on his Honour’s rejection of the history upon which that opinion was based. That is a legitimate basis for rejecting the conclusions in an expert’s report (Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; 52 NSWLR 705 (Priestley, Powell and Heydon JJA at [4], [10], [21], [64] – [78])).
	
	
	Fundamental to the opinion of Dr Jacmon was an acceptance of the following matters:
	



	
	That the applicant had broken up with his girlfriend before coming to Australia.
	
	
	That this had caused him to become profoundly depressed.
	
	
	That he came to Australia in an attempt to alleviate this depression.
	
	
	Shortly after his arrival, the applicant met Yeung who persuaded him to assist in the importation of fake goods. He became involved in this enterprise because of his diminished capacity for judgment.
	
	
	He subsequently learned that he was involved in the importation of drugs which markedly increased his depression.
	
	
	He remained significantly depressed at the time of his interview with Dr Jacmon.
	



	
	Whether or not the applicant had in fact broken up with his girlfriend and had become depressed thereby could not be directly challenged because the applicant did not give evidence. His motivation for coming to Australia, however, could and was directly challenged. The explanation given to Dr Jacmon was demonstrated by the evidence to be untrue. So also were the circumstances of his contact with Yeung and his involvement with the importation of drugs into Australia.
	
	
	The evidence before his Honour made it clear that the applicant’s arrival in Australia was premeditated and planned as were his subsequent actions in arranging for addresses to which consignments could be sent. His evidence concerning Yeung was clearly a falsehood in that he had arrived in Australia weeks before Yeung and the telephone intercepts made it clear that he was the person giving directions and providing information to Yeung. His motivation for his involvement in drug importation was financial gain, not that he had been inadvertently drawn into such a scheme because of a reduced capacity (due to depression) to make appropriate decisions. The disconnect between the history taken from the applicant by Dr Jacmon and the reality was not just a matter of detail but comprised a sequence of deliberate falsehoods designed to exculpate him from responsibility for his conduct.
	
	
	The extent of the applicant’s falsehoods was such that his Honour was entitled to reject the key conclusions of Dr Jacmon. It is apparent that if there had been a breakup with his girlfriend resulting in depression, that had nothing to do with the offending. The applicant’s actions and the inferences to be drawn from the telephone intercepts made it clear that he had full knowledge and appreciation of exactly what he was doing when importing drugs. As indicated, the history concerning Yeung was also a fabrication. Given the level of deceit practised upon Dr Jacmon on these key issues by the applicant, it was open to his Honour to reject not only those parts of the applicant’s history which could be proven to be falsehoods but those in respect of which there was no evidence except the unsubstantiated assertions of the applicant reported second hand by Dr Jacmon, i.e. the fact that he was depressed as a result of the breakup with his girlfriend and the fact that he was depressed at the time of examination. As his Honour observed, he may well have been somewhat depressed when examined by Dr Jacmon but this was because he was facing a substantial term of imprisonment, not because of what had happened in relation to his girlfriend, or because he had discovered that he had inadvertently become involved in drug importation.
	
	
	While it is true that the Crown did not in terms attack the report of Dr Jacmon and his conclusions it did, both in writing and orally, attack the applicant’s version of events as set out in his statement and as accepted by Dr Jacmon. Counsel for the applicant was well aware of this attack and made submissions in response. Once the substratum upon which Dr Jacmon’s conclusions were based was destroyed, those conclusions could not stand.
	
	
	It follows that there was no unfairness in what his Honour did. He made findings as to the part played by the applicant in the importation. That was an issue which was consciously contested by the parties. The effect of those findings was to almost completely undermine the conclusions of Dr Jacmon which were based on a version of the facts rejected by his Honour.
	
	
	It is no answer to say that his Honour should have given notice that he was considering rejecting Dr Jacmon’s opinion. It must have been apparent to counsel appearing for the applicant that if his Honour rejected the applicant’s submissions as to the part he played in the importation, that this would have a knock on effect in relation to the conclusions of Dr Jacmon. What occurred was the inevitable consequence of the applicant not giving evidence and relying on an expert’s report without calling the expert.
	
	
	On the facts of this case, even if Dr Jacmon had been called, it is difficult to see how that could have altered the result. All that Dr Jacmon could say under cross-examination was that his opinion was based on the history which he was given and that if that history were found to be incorrect, that would substantially invalidate his conclusions. The Beck Depression Inventory test would not have any effect on that result since that was a test which depended for its usefulness on the accuracy/honesty of the person answering the questions.
	
	
	The cases upon which the applicant relied do not assist him. They deal with very different factual situations.
	
	
	In Devaney v R there were reports from three psychiatrists before the sentencing judge to the effect that at the time of committing the offence, the applicant was in a state of psychosis. The cause of that psychosis was later diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia. The sentencing judge inclined to the view that the applicant was attempting to manipulate the psychiatrists while avoiding full confrontation with his violent history and attitudes towards his ex-girlfriend (the victim). The sentencing judge therefore substantially discounted the opinions of the three psychiatrists. Most particularly, there was no challenge to the factual basis upon which the psychiatrists reached their conclusions.
	
	
	It is not without significance that in Devaney the court was considering the reports of three psychiatrists, i.e. medical practitioners, and not reports of psychologists. As Allsop P pointed out, it was part of the professional skill of a psychiatrist to assess a history and to determine how it accorded with the hypothesised and formed views of the professional. In this case it was a psychologist taking the history, most of which was demonstrably false.
	
	
	In Cherdchoochatri v R the applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. In that evidence the applicant raised for the first time, as an explanation for his conduct, the issue of duress. The applicant was not cross-examined by the Crown to suggest that what he said concerning duress was untrue or incorrect. In those circumstances, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that his Honour should have given some indication that he proposed to disbelieve the applicant so as to enable his counsel to make appropriate submissions. That factual circumstance is very different to this case.
	
	
	In the course of giving her reasons in Cherdchoochatri v R Simpson J adverted to the tension which can arise between a judge’s prerogative to reject evidence, even if there is no evidence to the contrary, and circumstances where a miscarriage of justice can arise.
	
	
	Her Honour said:
	


“47   The present issue is whether, in the absence of notice given by the Crown to the applicant that his evidence was in contest, the judge was entitled to take that course.

48   Counsel for the applicant relied upon two paragraphs from the decision of this Court in O'Neil-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42 (per Basten JA). Those paragraphs are in the following terms:

""26    Statements of general principle must be understood in their context. Nothing in the statement set out above from Chow [see below] should be understood as inconsistent with the obligation of the sentencing judge to impose the appropriate sentence, based on the evidence properly before the court. As explained by Howie J in Palu [see below], the factual basis should be identified with particularity and disputed facts resolved by the accusatorial process upon the evidence before the court. Where the evidence was not challenged or disputed by the prosecution, and was not inherently implausible, his Honour was not entitled to reject it or fail to act on it, or at least was not entitled to do so without proper notice to the applicant that he intended to take that course.

27    It is a basic rule of procedural fairness that a party who does not accept the evidence of a witness should put the alternative view in cross-examination, both so that the witness may respond and so that the court has the benefit of assessing the response ... Where there has been no cross-examination of witnesses to contest their evidence 'judges should in general abstain from making adverse findings about parties and witnesses'.

49   The ""statements of general principle"" to which Basten JA referred appear in paras [23] and [24], preceding the paragraphs relied on on behalf of the applicant. The first is drawn from Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593, in which Kirby P set out principles governing the functions of prosecutors and judges involved in sentencing proceedings. The fifth principle is in the following terms:

""The foregoing rules do not oblige a sentencing judge passively, and unquestioningly, to accept facts as the basis for sentencing which are presented by the prosecution and/or the accused. The judge's sentencing discretion is to be exercised in the public interest. Even where the prosecution and the accused are agreed, they cannot fetter the judge's performance of the judicial function by their plea bargaining: see Malvaso v The Queen ... [[1989] HCA 58; [1989] HCA 58; 168 CLR 227]""

50   The second ""statement of general principle"" was drawn from the decision of this Court in R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174, and is in the following terms:

""21    It behoves the parties, especially after a 'plea bargain', to ensure that the sentencing court is made aware from the outset of the proceedings whether there is any dispute as to the factual basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced and identify with particularity what matters are in issue. Disputed facts are to be resolved by accusatorial process upon evidence before the court: Chow ... at 604-608 ...""

51   It is worth also noting a brief passage from the judgment of Johnson J in O'Neil-Shaw. His Honour said:

""50    Where affidavits are read without objection in civil proceedings, with deponents not being required for cross-examination, the rule is that such evidence should be accepted unless there is a credible body of evidence of a substantial character in direct contradiction of the non cross-examined evidence ..."" (citations omitted)

It may be that his Honour regarded that principle as also applicable in criminal proceedings. If that is so, I would venture to suggest that the principle is stated too broadly. Criminal proceedings, including (and possibly especially) sentencing proceedings, are more than inter partes litigation. A sentencing judge must have regard not only to the often competing positions of the Crown and the person the subject of the proceedings, but also to the public interest in criminal justice. That interest extends to the imposition of a sentence correctly within the appropriate range. That, in turn, extends to a proper and critical examination of all material put before the sentencing judge. A judge is not bound ""passively and unquestioningly"" to accept an account, apparently mitigatory, of an offender's motivation for becoming involved in an offence.

52   The various passages cited above expose two principles that are not necessarily easy to reconcile. On the one hand, as was noted in Chow, a sentencing judge is not obliged to accept ""passively and unquestioningly"" evidence presented by either party. On the other hand, as was pointed out by Basten JA and Johnson J in O'Neil-Shaw, the normal processes in the adversarial system require that the opposing party identify any challenge to factual material placed before the court. If no such challenge is identified, it is not unreasonable to assume that the evidence is not disputed. Where that is the case, it might also reasonably be expected that the sentencing judge would accept the evidence, at least in the absence of some signal that that might not be the case. Such a signal would give the party an opportunity to attempt to marshall additional evidence or argument. Basten JA explicitly recognised this in the last part of para [26] in O'Neil-Shaw.”


	
	In this case the disputed facts were resolved by the accusatorial process upon the evidence before the court. The applicant’s legal advisers were aware of the contest and participated in it. The facts in dispute were resolved in a way adverse to the applicant. Since the opinion of Dr Jacmon was predicated on a resolution of the facts favourable to the applicant, the rejection of the applicant’s position substantially undermined that opinion. That made the findings by the sentencing judge almost inevitable. The process which took place did not involve any denial of procedural fairness.
	
	
	The above is sufficient to dispose of the matter. For the guidance of lower courts, however, I wish to say something further. Although this issue is not relevant to the outcome of the appeal in that no submissions were made to the sentencing judge in relation to it, it does directly arise from the evidence which was before his Honour.
	
	
	It is trite to note that the Evidence Act 1995 does not apply in sentencing proceedings unless a direction is given to that effect, and that there is a degree of flexibility in sentencing proceedings as to the manner in which evidence may be given. Nevertheless, the rules of evidence as set out in the Act and at common law, embody principles of fairness which have been worked out by the courts over many years. An important part of that body of rules are those relating to opinion evidence.
	
	
	To be admissible under s 79(1) of the Evidence Act the evidence that is tendered must satisfy two criteria:
	



	
	The witness who gives the evidence must have “specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience”.
	
	
	The opinion expressed in evidence by the witness “is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge”.
	



	
	In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said in relation to s 79:
	


“37   It should be unnecessary, but it is nonetheless important, to emphasise that what was said by Gleeson CJ in HG (and later by Heydon JA in the Court of Appeal in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles) is to be read with one basic proposition at the forefront of consideration. The admissibility of opinion evidence is to be determined by application of the requirements of the Evidence Act rather than by any attempt to parse and analyse particular statements in decided cases divorced from the context in which those statements were made. Accepting that to be so, it remains useful to record that it is ordinarily the case, as Heydon JA said in Makita, that ""the expert's evidence must explain how the field of 'specialised knowledge' in which the witness is expert by reason of 'training, study or experience', and on which the opinion is 'wholly or substantially based', applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded"". The way in which s 79(1) is drafted necessarily makes the description of these requirements very long. But that is not to say that the requirements cannot be met in many, perhaps most, cases very quickly and easily. That a specialist medical practitioner expressing a diagnostic opinion in his or her relevant field of specialisation is applying ""specialised knowledge"" based on his or her ""training, study or experience"", being an opinion ""wholly or substantially based"" on that ""specialised knowledge"", will require little explicit articulation or amplification once the witness has described his or her qualifications and experience, and has identified the subject matter about which the opinion is proffered.”


	
	Dr Jacmon was not a medical practitioner and was not medically trained. His curriculum vitae showed that he had a Doctorate in Education, which included research into the treatment of depression. He had a Masters degree in Education, which included a psychological element, i.e. research into reinforcement theory. He had a Bachelor of Science, which included psychology as part of the course. His work history and published research showed that he had considerable experience and expertise in the treatment of depression and other psychological ailments. Even with such qualifications, it is difficult to see how his expression of opinion in paragraph 1 under the heading “Conclusions” could be said to be based on his specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience (at [42] hereof).
	
	
	The first part of the conclusion, i.e. that the applicant’s “functioning was impaired by a major depressive disorder at clinically significant levels”, was a conclusion available to Dr Jacmon based on the BDI test results. The history taken by Dr Jacmon could also inform that conclusion. Where I have difficulty is in understanding how Dr Jacmon could reach the next conclusion, i.e. “the impairment is likely to have resulted from the breakup with his long term girlfriend in Hong Kong”. That is a medical diagnosis for which I can find no basis in the specialised knowledge or training available to Dr Jacmon.
	
	
	Similarly, the following conclusions also appear to be beyond the expertise of Dr Jacmon:
	


“3   … Symptoms of depression particularly confused thought and impaired decision-making coupled with the sadness emanating from the ended relationship are likely to have been prominent triggers to the incident. These symptoms would have militated against his capacity to ensure that he kept away from any illegal activity and not give his absolute trust to his friend's initial assurance that the goods to be imported did not involve the commission of a serious offence.

4   Mr Lam's actions which led to offending indicated markedly diminished capacity for judgment because there appeared to be little thought given to the consequences, the near certainty of detection and arrest and the need to curb impulsivity.”


	
	The situation is similar to that considered by this Court in WW v R [2012] NSWCCA 165 where the following was set out:
	


“55   The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in relation to his treatment of the ADHD condition when he said:

""Little information has been provided as to whether the offender continued to be affected by the said disorder at around the time of the offence"". (ROS 14.8)

56   The applicant submitted that there was no question that he was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of six, and that when tested in April 2011 it was ""highly probable that he continues to suffer from ADHD"". Mr Mahoney described some of the symptoms of ADHD which was ""characterised by the co-existence of attentional problems impulsivity and hyperactivity"". Having reviewed the applicant's medical history, Mr Mahoney expressed the opinion that it was likely that his ADHD affected him to some degree at the time of the offence, particularly around the area of inattention on the road. The applicant submitted that his Honour erred when he failed to take account of that opinion of Mr Mahoney.

57   The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to have any regard to the opinion of Mr Mahoney that ""individuals with ADHD may have particular difficulty in conforming to the expectations of this environment such as attending to instructions on taking on tasks that require extended periods of attention"". The applicant submitted that his Honour should have taken that opinion into account on the question of whether his experience of imprisonment would be more difficult than that of the general prison population. The applicant submitted that this was an important principle to be taken into account on sentencing. Its importance had been recently affirmed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

58   His Honour was entitled to treat the evidence of Mr Mahoney in the way in which he did. On that issue, the cautionary observation of Johnson J in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No 36) [2008] NSWSC 626 is pertinent. There his Honour said:

""164   A number of psychologists gave oral evidence. In approaching their evidence, I keep in mind that it is important that psychologists do not cross the barrier of their expertise. It is appropriate for persons trained in the field of psychology to give evidence of the results of psychometric and other psychological testing, and to explain the relevance of those results, and their significance so far as they reveal or support the existence of brain damage or other recognised mental states or disorders. It is not, however, appropriate for them to enter into the field of psychiatry: R v Peisley (1990) 54 A Crim R 42 at 52.""

59   An analysis of the report of Mr Mahoney indicates that he did cross that line. Having reviewed the applicant's medical history, Mr Mahoney said:

""In relation to the offending behaviour, it is extremely difficult to determine to what extent Mr W's ADHD may have caused or contributed to either his inattention at the time of the accident or his leaving the scene of the accident. In part this is also due to the fact that Mr W has significant difficulty remembering details of the accident due to his own trauma around the event. What is clear is that he was not receiving treatment (medication) at the time of the offending behaviour. It is also clear that throughout his life (including at the time of the offences) he has had general problems with inattention and impulsivity. Therefore it is likely that Mr W's ADHD condition affected him to some degree at the time of the offence, particularly around the area of inattention on the road. There is little evidence to suggest he would have intended to have caused harm to the victim. It is highly probable that his impulsiveness (also a factor in ADHD) contributed to his rash decision of leaving the scene of the accident immediately after it occurred.

With regard to commenting on the impact of a custodial sentence on Mr W given his history of ADHD, there is some research about the vulnerabilities of people with ADHD in the prison system. In detention, individuals with ADHD may have particular difficulty in conforming to the expectations of this environment, such as attending to instructions or taking on tasks that require extended periods of attention. People with ADHD symptoms who are incarcerated have been found to be more disruptive (verbal aggression, damage to property) than a non-ADHD control group.""

Of significance is a further observation by Mr Mahoney that despite his ADHD ""he does not suffer from a serious mental illness"".

60   It was open to Mr Mahoney to test the applicant for indications that at the time of testing he was suffering from ADHD. He could describe the characteristics of the condition of ADHD. What he could not do as a psychologist was to express an opinion as to whether and to what extent the ADHD condition affected the applicant at the time of the offence. Counsel for the applicant, in the sentencing proceedings, could make a submission to his Honour linking the test results and the characteristics which can be experienced by somebody with ADHD. His Honour could accept that submission but was not obliged to do so.”


	
	As already indicated, in this case there was another basis by which his Honour could reject the opinion of Dr Jacmon, i.e. that the factual basis upon which the opinion was based was not made out. Even if that had not been so, for the reasons set out above a real question would have remained as to the weight to be given to the conclusions of Dr Jacmon to which I have referred. Normally such objections would go to the admissibility of those parts of the report but since the report was admitted without objection, the weight to be given to those conclusions become an issue.
	
	
	As was stated in WW v R at [60] in certain circumstances a sentencing judge could give some weight to those conclusions but was not obliged to do so.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: Subject to what follows I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	The applicant's complaint is that he was denied procedural fairness because the sentencing judge rejected the opinions of his psychologist without either the Crown or His Honour putting him on notice of the possibility that they may not be accepted. Whether a denial of procedural fairness occurs in circumstances where a sentencing judge rejects evidence put forward on behalf of an offender during a sentencing hearing, without its possible rejection being expressly foreshadowed, is a matter of fact and degree. In some cases it has been held that if the rejected evidence is unchallenged evidence from the offender or lay witnesses then a breach has been made out (O'Neil-Shaw v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 42; Cherdchoochatri v R [2013] NSWCCA 118; 277 FLR 126).
	
	
	The position is less clear with expert opinions that are at least partly informed by a disputed history given by an offender. In Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 (Devaney) Allsop P held that the sentencing judge was not entitled to reject the unanimous opinion of three psychiatrists, who found that an offender was suffering from a psychotic illness which directly contributed to the commission of an offence, because of a conclusion that the offender was attempting to manipulate them (at [87] to [89]). This was, in part, because His Honour found that ""part of the professional skill of the psychiatrist is the assessment of [a patient's history]"" and thus ""[t]o say that the applicant was manipulating the psychiatrists is to criticise the professional opinions of the psychiatrists and should be put to them"" (at [88]).
	
	
	In my view the guiding principle is whether the course of the proceeding was such that it should have alerted the offender to at least the possibility that a rejection of his history as recounted to the psychologist would result in a rejection of that psychologist's opinion, that is whether a dispute over that history meant that a rejection of the opinion was reasonably perceived as being ""in the ring"": Victims Compensation Fund Corporation v Nguyen [2001] NSWCA 264; 52 NSWLR 213 at [44] per Mason P). This will depend upon a number of matters including the extent of the dispute over the history, the nature of the expertise and the terms of the opinion. Taking the facts of Devaney, a dispute over an offender's history would not necessarily alert the parties to the possibility that the unanimous opinion of three psychiatrists concerning his suffering from psychotic illness was in issue.
	
	
	In this case, Dr Jacmon was a psychologist. He was not a medical practitioner. As Hoeben CJ at CL has explained, in terms of a diagnosis of various mental illnesses and their effect upon an offender's ""capacity for judgment"" they stand in a different position to psychiatrists. The relevant parts of Dr Jacmon's report are set out in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [42] to [43]. A review of Dr Jacmon's conclusions as set out in [42] clearly suggests that the opinions in [3] and [4] of the conclusion section were based substantially on the history provided to him and not just the fact that the applicant had broken up with his girlfriend. The opinions he expressed in [5] of his conclusion concerning remorse were simply a restatement of what the applicant told him. In my view the nature of Dr Jacmon's opinions and the terms of his report were such that it should have been apparent that a rejection of the offender's version of events as recounted in that report meant that it was at least reasonably possible, even likely, that any relevant opinion he expressed would also be rejected.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

2766925,Salafia v R [2015] NSWCCA 141,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with Wilson J and the orders proposed by her Honour.
	
	
	WILSON J: On 21 February 2014 at the Sydney District Court her Honour Judge Huggett sentenced the applicant on one count of Manufacture a Prohibited Drug contrary to s24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Act”). The drug was methylamphetamine in an amount of 31.6 grams which had been manufactured on 27 July 2011 at Putty, as part of a joint criminal enterprise between the applicant and a number of others, Rocco and Stefano Romeo, Ross Lentini, Kevin Sheldon, William Finau, Adam Peters-Fyfe and Jamin Talia.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months, to date from 21 February 2014, the date on which the sentence was imposed.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence under s24(1) of the Act is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. There is no standard non-parole period attaching to such an offence.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence advancing three grounds:
	



	
	Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in the way she dealt with the pre-sentence custody.
	
	
	Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in her consideration of the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	Ground 3: The sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


The proceedings in the District Court


	
	The applicant was jointly arraigned with his co-accused on 27 August 2013, and entered a plea of guilty. The plea was entered after extensive negotiations between the Crown and the applicant, and several days after the date on which the applicant’s trial was due to commence.
	
	
	The sentencing judge awarded a 10% discount in recognition of the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	The sentence proceedings with respect to the applicant were heard over two separate days before he was ultimately sentenced on 21 February 2014, together with two of his co-offenders, Stefano and Rocco Romeo.
	
	
	The applicant was on bail at the time of the sentence proceedings, having spent 19 days in pre-sentence custody prior to entering bail.
	


The facts of the offence


	
	A statement of facts, signed by all of those co-offenders who had entered a plea of guilty, was tendered in the Crown case on sentence. Although the statement was termed an “agreed” statement of facts, and bore the applicant’s signature, there were in fact discrete passages of the document with which the applicant (alone of the offenders) took issue. Her Honour was accordingly required to resolve that dispute. In large part, the dispute fell away after the applicant gave evidence before her Honour. Nothing turns on the factual dispute for present purposes, since there is no complaint as to any of her Honour’s conclusions in that regard.
	
	
	The facts set out below have been taken from the outline of the facts as they were found to be by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Between May and August 2011 the applicant became the focus of a police investigation involving both electronic and physical surveillance, which exposed a joint criminal enterprise between the applicant and a number of others to manufacture methylamphetamine. The manufacturing process was undertaken at a rural property belonging to, Stefano Romeo, at Putty, near Singleton, in New South Wales.
	
	
	The applicant was responsible, in early May 2011, for obtaining a sample of pseudoephedrine that he provided to Ross Lentini for testing. The plan was to manufacture methylamphetamine via a process utilising liquid pseudoephedrine. There followed a number of telephone conversations over ensuing days, and the eventual testing of the sample by, Peters-Fyfe. Lentini subsequently informed the applicant that the sample was “hundred per cent ridge didge”. (This was not actually correct; the sample was of poor quality.) Having been informed of the test results, the applicant made arrangements with one of his associates to “bring that thing” [pseudoephedrine] the following day, on 1 June 2011.
	
	
	A meeting took place between the applicant and a number of others at two locations in western Sydney, in furtherance of the agreement to manufacture methylamphetamine.
	
	
	After the meeting, the applicant contacted another one of his associates, Ned Whelan, and asked Whelan to set up a meeting with the “big fella” in Canberra. They discussed the prospect of the applicant leaving his car and a motor bike as a security in exchange for obtaining “them” to do a “twenty of them.” The applicant and Whelan met at Gundagai on 2 June 2011.
	
	
	On 3 June 2011, in a number of intercepted conversations, the applicant and Lentini discussed laying five metres of tiles and tilers wanting to start the job “up there” the following day. The applicant expressed reservations as to whether he would make it back from Canberra in time. However, he contacted Whelan and asked him to “just grab the five” as he would come the following day to collect it.
	
	
	There is no dispute that these conversations related to the manufacture of methylamphetamine, and the terms “five” and “twenty” referred to amounts. In evidence on sentence proceedings the applicant agreed he obtained pseudoephedrine through Whelan, and discussed the manufacturing process with Lentini, who knew the people who could conduct the “cook”.
	
	
	The applicant acknowledged in his evidence that, subsequent to this discussion with Whelan on 3 June 2011, he endeavoured to obtain $20,000 to purchase more pseudoephedrine to provide to Lentini. He was unsuccessful.
	
	
	The applicant was observed in the company of some of his associates on 7 and 8 June 2011. On 7 June 2011 the applicant travelled to Wagga Wagga where the conversations about obtaining the necessary $20,000 continued. By the end of the following day, 8 June 2011, the applicant had obtained a quantity of pseudoephedrine, in an amount not established by the evidence.
	
	
	A number of telephone calls were made in the days following between the applicant, Lentini and Stefano Romeo, discussing future plans, with the applicant and Lentini ultimately meeting on 15 June 2011. The applicant provided the liquid pseudoephedrine to Lentini that day.
	
	
	The two subsequently met with other of the co-offenders, Lentini, Stefano and Rocco Romeo, Talia and Peters-Fyfe, with one of the group making a purchase from a hardware store before the discussions continued.
	
	
	The following days were marked by telephone conversations between various of the offenders, in which arrangements for the manufacture of methylamphetamine, including the purchase of necessary equipment was discussed.
	
	
	On 21 June 2011 Lentini told the applicant that everything was fine but that he did not think “it” would be ready by the following day.
	
	
	That asserted optimism was not borne out since, by 29 June 2011, conversations between the applicant and the other offenders centred on the lack of progress. Lentini informed Stefano Romeo that the applicant was concerned about the delay, since he had lost his car, and the person who had provided the precursor wanted it back.
	
	
	At a meeting between Stefano Romeo, Lentini, Talia and the applicant on 1 July 2011, Stefano Romeo told the others that the manufacture was “harder than what they thought.” Further meetings followed between various parties, discussing the lack of progress and anticipated payments.
	
	
	Lentini and the applicant met a number of times on 6 July 2011.
	
	
	On 9 July 2011, the applicant informed Lentini that the deadline was 13 July and that he wanted his money or there would be trouble. He said he could not continue to lie to the people who had provided the pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	The following day Lentini told Stefano Romeo to find the money to pay the applicant. On 11 July 2011 Lentini told the applicant that he had delivered the “mixer” to Stefano Romeo, but the applicant continued to express considerable frustration at the delay [in the manufacture], saying that he would ""splatter"" Stefano Romeo ""all over the car park"". Later the same day Stefano Romeo conveyed the deadline to Talia.
	
	
	On 13 July 2011 in conversation with Lentini, the applicant queried whether the other parties were “fair dinkum”. He was assured that they were, and was invited to come to Sydney and speak to Talia. The applicant asked for a loan, saying that he was broke, because he had “put everything into this.” On 16 July the applicant told Lentini that he had spoken to “them” – the suppliers of the pseudoephedrine – and reassured them that he had been truthful about the manufacturing process. He said that his car had been returned, but that his “Harley” had been taken.
	
	
	Contact and discussions about progress and when the ""tilers"" would be ready continued between the offenders. On 18 July 2011 Lentini told the applicant that he wanted someone to be present to watch over the manufacture on his behalf. The applicant contacted one of his associates and told him he would have to ""go out to Ross""' [the site] for the day. However the plans were further delayed due to some “outstanding things"".
	
	
	The following day, Lentini met with the other co-offenders at Campbelltown. After this meeting he spoke with the applicant. Lentini confirmed that the preparations were being made. The applicant said he wanted to get ""money back in the bank"" and urged Lentini ""just tell him before you do the second stage bro you want a bit of fuckin' gold stuff'.”
	
	
	By 22 July 2011 the manufacturing of the drug had still not commenced. There were further discussions between the group about the ""materials"" and ""wall glue"" not arriving at the “tile shop”. There were also difficulties with access to the site due to rain, which meant that a four wheel drive was required. Stefano Romeo spoke with Talia that day and discussed how to collect the “material” and commence some preparatory work. Romeo told Talia that the ""builder” [the applicant] was ""spewing"" at the ""tradesman"" [Lentini].
	
	
	That same day the applicant informed Lentini that his mates in Wagga '""want to know how long we reckon?"". On 24 July 2011, having been informed that “all is under control and not to worry”, the applicant expressed his frustration over the lack of notice from the Romeos, stating that he had told them that they would have to wait until he had organised his materials.
	
	
	The following day, 25 July 2011, [1]  the applicant spoke to his brother and said that he had ""just rung the lads"" and told them ""if it’s not done by tomorrow, youse can get fucked I'm coming down to kill ya"". Some detailed conversations took place between Lentini and Stefano Romeo about travelling to the site and commencing the manufacture that day. Later in the day Lentini told the applicant that Stefano and Rocco Romeo had left to go to the site.
	
	
	The site referred to was a rural property located in a valley surrounded by steep hills and dense foliage. The only structure at the property had a tin roof but no proper door. There was a garage with a roller door beside the structure. There was no mobile telephone coverage or electricity. Access was via an unsealed road.
	
	
	Police entered the site on the evening of 25 July 2011, at a time when none of the offenders were present.
	
	
	By 26 July 2011, the “outstanding item” was obtained and transported to the site. At 11.15am Rocco Romeo drove to the site bringing a 44 litre drum. He was joined by Stefano Romeo, Talia, Peters-Fyfe, and later Finau and Sheldon. Neither the applicant nor Lentini attended the site on this day.
	
	
	Police commenced surveillance at 12.30pm and observed the offenders busy at work. This extensive activity produced solid pseudoephedrine from the liquid form. That evening, Stefano Romeo sent a text message to Lentini referring to the applicant, which read ""I feel very sorry for Mick”. The sentencing judge found that this message arose from Stefano Romeo’s awareness of the likely failure of the operation, due to the low quality of the liquid pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	On 27 July 2011, Talia, Finau and Sheldon were involved in manufacturing methylamphetamine from the pseudoephedrine obtained the previous day. Stefano Romeo sent a message to Lentini saying “I wouldn’t even worry about it. Poor Mick got ripped bad” [a reference to the poor quality precursor obtained by the applicant]. Around the same time Rocco Romeo told Lentini to arrange for the applicant to come and see them. The applicant called Stefano Romeo but told him he couldn't meet up for personal reasons. Romeo said ""I feel very sorry for you. I feel very sorry, that's all I've got to say. All right?"" This too appears to have related to the likely failure of the manufacturing undertaking.
	
	
	The applicant spoke to Lentini and said that he believed that Stefano and Rocco Romeo had lied about the results of the manufacture. He said that he needed to go and speak to them stating ""we have to do this together"" and ""whatever happens...I got other things for you and me man ...whatever I do I'll fuckin include you"". There were further discussions between Lentini and the applicant concerning whether the applicant was being given accurate information about what had really occurred in relation to the manufacture. The applicant said he was not getting stuck with ""this bill on me own"" and was not leaving Sydney “without something in my hands.” Lentini asked the applicant what he was going to do with “the rest of the materials”, to which the applicant replied “I can get rid of that.”
	
	
	The applicant spoke to Stefano Romeo shortly after, challenging him as to who was lying to him and why. Romeo explained there were problems with the quality of the materials, specifically, the purity of the pseudoephedrine that had been provided by the applicant. It was decided that they would attempt to manufacture as much methylamphetamine as was possible from the available material, rather than to aim for a specific amount. Stefano Romeo explained that the “tiles”, that is, pseudoephedrine, was not 75% pure but only 12 or 15%. Nonetheless, he assured the applicant, “we're still going to help you ... we'll do what we can"".
	
	
	Police arrested Finau, Sheldon, Rocco and Stefano Romeo later that day. Lentini and the applicant were arrested on 28 July 2011.
	
	
	The applicant declined to be interviewed. Talia was arrested on 4 August 2011. Having affected the first arrests, police entered and searched the site. They located items related to the manufacture of methylamphetamine including laboratory glassware, chemicals, an ice making machine, a generator, heating apparatus, jars, containers, respirators, gloves, and a condenser.
	
	
	A forensic chemist, Mr John Hugel, inspected the site, the equipment, and the materials located at the scene. His report of 24 February 2012 was tendered without objection during the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Hugel opined that methylamphetamine had been manufactured at the site using a method involving the synthesis of pseudoephedrine, hydrophosphorous acid, iodine, and reflux apparatus. Waste product containing low concentrations of methylamphetamine, consistent with the manufacture process, was detected in various substances at the site.
	
	
	Manufactured methylamphetamine was found in four items, in each case in a liquid form. The combined weight of the liquid containing methylamphetamine was 1409.29 grams with an estimated purity of between 1.7% and 3.5%. The combined weight of pure methylamphetamine was 31.6 grams. The approximate wholesale value of 31.6 grams in July 2011 was $7,550.
	
	
	Police located a number of precursors including caustic soda and hydrochloric acid. Also located at the site were containers with 2,590 grams of iodine and 884 grams of hydrophosphorous acid, chemicals which in combination with pseudoephedrine are used to manufacture methylamphetamine. The amount of methylamphetamine that could theoretically be derived from these chemicals was calculated in Mr Hugel’s report, and referred to by her Honour in her remarks on sentence.
	


The applicant’s evidence


	
	The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge, who ultimately found him to be “evasive, vague and not convincing in aspects of his evidence.”
	
	
	He asserted that he became involved in the enterprise to manufacture methylamphetamine to recover a debt of $5,000 that Whelan owed him. He claimed that, in lieu of payment of the debt, Whelan had suggested that, if the applicant contributed a further $5,000, he could obtain a litre of pseudoephedrine at a cost of $10,000. Whelan told the applicant that, in addition to cancelling his debt, the applicant could also “make some money back”.
	
	
	The applicant said that he made some inquiries to find a person to manufacture the methylamphetamine, and approached Lentini, a childhood friend. Lentini informed him that he might know of someone, and, in the applicant’s words ""we just went on from there"".
	
	
	The applicant stated he first obtained a 100ml sample and asked Lentini to have it tested before he committed to purchasing the full amount. Having been informed the sample was good, the applicant proceeded with the purchase of the litre of pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	The applicant attempted, unsuccessfully, to raise $20,000 to obtain more pseudoephedrine once more was requested by Lentini. He claimed he only attempted to obtain two extra litres, denying a suggestion he was trying to acquire five litres at a cost of $4,000 per litre. As he was unsuccessful in raising the funds, he discussed offering a car and motorbike as security, but claimed that was just brainstorming as he had no such vehicles to offer, and the supplier was not interested in any event. The Crown ultimately accepted that the applicant was unsuccessful in obtaining these additional funds.
	
	
	The applicant acknowledged that he had become very angry about the lack of progress, the inconsistent information he was receiving, and the delay in getting his money back. He claimed that he ""didn't think about the consequences"" of becoming involved with drug manufacture and was thinking that he would ""probably get back 10 grand and double my money and walk away ...or get my money back for starters"".
	
	
	In cross examination the applicant agreed that he had some $7,000 in savings at the time and was not in dire need of money with an urgent requirement that he recover the outstanding debt. He acknowledged that his motivation went beyond obtaining payment of the debt owed to him, and extended to obtaining a financial benefit.
	


Applicant’s subjective case


	
	A pre-sentence report was tendered on sentence, supplemented by the applicant’s oral evidence.
	
	
	Born in 1974 to an Italian father and an Aboriginal mother the applicant was 39 at the time of the sentence proceedings. He had had an impressive football career from the age of 15. He has one child from a previous relationship and two children to his current partner who remains supportive of him. He had a good working history and was employed at the time of the offence in an abalone business. He had moved his family back to his home town to ensure a better quality of life in a small, drug-free community.
	
	
	The applicant had only one matter on his criminal record, being an ex parte conviction for affray for which he was fined $800, a record which her Honour found did not disentitle him to leniency.
	
	
	There was nothing before the Court to suggest any mental illness or cognitive impairment. There was no evidence of drug use or addiction.
	
	
	Her Honour found some evidence of remorse, but, noting the applicant’s initial tendency to justify and minimize his involvement in the offence, found it was in part directed to his own legal predicament rather than to his offending behavior and its possible consequences. Nevertheless, her Honour found the applicant has “reasonable to good” prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Grounds of appeal

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in the way in which she dealt with the pre-sentence custody


	
	Following his arrest on 28 July 2011 the applicant was remanded in custody until bail was granted to him on 16 August 2011. He entered bail that day. This represented a period of nineteen days pre-sentence custody referable solely to this matter.
	
	
	As noted above, when sentence was imposed upon the applicant on 21 February 2014, her Honour directed that it commence that day. She did not back-date it by nineteen days.
	
	
	The applicant complains that in doing so her Honour either, failed to take into account the nineteen days of pre-sentence custody he had served; or, if she did, she failed to provide reasons for not back-dating the sentence.
	
	
	Section 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires a court to take into account “any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence”. Section 47(2)(a) of the same Act provides that a court may direct that a sentence commence “on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed”, and s 47(3) requires that a court take into account the time an offender is held in custody when deciding the date on which sentence is to commence.
	
	
	Whilst there is no absolute rule as to how such pre-sentence custody is to be taken into account by a sentencing court, backdating the commencement of a sentence to directly reflect the period of pre-sentence custody is the usual course adopted. This approach has generally been held by this Court to be preferred, since it readily demonstrates that the sentencing court has given an offender credit for time served.
	
	
	In Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30 Howie J said (at [3]),
	


“This Court has repeatedly stated that the preferable course to adopt, where an offender has served a period of pre-sentence custody, is to backdate the sentence imposed by a period equivalent to the pre-sentence custody. In R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245, Giles JA stated (my underlining):

This Court has on a number of occasions said that it is desirable that a sentencing judge back-date a sentence to take into account pre-sentence custody. It is not necessary to go further back than R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588 and what may be regarded as the definitive decision in R v Deeble (19 September 1991, unreported), in which the reasons for the practice are outlined: they need not be repeated here. Subsequent cases included R v Reid (26 March 1997, unreported) and R v Foster (30 October 1996, unreported). The desirability is put not as something which is mandatory, but as a rule of practice of importance, and in my view the importance should be emphasised once again. If a sentence is not back-dated to take into account pre-sentence custody the reason or reasons for not doing so should be clearly stated.” (emphasis in Wiggins)


	
	Backdating a sentence in this way avoids the possibility of an offender feeling that he or she has been unjustly dealt with on sentence by a perceived failure to reflect pre-sentence custody: Wiggins, at [2], per McClellan CJ at CL. It is, as was noted in Wiggins (at [8]), “simple, transparent, and does not result in an apparently lesser sentence being imposed than was actually served by the offender”.
	
	
	Whilst the latter benefit is more apparent when an offender has served a lengthy period in custody on remand, there is much to be said for the regularisation of the use of backdated sentences in most cases where there has been pre-sentence custody.
	
	
	In imposing sentence on the offender, her Honour specifically referred to the period of nineteen days pre-sentence custody that the applicant had served.
	


“Taking into account your plea of guilty and the 19 days served in custody to date, I impose a sentence of three years six months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years two months to date from 21 February 2014 and to expire on 20 April 2016 […]”


	
	As can be seen, the reference to the period of pre-sentence custody prefaced both the term of imprisonment imposed and its commencement date. Although the manner in which her Honour took the nineteen days into account is not made explicit in that reference, it is clear that her Honour did not overlook the period of nineteen days, or otherwise omit to take it into account as required by s.24.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant submits that it is open to conclude that her Honour in fact overlooked the period of pre-sentence custody, I would not draw that conclusion. That is particularly so in circumstances where her Honour stated clearly that she had taken it into account. For my part, I would not do other than take her Honour at her word.
	
	
	Although the applicant contends that the expression of the sentence “in round terms” suggests that the sentencing judge did not give him credit for nineteen days served, that contention assumes that the pre-sentence custody could only have been taken into account as a direct deduction from the sentence that would otherwise be imposed. That is, because the sentence ultimately imposed was not expressed as including a number of days, her Honour must have failed to take the nineteen day period properly into account.
	
	
	Whilst the process of sentencing an offender should not be permitted to be reduced to an analysis of calculus, as is suggested by the applicant’s approach, looking at the sentence in just that way can readily demonstrate one process by which it is likely that her Honour took pre-sentence custody into account.
	
	
	The sentence her Honour imposed incorporated a discount of 10% to reflect the plea. The starting point for the sentence of 3 years and 6 months, prior to the application of the discount, would have been 3 years, 10 months and 21 days imprisonment. It is very unlikely that a sentence of a term incorporating days could in fact have been the starting point.
	
	
	Although in the absence of specific reasons for not back-dating the sentence it cannot be certain, it is more likely that the starting point for the sentence was one of 4 years. If one subtracts 19 days from that starting point, then applies the 10% discount, then rounds the sentence down, the sentence reached is 3 years and 6 months. The (rounded down) sentence is the same if the discount of 10% is applied to the starting point, and the nineteen days is deducted thereafter.
	
	
	In undertaking that exercise, I do not mean to endorse a process of calculation as underpinning the sentencing exercise. Too frequently are such arguments advanced by appellants and complaints of that nature should not, in my view, be entertained without some specific error of the type referred to in House v The King [1936] 55 CLR 499 at [505] having been identified.
	
	
	The process of sentencing an offender is, as has been repeatedly stressed, an intuitive one. Sentencing cannot be a purely logical exercise of adding or subtracting from a penalty dependent upon the presence or absence of specific features: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68; Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476.
	
	
	Sentencing is very much a discretionary process. In Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600, it was noted (at [59] in the joint judgment of French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ),
	


“In Markarian Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ adopted the explanation of the sentencing discretion given by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Wong v The Queen that the description of the balance struck by a sentence as an ""instinctive synthesis"" is not used ""to cloak the task of the sentencer in some mystery, but to make plain that the sentencer is called on to reach a single sentence which, in the case of an offence like the one now under discussion, balances many different and conflicting features [footnotes omitted].”


	
	The applicant here contends that, even if her Honour did take into account the nineteen days of pre-sentence custody, she fell into error in failing to give reasons for not adopting the approach of backdating the sentence.
	
	
	Whilst that failure could perhaps be characterised as error, it cannot amount to error of the kind requiring this Court to intervene and re-sentence an appellant.
	
	
	Accepting that her Honour took the pre-sentence custody into account as she was required to by s.24 and as she said she did, failing to record reasons for not adopting the approach of backdating a sentence does not establish that she acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, mistook the facts, or did not take into account some material consideration.
	
	
	A failure to record reasons of that nature may lead to some lack of clarity, as Howie J (somewhat cholerically) commented in Wiggins at [7].
	


“Despite the repeated endorsement of this Court for the preferable course of backdating a sentence to reflect the period of pre-sentence custody, this is yet another case where the sentencing judge has not taken that course and yet given no reasons for not having done so. The result is an application for leave to appeal that could have been avoided by the simple expedient of commencing the sentences imposed upon the applicant six months earlier than the date of sentencing.”


	
	Similarly, had her Honour stated her reasons for not adopting the usual procedure of a backdated commencement date, the applicant could not have advanced the present ground 1. However, that oversight is not error in the House v The King sense.
	
	
	Oversight of that nature has not been treated as error requiring the intervention of the appellate Court in other cases where reasons were similarly not given by the sentencing judge for commencing a sentence at an earlier date: English [2000] NSWCCA 245 at [22] – [24]; R v Starmer [2008] NSWCCA 27 at [12]; and Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 at [32] – [34], for example.
	
	
	Despite the departure from the practice of stating reasons for not commencing the sentence at an earlier date, there is no occasion for interference with the sentence imposed by her Honour.
	
	
	Error has not been established.
	


Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in her consideration of the objective seriousness of the offending.


	
	In advancing this ground the applicant argues for three errors which he contends undermine the correctness of her Honour’s assessment of the objective gravity of the crime, namely:
	



	
	That her Honour erred in the assessment of the applicant’s role in the enterprise;
	
	
	That her Honour erred in the way she considered the amount and purity of the manufactured drug; and
	
	
	That her Honour placed too much emphasis on Mr Hugel’s opinion as to the theoretical amounts of methylamphetamine to be manufactured from some of the material located at the site.
	



	
	Complaints concerning error in the assessment of objective seriousness cannot be made good simply by pointing to some differing assessment that could arguably have been made. The question is whether or not the characterization of the gravity of the crime was open to the sentencing judge
	
	
	In Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35, this Court said at [33]:
	


“This Court has emphasised that characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]. This Court is slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion, and the question must be whether the particular characterisation was open: Mulato v R, at [37], [46]-[47].”


	
	A ground of appeal asserting error in the assessment of objective seriousness should be advanced only where specific error of the sort referred to in House v The King can be identified rather than, as seems to be commonly the case, a complaint routinely made. Assessment of gravity by a first instance judge is a process involving the application of principle to facts established by the evidence. It is a discretionary process that relies upon a judicial officer considering all relevant features, and making what in many regards is a value judgment. The conclusion reached is a discretionary one in a process where there is no definitively “correct” answer. Opinions can reasonably differ, but the availability of other differing assessments is not a basis upon which to discern error. There will be appealable error only where there has been a failure in the proper application of principle in making the assessment.
	
	
	The ubiquity of a ground of appeal such as this does not suggest that the breadth of the discretion is well understood or, if it is, that it is properly acknowledged.
	
	
	Since his complaint, reduced to essentials, concerns the weight that her Honour gave to different aspects of the assessment she made, the applicant’s task is no easy one. That is particularly so when regard is had to the care with which her Honour considered all relevant features of the offence when assessing its gravity.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the fact that he was not himself involved in the “cook” that resulted in the production of methylamphetamine, and that he suffered considerable financial loss through the failure of the process, a process over which he had no personal control. He argued that these features should have led to a conclusion that the applicant’s role was not as significant as the sentencing judge found it to be.
	
	
	The sentencing judge correctly noted that the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending conduct stands to be assessed by the quantity and the purity of the manufactured drug, the degree of sophistication and planning involved, the applicant’s individual role and involvement, as well as his intention and motivation for committing the offence.
	
	
	As for the applicant’s individual culpability in the context of the joint criminal enterprise, she noted that it was to be assessed by reference to his actual conduct and involvement within the enterprise. She concluded that his role had been a significant one.
	


“I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt his role was a vital and significant one and can be characterised as upper management. While I cannot be satisfied to the requisite standard that his role was higher than Lentini's role, I am satisfied his role was greater to varying degrees than those of the other persons arrested by the police.

Notwithstanding his absence from [the site] on 26 and 27 July 2011, I am satisfied that Salafia knew that the manufacture process was occurring and that others were being utilised in the actual labour process. Salafia provided the pseudoephedrine for the enterprise, albeit in an unqualified amount, and in doing so he intended it to be used to manufacture methylamphetamine as successfully as possible given the amount and quality of the agreed ingredients available and the skills of the actual cooks.

Salafia admitted in his evidence that he was motivated by making money by providing pseudoephedrine for use in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Salafia was of the understanding that the sample he had provided was both ""ridgy didge"" and ""very good"". After this he, Salafia, continued to participate in discussions with significant participants in the enterprise which I have no doubt related to the intended manufacture of methylamphetamine using pseudoephedrine that he had provided. At times Salafia expressed his frustration at the delays and the consequent effect they were having on him, for example at 17:58 on 29 June 2011 to Lentini. I have no doubt Salafia's continued participation in the enterprise was because having provided a further quantity of pseudoephedrine, in an amount which cannot be quantified, he was anticipating a financial gain.

I make these findings based individually and collectively on all of the material in the Agreed Facts as I have found them proved against Salafia including the following matters:

He provided a sample of pseudoephedrine in liquid form;

He represented to at least Simpson that the sample was ""100% all good"";

He participated in numerous meetings over several weeks directly related to the proposed manufacture of methylamphetamine using liquid pseudoephedrine;

He participated in numerous coded conversations over several weeks directly related to the proposed manufacture of methylamphetamine using liquid pseudoephedrine;

•    He obtained an unquantified amount of liquid pseudoephedrine which he delivered to Lentini knowing it was to be used to manufacture methylamphetamine;

•    He delivered a ""mixer"" to Stefano Romeo, that being an item required to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine;

•    He set deadlines regarding the timing for the proposed manufacture expressing frustration and concern at times over delays and its consequent effect upon him;

•    He requested a loan from Lentini stating he had put everything into the enterprise to manufacture;

•   He issued demands to Lentini for ""his money"" stating that otherwise there would be trouble;

•    He participated in communications on 27 July 2011 regarding the success or lack thereof of the manufacture and the fact that steps were being taken to see what might be able to be produced from the available pseudoephedrine.”


	
	None of her Honour’s findings of fact were challenged in oral submissions, nor was it argued that her conclusion that the applicant was “upper management” with Lentini was not open to her. Her Honour’s consideration of this aspect of the matter was careful and thorough, and she set out all relevant matters. No error has been demonstrated in his regard.
	
	
	With respect to the second point, the applicant sought to draw a distinction between pure methylamphetamine readily available to be further diluted or “cut”, and the situation in the present case where the drug was already diluted in another liquid, and the amount of pure drug was derived from a calculation of the percentage of the drug in the liquid.
	
	
	In her remarks her Honour carefully identified the form in which the prohibited drug was located by investigating police, as follows:
	


“(1) Item A03, a 600 millilitre plastic water bottle containing a quantity of cloudy liquid with a total weight of 2.29 grams, a purity of 1.7% methylamphetamine and a pure methylamphetamine weight of 0.0389 grams;

(2) Item A04, a 600 millilitre plastic water bottle approximately 30% full with a total weight of 206 grams, a purity of 3.5% methylamphetamine and a pure methylamphetamine weight of 7.21 grams;

(3) Item A05, a 600 millilitre plastic water bottle approximately 20% full with a total weight of 161 grams, a purity of 3.5% methylamphetamine and with a pure methylamphetamine weight of 5.635 grams;

(4) Item A09, a 1 litre measuring jug containing approximately 1 litre of brown cloudy liquid with a total weight of 1040 grams, apurity of 1.8% methylamphetamine and with a pure methylamphetamine weight of 18.72 grams.”


	
	She went on to note the total combined weight of pure methylamphetamine from the four discrete amounts as 31.6 grams. As to the interrelationship between weight and purity with objective seriousness, her Honour said:
	


“The quantity of drug manufactured is a material consideration in assessing the seriousness of a manufacture offence. It is not, however, the sole, chief or determinative factor in assessing objective seriousness. It is a factor that will be relevant to such a determination, the relevance of which will depend on the circumstances of each case. The quantity of methylamphetamine, the subject of the present offence was 31.6 grams. The indictable threshold is reached at 250 grams. Within that range such quantity cannot be described as being large.

Again, although not decisive as to objective seriousness, the purity of the substance in question is a very relevant consideration. The 31.6 grams of methylamphetamine the subject of the present offence had a purity of 100%. Such a purity increases the objective seriousness of this offence. Pure methylamphetamine has the capacity to be cut with other substances to increase its quantity. Cut or diluted methylamphetamine can be distributed at street level. Illicit drugs have the capacity to cause considerable harm within the community in many different ways. Fortunately, the methylamphetamine the subject of the present offence was fully recovered by police.”


	
	The applicant contends that, in these comments, her Honour overlooked the fact that, to derive 31.6 grams of pure methylamphetamine, a further process of distillation was required. Having regard to her Honours remarks as a whole, this submission cannot be made good. Her Honour outlined the factual circumstances in considerable detail, including the chemical status of the methylamphetamine. There is nothing to support the suggestion that she “overlooked” this aspect of the evidence.
	
	
	As her Honour noted, the amount and the purity of the drug is a consideration relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness. So much is accepted by the applicant. In circumstances where the applicant pleaded guilty to the manufacturing of 31.6 grams of methylamphetamine of 100% purity, taking no issue with those particulars, it is difficult to see how her Honour’s analysis can now reasonably be asserted to be incorrect.
	
	
	Indeed, on one view, the fact that the amount of methylamphetamine particularised by the indictment and referred to by her Honour was limited to its pure weight may have been to the applicant’s benefit. Had the admixture rule in s.4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 been relied upon, the overall weight of prohibited drug would have been much greater.
	
	
	The third part of the applicant’s complaint under this ground is that her Honour placed too great an emphasis on the report of the forensic chemist, Mr Hugel.
	
	
	Although her Honour referred to the opinions expressed by Mr. Hugel as to the quantity of methylamphetamine that could theoretically be produced from the chemicals found on site – opinions with which the applicant took no issue at first instance – the applicant’s complaint is readily negated by considering the whole of what was said on that aspect of the matter. The sentencing judge repeatedly noted that the capacity to produce particular amounts of prohibited drug was “theoretical” only. Significantly, she additionally recognised that there was no evidence that, either, all necessary ingredients were present for any larger quantities to be manufactured, or that those involved possessed the necessary knowledge or expertise to make any larger quantities.
	
	
	In considering those factors relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime, her Honour stated that the quantity of methylamphetamine manufactured for which the applicant stood to be sentenced was 31.6 grams. Indeed she concluded that, in a range where the upper threshold of the indictable quantity is represented by an amount of 250 grams of methylamphetamine, the amount manufactured by the applicant “cannot be described as large.”
	
	
	Taken as a whole, her Honour’s remarks cannot demonstrate that she lost sight of that fact or gave undue weight to Mr Hugel’s opinion.
	
	
	This ground has not been made out and I would not grant leave to advance it.
	


Ground 3: The sentence was manifestly excessive.


	
	In support of this ground the applicant argues that the sentence is excessive having regard to the fact that he was not personally involved in the manufacturing process; only a small amount of the drug was produced; the pseudoephedrine provided by the applicant was limited in quantity and of poor quality; and that he suffered financial loss as a result of the enterprise.
	
	
	None of those features in my opinion can greatly mitigate the seriousness of this offence. That an offence is incompetently executed, and therefore makes a loss, can be relevant to objective gravity, but that is always a question to be determined in light of the particular circumstances of an individual case. Ordinarily, the sentencing judge will be in the best position to assess the various features.
	
	
	For my part, I do not accept that the fact that an offence was less successful than intended or that an offender made a loss rather than the hoped for profit, should necessarily diminish its gravity and alleviate against the penalty imposed. The applicant provided what he thought was good quality pseudoephedrine to his associates to further the manufacture of methylamphetamine, and then took all steps that he could to facilitate the efforts of his co-offenders. His role was a senior one, and his crime was committed out of greed and for financial gain. That he ultimately made a loss rather than the money he hoped to gain does not make his crime less serious or ameliorate the penalty to be imposed.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant also highlighted in support of this ground his subjective case, being his “reasonable to good” prospects of rehabilitation, the absence of any chromogenic needs, his minor record, remorse, good employment history, and positive family circumstances, these were all features taken into account by her Honour in fixing the penalty. Some of the latter aspects of the matter figured in the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge, a finding very much in the applicant’s favour, and which introduced an additional element of leniency to the sentence imposed upon him.
	
	
	To establish a complaint of manifest excess the applicant must demonstrate that a sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [325]. That burden has to be discharged in circumstances where there is no “correct” sentence and the discretion that reposes in sentencing judges in this regard is a broad one: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.
	
	
	The question for this Court is whether the length of the sentence is demonstrated to be outside the range of a sound sentencing discretion. In determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive it is necessary to examine the result from the perspective of the maximum prescribed penalty, which in this case is fifteen years imprisonment plus a monetary penalty, and considering the gravity of the offence and the personal circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence that was before the sentencing court, and her Honour’s remarks, I can detect no error in the approach taken, and no departure from the application of relevant principles.
	
	
	This ground cannot be made good.
	


Conclusion


	
	The applicant's complaints have not been made good and I would not grant leave to appeal.
	


Orders


	
	Leave to appeal is refused.

2766926,Garcia-Godos v R (Cth) [2015] NSWCCA 144,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Nature of proceedings

The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against an order made by Toner SC DCJ on 28 February 2013. The order, which is the subject of the appeal, is the dismissal by his Honour of the application to reverse the plea of guilty to Count 1 on the indictment (the importation count).


	
	The single ground of appeal is:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in refusing to allow the appellant to withdraw his guilty plea in respect of Count 1 on the indictment.


	
	Count 1 on the indictment is:
	


1.   Between about 19 December 2005 and about 12 June 2006 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity (contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth)).


	
	The other two counts on the indictment as originally framed were:
	


2.   Between about 2 February 2008 and 30 April 2006 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did conspire with Patricia Gloria Trujillo-Mesa and others to commit an offence against s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) to deal with money or other property, believing the money or other property to be proceeds of crime, and at the time of dealing the value of the money or other property was $100,000 or more, being approximately $702,647.80 (contrary to s 11.5(1) and s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth)).

3.   Between about 30 April 2006 and 7 June 2006 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with Maria Simona Maldonado, Julian Enrique Gallego-Lavalle and others to commit an offence against s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) to deal with money or other property, believing the money or other property to be proceeds of crime, and at the time of dealing the value of the money or other property was $100,000 or more, being approximately $429,976.30 (contrary to s 11.5(1) and 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth)).

Factual background


	
	On 23 December 2005, 34 kgs of pure cocaine was imported into Australia from Peru, concealed within bags of lucuma (fruit) powder. The applicant travelled to Australia on various occasions in 2005 and 2006, departing finally on 26 March 2006.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 11 July 2008 in Peru, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). On about 28 February 2010 the applicant was extradited from Peru and arrived in Australia on 1 March 2010 at which time he was charged with the offences on the indictment. The applicant has remained bail refused since that date.
	
	
	On 1 September 2010 the applicant waived his right to a committal hearing at Central Local Court in relation to those offences. The matters were committed to the Sydney District Court for trial.
	
	
	In February 2011 the applicant engaged Victoria Havryliv, a solicitor in the employ of Ford Lawyers, to act on his behalf. On 14 April 2011 Ms Havryliv sent a letter to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) advising that she had been instructed by the applicant to enter into plea negotiations with the Crown. On 11 May 2011 the CDPP replied to Ms Havryliv to the effect that the plea offer was not accepted. A counter offer was made.
	
	
	On 20 May 2011 Ms Havryliv telephoned the CDPP and advised that the applicant would enter pleas of guilty in accordance with the counter offer. The counter offer was that pleas of guilty would be entered in respect of counts 1 and 2, with count 3 being taken into account pursuant to the provisions of s 16BA of the Commonwealth Crimes Act.
	
	
	On 20 May 2011, with the aid of a Spanish speaking interpreter, the applicant was arraigned before Solomon DCJ at the Sydney District Court. The applicant entered pleas of guilty in respect of counts 1 and 2 on the indictment. The applicant was not present in person but appeared by audio-visual link. He was represented on this day by Ms Havryliv.
	
	
	The matter was subsequently listed on a number of occasions for a disputed sentence hearing. On 2 March 2012 the sentence hearing date was vacated and for the first time, the District Court was advised that it was the applicant’s intention to seek leave to withdraw his pleas of guilty to counts 1 and 2.
	
	
	The application for leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty was heard by Toner SC DCJ on 15-18 January, 25 January and 25-26 February 2013 with his Honour giving judgment on 28 February 2013. The application for leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty was dismissed.
	


The hearing before Toner SC DCJ


	
	The applicant’s case relied primarily on his own affidavit, sworn 8 November 2011, his oral evidence before the court and an affidavit sworn by Richard Cornwell (Cornwell), dated 22 November 2012. Cornwell also gave oral evidence.
	
	
	The effect of the applicant’s evidence was that he never agreed to plead guilty to the importation count and never told his lawyers that he wanted to plead guilty. He maintained that he was not guilty of the importation count. In evidence he said that he instructed Ms Havryliv that he did not import any drugs into Australia as charged and that “I had no involvement with the importation” (affidavit [21]). He said that on 20 May 2011 he talked to Ms Havryliv and said “Are you sure what I’m doing? Because I have nothing to do with the importation”. She said “Don’t worry, you are going to be a witness and tell the judge. You are going to declare and tell your story” (T.21.25, 24.36).
	
	
	On other occasions in evidence he said that his instructions to his solicitor were that he was not the person in charge of the importation. He did not sign any instructions to enter pleas of guilty. When he pleaded guilty, he had not seen any version of the statement of facts but had seen the brief of evidence.
	
	
	The applicant said that he did not understand the repercussions of pleading guilty, namely that once he pleaded guilty he was “stuck with it” (affidavit [39]). He said that Ms Havryliv advised him that the sentencing judge, after hearing his evidence on sentence, “would be able to throw out the importation charge or at least minimise his role” (affidavit [36], [38], T.18.37, T.61.05). In other words, his understanding was that after he pleaded guilty the sentencing judge “could drop the important charge” or convict him of a lesser charge (affidavit [24], T.18.45).
	
	
	The applicant said that he had a poor command of spoken and written English and that as at 6 April 2011 (the date of a key conference with his solicitors), he could not converse in English and could speak only “very, very basic” words. He said that this contributed to his misunderstanding with his solicitors.
	
	
	The applicant said that his solicitors pressured him to plead guilty. He said that Ms Havryliv told him “I should declare myself guilty of two of them [the charges]” (T.14.07, T.15.05, T.18.30, T.60.35). The advice that he had to plead guilty was only given by Ms Havryliv and Ms Maltezos. This advice was not given in the presence of his counsel, Ms Nash.
	
	
	The applicant made no mention in his affidavit and evidence in chief about any conferences with his solicitors before, at the time of and subsequent to his entering of pleas of guilty. There were in existence file notes relating to those conferences (exhibit B, which was the file of Ms Havryliv). The applicant’s evidence in relation to the file notes was confusing and he appeared to have problems isolating his recollection from one conference to the next. His Honour regarded that as understandable. The effect of the file notes was that the applicant was not saying that he had nothing to do with the importation, but that he was not a principal in the importation. A file note taken on 6 April 2011 had the applicant saying: “Involved, involved but I am not the boss”.
	
	
	His Honour expressed his conclusion in relation to the file notes as follows:
	


“51   From each of the records of the conferences involving Ms Nash it is hard to avoid the conclusion if those notes are accurate; that Mr Garcia-Godos well understood that when he entered his plea to the charge of importation he was accepting an involvement in that offence but that he was insisting that his role in the importation was very much that of a lesser player and at best characterised in the way Mr Cornwell's note describes.”


	
	Cornwell was an inmate held in the same prison as the applicant. His evidence concerned what he had been told by the applicant. Significantly, Cornwell did not speak Spanish. He explained his communication with the applicant by describing it as a tortuous process, involving very long conversations in halting English. Where his evidence conflicted with that of the applicant, he sought to explain it by saying that he may well have been mistaken in his interpretation of what he had been told by the applicant.
	
	
	Cornwell was also involved apparently in committing an importation of drugs offence and was involved with persons who may well have been the principals in the importation with which the applicant was concerned. This was never made clear. Cornwell was at pains to portray himself as somebody who was acting, in effect, altruistically and trying to assist the applicant to understand the nature of the predicament in which he was and to assist in interpreting and explaining the nature of the evidence that the Crown proposed to produce against the applicant.
	
	
	His Honour summarised his assessment of the evidence of the applicant and Mr Cornwell as follows:
	


“63   I was not impressed by Mr Cornwell as a witness. He was, at times, argumentative which in certain circumstances is not necessarily a vice, but in this case did not reflect well upon him. His evidence was in parts simply unbelievable. That part which I have recited above is characteristic of the way in which he gave his evidence. In essence, he was anxious to say that the applicant emphasised to him throughout that he had no part to play in the importation of the cocaine and yet when confronted with parts of the documents that he had written himself, which frankly contradicted that assertion, he not just equivocated but sought to explain how it was that such precise detail may have been his own interpretation of what Garcia-Godos said rather than a reflection of what he had been told by Garcia-Godos. I reject that proposition.

64   Similar criticism can be levelled at the applicant. I do not propose within these reasons to scrutinise each of his answers to each of the propositions put to him, particularly in relation to the cross-examination of him as it related to each of the conferences between himself and his lawyers, most particularly Ms Havryliv and Ms Nash. Again, his evidence was vague and imprecise. His memory faded conveniently in my opinion, except in circumstances where specific propositions were put to him where he says that he directly recalls instructions that he gave to his solicitors and counsel.

65   I bear in mind when reaching those conclusions the difficulties that always attend a witness giving evidence through an interpreter. Answers tend to be literal and lack the colloquial flavour which normally flows from English given by an English speaker and accordingly I am prepared to make significant concessions in his favour in that regard. Further, I was told from the Bar Table and accept that perhaps a part of explanation for the somewhat discursive nature of some of the answers given by the applicant springs from a cultural habit, as I understand it, not just of Peruvians but of Spanish speakers.

66   There is no evidence before me to that effect but nonetheless I am prepared to draw that conclusion in favour of the applicant. However, on many occasions I am of the view that the answers given by the applicant were simply not responsive to the questions asked of him and his answers were designed to avoid confronting the obvious conclusions contained within the question asked. Particularly, that relates to the nature of the instructions that he gave to his lawyers.”


	
	His Honour specifically noted that many of the answers given by the applicant in evidence were at odds with the notes on conference contained in exhibit B. They were also inconsistent with much of the written records of Cornwell, said by Cornwell to be derived from his lengthy conversations with the applicant. His Honour observed that it was hard to see why the applicant would want to co-operate with the AFP (as he sought to do by making a statement to them) if in fact he was not involved in the importation offence.
	
	
	The Crown adduced oral evidence from a federal agent, Ms Nash of counsel, Ms Havryliv solicitor, and Ms Maltezos solicitor.
	
	
	In general terms his Honour was critical of both Ms Havryliv and Ms Nash in that some conferences with the applicant were conducted without an interpreter. He was also critical of the fact that written instructions concerning the entry of pleas of guilty to counts 1 and 2 were not obtained from the applicant. Despite those criticisms, his Honour accepted both Ms Havryliv and Ms Nash as witnesses of truth.
	
	
	The evidence of Ms Nash was that the notes contained in exhibit B accurately reflected the instructions given by the applicant to her and Ms Havryliv. His Honour took into account that it was never put to Ms Nash that the notes in exhibit B were not an accurate record of the conferences. Those notes were to the effect that the applicant well understood the effect of the pleas of guilty and had given clear instructions for those pleas to be entered. His Honour’s conclusion in relation to the evidence of Ms Nash was:
	


“80   I cannot reject the evidence of Ms Nash and in fact I accept her evidence as being accurate, honest and reliable.”


	
	The evidence of Ms Havryliv was that although the applicant’s English was not always grammatically correct, she could comfortably understand him and it was apparent from his responses to her and his interaction in this and the other conferences where an interpreter was not present, that he understood her English.
	
	
	Ms Havryliv gave evidence concerning a conference she had with the applicant on 18 May 2011 at Long Bay. There was no interpreter present. She said that her note of that conference was an accurate reflection of it. She said that she showed the applicant the letter from the DPP containing the counter proposal and that she received instructions to plead guilty to the two counts that would be left on the indictment in accordance with the offer made by the DPP. She denied that she had ever told the applicant to plead guilty.
	
	
	The events of 20 May 2011 are important because that is the day upon which the pleas of guilty were formally entered in court. Ms Havryliv said that on that day she spoke to the applicant via the audio visual link with the assistance of an interpreter. The interpreter read out the indictment that was to be presented against the applicant in Spanish. She explained to him what was to happen next and he was then arraigned before Judge Solomon and entered the two pleas of guilty.
	
	
	His Honour set out his conclusion as to the evidence of Ms Havryliv as follows:
	


“146   I found Ms Havryliv to be an impressive witness. It was not suggested to her during the course of cross-examination that the notes that she made on conference, which are variously contained within exhibit B, were fabricated by her nor were they anything other than a contemporaneous record as she said. It was not suggested to her that they represented anything other than an accurate record of those conferences.

…

149   Her evidence was not disturbed in cross-examination. She was credible and consistent. It is impossible to reconcile her evidence with that of the applicant. I have already made remarks as to my opinion of his evidence and how it ought to be treated. Ms Havryliv’s evidence is consistent with that of Ms Nash.”


	
	His Honour made similarly favourable findings in relation to the evidence of Ms Maltezos, who was a solicitor junior to Ms Havryliv and who attended three of the conferences with the applicant.
	
	
	The evidence of the federal agent was to the effect that the applicant had a good understanding of English. The agent had spent a considerable period of time with the applicant when escorting him under arrest from Peru. Some of the conversations he had with him were played to the court and the content of those conversations supported his assessment of the applicant’s knowledge of English.
	
	
	His Honour set out his findings as follows:
	


“161   I accept the evidence of each of Ms Nash, Ms Havryliv and Ms Maltezos. Given the findings that I have already made in relation to Mr Garcia-Godos' evidence and that of Mr Cornwell insofar as he takes it any further, I prefer their evidence.

162   I find that the applicant well understood the nature of the case against him on Count 1. He well understood that the Crown had a solid and persuasive case against him.

163   I find that he was advised of his options and the consequences that would   flow from them and that he freely and voluntarily instructed his lawyers that he would plead guilty. I find that he was not told that he had to plead guilty by them nor was he told that he would not be able to give evidence at the sentencing hearing. I find that he was not told that the sentencing Judge

would, after hearing his version of events, after he entered a guilty plea be

able to dismiss the charge of importation or reduce it to a lesser charge.

164   I find that his plea on 20 May 2011 was predicated on his instructions to his lawyers that he was culpably involved in the importation charge but that

he asserted that he was not a principal in that enterprise and claimed that his involvement though culpable, was peripheral.

165   I find that he was advised by his lawyers that he could plead guilty on that basis and that there would be a hearing in the sentencing proceedings to

contest the Crown's assertion that he was in fact a principal. I find that he

was both told that he could and advised that he would have to give evidence in those proceedings to assert what were his instructions to his lawyers as to his involvement in that charge.

166   I am of the opinion that the clear inference from the evidence is that the applicant only determined to seek to change his pleas when his attempts

to pursue avenues which might reduce the sentence which otherwise

would be imposed upon him fell away. More importantly the rejection by

the AFP of what he said to them as being of no assistance and, in effect,

either already known to them or unreliable.

167   This was on top of the diminishing discount he could expect for the

utilitarian value of the timing of his plea.

168   He is, by this application to my mind now hoping to simply ""roll the dice"" and take his chance at trial.

169   The applicant's contention that he was told what he has asserted he was told is simply unlikely. Quite why highly experienced lawyers would give such advice or utter such urgings was not explained.”

Submissions


	
	The applicant was represented by solicitors and counsel before Toner SC DCJ. When the matter came to this Court, the applicant appeared for himself. The applicant relied upon written submissions which he had prepared and made brief oral submissions to supplement them.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submissions essentially repeated the submissions made on his behalf in the District Court. The applicant also sought to explain the words attributed to him in the solicitors’ notes and which were specifically referred to by his Honour. At no time did he deny that he used those words but offered explanations to the effect that his admissions related to count 2, or that on those occasions that an interpreter was not present, he did not understand what was being said to him because of his imperfect knowledge of English. The applicant sought to explain the non-responsive nature of some of his answers by saying that he was extremely nervous and was not used to a court atmosphere.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that Ms Nash may well have believed that he had agreed that he was involved in the drug importation. He thought that may have occurred because Ms Havryliv had told him that he would be able to explain to a judge at a sentencing hearing that he was not so involved. He submitted that although Ms Nash may genuinely have felt that he was not pressured into pleading guilty, he felt that he had been so pressured. The applicant said that he accepted that Ms Nash was honest in her evidence but that she had misunderstood what he had said.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that Ms Havryliv had an agenda, which included persuading him to enter a plea of guilty to both counts. He complained that she was not cross-examined sufficiently aggressively by his counsel in the District Court. He submitted that he was disadvantaged because he was unable to take notes of what had occurred at conferences, due to being in custody and not having a proper knowledge of English. He submitted that Ms Havryliv had a significant advantage in that she was able to take notes of what occurred at the conferences and refer to those notes when giving evidence. It was therefore very difficult to challenge her evidence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that he believed from what Ms Havryliv had told him that if he pleaded guilty to the importation count, he would still be able to explain to a judge in the sentence proceedings that he was not involved in that offence. He submitted that in retrospect that was probably a foolish belief but it was a belief which he genuinely held at the time that he entered his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that Ms Havryliv was mistaken or confused when she gave evidence that he had unequivocally agreed to plead guilty to the importation offence. He submitted that in giving the evidence which she did, she was seeking to protect her reputation since it would not help her professionally to be known as a person who bullied a client into entering a plea of guilty when that was not what the client wished to do.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that Ms Maltezos was a junior solicitor and in effect was dominated by Ms Havryliv. He submitted that Ms Maltezos would have also been aware that her professional reputation was at stake when she gave evidence in the District Court.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that because Cornwell was also a client of Ms Havryliv the evidence, which he gave both in his affidavit and orally, was designed to assist her and not him. He submitted that in giving his evidence Cornwell had a conflict of interest between trying to assist Ms Havryliv and apparently trying to assist him.
	
	
	The applicant sought to challenge his Honour’s findings in a number of respects. He submitted that if the Crown had such a strong case against him, why was the Crown so determined to prevent him having a trial, so that the Crown case could be examined by a jury. The applicant submitted that he did not understand that by pleading guilty to the importation offence, he was accepting that he had played a part in the importation of the cocaine.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour was mistaken in the conclusions which he had drawn from the evidence. The applicant denied that he had played any part in the importation of the cocaine and that his only involvement was to help launder the money. He submitted that he was not able to make clear to Ms Havryliv nor did he clearly understand himself, that he could plead guilty to one part of the crimes with which he had been charged and not guilty to the other.
	
	
	It is instructive to set out one of the submissions of the applicant on this issue:
	


“6   After I have been persuaded to plead guilty by Ms Havryliv based on an assurance that I would serve no more than 7 years. There were no avenues which might reduce my sentence, it was not a case of them “falling away” all within a period of ten days.”

That last comment was a reference to the applicant’s assertion that he gave instructions to withdraw the pleas of guilty within 10 days of them having been entered.


	
	The applicant also made submissions as to why he was not guilty of the offence:
	



	
	He was not involved in the export of the lucuma powder to Australia. He submitted that no connection had ever been proved between him and the shipping agents or the company which exported the lucuma powder.
	
	
	This was a sophisticated and complicated crime involving chemists at both ends of the process. He had no experience or expertise in such activities.
	
	
	The importation offence did not in fact occur in that there was no cocaine imported into Australia in lucuma powder. What was imported into Australia was a precursor and so he was charged with the wrong offence.
	


Consideration


	
	This matter comes before the Court pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act and not by way of a conventional appeal. Accordingly, it is necessary to understand the nature of the appeal. Uninstructed by authority, I would have thought that for the applicant to succeed he would need to establish House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 error. That, however, is not the case.
	
	
	This issue was considered in Norvenska v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 158 where Basten JA (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) said:
	


“11   Section 5F(4) provides that an appeal under that section is to be determined on the evidence given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates, unless, by leave, fresh, additional or substituted evidence is adduced. Such provisions have, in cases involving civil jurisdiction, been relied upon in support of the conclusion that the nature of the appeal is by way of rehearing: see, eg, CDJ v VAJ (1998) 197 CLR 172 at [95]-[101] and Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40; (2000) 203 CLR 172 at [22]. As Mr Game SC for the applicant noted, there is a suggestion in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260 at 265-267, that an appeal pursuant to s 5F “is not by way of rehearing”: at p 265. However, neither Gleeson CJ nor Hidden J joined in his Honour’s comments in that respect. Hunt CJ at CL referred (at p 267) to Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290, as authority that an appeal pursuant to s 5F was not by way of rehearing. However, the discussion in Alexandroaia at p 290 is to the effect that an exercise of discretion is only reviewable on the grounds identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. As Gleeson CJ noted in BWM, at p 261, that is not the same question. What Hunt CJ at CL appears to have meant by an appeal “by way of rehearing” is to be understood by reference to his summary of the applicant’s argument in BWM that “an appeal pursuant to s 5F is by way of rehearing, and that it is for this Court to determine for itself whether the Crown should have leave to withdraw its acceptance of the plea, without first concerning itself with the issue as to whether error had been demonstrated ...”: pp 264-5.

…

13 Such a description of the nature of the appeal does not provide a full indication of the powers of the Court and the limitations on those powers. In an appeal under s 5F, unlike an appeal against conviction following a jury trial, this Court may have the benefit of reasons given by the trial judge, as it did in this case. On the other hand, it does not have the benefit of having seen the witnesses give evidence and respond to cross-examination, which constrains the ability of the Court to interfere with findings as to credibility. In the present case, a significant feature of the applicant’s case for withdrawal of his plea was that he had been subjected to inappropriate pressure to change his plea to guilty, on the morning of 3 April. In his affidavit, he asserted that counsel had told him that he had to plead guilty, that his lawyers were shouting at him and that they would not defend him. These allegations were denied by each of the lawyers and his Honour concluded that no undue pressure had been placed upon him. That factual finding was, understandably, not challenged on appeal.”


	
	For obvious reasons, the applicant made no submission concerning the legal tests applied by his Honour when considering the applicant’s application. It is clear that his Honour had regard to relevant decisions and applied the principles identified in those decisions appropriately (R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35, R v Van [2002] NSWCCA 148; 129 A Crim R 229, Wong v DPP (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 129; 155 A Crim R 37). His Honour accepted that he had a discretion to allow an accused to withdraw a guilty plea at any time before the passing of sentence (Frodsham v O’Gorman (1979) 1 NSWLR 683 per Hope JA at [389]).
	
	
	The decision upon which his Honour focused was that of Justice Greg James in Van. In that judgment Justice Greg James collected and stated the principles relevant to such an application. That statement of legal principle in Van has been approved on many occasions in this Court, most recently in Lawson v R [2011] NSWCCA 44; 206 A Crim R 557 at [32] – [36]; Khamis v R [2014] NSWCCA 152 at [57] – [59] and Kim v R [2015] NSWCCA 115 at [53] – [56].
	
	
	As was stated in Khamis at [59]:
	


“59   … any miscarriage of justice is to be found in the circumstances in which the applicant came to enter his plea. Ordinarily, this task is not an investigation of the applicant's guilt or innocence, rather it is an examination of the integrity of the plea of guilty itself.”


	
	That was the approach followed by Toner SC DCJ in this case and I have found no error in either his Honour’s statement of the principles or the way in which he applied them. The authorities have consistently restated the underlying principle that a plea of guilty will only be permitted to be withdrawn where it has been shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. The applicant bore the onus of proof on a balance of probabilities to show the existence of such a miscarriage and was required to establish “a good and substantial reason for the court taking that course” (R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 at [39]).
	
	
	It follows that if the applicant was to be successful in this appeal he had to show some error on the part of his Honour in relation to his fact finding. It is for that reason that I have set out in considerable detail the findings of fact and process of reasoning of his Honour in making those findings of fact.
	
	
	In reviewing his Honour’s process of fact finding, it also needs to be kept in mind that his Honour had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses and “has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole …” (Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118). Accordingly considerable weight has to be given to his Honour’s assessment of the reliability of the witnesses who gave evidence before him.
	
	
	When one has regard to the specific matters raised by and on behalf of the applicant, there is no error in the decision to refuse the applicant’s application to reverse his guilty plea to the importation count and no miscarriage of justice has arisen.
	


(a)   The applicant’s claim that he did not wish to plead guilty, he did not instruct his solicitors to plead guilty, and he did not admit his guilt.


	
	Having heard the evidence, and having taken into account the conference notes in exhibit B, his Honour held that the applicant’s evidence lacked credibility and could not support findings that he never instructed his solicitors to plead guilty, or gave instructions that he played no role in the importation. The applicant’s evidence that he never wanted to plead guilty was directly at odds with the evidence of his solicitors and the notes made during their conferences with him. His Honour found that the evidence of Ms Havryliv and Ms Maltezos was accurate, contemporaneous (referring to the notes), credible and consistent (referring to their testimony).
	
	
	As already indicated, the theme running through the solicitors’ notes was not that the applicant was not involved in the importation offence but that he played a minor role in it. It is clear from those notes that the applicant gave instructions which were consistent with his involvement in the importation offence.
	


(b)   Absence of signed instructions


	
	His Honour was critical of Ms Havryliv and Ms Nash for not obtaining signed instructions from the applicant for the entry of the pleas of guilty. Even so his Honour was not satisfied that the absence of signed instructions proved that the applicant had never instructed his solicitors to enter pleas of guilty on his behalf or that he had not admitted guilt to his solicitors. The absence of signed instructions was well and truly overcome by the content of the conference notes and the evidence from the solicitors and Ms Nash.
	


(c)   The applicant claimed that he did not understand the consequences of the guilty plea because he received inaccurate advice and/or his level of English was such that he misunderstood the legal advice he received.


	
	The applicant accepted that he understood the nature of the charges against him. He accepted that on 22 March 2011 Ms Nash read the charges out to him and explained what they meant. Further, he was not a stranger to criminal proceedings in Australia. In 1990 he was convicted of possessing cocaine in Australia. On that occasion he was represented by a solicitor, Mr Greg Goold. He pleaded guilty to the offence, after some negotiations by Mr Goold, and knew that when he pleaded guilty he was admitting to having committed the offence. In his evidence, he accepted that during the extradition proceedings in Peru, he understood that he was charged with the importation of a large amount of cocaine into Australia.
	
	
	The applicant was advised of the plea negotiations and their outcome. This is clear from the solicitors’ notes. On 12 May 2011 Ms Maltezos (with an interpreter) advised the applicant that the best that could happen was a plea of guilty to counts 1 and 2, with count 3 on a Form 1 and a contested hearing on the facts. This advice was repeated to the applicant by Ms Havryliv on 18 May 2011. On 20 May 2011 the applicant pleaded guilty with the benefit of an interpreter translating the charges which were read out to him.
	
	
	The applicant’s claim that he had little or no knowledge of English was problematic at best.
	


The applicant had many conversations in English with Cornwell. These formed the basis of a good deal of Cornwell’s numerous handwritten notes on the applicant’s involvement in the offences.

Ms Nash, Ms Havryliv and Ms Maltezos each gave evidence that the applicant spoke English at a reasonable level in conference with them. Some of the words he spoke were recorded in the notes made by Ms Havryliv.

The applicant had discussions in English with a federal agent on a range of matters on 27 February 2010 while he was being extradited from Peru, including his indication to that agent that he wanted to assist the AFP and provide information.

During his recorded interview with police on 19 July 2011 the applicant demonstrated a good awareness of indemnities, letters of assistance and discounts on penalty for assistance to authorities.

The applicant did tertiary studies in Peru – he studied graphic design for two years. He married an English woman. He was with her for 10 years. He travelled to the UK and Ireland on two occasions, including a visit with his wife and daughter for two weeks.

The applicant had the benefit of an interpreter during key conferences with his lawyers and in particular when the pleas of guilty were entered on 20 May 2011.

(d)   The applicant’s claim that he was pressured to enter a guilty plea by his solicitors.


	
	The applicant gave evidence that it was always Ms Havryliv who was pressuring him to plead guilty. He said that “when the interpreter was present, they never touched the subject that I declare myself guilty” (T.98.50-99.03). However, on 6 April 2011 when both Ms Nash and the interpreter were present, the solicitors’ notes record “I do not want to go to trial but I was not the principal”. Although the applicant denied saying that, it was not suggested that these notes were fabricated. Moreover, the applicant later contradicted himself by stating that he told his lawyers on 6 April 2011 that he did not want to plead guilty to the importation charge.
	
	
	On 6 April 2011, after a lengthy analysis of the Crown case against him, the solicitors’ conference notes record “It is a matter for you whether you go to trial or plead”. There was no suggestion that those conferences notes were not accurate.
	


Conclusion


	
	Because the applicant was representing himself, I have gone into more detail in relation to this appeal than was strictly necessary. It is, however, clear from a review of his Honour’s statement of the law and application of those principles to the facts that the complaints made by the applicant at (a) – (d) (see [55] – [62] hereof) have not been made out. There was no error in his Honour’s identification of the applicable law or its application. There was a sound basis in evidence for the findings made by his Honour and the rejection of the issues raised on behalf of the applicant. This led to his Honour’s ultimate decision that no miscarriage of justice would arise from the applicant being required to maintain his guilty plea to the importation count.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: No basis has been put forward by the applicant for interfering with the findings of fact made by Toner SC DCJ in rejecting his application to reverse his plea. Those findings were supported by the objective material before his Honour and were otherwise informed by the advantage that his Honour enjoyed in observing all the witnesses give evidence. Once those findings were made the rejection of the application to reverse the plea was inevitable. I otherwise agree with the reasons of Hoeben CJ at CL. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes.

		17 June 2015",2015-06-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766928,Michail v Mount Druitt & Area Community Legal Centre [2015] NSWDC 145,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	This judgment is a short outline of the issues concerning the plea of defamation in these proceedings, and is intended to summarise, in a somewhat informal way, the points I made when discussing these problems in court with the plaintiff on 18 June 2015. The purpose is to assist the plaintiff, who is distressed by the events leading up to the bringing of this claim, as well as by a recent bereavement.
	
	
	These proceedings unfortunately did not get off to a good start, and this is not necessarily the fault of the plaintiff. They were commenced, incorrectly, by Summons filed in the Parramatta registry on 20 February 2015, when they should have been commenced by statement of claim. A statement of claim was subsequently prepared, and is stamped “received on 5 March 2015”, the date of the callover before the Registrar, who made orders for the plaintiff to file that document. The Registrar’s orders refer to the filing of a “defence” but the parties have explained that this is an error.
	
	
	As these proceedings were commenced in Parramatta and not in the Sydney Registry Defamation List, they are one of a series of claims where case management has been delayed, through no fault of the parties, by the lack of procedures for defamation proceedings in that court. This is why the proceedings were transferred to Sydney. While these delays have made the plaintiff suspicious that the defendant is engaging in misconduct, the problem is in fact court-related, in that it results from case management changes made by the court in relation to defamation matters.
	
	
	When the matter came before me for directions on 16 April 2015 the plaintiff, who had filed an amended statement of claim on 11 March 2015, sought orders for the defendant to file a defence immediately. I explained to the plaintiff that the statement of claim contained a series of pleading errors which would make the filing of a defence unrealistic at this stage. For example the pleading set out only part of the 9 February 2015 email from the defendant to the plaintiff which was stated to be the matter complained of, and did not identify any imputations; there was even less information about the other publications.
	
	
	I accordingly invited the plaintiff to redraft her claim to set out the full text of all publications upon which she intends to sue, followed by the imputations pleaded and, where relevant, the particulars of the publication of any such defamatory matters to third parties.
	


The plaintiff’s current pleading


	
	The plaintiff filed a further amended statement of claim on 25 May 2015. The statement of claim now identifies two publications as matters complained of (9 and 24 February 2015) but also refers to one or more oral publications in October 2014 (described as “communication” in paragraph 76) and electronic publications from 30 January 2015, although some of these appear to have been made by the plaintiff (paragraph 87).
	
	
	The plaintiff filed a further amended statement of claim on 25 May 2015, although this document is entitled Amended Statement of Claim. This document will hereafter be referred to as the Further Amended Statement of Claim or the current statement of claim. The Further Amended Statement of Claim now identifies two publications as matters complained of (9 and 24 February 2015) but also refers to one or more oral publications in October 2014 (described as “communication” in paragraph 76) and electronic publications from 30 January 2015 (paragraph 87):
	


“6. Defamation

75. The plaintiff is only aware of the communications and publications pleaded herein.

76. On or about end of October 2014 NC defamed the plaintiff in her workplace by communicating the theme that the plaintiff likes being abused, which he admitted to in the presence of VC on 15 January 2015 (communication).

77. Imputations: The plaintiff is a masochist who enjoys public abuse and humiliation. The plaintiff is a doormat. The more the plaintiff is abused, the more she will remain with, idolise, worship and praise her abusers. The plaintiff will keep her head down and put-up with ill treatment.

78. In addition to paragraphs 45 to 53 inclusive, on 9 February 2015 (first publication and notification date), approximately 5 working hours subsequent to the plaintiff’s complaint, the plaintiff received an email from the defendant’s Executive Management Committee, attaching a letter of their unlawful and harmful termination of the plaintiff’s contract of service, annexed hereto and marked “A” (first publication).

79. The first publication was made on the defendant’s letterhead, sent from the defendants volunteers email account, and contained legal terminology and formatting. DO does not have legal background and therefore the first publication was made in collaboration with VC and/or NC.

80. Imputation paragraphs 1 and 2: serious misconduct.

81. Defendant’s advice in paragraph 3: The defendant prevented the plaintiff from making any contact with them, thereby denying her the right to request particulars, explanations and/or reasons for their unlawful and harmful first publication.

82. Imputation paragraphs 4 and 5: violent and unlawful conduct. The plaintiff is violent towards the defendant not only in person, but also through Electronic Media Communications. The plaintiff was previously removed from the defendant’s premises by the police for violent and unlawful conduct.

83. On Friday 20 February 2015 the plaintiff summoned the defendant to Court for defamation.

84. On Tuesday 24 February 2015, approximately 9 working hours subsequent to the plaintiff instigating this proceeding, VC made a verbal complaint against the plaintiff at the Mount Druitt police station (second publication).

85. And in addition to paragraphs 78 and 79, the second publication is based on the plaintiff’s electronic media communications from on or about 30 January 2015 onwards, which is the plaintiff’s electronic media communication prior to the first publication and notification date.

86. Imputation of the second publication: Unlawful conduct on behalf of the plaintiff through electronic media communications as to warrant police intervention. VC is a principal solicitor who has approximately 10 years post-admission experience.

87. The defendant’s second publication authorised Mount Druitt police station to publish a report on the second publication – report number is 58567655 (police record) on NSW police electronic filing system. Mount Druitt police did not take any legal action against the plaintiff due to the second publication.”


	
	The text of the first matter complained was attached to the Further Amended Statement of Claim, and is in the following terms:
	


“[Mt Druitt & Area Community Legal Centre Inc. letterhead]

9 February 2015

Ms Nancy Michail

[Plaintiff’s address]

	In accordance with the timetable of 16 April 2015, the defendant has provided a letter of objections (dated 11 June 2015), identifying many alleged errors in the pleadings, and seeking the summary dismissal of the whole of the claim.
	
	
	The defendant’s letter of 11 June 2015 is, however, unhelpful to the court, as well as to the plaintiff, in that it simply lists pleading errors and refers the plaintiff to the relevant Rules. The plaintiff has asked the defendant for a list of authorities in accordance with the case note, but in my opinion what should be provided are the facts and matters (as well as the authorities) in support of the application, hopefully in the form of written submissions.
	
	
	Pleading errors may lead to amended pleadings being filed, but are not of themselves a sufficient basis to strike out the whole of the claim other than in an extreme case. The defendant’s application will not be dealt with until a clear explanation of the basis for summary dismissal is sought. The plaintiff clearly has some kind of claim of employment (whether paid or unpaid) which is relevant to her legal career, and her claim will not be struck out on the basis of the current long and rather unhelpful letter of complaint.
	
	
	Having noted these problems, I set out what I see as the principal problems with the defamation claims as presently pleaded.
	


Pleading problems


	
	The defamation pleading is deficient in the following respects.
	


(a) Publication


	
	The first matter complained of is an email published only to the plaintiff. No claim for defamation may be made without publication to a third party: see Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law and Practice at [5,001].
	
	
	The text of the “second publication” referred to in paragraph 84 is not provided, and it is unclear what the relationship of this publication is with the electronic publications of 30 January 2015 (the texts of which are not provided). The plaintiff clearly has some idea of what was said, in that she pleads imputations, so she should set out what the matter complained of is likely to contain, and that will enable more precise details to be obtained through discovery (or subpoenae to third parties).
	
	
	The publication(s) referred to in paragraph 76 must be set out individually, and not rolled up, with details of the dates as well as the text of the matter complained of (to the best of the plaintiff’s ability). Imputations for each publication must be pleaded; the pleading of one rolled-up set of imputations is not permitted.
	
	
	Any claim for republication (in particular, in relation to further publications by the police) should be identified with precision. It should be clear whether any such claim is a separate claim for defamation or relevant to quantum only.
	


(b) Text of the matter complained of


	
	As noted above, only the text of the first matter complained of has been provided. Where the matter complained of is a slander, the plaintiff need only set out a general summary of what she believes to have been said, providing dates and persons.
	
	
	These publications should be identified in chronological order and the texts set out (marked “Annexure A” and following) in the amended pleading, with the imputations for each such claim numbered in alphabetical order.
	
	
	If there are identification issues (i.e. if the plaintiff was not named), the relevant particulars of identification should be provided.
	


(c) Imputations


	
	The imputations should be labelled from (a) onwards, and the plaintiff should plead meanings which have a defamatory sting. They should differ in substance: r 14.30(3) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”).
	
	
	Abbreviations, such as “serious misconduct”, are impermissible and should not be included.
	


(d) Damages


	
	Particulars of aggravated damages and, if applicable, special damages, arising from these publications (as opposed to the breach of contract claim) must be identified with precision.
	


General remarks


	
	The statement of claim generally should avoid discursive narrative of matters which are the subject of evidence. There should be no reference to malice, or long histories of ill will or arguments between the parties. If relevant, those are matters for evidence at the trial.
	
	
	When these matters have been attended to in a further amended pleading, any objections by the defendant to the form and capacity of the imputations may be dealt with. No defence need be filed to the claim until those steps have been completed.
	
	
	Careful pleading in accordance with UCPR r 14.30 is essential. The relevant principles are set out in detail in Ritchie’s Uniform Civil Procedure at [14.30.5] – [14.30.75]. Sample pleadings are provided by LexisNexis at http://www.lexisnexis.com.au/en-au/products/court-forms-precedents-and-pleadings-nsw.page (subscription required). The statement of claim for the proceedings Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd is set out in Australian Defamation Law and Practice at [60,000], which is accessible in most law libraries as well as online (subscription required).
	
	
	The defendant has other objections to the statement of claim, which will be determined once the pleading of the defamation claim has been resolved, and after correspondence between the parties concerning the plaintiff’s need for a statement of employment. Given the one-year limitation for defamation claims, correct pleading of the publications is a high priority.
	


Correspondence with the court


	
	Although these proceedings have only been in this court on one prior occasion, the plaintiff has, between 7 April and 18 June, forwarded 23 emails to my associate, some of which were not sent to the defendant. These emails were not in response to any correspondence from the defendant. The defendant had only forwarded one email to my associate, on 7 April 2015, inquiring about the applicability of the Practice Note (it should be noted that the Practice Note, prior to amendment on 3 June 2015, did not apply to proceedings outside the Sydney registry).
	
	
	In the course of her correspondence, the plaintiff has expressed concerns that the defendant has been corresponding with the court. Not only is this wrong, but it would be improper of the defendant to do so. No party to litigation should correspond with the court, other than for the purposes of fixing or altering a court date, without a court order to that effect, and copies of any such letters should always be provided to the opposing party. Any emails forwarded to my associate of this kind in the future will be deleted without being read.
	


Orders


	
	The plaintiff to file and serve a Second Further Amended Statement of Claim by 16 July 2015.
	
	
	Matter stood over for further directions in the Defamation List on Thursday 30 July 2015 at 9:00am.

		06 August 2015",2015-06-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766934,O’Reilly v Komatsu Forklift Australia Pty Limited [2015] NSWDC 130,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an action in the tort of negligence. The plaintiff claims work injury damages. The plaintiff was born in Ireland on 12 August 1966. He came to Australia as a baby in February 1967 with his family. His education was wholly in New South Wales. He left Sefton High School at the end of year 10, having obtained the School Certificate. He then obtained an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic. He completed that apprenticeship.
	
	
	Since then the plaintiff has advanced his qualifications as a motor mechanic and gained skills necessary to pursue his career as a mechanic. He obtained a certificate as a trade mechanic, a certificate as a diesel fitter, an engineering certificate and other ancillary qualifications such as a forklift driver, a crane chaser, a dogman, a crane driver and eventually the highest grade of driver’s licence which allows him to drive the largest trucks with the largest number of trailers that can be towed in this country.
	
	
	Between commencing his apprenticeship and 15 March 2007, the plaintiff has worked in his trade often doing very heavy work. He told me that, although he had a number of jobs, the longest period in which he was unemployed was two weeks. It is clear that the plaintiff has an excellent work ethic. He also has a wealth of experience in mechanics, mechanical engineering and diesel mechanical engineering. He has had many employers in different fields and has experience in many workplaces and in many different systems of work.
	


Liability


	
	In the current proceedings the plaintiff relies upon an injury which occurred to him on 30 June 2011. It is convenient for me to discuss the question of liability first. The plaintiff commenced working for the present defendant on 6 December 2010. Komatsu Forklift Australia Pty Ltd has its workshop in Sydney at 7 Welder Road, Seven Hills. According to exhibit A, the defendant also has offices in Darwin, Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane, Newcastle, Wollongong, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. It appears from the defendant’s stationery that it provides not only Komatsu forklifts but also PM truck mounted cranes and Baumann sideloaders.
	
	
	The plaintiff obtained with the defendant the position of a field service technician. The evidence discloses that at the workshop at Seven Hills the defendant has three tradesmen technicians and two apprentices and employs ten field service technicians operating from the same premises. The plaintiff was provided with a vehicle by the defendant, a HiAce van which he used for the purposes of his occupation and was also permitted to use for his private use, that is, not only going to and from work but, for example, he could use it on weekends if he so wished. The plaintiff’s base rate of pay was $28 per hour. His normal working hours were 40 hours per week and he gave evidence of working about two hours’ overtime each week. He was also given a tool allowance which averaged $35 per week and a clothing allowance which averaged $12 per week. Those extra benefits amount to $47 per week plus the value of the plaintiff’s private use of the defendant’s vehicle.
	
	
	The plaintiff would attend the defendant’s workshop regularly. He worked there one or two days on average each week repairing vehicles that had been brought from the field into the workshop. He also attended the workshop regularly to drop off invoices to the office and to collect from the store parts which he needed to effect repairs of vehicles in the field. The plaintiff would be advised of jobs in the field either on the mobile phone provided to him for use in the defendant’s business, but such use was restricted to work use, or he would be advised of jobs by facsimile transmission. No doubt he was also advised, from time to time, of other jobs in the field when he called in to the company’s office at the workshop.
	
	
	The plaintiff drew a sketch plan of the relevant part of the defendant’s workshop. It is exhibit B. The office was on a second storey at the front of the workshop. Technicians such as the plaintiff parked their vehicles at the rear of the workshop, reaching there from an access road. At one end of the workshop was the spare parts store. The bulk of the ground floor of the workshop, besides containing the spare parts store, also contained bays in which forklifts could be repaired as well as an area where new machinery was parked, presumably prior to sale. There was marked on the ground floor of the workshop, within the area occupied by the bays for repairing forklifts, a walkway. That walkway was along a wall at one end leading from where technicians parked their cars, past the area where new machinery was stored, and then along a pathway, which was at a right angle to the other pathway, to the entrance to the spare parts store. This clearly was an “L” shaped walkway.
	
	
	Photographs taken of part of the walkway, exhibit E, show the walkway to be marked with yellow paint. The photographs of the walkway before me were along the wall which separated the repair bays from the new machinery store. The photographs, exhibit E, were taken a day after the plaintiff’s injury on 30 June 2011. They clearly show the walkway to be at least partially obstructed, its being used to store things such as trolleys which would carry oxyacetylene bottles, hoses or cables, boxes, pieces of machinery or tools, items which may have been taken from machinery under repair, and a plastic post of the type often used to mark a danger.
	
	
	The mere fact that the walkway was partially obstructed on the day after the plaintiff’s accident indicates that the defendant did not ensure that the pathway was kept clear. In any event, the plaintiff told me that it was normal practice for him, and had been over the seven months he worked for the defendant, to walk through the repair bays to get to the spare parts store. He said that was the practice for him and for others. If the defendant required its employees to only use the walkway, then such a direction was not given to the plaintiff, and, if that were supposed to be the practice, it clearly was not enforced.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s accident occurred at about 8.15 in the morning. His working hours commenced at 7.30. The plaintiff initially thought, when giving evidence, that his accident occurred some time between 11am and noon but he was clearly incorrect in that recollection. He was prompted by learned counsel for the defendant as to what he did that morning and the suggestion made was that he attended a toolbox meeting, a safety meeting, which was held in the lunch room, which has also been marked on exhibit B, the sketch plan, and was relatively close to the spare parts store, underneath the office, on the first floor of the defendant’s workshop.
	
	
	It is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff must have made a number of journeys through the workshop before the journey on which he was injured. From where he had parked his van he must have journeyed through the workshop, one way or another, to get to the lunch room and must have returned, for some reason or another, to his van before then walking from his van through the bays where forklifts were repaired to go to the store. It was on that journey, which was obviously a third journey, that he sustained injury.
	
	
	An apprentice, Mr Scott Williams, was working on a forklift. He had taken from the forklift its accelerator assembly. Photographs of an accelerator assembly similar to that on the forklift in question are exhibit C. They are captioned “An accelerator and speed limiter assembly similar to what the Claimant alleges he stepped on”. They were provided to the plaintiff by the defendant. Not clear to me is the extent of the accelerator assembly, but it appears to be mainly the accelerator pedal and a plate to which it was affixed.
	
	
	Mr Williams placed the accelerator assembly, which he removed from the forklift on which he was working, on the floor of the bay in which the forklift was located. The plaintiff gave evidence on oath, which was not challenged, that Mr Williams was supposed to place such a vehicle part on a workbench. The position of workbenches is marked on exhibit B but that was at the commencement of a shift. That appears to be their usual storage place. The workbenches are portable and, when working on a forklift, the technician or apprentice moves the bench to be near him. That such parts were to be placed on a workbench is explicable in one of two or perhaps both ways. They are, firstly, that the part in question is not placed on the ground where it may be contaminated or soiled by rubber adhering to the floor or by oil or grease which has found its way onto the floor. On the other hand, it may be that the part which has been removed from the forklift is placed on the workbench in order not to contaminate the floor with any, for example, oil or grease which was adherent to the part. The floor of the workshop is of dark coloured concrete which has been painted with epoxy. Part of that floor can be seen on the photographs which are exhibit E. The epoxy coated floor appears to be some colour of off white in the photographs but clearly the epoxy has been obliterated in places or masked by things such as deposits of rubber, oil or grease.
	
	
	The plaintiff was making his way to the spare parts store and walked near where Mr Williams was working. The plaintiff told me that Mr Williams greeted him by saying, “Hello,” and the plaintiff replied by greeting him with the same word. The plaintiff told me that Mr Williams asked him a question but that he, the plaintiff, kept walking and stepped at the time onto the accelerator assembly, causing him to fall. An almost contemporaneous description of the mechanism of the accident was taken by Dr Clarence Foo of the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice on 1 August 2011. Dr Foo records this:
	


“He slipped on the accelerator assembly next to the forklift, bending his right knee backwards, spun 90 degrees and then hitting the ground.”

Another history, which goes into detail of the mechanism of the accident, refers to the plaintiff striking the workbench as he was falling to the ground. The inference to be drawn is that the workbench which the plaintiff’s struck was that which was being used by Mr Williams.


	
	In cases of this nature it is often necessary to remind oneself of well established law. I do so by referring to my copy of the second edition of Glass, McHugh and Douglas, The Liability of Employers, 1979, Law Book Company Limited. Chapter III considers the safety of premises in which an employee is required to work. Commencing at p 52, the learned authors say this:
	


“Under modern industrial conditions the place where an employee is required to work frequently exposes him to an avoidable risk of injury and actions for this type of breach of duty are very common. Thus, an action may be brought for injuries caused by a static defect in the premises, such as an unguarded hole or a raised projection; or by structural weakness such as a roof or floor which is insufficiently supported; or by some makeshift platform which proves to be insecure when stood on; or by some temporary obstruction over which the employee has tripped. Again, the action may allege that the place of work is unsafe because of some dangerous physical condition, such as oil or water or a live wire, which is superimposed on a surface normally safe. Or that it is unsafe because it exposes the employee to the danger of a fall over some unfenced drop or to the danger of being struck by some object which passes near the place of work, or to the danger or being attacked by a stranger.”

The next part of the chapter compares the employer’s duty to the duty of an occupier of land. The then law applicable to occupiers’ liability has now been “reformed” by the High Court of Australia. However, it makes clear that the employer owes “a duty to make the place of employment…as safe as the exercise of reasonable skill and care will permit”, relying upon Naismith v London Film Productions [1939] 1 All ER 794 per Goddard LJ at 798 and Cotter v Huddart Parker Ltd (1941) 42 SR(NSW) 33 per Jordan CJ at 37. The work then continues thus:

“The employer’s responsibility applies not only to the working site but to any premises which the employee uses in connection with, or in furtherance of, his employment, including approaches and means of access. It applies to the practice of maintaining a wooden box in position at the end of a platform as a means of access to it. It extends to all those parts of the premises where the employee may be reasonably authorised, required or expected to go. The expectation may be based not only on the normal course of conduct but also upon the exigencies of a particular isolated operation.”


	
	At p 56 the authors turn to the question of foreseeability. The relevant part is this:
	


“Thus, the plaintiff must tender evidence which shows that, in the physical condition of the employer’s premises, there existed a possibility of injury which was reasonably foreseeable. The evidence of foreseeability may be defective because it does not appear from the facts proved that the unsafe place was one where the employees were required to be or could have been expected to be. Again, if it appears that the collapse of the structure was due to a latent defect, viz a defect not discoverable by the exercise of reasonable care, there is no warrant for a finding that a foreseeable risk of injury existed. Further, the issue of foreseeable risk will not be discharged if the plaintiff does no more than prove the existence of a danger at the time of his injury. If the evidence leaves open the question whether the danger has just come into existence or whether it has been present long enough to give the employer means of knowledge, there is nothing to show a risk foreseeable by the reasonably careful employer. The kind of situation being specifically referred to is where the danger has come into being as a result of wear and tear so as not to imply any human agency or knowledge. If, of course, the danger, the duration of which cannot be proved, is due to human intervention, such as a pool of spilt oil, the employer can be charged with vicarious liability for the casual negligence of the person presumably employed by him who created the hazard on the premises and left it.”


	
	In this case, inter alia, the plaintiff relies upon the casual act of negligence of Scott Williams in placing the accelerator assembly on the floor of the workshop where others, such as the plaintiff, might step on it or trip on it. It is clearly contrary to the usual work practice. Mr Williams, as one who worked constantly in the workshop, must have known that people, such as the plaintiff, that is, other technicians and, indeed, the other apprentices, walked through the workshop bays. The plaintiff tripped because Mr Williams did what he did and did something which he was expected not to do, thus causing the plaintiff’s injury. This was a casual act of negligence for which the defendant is vicariously liable. Such is pleaded, in particular (g) of para 6 of the statement of claim:
	


“By its servant or agent leaving on the workshop floor an accelerator assembly for others to trip or slip upon.”


	
	The parties agree that I need not bother to turn to the provisions of the Civil Liability Act, in particular ss 5B to 5E in light of the finding which I have just announced.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	The remaining issue on the question of liability is contributory negligence. Contributory negligence is pleaded in the defence. The only particular of contributory negligence is “failing to keep any (or any proper) lookout”. In his submissions Mr Benson made no submission on the question of contributory negligence. That was adverted to by the learned senior counsel for the plaintiff, and that brought Mr Benson to his feet in reply. It clearly was a matter raised on the evidence. However, the law is clear that employees can, at times, conduct themselves with, what might be thought to be, a want of care due to momentary inadvertence or inattention. Indeed, that is why the law concerning the employer’s liability requires the employer to not only establish the safety of his premises but to maintain the safety of his premises, just as the employer is required to establish a safe system of work and to maintain that system of work. The system of work clearly was not being maintained by Mr Williams. The plaintiff was distracted, I infer, from the greeting given to him by Mr Williams, that must have caused him to look towards Mr Williams to return the greeting and perhaps he was listening to the question being asked of him when he trod on the accelerator assembly and fell. Furthermore, the plaintiff may have been distracted by keeping in his mind the list of items which he needed to recover from the store to which he was headed and in which direction he was obviously looking until he was distracted by Mr Williams’s greeting.
	
	
	However, the system adopted by the defendant, to which the plaintiff deposed and upon which he was not cross examined, was that the parts taken from forklifts ought to be placed on the workbenches and not on the floor. In my view, this is not a case of contributory negligence but of having his attention diverted from looking at where he was walking in the expectation that the floor would not be obstructed by parts taken from forklifts under repair. I reject the submission that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.
	


Damages


	
	I turn now to the question of damages. The extent of the plaintiff’s damages has been the main area of contention in the current proceedings. The plaintiff had a pre-existing, serious back injury.
	


Pre-existing back injuries


	
	Between 2003 and 2006, the plaintiff was employed by WesTrac as a plant and diesel mechanic and crane operator. On, it was suggested, 24 October 2005 the plaintiff injured his back whilst working for that company. I do know that he attended upon the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice on 26 or it might be 28 October 2005 and saw either Dr Foo or one of his colleagues. A history is recorded that the plaintiff was hit by a truck bonnet which fell from a vertical position some 3 feet onto his back, causing pain which had increased overnight. The date of the event given in the notes was 25 October 2005. On examination the plaintiff was found to be tender in the low back between L1 and L5 in the midline and the paralumbar area. Straight leg raising was restricted on the right to 45 degrees and on the left to 50 degrees by a complaint of increasing lower back pain. However, sensation in both legs was thought to be normal and the reflexes appeared to have been equal and normal. An X-ray was ordered of the lumbar spine and the plaintiff was prescribed physiotherapy and Nurofen.
	
	
	The plaintiff went back to the practice on 14 November 2005. He was found to be tender in the L4/L5 disc space. Straight leg raising on the right was limited to 60 degrees by increasing lower back pain. There was thought, however, to be no neural tension. However, the notes seem to indicate that the plaintiff had some complaint of paraesthesiae, that is, pins and needles, in his right leg.
	
	
	The plaintiff attended the practice again on a date early in December 2005 when he said that he was getting worse. The plaintiff told the doctor at the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice that he had been seen by another doctor who prescribed a bone scan. The plaintiff was then on nonspecific anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics. He complained of pain in his right leg and there was found to be some alteration of sensation in that leg. However, the reflexes appeared to be normal. The doctor noted that there was a reduction in pinprick sensation in the right L4 dermatome, indicating a problem with the L4 nerve root.
	
	
	The plaintiff returned to the practice on 5 December 2005 and on that occasion was prescribed Tramal, I assume as a painkiller, and was referred to Dr Matthew Giblin, an orthopaedic surgeon. Unfortunately, no reports from Dr Giblin from that time are extant.
	
	
	I have now had to rearrange the material before me because there are clearly notes made on 31 October 2005 and 7 November 2005 which were misplaced in the tender bundle. On 31 October 2005 straight leg raising on the right was restricted to 60 degrees, again by a complaint of increased low back pain but with no neural tension. On 7 November 2005 there is a complaint of right leg pain and paraesthesiae, which the plaintiff referred to as feeling like “a dead leg”. On that occasion, straight leg raising on the right was restricted to 60 degrees because of increased pain but, again, there was no neural tension sign. Straight leg raising on the left-hand side was normal.
	
	
	Notes made on 12 December 2005 indicate that Dr Giblin prescribed a cortisone injection, which was to be carried out on 13 December 2005. On 9 January 2006 the plaintiff told the general practitioner that he was improving and he was between 30% and 40% better. He told the doctor that he was feeling more confident. By this stage straight leg raising on the right was only restricted to 80 degrees, the left leg being the normal 90 degrees.
	
	
	On 14 January the plaintiff told Dr Foo or his associate that he felt good after an injection given to him by Dr Giblin, and there was a discussion between the doctor and the plaintiff about his long term prognosis. On 2 February 2006 the plaintiff told the doctor he felt a lot better but was still having some early morning pain. By that stage his painkilling medication had been reduced to Panadol.
	
	
	On 17 February 2006 the doctor noted that the plaintiff was starting to attend a gymnasium on that day and had started taking Celebrex at the request of Dr Giblin. Straight leg raising on the right was restricted only to 80 degrees by that stage but, again, there was no suggestion of any neural tension. There were further attendances upon the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice on 17 February and 3 March 2006, and then, finally, on 20 March 2006 when the plaintiff told the doctor he had seen Dr Giblin and was fit for a trial of his normal duties commencing on 15 March 2006. Presumably the plaintiff had, by that stage, done a week’s normal duties. There was no further attendance upon the practice until after the plaintiff’s injury with another employer on 15 March 2007.
	
	
	One can infer that the plaintiff was having some discal problem, perhaps at L4/5 or perhaps at L5-S1 with right sided sciatica after the injury of 25 October 2005. However, that problem seems to have resolved when the plaintiff returned to work on normal duties on 15 March 2006.
	
	
	In 2006 the plaintiff commenced working for WSN Environmental Solutions as a workshop manager, truck driver, crane operator and diesel mechanic. He sustained a major injury to his low back on the Ides of March 2007. The plaintiff was struck by a large diesel engine which was on the end of a chain slung on a mobile crane. The swivel mechanism of the jib attachment of the mobile crane was said to be defective because it was stiff and jammed. The mobile crane was being driven by another employee of WSN Environmental Solutions. According to a pleading, the plaintiff was struck by the engine as the chains from which the engine was suspended wound and unwound. The plaintiff was struck on two occasions.
	
	
	He was again referred to the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice, first attending there after this event on 22 March 2007. The plaintiff was again seen by Dr Matthew Giblin on re-referral by Dr Foo. Dr Matthew Giblin wrote a short report to Dr Foo on 10 April 2007. After thanking Dr Foo for referring the plaintiff to him, Dr Giblin said this:
	


“he had an acute exacerbation of his back pain once more with radiation down the right leg in the distribution of L5 and numbness in the big toe.”

Dr Giblin arranged for an MRI to be “repeated”, from which I infer that there had been an earlier one. Dr Giblin reported to Dr Foo that the more recent MRI showed desiccation of L4/5 and L5-S1 with quite a deal of facet arthritis. Dr Giblin thought that there was a small left sided L4/5 disc lesion with no significant nerve root pressure.


	
	Dr Giblin carried out facet blocks. In a report of 14 May 2007 Dr Giblin told Dr Foo at the time of a recent facet block the L4/5 joint reproduced the plaintiff’s symptoms but the plaintiff did not get relief from the local anaesthetic or steroid injected into the L4/5 joint which made the investigation “a little unclear’. Dr Giblin then, on 25 May 2007, decided to investigate the L5-S1 disc space and foramina. He suggested rhizolysis, which is a cutting of the nerves.
	
	
	The plaintiff was then referred by Dr Foo to Dr Balsam Darwish, a neurosurgeon. In a report of 22 June 2007 following upon examining the plaintiff on the preceding day, Dr Darwish said this:
	


“Today I explained to Sheridan that his symptoms in the right leg are most likely due to right L5 nerve root compression in the right L5-S1 foramen. The MRI scan was done in the supine position without loading and does not reflect the status when he is in upright position and carrying weight. I explained to him that decompressing the nerve in the foramen carries an 80% chance of improving his leg symptoms but probably will not have any effect on his back pain. I have advised him to continue with conservative treatment at this time.”


	
	However, at review on 19 July 2007 Dr Darwish recommended lateral discectomy, facetectomy, right L5 rhizolysis and an L5-S1 fusion. The plaintiff accepted Dr Darwish’s advice. The surgery was practised at the Sydney Southwest Private Hospital on 20 August 2007. The fusion involved the application of pedicle screws in the plaintiff’s spine. On 19 September 2007 Dr Darwish reported to Dr Foo that that led to a complete resolution of the plaintiff’s right leg pain. By 9 October 2007 Dr Darwish noted that the plaintiff was keen to get back to work. Again, on 6 November 2007 Dr Darwish noted the plaintiff’s right leg pain had completely resolved and that, on examination, muscular power and sensation were normal in both lower limbs.
	
	
	However, on 14 February 2008 the plaintiff told Dr Darwish that in the previous month or so he had developed a recurrent right leg pain reaching down to the right great toe. Dr Darwish said that it was in the right L5 dermatome. He thought that the recurrent leg symptoms were suggestive of scarring around the L5 nerve root. A further MRI done on 3 March 2008 was said to confirm that opinion. By that stage the plaintiff had started to go to a gymnasium.
	
	
	On 22 May 2008 the plaintiff’s right leg pain had completely vanished again and Dr Darwish expressed the view that in the long term he thought the plaintiff should look for a physically less demanding job. On 11 September 2008 Dr Darwish noted that the plaintiff was back at work doing six hours a day driving a sweeper and was managing that work quite well. However, he still had lower back pain and stiffness at the end of a day’s work. He also complained of getting numbness in the right leg. In his report of 11 September 2008 Dr Darwish made this comment:
	


“Follow up lumbo sacral spine CT scan on 24 July 2008 showed bony fusion across L5/S1 level. He has minor anterolisthesis at L4/L5 level with a small disc bulge not causing nerve root or cauda equina compression.” [My emphasis].

Dr Darwish recommended a further scan to assess the progression of the anterolisthesis.


	
	On 28 October 2008 the doctor noted the plaintiff had left leg pain; however, the distribution of pain was in the L5 dermatome, that is, it came from the L5-S1 disc. At that stage the plaintiff was working driving a sweeper six hours a day, five days a week. An MRI scan done on 17 November 2008 was said to show no evidence of nerve root or cauda equina compression at the L4/5 disc, although it remained desiccated.
	
	
	The left leg symptoms appear to have disappeared by 10 February 2009. The plaintiff was then seeing a psychologist, which Dr Darwish thought was a good idea, to help the plaintiff develop strategies to deal with “chronic back pain”. The plaintiff told me that he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at a relative young age and has been constantly treated for that condition ever since. One can understand that with chronic back pain that condition itself could be destabilised. On 21 April 2009 Dr Darwish noted the plaintiff was working 30 hours a week and “coping very well with that”.
	
	
	However, on 21 July 2009 the plaintiff told Dr Darwish that three weeks earlier he had an exacerbation of his lower back pain and developed right sided sciatica again and he had been off work for three weeks. Dr Darwish noted that the plaintiff’s pain specialist wanted to investigate the L4/5 disc and Dr Darwish supported that investigation. However, that investigation appears to have shown no obvious nerve root or cauda equina compression at the L4/5 level.
	
	
	As ought be clear from what I have earlier said, the plaintiff commenced proceedings in this Court, claiming damages under the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999. For that purpose he was sent to see a number of medical practitioners by his own solicitors and the solicitors acting for the then defendant.
	
	
	The first report following upon such examinations that I have is a report of Dr Peter Giblin of 20 November 2007 commenting upon his examination of the plaintiff on the preceding day. Dr Peter Giblin took a history of the injury in October 2005 erroneously recorded as November 2006 and the told Dr Giblin that he made a “95%” recovery from that injury and was able to get back to normal duties. Under the heading “Prognosis” Dr Giblin said this:
	


“This gentleman has a poor prognosis. He has the perennial and insoluble problem of a blue collar worker with a bad back which, is only going to deteriorate in a post traumatic fashion.

He will be subject to a domino phenomenon whereby the adjacent anatomical level to the [L5/S1] fusion, that is, L4/5, will progressively deteriorate and in due course, require surgical intervention. This may take the form of either a discectomy, or decompression/fusion.”

The current defendant lays much stress upon that opinion.


	
	The plaintiff was sent to see, by the then defendant, Dr James Bodel, a well known and respected orthopaedic surgeon. Dr Bodel first saw the plaintiff on 21 January 2008 and more recently on 10 November 2010. At his first examination Dr Bodel thought the prognosis was uncertain. When the plaintiff last saw Dr Bodel, that is, on 10 November 2010, the plaintiff was back at work for WSN Environmental Solutions. The relevant part of the history is this:
	


“He is now back at work following his back surgery and is currently working five hours a day, four days a week but is hopeful that with some further strengthening in the gymnasium he will be able to upgrade to five days a week. He is working in workshop activities only but in a different workshop although still at the same landfill site. He does not have to go onto the uneven ground or down into the landfill area.”

Dr Bodel noted the plaintiff’s then complaints as these:

“This gentleman has a constant dull aching pain in the lower part of the back. Prolonged sitting or bending and lifting aggravates the pain; and he has pain that radiates into the right leg and this is aggravated by prolonged sitting, bending, twisting or lifting. There is also numbness and tingling in the leg.”

Dr Bodel noted that the plaintiff was still continuing to take painkilling medication and was doing a home based exercise program. Dr Bodel expressed the opinion that the plaintiff would remain “incapacitated for his pre-injury work indefinitely”. He attributed that incapacity solely to the event of 15 March 2007.


	
	On or about the same day the plaintiff saw Dr Leonard Lee, a consultant psychiatrist, for the then defendant. Dr Lee’s report is of little assistance to me.
	


Settlement of an earlier claim


	
	The plaintiff settled his action against WSN Environmental Solutions. Judgment was entered by a judge of this Court but, unfortunately, the date of the entry of judgment has not been recorded on the documentation before me. Mr Lidden SC dated his signature on the terms of settlement on 30 November 2010. Counsel for the defendant did not endorse the date of his signature. It was suggested to the plaintiff and accepted that he settled the proceedings on 1 December 2010. The case was clearly settled some time between 10 November 2011 and the date of Mr Lidden’s signature being 30 November 2010, although judgment was probably entered a short time thereafter, when the matter came on for hearing.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind that the damages were claimed under the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999. Damages were recoverable for non-economic loss as well as economic loss, that is, for pain and suffering and loss of amenity of life, for out-of-pocket expenses both in the past and in the future, for past and future economic loss and a claim had also been mounted for past and future domestic assistance and/or attendant care and for loss of superannuation. The judgment entered was for $650,000 inclusive of costs but clear of workers compensation payments made to that date. Of course, it is impossible to separate out what part of that agreed lump sum was for what particular head of damage. The only thing that one can say is that there would have been some significant allowance for both past and future economic loss.
	


Plaintiff’s problems in 2010


	
	In 2010, the year in which the plaintiff both settled the earlier proceedings in late November and when he commenced working for the current defendant in early December, it is important to note the plaintiff’s complaints. That is why I have set out the complaints recorded by Dr Bodel. The plaintiff was still attending upon the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice and seeing, in particular, Dr Foo. It was suggested to the plaintiff that he saw Dr Foo on 40 occasions during that year; that suggestion probably contained hyperbole. Indeed, in submissions, Mr Benson reduced the number of attendances to 35, but even that appears to me to be hyperbolic. There are a number of entries recorded but a lot of them are merely for administrative purposes and recording things such as a nonattendance, and many of the attendances are upon a physiotherapist. Some of the attendances appear to be merely for the creation of documentation.
	
	
	On 8 January 2010 the plaintiff discussed with Dr Foo his medication. He was told to stop taking Panadeine Forte before there was to be a nerve ablation; that was carried out on 15 January 2010. On 25 January 2010 the plaintiff was again put back onto Panadeine Forte. On 2 February 2010 the plaintiff saw Dr Stephen Woolnough who noted that Dr Manohar, a pain specialist, had cleared the plaintiff to return to work. The plaintiff attended Dr Foo on 4 February 2010 and told him that the pain in his right leg had gone and the pain in the back was much the same as before and that the plaintiff could work four hours per day, five days per week.
	
	
	On 15 February 2010 Dr Foo referred the plaintiff to a swimming pool for hydrotherapy. On 15 March 2010, the third anniversary of the injury of 15 March 2007, the plaintiff told Dr Foo that he was a little better, had become more mobile since undergoing hydrotherapy and he had taken no medication for the previous three weeks. The doctor increased the number of hours in which the plaintiff could perform restricted duties. On 29 March 2010 Dr Foo noted that the plaintiff had improved overall, that he was sore after hydrotherapy in the morning but that that soreness was relieved by a warm shower. There was no leg pain, although the plaintiff’s sleep was still affected by pain, and the plaintiff was to undergo further sessions of hydrotherapy to be following by a gymnasium program.
	
	
	The plaintiff attended again upon Dr Foo on 12 April and told the doctor that he was in a lot more pain and was not feeling the best, but the doctor’s further comments of “no fever, no shiver” indicate that the plaintiff’s condition may have been thought to be medical rather than surgical. There was an attendance on 17 May 2010 but that was for pleurisy. On 2 June 2010 the plaintiff told Dr Foo that he was to start working at the gym in the following week and that his back was still sore, and the plaintiff’s assessment of the nerve ablation was that it had not helped him. On 24 June 2010 Dr Foo noted the plaintiff had gone to Melbourne on a holiday. The only thing that occurred on that day was a prescription of Panadeine Forte. The plaintiff had some form of assessment on 8 July 2010 which had caused the plaintiff soreness for a week. It appears that, during the assessment, the plaintiff hurt himself. On 28 July 2010 the plaintiff told the doctor that he was going to continue with his gymnasium program, together with the tissue massage, although he did not like massage itself. The doctor suggested the plaintiff try acupuncture and physiotherapy. There was an attendance on 5 August 2010 being merely to renew the script for Panadeine Forte.
	
	
	On 5 August 2010 the plaintiff started seeing Mr David Wei, a physiotherapist at the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice. Many of the notes recorded thereafter relate to attendances upon Mr Wei and often nonattendances upon Mr Wei. On 18 August 2010 Mr Wei appears to have commenced deep needle technique physiotherapy, or some form of therapy of a like nature, and that appeared to cause problems at times. There was an attendance upon Dr Foo on 30 August 2010 that merely concerned rehabilitation. Dr Foo noted the plaintiff was to resume physiotherapy and his gymnasium program.
	
	
	On 27 September 2010 the plaintiff saw Dr Foo and told him that he did not want any more physiotherapy. The plaintiff told the doctor that his view was his back would be the same with or without it and he would just learn to live with his problem, which he referred to as “not too bad”. On 17 October 2010 there was a complaint that the plaintiff felt as if he had been hit by a bus but that was because of the flu. On 21 October 2010 the plaintiff told the doctor that he was not bad, that he wanted to get back to working for 20 hours a week that he had again started his gymnasium program, and that he had lost his script for Panadeine Forte, which needed to be replaced.
	
	
	An attendance on 5 November 2010 indicates that the gymnasium program was causing soreness. On 18 November 2010 the plaintiff told Dr Foo that the gym and weather had increased his pain and that it took him a while to get out of bed and that he needed a medical certificate. Dr Foo then told the plaintiff to obtain a back brace for support and warmth. On 26 November 2010, around the time of the settlement, the plaintiff told Dr Foo that he felt as if he was “going backwards”; that appeared to be because of soreness undergoing the gymnasium program. The plaintiff did not then attend upon Dr Foo again until after the injury with which I am dealing, that of 30 June 2011.
	
	
	The evidence is that the plaintiff worked for the defendant for the best part of seven months from 6 December 2010 to 30 June 2011 without losing any time from work, without there being any complaint about his work as such, and there was no complaint made to him by anybody in authority about his work habits or work practices or the adequacy of his work, which was clearly heavy at times.
	
	
	The plaintiff maintained that he had made a complete recovery. I have to take that with a grain of salt because of the complaints recorded in 2010. What I do take literally, however, is the fact the plaintiff had recovered sufficiently well to be able to return to his normal work as a diesel mechanic/forklift mechanic/motor mechanic/field service technician. The fact that the defendant called no evidence about the plaintiff’s work performance or lack of it, and did not cross examine the plaintiff about his work attendance, indicates that I should accept entirely that the plaintiff did his normal work without any problem for the best part of seven months and almost seven months at that.
	


Effect of this accident on plaintiff’s back


	
	The plaintiff then had this injury with which I am dealing. Again, he was initially taken by those in authority at the defendant’s premises to Dr Knapik, who organised for a CT scan. He was then sent to see the Wetherill Park Occupational Health Practice where he saw Dr Foo on 1 August 2011. The plaintiff was referred back to Dr Darwish. According to Dr Darwish’s report of 25 July 2011, the recent MRI scanning showed a rupture of the previously desiccated L4/5 disc with compression of both the L4 nerve roots in their foramina, that is, compression both on the left and the right-hand sides. Dr Darwish recommended laminectomy, discectomy and extension of the fusion to involve L4/L5, that is, he wanted now to fuse the level above L5 S1. The insurer of the defendant authorised that surgical procedure. It was performed on 2 September 2011. With the benefit of hindsight it can be seen that that surgical procedure has failed, in that the fusion at the L4/5 level has not been realised.
	


Plaintiff returns to work with the defendant


	
	The plaintiff, with his usual devotion to his work, returned to work, he told me, in October 2011, one month after this major surgical procedure. He told me that he initially returned to restricted duties in the storeroom. He worked himself up from restricted hours on a restricted number of days per week to eight hours per day, five days per week. However, he had lifting and bending restrictions. He was then allowed to “go back onto the tools”, that is, to do a mechanic’s work, and he did so until August 2012 when he resigned. He resigned to go to Queensland. The decision of the plaintiff and his wife to go to Queensland was not due to “sea change” but because the plaintiff perceived that going to a warmer climate might assist him in recovering from the effects of his back injuries.
	
	
	The plaintiff last worked for the defendant on 7 August 2012. I know from Dr Foo’s notes that the plaintiff was cleared by Dr Darwish to return to working seven hours a day, four days a week, with a lifting restriction, on or about 4 June 2012, the date of Dr Foo’s consultation. However, the plaintiff told Dr Foo on that occasion that he was moving to Brisbane. The plaintiff had been on OxyContin, a morphine based medication. It was reduced on that day. On 4 July 2012 Dr Foo noted the plaintiff had been on holiday for three weeks and found a job in Brisbane and would be starting there in a few months’ time. The plaintiff told Dr Foo that Naprosyn was helping him and it had no side effects and he wanted to continue on that medication. The plaintiff told Dr Foo that he had “no problems”. The doctor then noted that the plaintiff hoped to be cleared for his pre-injury duties after next seeing Dr Darwish.
	
	
	On 16 July 2012 the plaintiff told Dr Foo that he had seen Dr Darwish who permitted him to work for five days a week for eight hours a day. On 8 August 2012 the plaintiff told Dr Foo that he was leaving for Queensland on 9 August and that he had resigned his work with Komatsu. The doctor decreased the number of Panadeine Forte that the plaintiff needed to take at that consultation.
	
	
	I have omitted to state what would be obvious to most lawyers, that it was a term of the plaintiff’s settlement withWSN Environmental Solutions that he resign his employment. He did. On 1 December 2010 he commenced the process of obtaining work with the defendant which he commenced on 6 December 2010.
	
	
	Not only was 9 August 2012 the date when the plaintiff was to move to Brisbane, it is also the date on which he saw Dr Michael Fearnside, a neurosurgeon, for his current solicitors. One part of Dr Fearnside’s history is this:
	


“After the operation he was off work for about six weeks. He then returned to work and has been able to upgrade to full time. When seen, he had recently resigned from Komatsu but until his resignation, he was working eight hours per day, five days per week with no overtime. Previously, he had relied on overtime to supplement his income. His wife did not work.

As a forklift mechanic, Mr O’Reilly worked ‘on the road’ frequently and was able to divide his tasks and if the pain was severe, he could stop the car if he was driving and walk around and have a stretch. He had resigned from Komatsu on 8 August 2012 and was moving to Queensland, a warmer climate where he hoped that his back pain would improve. He was intending to live with his family in Queensland and had been able to obtain work with another forklift family, Linde Forklifts. He noted that his symptoms were very much worse in cold weather and was hoping for a fresh start in Queensland.”


	
	It has to be borne in mind, when considering the plaintiff’s return to working 40 hours per week in his pre-injury job with the defendant, that he had only been working 40 hours for the defendant since he was cleared for 40 hours by Dr Darwish in July 2012. In other words, the plaintiff only worked his normal duties for 40 hours a week for about a month before he resigned from the defendant’s employment to move to Queensland.
	


Work in Queensland


	
	The move to Queensland has not proved to be the success the plaintiff had hoped. The plaintiff worked for Linde Forklifts Australia as a field service technician between 13 August 2012 and 26 February 2013. The plaintiff found the work for Linde to be getting harder and harder to perform. He needed to take more and more painkilling medication and he was taking time off work. He left that employment in circumstances not favourable to himself. He then obtained work with Metro Lift as a crane operator and dogman. He worked for that company between 4 April 2013 and May 2013.
	
	
	The plaintiff told me that he could not perform the duties asked of him which required, essentially, a long period sitting in the one chair. He resigned because he was unable to do the work. Later in May 2013 he obtained work with Clarke Equipment as a plant mechanic. He told me he worked there for four weeks. He was taking time off work and left “by mutual agreement”. That was, probably “resign or be sacked”.
	
	
	The plaintiff then obtained work with Qube Logistics as a nightshift supervisor. He thought he could do work as a nightshift organiser but, in fact, he was required “to do work with tools”. He was given two warnings about his work performance and asked to leave. He was unable to do work with tools as a mechanic. The plaintiff then obtained work with Bribie Island Coaches as a diesel fitter. He worked for that company between 8 July 2013 and 28 July 2013 but was unable to do that work and resigned.
	
	
	His penultimate work in Queensland was with Cleanaway, which he obtained through a recruitment agency known a Zippa. That work was as a diesel fitter. However, the work period was short, a period commencing in August 2013. The plaintiff thought he had been hired as a leading hand but, in fact, he was required to work as a mechanic. He took a lot of time off work and had to resign because he was not able to do the work. The work ceased in October 2013.
	
	
	The only other work the plaintiff attempted was a work trial with Torque Toyota at North Lakes as a “service advisor”. He was required to stand in the showroom of that car dealer to meet and greet customers and to drive them home when so requested. The plaintiff said that he lasted only four days in that work. The work was “not too good”. It required long standing which made the plaintiff’s symptoms worse. That four days’ work was done in June 2014. The work trial was arranged by the insurer of the defendant. It clearly was unsuccessful. The plaintiff has been unemployed since that time and has been paid weekly payments of compensation.
	


Failure of fusion at L4/5


	
	The medical evidence, in particular evidence from the plaintiff’s current treating neurosurgeon in Queensland, Dr Richard Laherty, is that the fusion at L4/5 has not taken. He recommends a further operation to revise the fusion in the hope of making the fusion take, that is, to make the fusion solid. In a report of 20 November 2013 Dr Laherty expressed this view:
	


“I would take the opportunity to remove the existing metalwork and re site screws in L4, L5 and S1, and in doing so use the new screws to facilitate reduction of the spondylolisthesis, I would plan to remove the cages which are in situ at L4/5. This surgery has previously been done as midline open procedure and I would use the same wound, although I have spoken to Sheridan about the muscle trauma related to this.”

Another report suggests that the “hardware” in the plaintiff’s back may be impinging upon his musculature, causing part of the problem and that the revision surgery proposed by Dr Laherty may remove that problem. The defendant, by its insurer, has refused to pay for that revision surgery which the plaintiff would like to undertake. The plaintiff cannot pay for it himself. He would have to borrow further moneys on his mortgage which he has grave difficulty in paying off at the current time. The plaintiff must support his wife and three children who are currently aged 13 years, 10 years and 1 year. I accept that the plaintiff cannot afford to have the treatment nor can any award of damages I make to him give him that money. Damages are limited under the legislation to economic loss only and not to out-of-pocket expenses either in the past or the future. The insurer’s refusal to pay for the surgery is perhaps best explained by Dr Michael Fearnside who believes the plaintiff should only have conservative treatment, doubts that the removal of the hardware in plaintiff’s back would help the plaintiff’s symptoms and believes that further surgery might unmask a hidden instability.


	
	There is currently some weakness of dorsiflexion and inversion of the right foot, altered sensation in the right L5 dermatome but no limb wasting and both ankle and knee reflexes are normal. The plaintiff has clearly had a recurrence of his L5 sciatica. That may have been caused by the second surgical procedure performed by Dr Darwish or be a consequence of a failure of the fusion or a further slipping of the L4 vertebra over the L5 vertebra, allowing the L4/5 disc to be exposed.
	


Plaintiff unable to work


	
	The plaintiff now cannot do any of the work which he has been trained to do or has trained himself to do. The plaintiff recently had a nervous breakdown but has recovered somewhat from that. I accept that the plaintiff is well motivated and would work if he could. He cannot. No one in the current proceedings suggested to the plaintiff any form of work which he could do, neither learned counsel for the defendant, not even I. The plaintiff left school with a school certificate some time ago. He has no clerical or computer skills. The best sort of work for the plaintiff would be work where he could sit or stand at will, move about at work at will, perhaps some form of clerical work, but that is not any work for which the plaintiff has been trained.
	
	
	Kallouf v Middis [2008] NSWCA 61 is authority for the proposition that the defendant bears at least an evidentiary onus to prove what an injured plaintiff could do as far as work is concerned and that such work is reasonably available to him in the labour market. The defendant itself can advance no suggestion as to what work the plaintiff can now do and what work the plaintiff has available to him, either if he had remained living in Sydney in Glenmore Park or what work is available to him where he currently lives in Rothwell in Queensland.
	


Economic loss - Past


	
	The plaintiff’s past economic loss has been assessed as being $147,256. That is calculated on the basis that the plaintiff’s pre accident income was $930 per week net and by accepting that the earnings of a comparable employee have, from 1 July 2011, been $1,000 per week net and that sum has been increased for each financial year since by the changes in average weekly earnings. Considering the fact the plaintiff’s net earnings were $930 per week, together with the $47 in two allowances I mentioned at the commencement of this judgment and the use of the company vehicle for private purposes, I accept that $1,000 is an appropriate sum to consider that the plaintiff would have earned but for injury between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2012. I accept that it is reasonable also to increase that amount by changes in average weekly earnings since that time.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s net earnings since 1 July 2011 have been averaged. That explains exhibit Q. I accept the plaintiff’s wage loss to date has been $147,256. I believe that to be the appropriate sum to award the plaintiff. There is no evidence that he is shirking or taking lesser paid work. I accept that he has done his best to mitigate his loss and I accept that, in essence, the plaintiff has actually been unfit for his pre-injury work since 1 July 2011.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s past superannuation loss is 11% of that sum, $16,262. It is agreed that the Fox v Wood component is $20,990. Workers compensation paid to date is no longer a pro tanto defence but will be deducted in any event from any judgment that I enter for the plaintiff by the defendant’s insurer.
	


Economic loss - Future


	
	The question remains, what should I allow the plaintiff for the future? The plaintiff claims $875 per week net until the age of 67 years. The multiplier is 646.2. The plaintiff does not claim that which is shown in exhibit Q as the comparable earnings at the current time, $1,075, but the sum of $875. The plaintiff has discounted the claim for future economic loss by $200 per week. That is a discount of 19.37%. If one includes the usual 15% discount for vicissitudes, the plaintiff is seeking a discount, in essence, of 35%. I accept that that is a reasonable way to proceed in this case.
	
	
	I cannot but comment that the observations made by Dr Peter Giblin in his report of 20 November 2007 to the plaintiff’s then and current solicitors, Messrs Brydens, is something that this Court regularly sees: that, if one operates at, say, L4/L5 and a patient continues to perform heavy work, that the level above will quickly degenerate, what Dr Peter Giblin described as the “domino phenomenon”. This is what has happened to the plaintiff.
	
	
	However, if the plaintiff had not returned to working for the defendant in his pre-injury work that would not have occurred or may have occurred at some much later age, such as age 64 or 67. The defendant must take the plaintiff as it finds him. It is clear from exhibit F, a preplacement medical examination questionnaire and report, that the defendant had drawn to its attention the fact the plaintiff had a lumbar surgical scar from lumbar spinal surgery. The plaintiff admitted to a “minor back injury” and the plaintiff accepted that he sought to downplay his condition in order to get the job, but the fact remains that the medical practitioner who examined the plaintiff on 1 December 2005 accepted there was a “crush of L5”, which may have intended to mean a crushing not of the fifth lumbar vertebra but of the lumbosacral disc. There is also a reference made by the practitioner to pain radiating at least as far as the right iliac fossa, which could indicate sciatica.
	
	
	In the circumstances there must be some further discount on the usual 15% because the plaintiff may ultimately have found himself in the position he currently finds himself, but when I look at a total discount of 35% I believe that to be reasonable. Future economic loss calculated on that basis is $480,611. Future loss of superannuation on that sum, 13% of it, is $62,479. The total of those sums is $727,686.
	


Order


	
	For those reasons I give verdict and judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for $727,686.

		23 July 2015",2015-06-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2766945,Colville v R [2015] NSWCCA 149,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: Mr Colville pleaded guilty in the Local Court in 2013 to one count of dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The offences arose out of a fatal motor vehicle collision on 9 December 2012 when the car Mr Colville was driving crossed over to the wrong side of the road and collided in a head-on collision with another vehicle. The driver of the other vehicle (Mr Chapman) died as a result of the incident. His wife, who was a passenger in the car, was seriously injured.
	
	
	Mr Colville was sentenced in the District Court on 4 June 2014, following a sentencing hearing on 30 May 2014.
	
	
	On count 1 of the indictment, driving in a manner dangerous to a person or persons occasioning death, Mr Colville was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 5 months, commencing on 4 August 2015 and expiring on 3 January 2019, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months expiring on 3 November 2017.
	
	
	On count 2 of the indictment, driving in a manner dangerous to a person or persons occasioning grievous bodily harm, Mr Colville was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, commencing on 4 June 2014 and expiring on 3 December 2016.
	
	
	The total effective sentence was thus 4 years and 7 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months. For each offence, Mr Colville was disqualified from driving for a three year period, those disqualification periods being cumulative. A further offence on a s 166 certificate of driving while suspended, to which Mr Colville also pleaded guilty, was found proved but no further penalty was imposed having regard to the punishment already imposed on the offences before the court on indictment.
	


Appeal


	
	Mr Colville now seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal from the sentence imposed on him on the following two grounds:
	


1.   Her Honour erred in her finding made beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender was sleep deprived with his level of fatigue exacerbated by the secondary effects of at least his methylamphetamine usage.

2.   Her Honour erred in rejecting the background material tendered in relation to deprived early childhood.


	
	The Crown did not oppose the grant of leave to appeal. For the reasons that follow, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed.
	


Ground 1 – finding as to sleep deprivation exacerbated by secondary effects of drug usage


	
	The collision occurred at about 11.28am on Sunday, 9 December 2012. A statement of agreed facts was tendered on sentencing, from which it can be noted that: at the time of the collision, it was daylight, overcast and the road surface and surrounding areas were dry; Mr Colville was travelling within the speed limit (which was 60km/h) and in a southerly direction along a straight and level road before entering a gradual bend to the east; there was one lane for northbound traffic and one land for southbound traffic; the lanes were separated by a painted double white unbroken line; Mr Chapman was travelling on the same road in a northerly direction also within the speed limit.
	
	
	It was agreed that Mr Colville’s vehicle crossed the double unbroken centre line markings and entered the northbound lane, the front of his vehicle colliding directly with the front of the vehicle driven by Mr Chapman. Witnesses did not see any braking prior to the collision and the only skid marks on the surface of the road were believed to be post impact.
	
	
	Mr Colville was semi-conscious after the accident happened. There was a dog in the rear seat of his car. When he recovered consciousness, Mr Colville asked a witness “[w]hat did I hit?”.
	
	
	The statement of agreed facts recorded that a witness driving 50 to 60m behind Mr Colville as he crossed a bridge over Fennell Bay (which is about 200m before the gradual bend) described seeing Mr Colville’s vehicle drift to the right:
	


it certainly wasn’t an erratic motion, but it started to move right towards the middle lines. I could see a line of traffic oncoming traffic heading north and I saw three vehicles move to their left within their lanes to give the station wagon a wide berth … The station wagon was still in his lane but had drifted right over to the centre lines, this happened over maybe a second to a second and a half. Then I saw the station wagon suddenly pull to the right and the front of the vehicle veered onto the wrong side of the road and into incoming traffic ...


	
	Paragraph 17 of the agreed statement of facts stated that:
	


There is no clear explanation for the vehicle driven by the offender crossing on to the incorrect side of the road. An examination of the offender’s vehicle discovered no mechanical defects. The surface of the road was in good condition, and dry. The offender was not travelling at a speed considered to be excessive by the other motorists who saw the collision.


	
	The agreed statement of facts also recorded that on 26 May 2013 Mr Colville had provided a typed version of events to investigating police, in which he stated that on the morning of the accident he had driven a friend from Noraville to Speers Point (from about 4.30am to 5.30am) and that the next thing he was aware of was regaining consciousness a couple of times when being treated by ambulance officers at the scene of the collision. Mr Colville also stated that he was aware that various substances were found in his system at the time of the accident and that “the last time I had taken any illicit substance was at least 24 hours beforehand, if not longer”.
	
	
	Annexed to the statement of agreed facts was an expert report from a clinical forensic pharmacologist, Dr Perl. Dr Perl analysed blood samples taken from Mr Colville at 1.35pm and 5.40pm on the day of the incident, as well as a urine sample taken at 5.40pm that day. Dr Perl identified various substances in Mr Colville’s blood samples, including methylamphetamine, diazepam and clonazepam. Dr Perl explained that methylamphetamine, generally referred to as “speed” (and in its hydrochloric form as “ice”) is an illicit substance with no legitimate therapeutic use; that diazepam and clonazepam both have therapeutic uses but are only meant to be available on prescription and are commonly misused by narcotic or recreational drug users; and that the presence of morphine in the blood could have been administered for pain after the collision but this was not probable given the presence of fentanyl (which is commonly used to treat pain in hospital).
	
	
	Dr Perl also explained the “biphasic” actions of methylamphetamine: the second phase, following the acute effects caused by the stimulation of the central nervous system, being dominated by “rebound fatigue and sedation”. Dr Perl said at p 2 of her report:
	


Following the stimulation phase, as the blood concentration of the stimulant decreases, there may be a reactive drug-induced fatigue stage when driving ability can also be impaired. During this stage the driver may experience drowsiness/sleepiness/fatigue, a slowing of reactions and impairment of perceptions and judgement.


	
	Dr Perl, relevantly, stated at [1] that:
	


Based on my specialised knowledge, and relying upon the above information, I cannot form a firm opinion that at the time of driving, Patrick James COLVILLE was under the influence of the drugs detected to the extent that his driving ability would have been impaired, but I cannot exclude there being some effects of methylamphetamine and clonazepam (and possibly morphine) which may have contributed to the collision.


	
	At [7], referring specifically to methylamphetamine, Dr Perl expressed the opinion that the circumstances of the collision and blood level of methylamphetamine “would suggest some impairment of [Mr Colville’s] vigilance and reaction skills which are likely to have contributed to the collision”. That opinion was preceded by the qualification that, in the absence of any information related to “the last use of methylamphetamine, regularity of use, absence of symptoms displayed by” Mr Colville, Dr Perl could not provide an opinion “beyond reasonable doubt” that there was impairment due to the methylamphetamine at the time of the incident. (Whether the evidence sustained a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt was not, of course, part of Dr Perl’s function as an expert to determine. However, reliance is placed for the applicant on this statement in the report as indicating the matters in respect of which Dr Perl would have required information in order to be able to conclude that the methylamphetamine had impaired Mr Colville’s driving ability.)
	
	
	Other material capable of shedding light on Mr Colville’s state of alertness at the time of the offence includes the reference in the Crown’s pre-sentence report dated 29 May 2014 to a statement by Mr Colville that he had last used illicit substances a few days prior to the offence and his claim that he had had “limited sleep” due to relocating from the Blue Mountains to the Lake Macquarie area. Mr Colville’s statement to the police in May 2013 referred to a ‘recent’ move to the Central Coast from the Blue Mountains, as did the psychological assessment report tendered by Mr Colville at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	That psychological assessment report, dated 23 May 2014, was based on a two hour “semi-structured interview and psychometric testing”. Ms Durkin, a clinical and forensic psychologist, recorded among other things Mr Colville’s account of his drug and alcohol history. That history included heroin use commencing from the age of 28 as well as use of “speed” and “ice” from that time. Ms Durkin records that Mr Colville indicated that his abuse of stimulants receded as his use of heroin increased. He reported that he had injected up to $1,500 worth of heroin per day for around 10 years but after a period of incarceration in 2010 his heroin use reduced to around $100 to $200 worth of heroin per day and this apparently was the level of his heroin use at around the time of the offence ([30]).
	
	
	At [38] of her report, Ms Durkin recounted Mr Colville’s account of the offence, including the following:
	


Around the time of the offence, Mr Colville advised that he was moving house, relocating to the Central Coast region in order to extricate himself from the drug using culture in the Blue Mountains where he had been residing. On the day of the offence, he said that he was in the process of moving his possessions to a new residence when the collision occurred. He stressed that it was unintentional and he stated that he has no clear recollection of what led to the incident. As such, he was unable to explain why he crossed over the middle of the road, causing a head on collision with the victims’ car. Mr Colville denied that speed was a factor in the offence, advised that he was feeling positive in mood about moving and he did not report being under the influence of substances at the time of the collision.


	
	The sentencing judge’s conclusion, having regard to all of the evidence concerning the crash, was that Mr Colville was driving his vehicle on the morning of the crash “in a sleep deprived state, with his fatigue exacerbated by the after effects of the drugs he had illegally consumed” (p 7 of the remarks on sentence). Her Honour referred to the statement made by Mr Colville to the police in May 2013 (see [14] above) that he had taken illicit substances “at least 24 hours prior to the crash” and inferred that he was in the second phase of methylamphetamine use and consequently affected by some degree of rebound fatigue. Her Honour went on to say (p 8 of the remarks on sentence):
	


Since the offender had a clear recollection of having had little sleep in the period immediately prior to the crash, it is reasonable on all of the evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he was sleep deprived, with his level of fatigue exacerbated by the secondary effects of at least his methylamphetamine usage. Plainly, the offender was on the road on this morning fully cognisant of his level of fatigue. He must have posed a danger to other road users throughout his journey that day, with the risk becoming manifest in the seconds before the crash.

and:

The manner of driving here is common to both offences and involves the use by the offender of his car when he was sleep deprived and so fatigued as to have been in danger of falling asleep on the road. He was aware of his level of sleep deprivation and doubtless aware that he should not have attempted to undertake the journey he took with such high levels of fatigue.


	
	Elsewhere, her Honour referred to Mr Colville being “in a state of deep fatigue” and being “sleep deprived throughout [the journey]” (p 9 of the remarks on sentence).
	
	
	Relevantly, her Honour did not accept Mr Colville’s submission that his offending conduct was of fleeting duration and the crash the result of momentary inattention, though she acknowledged that the portion of the journey spent driving either towards the centre line or on the incorrect side of it was of short duration (p 9 remarks on sentence).
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that, although Mr Colville’s conduct could not be described as an abandonment of his responsibility to others when using the road as a motor vehicle driver, his moral culpability was grave and much higher than fleeting error or misjudgement (p 10 of the remarks on sentence).
	
	
	Mr Colville submits it was not open to her Honour on the evidence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of the accident was sleep deprivation exacerbated by illicit drug use. Complaint is made both as to the finding of sleep deprivation per se and as to the related finding that it was exacerbated by illicit drug use.
	
	
	As to the finding of sleep deprivation, it is submitted for Mr Colville that the entirety of the evidence in relation to sleep prior to the accident was the statement in the pre-sentence report that he had had limited sleep due to relocating from the Blue Mountains to the Lake Macquarie area. It is submitted that this evidence could not provide a basis for the conclusion either of deep fatigue or that Mr Colville was aware of his level of sleep deprivation and that he should not have attempted to undertake the journey he took with such high levels of fatigue.
	
	
	As to the finding that Mr Colville’s sleep deprivation was exacerbated by illicit drug use, it is submitted that Dr Perl’s report made clear (at [7]) what additional information would be required in order to reach a conclusion as to the level of any impairment referable to the concentration of drugs in Mr Colville’s system after the accident (i.e., information as to the last use of methylamphetamine, regularity of use and symptoms, or absence of symptoms, displayed by Mr Colville). To the extent that there was evidence available to the court as to some of those matters, it is submitted that Dr Perl did not indicate in her report how those additional factors would impact upon her opinion as to impairment.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the findings made by her Honour were well open to her and that this Court is bound by the findings of fact made by the sentencing judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King [1936] 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 (see Keeley v R [2014] NSWCCA 139 per Johnson J at [76]). Reference is made to McBeth v R [2009] NSWCCA 235, where McCallum J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed, said (at [30]) that the Court’s power to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the sentencing judge arises only if the judge mistakes the facts in the sense understood in House v The King; it being necessary to establish there is no evidence to support the finding, or that the evidence is all one way, or that the judge has misdirected himself or herself. The basis on which this Court’s power to intervene in relation to findings of fact in this context is to be exercised has been comprehensively analysed by Simpson J (as her Honour then was) in AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 339, with whom Meagher JA and Wilson J agreed.
	
	
	The inference that Mr Colville was sleep deprived was one that was clearly open on the evidence. He had commenced driving that morning at about 4.30am, having on his own account recently had limited sleep due to his move to the Central Coast. There were no mechanical defects found in the vehicle. The road was in good condition and dry. It was a gradual bend in the road. Mr Colville was not travelling at an excessive speed and, significantly, he was not observed to have applied the brake in the second or second and a half in which the witness observed him to drift right over to the centre line (such that other cars had moved to the far left of their lane to avoid him) and then crossed to the right straight into the path of oncoming traffic. Nor were there skid marks to suggest that he had applied the brakes before the collision. There was no suggestion that Mr Colville had been distracted by anything inside the car (such as by using a mobile phone or turning his head to check on his dog); nor was there evidence to suggest that anything occurred outside the car to distract his attention. There was no suggestion that Mr Colville was afflicted by some condition of automatism or the like.
	
	
	The available inference (since it is not suggested that Mr Colville was acting deliberately when he crashed into Mr Chapman’s vehicle) is that when Mr Colville’s car drifted to the centre of the road and then crossed to the right (as the road was curving to the left) he took no action to correct the vehicle’s course and to avoid the head-on collision because of fatigue.
	
	
	As to the impact of recent drug use on Mr Colville’s state of alertness, it is accepted that there was methylamphetamine in the blood samples taken at the hospital. Mr Colville’s statement to the police placed the last use of “illicit substances” as being “at least” 24 hours prior to the collision (if not longer). His account to Ms Durkin of his drug and alcohol history includes the use of methylamphetamine as well as the use, on a daily basis, of heroin. Whether the methylamphetamine was taken 24 hours before the collision or sometime earlier than that, the fact is that the drug was still in his system at the time of the accident (and for at least six hours after the accident). (The toxicology report also confirmed, by reference to the concentration of diazepam in Mr Colville’s blood that he had used diazepam within the previous 24 hours, as well as the probability that the morphine or heroin in his blood was present at the time of the accident.)
	
	
	As noted earlier, Dr Perl’s report explained the secondary effects of methylamphetamine and concluded that the circumstances of the accident and the blood level of methylamphetamine suggested “some” impairment of his vigilance and reaction skills.
	
	
	The conclusion that Mr Colville’s driving ability was impaired to some degree by the effect of the methylamphetamine in his system was one that was open to her Honour having regard not only to the blood analysis but also to the circumstances in which the collision occurred (there being simply no reaction at all, it would seem, by Mr Colville to his car drifting across and then veering to collide head-on with oncoming traffic). True it is that it would not be possible on the basis of Dr Perl’s report to determine the extent or level of the impairment of his driving ability due to the presence of methylamphetamine but that does not mean that it was not open to her Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Colville was driving the car in a state of tiredness exacerbated by the secondary effects of methylamphetamine use.
	
	
	Her Honour did not err as contended by ground 1 of the proposed grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Although not raised specifically in the grounds of appeal, in his submissions Mr Colville also raises an issue as to procedural fairness in relation to the finding of sleep deprivation. Reference is made to R v Uzaabeaga [2000] NSWCCA 381; (2000) 119 A Crim R 452 in this context. It is submitted that her Honour provided no indication that she intended to sentence Mr Colville upon a higher degree of culpability than that contained in or disclosed by the agreed facts and hence that there was no basis procedurally for her Honour to find sleep deprivation and drug use as a matter of aggravation.
	
	
	In this regard, Mr Colville refers to the submissions made during the course of the sentence hearing. In particular, he notes that the Crown informed her Honour (30 May 2014, T 5) that:
	


The stark issue is that there is no satisfactory explanation as to why the vehicle driven by the offender went onto the incorrect side of the road and collided in a head on fashion with the vehicle driven by Mr Harold Chapman. …there is a reference in the pre-sentence report to the offender saying that he had had … some little sleep as a result of him moving locations. It is not further set out and it is not explored. There is simply no evidence that the offender fell asleep or that there was any degree of sleep deprivation.


	
	The Crown went on to discuss Dr Perl’s report and said:
	


The Crown can’t elevate the report of Dr Perl to a position where I can safely submit to your Honour that beyond reasonable doubt the collision is as a result of driving under the influence but I do say to your Honour that in terms of the charge of driving in a manner dangerous and where there’s no other satisfactory explanation on the evidence as to why the offender crossed on to the incorrect side of the road, it is a relevant matter for your Honour to consider. … the Crown says that just as an assertion of the offender having lost the opportunity to sleep might be considered, so should the report of Dr Perl (T 6).


	
	The Crown also pointed out to her Honour that there was no evidence that the offender was distracted by answering a mobile telephone or by the dog that was in the vehicle, and that none of the witnesses described the offender bending down or doing anything such as changing the volume on the radio or tending to something that may have fallen to the floor of the car. The Crown emphasised that:
	


It seems to be a case where your Honour needs to sentence simply on the basis that the offender, whilst driving a motor vehicle, allowed the motor vehicle to veer to the centre of the road over a period of a second and a half or so, to a degree that alarmed three oncoming vehicles who took evasive action and the vehicle driven by the offender then seems to have continued on the trajectory into the path of oncoming traffic until suddenly veering to the right shortly prior to impact.

…

In the Crown’s submission your Honour it can’t be classified as a case simply of momentary inattention or misjudgement. [T 6- 7]


	
	Having regard to the evidence and submissions made at the sentence hearing, the Crown submits that the degree of sleep deprivation of Mr Colville was a live issue during the sentencing proceedings and there was no procedural unfairness occasioned to Mr Colville since he had the opportunity to make submissions on that issue.
	
	
	In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs: ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; (2003) 214 CLR 1 (at [35] and [37]) Gleeson CJ noted that the real question in determining whether or not a party has been denied an opportunity to be heard is whether there has been actual unfairness, not whether there has been a disappointment because an expectation was not fulfilled or has been disappointed. The Crown submits that in the present case, submissions were made as to moral culpability by reference to the aggravating factors outlined in the guideline judgment of R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. Those included the degree of sleep deprivation, an issue that Mr Colville’s legal representatives addressed in their oral submissions (at T 11.20ff).
	
	
	The Crown points out that it is open for a sentencing judge not to accept submissions of Counsel and that the existence of agreed facts between the parties does not prevent proper inferences to be drawn outside the statement of facts (referring for the latter submission to Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 606).
	
	
	In the present case, the agreed statement of facts relevantly said no more than that there was no clear explanation for the vehicle crossing onto the wrong side of the road. However, facts from which an inference that it was due to sleep deprivation exacerbated by drug use (in particular the circumstances of the accident and Mr Colville’s blood analysis) were part of the agreed facts and submissions proceeded on the basis that it was for her Honour to determine what findings could properly be made on the basis of the evidence before the Court. Sleep deprivation and the secondary effect of methylamphetamine were matters raised in the material before the Court and Mr Colville had the opportunity to address thereon. No denial of procedural fairness has been demonstrated in this regard.
	
	
	Ground 1 is not made out.
	


Ground 2 – rejection of background material in relation to deprived early childhood


	
	As noted above, at the sentence hearing Mr Colville tendered the psychological assessment report of Ms Durkin. It was admitted without objection from the Crown. It therefore was not rejected in the evidentiary sense. Rather, it is clear that her Honour had regard to the report but considered that no great weight should be accorded to the account of Mr Colville’s childhood history having regard to Mr Colville’s unreliability as a historian and the fact that the veracity of that account could not be tested.
	
	
	At pp 10-11 in her remarks on sentence, her Honour noted that the offender had described a dysfunctional and violent upbringing with consequent disruption to his education but said that it was impossible to know if any of the history he gave Ms Durkin was accurate or reliable. Her Honour said:
	


Ms Durkin reports that the offender impressed her as a man of low but functional intelligence who was not particularly insightful and who was, in part, a reluctant historian. He was one of three sons born to his parents but he reported an unhappy childhood to Ms Durkin. He asserted to her that he was made a State ward at about the age of eight and placed in some sort of remand facility, despite having not been charged with or sentenced for any crime. The court simply has no way of knowing whether that claim could be correct or not.


	
	Her Honour also referred to Ms Durkin having recorded that Mr Colville had reported to her that his developmental years were punctuated by violence, neglect and an absence of proper education and family support. Her Honour noted that Mr Colville had not given any evidence of his personal antecedents and had called no evidence from any family member who could confirm his untested account of his early life; nor were any government records obtained as the time Mr Colville says he spent in the care of the Minister when a child. Her Honour then said:
	


The court has no means of assessing the veracity of the history the offender provided to Ms Durkin. One matter of which he gave account to Ms Durkin, his now greater respect for the law and the greater care with which he says he drives a motor vehicle, is disproved by the objective evidence of the offender’s traffic record. That fact does not suggest the offender is necessarily a truthful or an accurate historian. Accordingly, I am unable to give Ms Durkin’s report and opinion any great weight.

Specifically, the court cannot accept the offender’s submission that his moral culpability for these offences is reduced in the way referred to in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37, or that it militates in favour of amelioration of the sentence to be imposed upon him.


	
	Mr Colville submits that her Honour’s reasoning followed a misapprehension of the principles espoused in R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 concerning the reliance upon untested histories in areas of controversy. In Qutami, Smart AJ emphasised that great caution would be exercised in respect of the weight, if any, given to statements made by prisoners to experts such as psychiatrists and psychologists where there is no evidence given by the prisoner and that in many cases only very limited weight could be given to such statements ([58]-[59]). More recently, in Keeley v R [2014] NSWCCA 139, Johnson J referred to Qutami when holding that it was correct for the sentencing judge to give very limited weight to unsworn and untested statements made by the offender to the psychiatrist and psychologist (at [78]).
	
	
	In this regard, Mr Colville points to his criminal record, which was in evidence before her Honour and which showed intervention by the juvenile courts; the statement in the Crown’s pre-sentence report that he had ceased his formal education at year eight and had described a sporadic history of employment since that time; and his commencement of the use of cannabis at the age of eight and amphetamines in adolescence. However, the matters to which her Honour referred in the context of her observations as to the untested accounts given by Mr Colville of his early life went to matters not evident on the face of the material going to his juvenile criminal record and early use of drugs. There was nothing, for example, by reference to which her Honour could test the veracity of the account given by Mr Colville of his experience of violence and neglect; nor of his claim to have been made a ward of the State and his experience as such.
	
	
	Given that Mr Colville’s own psychologist referred to him as a reluctant historian, lacking in insight and inconsistent in his explanation at times, and there was an obvious example of Mr Colville’s unreliability as a historian by reference to his claim now to have a greater regard for the law, her Honour did not err in concluding that she was unable to know if any of the history he had given to Ms Durkin as to his developmental years was accurate or reliable.
	
	
	Mr Colville nevertheless maintains that this is another area where he was not accorded procedural fairness. It is submitted that the Crown identified that part of the report dealing with his childhood history as evidence that it would not challenge and hence that if the sentencing judge was going to reject that part of the report, on the basis of it not being supported by evidence, there was a positive obligation on the part of her Honour to raise that issue.
	
	
	On this aspect of ground 2, Mr Colville points to what was said by the Crown in closing submissions in relation to Ms Durkin’s report. At T 7, the Crown said:
	


In terms of the psychological report that’s available to your Honour, it is not supported by way of any sworn evidence. There is a personal history some of it pointing towards a childhood and upbringing that certainly would suggest that the offender was significantly disadvantaged. As a general proposition, I don’t seek to cavil with that. (my emphasis)


	
	The Crown drew her Honour’s attention to particular paragraphs of the report about which it was said that if they were to be given any weight they needed to be supported by sworn evidence ([30], [31], [33], [34], [36], [38], [39] and [40]). In so doing, the Crown seems to have identified these as statements which were directly proximate to the offending conduct. The statements as to his early childhood were not so identified. The Crown notes that Mr Colville’s written submissions at the sentence hearing themselves eschewed any causal relationship between the offences and his upbringing (referring to the submissions on sentence at [17]).
	
	
	Mr Colville submits that the statement made in the sentence hearing that, as a general proposition, the Crown did not seek to cavil with the personal history contained in the report meant that there was no controversy as to the proposition that he was significantly disadvantaged as a child, thus making it incumbent on her Honour, if she proposed to give it little weight because it was untested, to draw this to his attention.
	
	
	The Crown’s response is that the statement extracted above did not mean that there was a complete adoption of the version of events recounted by Mr Colville to Ms Durkin; rather, the Crown had sought to concentrate on those aspects of his history which could be said to be causally connected with his offending per se.
	
	
	Mr Colville’s submission as to a denial of procedural fairness seeks to draw more from the way in which the Crown approached the report in submissions than is warranted. What the Crown indicated, in the extract set out above, was that it conceded that the personal history “pointed to” a childhood and upbringing that “would suggest” there was a significant disadvantage. The Crown made no concession that there was a significantly disadvantaged childhood/upbringing. The position was thus left that it was a matter for her Honour to decide what weight should be put to Mr Colville’s unsworn and untested account of his childhood. The caution with which such history is approached has been made clear in the authorities to which I have earlier referred and of which it is not suggested Mr Colville’s legal representatives were aware.
	
	
	Ground 2 is not made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	Her Honour’s assessment of the moral culpability of the offending has not been shown to be in error. It was open to her Honour to infer that sleep deprivation exacerbated by the secondary effects of the illicit substances that were in Mr Colville’s system was the cause of Mr Colville’s failure to keep his car on the correct side of the road; and that this was neither a fleeting moment of inattention (as was submitted at the sentence hearing) nor an unexplained accident (as Mr Colville submits in this Court it was). Mr Colville must have known, when he commenced his car journey, how much or how little sleep he had actually had and what drugs he had taken and when. On the scale of moral culpability, her Honour did not find there had been an abandonment of responsibility on Mr Colville’s part but that his moral culpability was grave. I agree. No error in sentencing has been established. Leave should be granted and the appeal dismissed.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with Ward JA.

		19 June 2015",2015-06-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2766948,TA v R [2015] NSWCCA 151,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The applicant (“TA”) was convicted by a jury in August 2013 of sexual assault against the complainant (his wife, “NA”). He seeks leave to appeal against those convictions, leave being required pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 since the ground of appeal relied upon does not involve questions of law alone (Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]). He also requires an extension of time for the filing of his application for leave to appeal, which is opposed by the Crown.
	
	
	TA was tried in the District Court on an indictment in which there were nine counts, eight of which related to conduct against his wife (one relating to possession of a prohibited weapon without a permit). The jury returned a verdict of guilty on two of the nine counts (counts 6 and 8). The sole ground of appeal pressed in this Court is that the convictions on those two counts are unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act having regard to TA’s acquittal in respect of one of the seven remaining counts on which he was found not guilty (count 5).
	


Application for extension of time


	
	An affidavit sworn by TA’s solicitor, Mr Juweinat, was read in support of the application for an extension of time to file the notice of application for leave to appeal. In that affidavit there was no explanation for the initial delay between TA’s conviction on 6 August 2013 and May 2014, when an extension was granted to extend the time for filing of a notice of intention to appeal. Counsel appearing for TA in this Court informs the Court that the matter was assigned by Legal Aid in November 2013 and that the delay was not attributable to TA but there is no way of knowing what the explanation for it might be other than that Mr Juweinat has deposed that the grant of the initial extension was on the basis that the entire transcript was not available to his office at that stage. In any event, that extension expired in July 2014. TA’s solicitor has deposed that, due to an administrative error, the filing of a further extension (by which he presumably means an application for a further extension of time) was overlooked.
	
	
	Once the transcript was received (there is no indication when that was other than that it must have been before September 2014 when Counsel’s advice was obtained), Mr Juweinat sought Counsel’s advice on the merits of an appeal. That advice was received in late September 2014. Mr Juweinat has deposed that one possible ground of appeal advised by Counsel was that of competence of the Counsel appearing at trial and that he was advised that he needed to take certain instructions from TA (as to what advice was given to him about giving evidence in the proceedings) before relying upon the competence ground of appeal. Mr Juweinat was unable to take “sound instructions” from TA until December 2014. He says that he received Counsel’s revised submissions on 16 February 2015 but due to personal difficulties had been unable to file the appeal in late February 2015. The notice of application for leave to appeal was finally filed on 4 March 2015.
	
	
	I will consider the application for leave to appeal and for an extension of time for the filing of the requisite notice after addressing the merits of the appeal.
	


Crown case at trial


	
	It was the Crown case that TA sexually abused and assaulted his wife over a period of years from 2000 until November 2011 when she left him, taking with her their four children. NA first complained to the police after she had left her husband.
	
	
	TA was charged with nine offences: five counts of sexual intercourse without consent knowing that NA was not consenting, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (counts 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8); one count of an offence of possession of prohibited weapon without permit, contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapon`s Prohibition Act 1998 (count 3); one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act (count 4); and two counts of assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act (counts 7 and 9).
	
	
	The conduct the subject of count 5, on which TA was found not guilty, was alleged to have taken place between 31 December 2010 and 1 March 2011. The conduct the subject of counts 6 and 8 took place after that (between 30 April 2011 and 1 September 2011 for count 6 and between 31 July 2011 and 10 August 2011 for count 8). The conduct alleged in counts 7 and 9 was conduct occurring at the conclusion of the offences the subject of counts 6 and 8 respectively.
	
	
	As noted earlier, the jury returned guilty verdicts on counts 6 and 8. TA was sentenced on count 6 to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months, commencing on 16 July 2013 and expiring on 15 January 2015. On count 8, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 16 January 2014 and expiring on 15 July 2015 and the balance of term expiring on 15 January 2017.
	


Defence case at trial


	
	TA, as was his right, did not give evidence in the proceedings. The defence case, as put through the cross-examination of NA, was that NA had either made up the incidents or that the intercourse was consensual and she had fabricated the allegations of lack of consent, or her allegations of communicating her lack of consent to TA. It was suggested that NA had made the complaints to the police in order that two of the couple’s children (who had been taken from her by TA in the intervening period) be returned to her care and to ensure that she retained the custody and care of all of their children.
	


Ground 1 – unreasonable convictions by reason of inconsistency


	
	The sole ground of appeal, amended to reflect the manner in which it was confined during oral submissions by TA’s Counsel, is that:
	


1.   The convictions of the appellant in relation to counts 6 and 8 are, in the light of the appellant’s acquittal in respect of count 5, unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.


	
	In MFA v The Queen ([2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606), the High Court analysed the legal principles to be applied where the complaint is that the verdict is unreasonable and confirmed that unreasonableness is determined according to the test articulated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-494, namely, whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (see also: Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 56; (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 452). In MFA v The Queen, Gleeson CJ and Hayne and Callinan JJ said (at [35]) that this test “must be applied in deciding whether a conviction on one or more counts of sexual offences, when the accused was acquitted on other counts, is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”.
	
	
	In TK v R ([2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299) Simpson J (as her Honour then was), with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed, suggested (at [135]) that where the circumstance said to create the unreasonableness of the verdict is inconsistency:
	


… [t]he issue is not only whether the verdict was open “upon the whole of the evidence”. It is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on one or some counts, whatever (if anything) can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals, and whatever insight can be gained into the jury’s thinking and reasoning. It is only where the only reasonable explanation for the acquittals is doubt about the complainant’s veracity that an appellate court would be obliged to take the approach taken in Jones (and in Norris). (emphasis as per original)


	
	Her Honour emphasised (at [136]) the caution that an appellate court ought exercise before concluding that the explanation for differential verdicts is compromise, since inherent in such a conclusion is the further conclusion that the jury has acted contrary to its duty and to the instruction it has been given. Her Honour noted that the criminal justice system depends upon its faith in juries adhering to their obligations, as explained to them, and acting in conformity with those obligations.
	
	
	In Dungay v R; R v Dungay [2010] NSWCCA 82, Giles JA (RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreeing) considered what had been said by Simpson J in TK v R and said (at [11]-[12]):
	


It is not necessary to explore whether there is truly an addendum to the test derived from M v The Queen, or only an additional dimension within that test. Consistency or inconsistency of verdicts will always come down to what was open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence. Examination of the evidence, with an appreciation of how it was presented and left to the jury, will reveal whether there is a rational explanation for a verdict of guilty on one count and a verdict of not guilty on another count. In MFA v The Queen, for example, it was held at [36] that there was an explanation in the evidence of the differences between the verdicts, and that it was therefore open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of guilt on two counts notwithstanding unwillingness to convict on the other counts.

If a rational explanation can not (sic) be discerned, it can be said that it was not open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in coming to the guilty verdict, or it can be said that there was otherwise a miscarriage of justice. The formulation will rarely be of moment, and is not in the present case. Ultimately, as Wood CJ at CL pointed out in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [237], on reviewing the entirety of the case the court may maintain a comfortable satisfaction as to the guilty verdict upon the evidence separately considered concerning it.


	
	In Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; (2011) 210 A Crim R 326, Johnson J said (at [35]) that the focus of enquiry, where an unreasonable verdict ground is said to be supported by a claim of inconsistent verdicts, is upon whether there is any explanation for an acquittal, not for a conviction. His Honour there noted (at [36]) that it is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction would be set aside (citing Dungay v R; R v Dungay at [22]; Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [57]-[81]).
	
	
	In the present case, having regard to the narrowed scope of the sole ground of appeal sought to be raised, it is necessary to consider the conduct alleged in count 5 and to see whether there is a rational explanation for the acquittal on that count but not on counts 6 and 8.
	
	
	At the outset, I note that there was no complaint as to the directions given by the trial judge. His Honour correctly directed the jury on two occasions (in his summing up both on 2 and 5 August 2013) that: they must make a decision on each of the charges separately and only in relation to the evidence concerning that offence; that (in accordance with R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82) if they had a concern about the credibility and reliability of the complainant, and that led them to returning a verdict of not guilty in respect of one count, then it would be essential that they give consideration and weight to that when considering another count in the indictment; and (in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12) that they should approach with caution and scrutinise carefully the evidence of the complainant, given that she was the sole source of the complaints. His Honour also made reference to the aspects of NA’s evidence that the defence maintained significantly called into question her reliability (see summing up at pp 51-55).
	


Conduct the subject of the respective counts


	
	Counts 1, 2 and 4, which TA does not suggest are inconsistent with the guilty verdicts on counts 6 and 8, related to allegations of sexual intercourse without consent in 2000, 2004 and the second half of 2010, respectively. Count 4, which again is not relied upon by TA as an inconsistent verdict, related to an allegation that TA had touched NA on her left thigh with a Taser-like object when in the family car on an occasion in the second half of 2010. Counts 7 and 9 were of physical assaults following the intercourse the subject of counts 6 and 8. Again, the not guilty verdicts on those counts are not said to be inconsistent with the guilty verdicts on counts 6 and 8.
	


Count 5


	
	The conduct, the subject of this count, like that in counts 6 and 8, was of sexual intercourse without consent knowing that there was a lack of consent.
	
	
	The incident was alleged to have taken place between 31 December 2010 and 1 March 2011 in the family home when NA was folding the washing in the bedroom with her back to the door and the children were in the lounge room. She said that TA came into the room and forcibly shut the door; that he was “smirking”; and that when she turned her back to him TA came behind her, put his hand around her waist and pulled her to him. She said that she could feel TA’s erect penis pressing onto her buttocks; that he pulled her pants and underwear down; and that she resisted, using her right hand to pull her pants back up and telling him “Don’t. Don’t do it”. She said that TA said “I’ll be quick” and she said “The children will hear”. NA said that she continued to hold onto her pants trying to keep them up as TA pulled them down; that he pushed her, bent her over the chair and forcibly engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse. NA said that she told him it hurt her and that the children would hear. She said that then she could feel her vagina tearing. She said it continued for a couple of minutes before TA became angry and thrust harder. She said she told him again that she did not want to do it and that he “withdrew himself because I didn’t show any signs of pleasure” and pushed her onto a chair; her right hand caught the window ledge and her head hit the window and the blinds.
	
	
	In cross-examination, NA accepted that in her statement to the police she had used the word “smiling” not “smirking” to describe TA’s expression and that she had attributed to him the words “come on, come on” rather than “I’ll be quick”. She also accepted that in her statement to the police she did not mention her vagina tearing.
	
	
	Relevantly, for present purposes, NA said in cross-examination that during the incident TA was wearing “church clothing” featuring the “square and compass”. She agreed that, under the tenets of the Mormon faith, it would be offensive to wear those garments while engaging in the alleged act. She also agreed in cross-examination that she had a concern about being seen by the children but she denied that this was her only concern.
	


Count 6


	
	Count 6 was an incident occurring between 30 April 2011 and 1 September 2011.
	
	
	NA’s evidence was that on an occasion in the cooler middle part of 2011 she went to bed in the very early hours of the morning around 2am to 3am. As she got into the bed she felt that she had disturbed TA’s sleep. He put his arm around her and pulled her towards him such that her back was touching the front of his body. She was wearing a long t-shirt style nightie, tights and underwear. TA began to pull down her pants and underwear. She said “I don’t want to, I’m tired” but TA continued to pull her pants down and climbed on top of her, turning her body so that she was lying on her back. TA straddled her with his knees on either side of her legs and began trying to force his penis into her vagina; he then placed his right knee in between her legs followed by his left leg forcing them apart. NA said that throughout this she said “I don’t want to”. TA engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse for about five minutes and ejaculated. She said that she ended up lying sideways across the bed with her head off the mattress looking backwards towards the blinds and she could see the street light; TA was still sitting on top of her with his legs positioned outside of her thighs. NA said she was quietly crying and that TA asked “what’s wrong” and she said “nothing”. She said that as TA went to get off he kneed her with his right knee (this was the subject of count 7) and he said “I should have gone to a prostitute”.
	
	
	NA agreed that her police statement only referred to her saying “No, I’m tired”. It was suggested to her that, if she was kneed by TA, it was purely accidental as he rolled off her.
	


Count 8


	
	Count 8 was an incident occurring between 31 July 2011 and 10 August 2011, three or four days prior to when NA was scheduled to have surgery to remove her right ovary. She suffered from endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome. In the lead up to the surgery NA was in a lot of abdominal pain.
	
	
	Count 8 occurred during the night at around about the same time as the offence in count 6. NA was wearing the same style of nightie and underwear. TA pulled her underwear down with his hand and used his foot to push them down to her ankles. She unsuccessfully tried to pull her underwear up. She told him “I don’t want to. I am in pain”. TA climbed on top of her and knelt between her legs with his hands close to her upper arms. He engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse. She told him “I don’t want to” two or three times. She said that during this time her head was banged up against the bed head and she was crying and sobbing. She also said that it was excruciatingly painful as she had an inflamed pelvis which made sexual intercourse very painful. She said that TA ejaculated and got off her and then forcibly kicked her in between her calf muscle and her knee with his right leg (the kick being the subject of count 9).
	
	
	In cross-examination NA said that, prior to the incident, when she became aware of her endometriosis and the fact that she needed to have an ovary removed, she had a conversation about that with TA. She said he knew of her condition. There was then the following exchange in cross-examination:
	


Q.   It’s possible, isn’t it, that there was an agreement between you that there would be no sex in that fashion until such time as you were fully recovered?

A.    Yes.

Q.    That’s in fact what happened, wasn’t it?

A.    No.


	
	In relation to each of counts 5, 6 and 8, NA denied the possibility that she did consent and denied the possibility that she did not communicate a lack of consent. NA agreed that she was upset that her husband had taken two of the children home with him on New Years’ Day in 2012 and that she wanted the children returned to her care. She also agreed in cross-examination that she did not raise any complaint regarding the allegations with police until 4 January 2012. She denied that the whole case was about allegations made to the police that were designed to get her children back without having to go through the Family Court.
	


Applicant’s submissions


	
	TA submits that NA’s evidence in relation to count 5 did not lack any more detail than counts 6 and 8 which might have given the jury reason to pause. He submits that all of the counts were described by the complainant in a “fairly general fashion” and therefore, once the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the veracity and accuracy of her evidence on count 5, the jury must reasonably have harboured similar doubts in relation to counts 6 and 8.
	
	
	He points out that in relation to count 5 (as was also the case in counts 6 and 8) there was no other forensic or corroborative evidence; the case being solely reliant on NA’s evidence. It is submitted that a finding of not guilty on count 5 could only have come about as a result of the rejection of the complainant’s evidence because it lacked credibility.
	
	
	It is further submitted that on one view the strength of the Crown case on count 5 was stronger than that on count 6 because, in evidence in chief in respect to count 6, NA provided some evidence that TA may have lacked knowledge as to her absence of consent in that she said that, after the alleged sexual assault, he had asked her what was wrong.
	
	
	TA’s complaint is that once the jury found NA’s evidence lacked sufficient credibility to convict on count 5, it is impossible to understand why the jury chose to accept her evidence about the alleged acts of sexual intercourse in relation to counts 6 and 8.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown places emphasis on the evidence given by NA as to the agreement that they would not have sexual intercourse until she was fully recovered from her forthcoming operation as probative both of NA’s lack of consent and of TA’s knowledge of her lack of consent to sexual intercourse. It was submitted that it was open for the jury to consider that the agreement was in existence at the time of the incident in count 6 as well as count 8, due to the time frame of both counts, and for the jury to have concluded that TA was well aware that the act of sexual intercourse at that time was something that caused NA extreme pain and that he had agreed not to have sexual intercourse with her from the time she was diagnosed with endometriosis until after she had recovered from surgery.
	
	
	The Crown notes that there were only minor inconsistencies between NA’s evidence and her earlier statement to the police; that she had provided more detailed and persuasive evidence as to the lack of consent in relation to those counts than in relation to the other alleged sexual assault counts; and that on NA’s evidence she clearly expressed her lack of consent from the beginning rather than withdrawing consent part way through the sexual acts.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the not guilty verdict on count 5 (and the other counts) is reflective of the jury’s compliance with judicial directions and not solely or principally attributable to doubt about NA’s credibility. In particular, reference is made to the evidence given by NA as to TA wearing “Church clothing” during the alleged sexual assault the subject of count 5.
	


Determination


	
	The relevance of the agreement to abstain from sexual intercourse until NA’s medical condition had been treated and she had recovered from the surgery scheduled for 10 August 2011 is that it provides a rational basis for, and corroboration of, NA’s evidence that she did not consent to sexual intercourse at around that time and for the jury reasonably to conclude that TA was aware of her lack of consent. The question is not, as Counsel for TA submitted, whether the absence of an agreement to abstain from sexual activity at the time of the incident in count 5 is something that could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that the quality of the evidence for count 5 was diminished or that the quality of the evidence for counts 6 and 8 was in some way improved or enhanced (see T 5.23-29; T 6.17-33). It was evidence that provides a rational explanation for the jury to have accepted NA’s evidence on counts 6 and 8 even though the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of TA’s guilt on count 5.
	
	
	Similarly, the evidence that TA was wearing Church clothing at the time of the incident in count 5 provides a rational explanation for the jury not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what occurred on that occasion was without consent or that TA was aware of a lack of consent at that time. The suggestion that TA might equally have been wearing Church clothing at the time of the incidents in counts 6 and 8 was not put to NA in cross-examination and seems inherently implausible since he was in bed and asleep prior to those incidents.
	
	
	Those differences between count 5 on the one hand and counts 6 and 8 on the other hand provide a rational explanation for the different verdicts on those counts. Certainly, having regard to the caution that it is recognised an appellate court should exercise before concluding that the jury has acted contrary to its duty and contrary to the clear directions given by the trial judge, it cannot be said that the evidence demonstrates that no reasonable jury applying their minds to the evidence could have arrived at the differential verdicts (as the question was framed in Osland v R [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316) nor has it been demonstrated that there is inconsistency rising to the point where intervention is required to prevent a possible injustice.
	
	
	In those circumstances, were leave to appeal be granted I would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	That brings me back to the application for an extension of time for the filing of the notice of application for leave to appeal. There was no satisfactory explanation for the overall delay in commencing the proceedings, although a partial explanation was proffered. An application for such an extension must of course be determined by reference to the interests of justice (O’Grady v R [2014] HCA 38; (2014) 254 CLR 621). In circumstances where the sole ground of appeal now sought to be pressed (if leave to appeal is granted) has been shown to have no merit, refusal of the application for an extension could not be said to occasion any injustice. That said, the merits of the proposed appeal have been argued and considered. I consider the appropriate course is to grant the extension of time for the filing of the application for leave to appeal and to dismiss the application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Extend time for the filing of the notice of application for leave to appeal to 4 March 2015.
	
	
	Dismiss the application for leave to appeal.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with Ward JA.

Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The appellants were two of four co-accused arraigned before Judge Sweeney in June 2014 on charges relating to a possession of a commercial quantity of unlawfully imported substances, being heroin and methamphetamine. The charges were laid pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth). The Court was therefore exercising federal jurisdiction, a factor to which reference will be made below.
	
	
	The jury retired to consider its verdicts on 1 October 2014. On 17 October it returned verdicts of guilty with respect to the two appellants. The jury continued its deliberations with respect to two other co-accused, Hung Kai Lok and Tri Thanh Phan. Being unable to reach a unanimous verdict with respect to Mr Lok, on 22 October 2014 the jury were discharged in relation to the charges against him. They continued their deliberations with respect to Mr Phan.
	
	
	On 24 October 2014 the trial judge received a note from the foreperson of the jury. The note covered in some detail concerns held by the foreperson with respect to a juror referred to as juror X. (The juror’s identity was carefully not revealed in the note.)
	
	
	The note identified two bases of concern. One was that the juror had a chronic illness which had been disclosed to the foreperson early in the proceedings. The foreperson noted that the juror said to her that he had been advised by a doctor to have an operation. The advice had not been taken, as the person was anxious to undertake the jury duty, although, as the foreperson noted, neither the likely length of the trial, nor the stress which would be involved, were probably appreciated at the time. The foreperson noted that the juror had expressed a desire to drop out due to ill health just prior to a ballot being taken to reduce the number of jurors from 15 to 12. The foreperson did not express an opinion (and probably was not competent to do so), as to whether the juror’s participation was actually affected adversely by ill health.
	
	
	The second matter raised by the foreperson was an opinion that the juror was illiterate, based on the fact that at no stage was the juror observed to make reference to the extensive transcripts and documents that had been provided to the jury. The foreperson said that the juror had in fact disclosed to her his inability to read in the course of conversation.
	
	
	After discussion with counsel, the trial judge invited the foreperson to confirm on oath particular matters raised in the note. [1]  The judge then had juror X return to court and asked him some questions concerning his ability to read and his state of health. He was asked first as to whether he had “some difficulty reading”. He replied: [2] 
	


“I can read, but its just it doesn’t absorb into my brain as well as it could and I can read a book and sort of only get the main points of it.”


	
	When asked whether he thought that his level of reading affected his ability to absorb the evidence in the trial he replied:
	


“No. I have a good comprehension of absorbing from what you hear.”


	
	The judge also asked him whether he thought it had affected his ability to participate in deliberations to which he replied:
	


“I don’t think so, because I can remember most of the court case.”


	
	With respect to his ill health he indicated that his blood pressure had “gone through the roof and its like 190/140, I’ve been told to go to have it checked it out before I have a heart attack”.
	
	
	After hearing further from counsel, the trial judge stated: [3] 
	


“I think because of the juror’s ill health which, even on what he says, [he] is quite at risk of some serious consequences if he doesn’t get some attention, so under s 53B(a), and also on the basis that the foreperson has said that his illiteracy has affected the jury’s deliberations, even though he was not prepared to concede that, and I can understand he may not be prepared to, he may be embarrassed by that, so I think on those bases I do discharge that juror.”


	
	Juror X was then brought back to Court, his conscientiousness duly noted, but discharged with firm advice to go and see a doctor.
	
	
	The reference to s 53B(a) was a reference to a provision in the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) providing for discretionary discharge of an individual juror. The section reads:
	


“53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court … may, in the course of any trial …, discharge a juror if:

(a)   the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge’s … opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or

(b)   it appears to the court … (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court …) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case …, or

(c)   a juror refuses to take part in the jury’s deliberations, or

(d)   it appears to the court … that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

Note. Section 22 provides for the continuation of a trial or inquest on the death or discharge of a juror.”


	
	.
	
	
	It is perhaps curious that the section does not expressly extend to a person whose continued service on the jury may be a significant risk to his or her own health. However, that circumstance could fall within par (d).
	
	
	The Court is under an obligation to discharge a juror if it is found in the course of the trial that the juror “was mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, … because the juror was excluded from jury service” or “has become excluded from jury service”. [4]  Prior to amendments which commenced on 31 January 2014, [5]  Schedule 2 of the Jury Act provided that persons were “ineligible to serve as jurors” if “unable to read or understand English” (item 11) or “unable, because of sickness, infirmity or disability, to discharge the duties of a juror” (item 12). There are no equivalent provisions in the current Act.
	
	
	There will be a degree of flexibility inherent in the element of illiteracy, depending on the nature of a trial. No doubt someone who is quite unable to read English should be excluded in most cases. But where, as is more usual and as appeared to be the case with juror X, there is a limited ability to read English, it will be necessary to consider whether the trial is one in which, in practical terms, a difficulty is not likely to arise. (That may be rare these days, when, in cases of any complexity, it is usual to provide jurors with written instructions as to the law and when documentary exhibits are commonplace.)
	
	
	Section 53A speaks of the power of the court to discharge a jury if in the course of the trial “it is found” that the juror was excluded or if the juror has become excluded. The first limb no doubt intends that the judge form an opinion based on available material; the second limb should be approached on the same basis, as it was in this case. As the passages set out above indicate, the juror’s own statement as to his blood pressure was seen as a critical factor, which understandably gave rise to serious concern. Although the evidence as to literacy was imprecise and somewhat qualified, the judge clearly gave weight to the opinions of the foreperson who, as a practical matter, had observed the conduct of the juror over many weeks. To the extent that the judge relied upon the lack of literacy, she was correct to discharge the juror.
	
	
	Although there is no challenge to the decision to discharge the juror, the basis of discharge was not irrelevant to the next question faced by the trial judge, namely whether the trial should be allowed to proceed with the remaining jurors or whether the whole of the jury should be discharged. It also has a consequence for the verdicts already given, prior to the problem being identified, with respect to Messrs Lee and Tang.
	
	
	There is no dispute between the parties in this case: the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has accepted that the verdicts with respect to Messrs Lee and Tang should be quashed so that all four accused may be the subject of a retrial, which is set down to commence in mid July 2015. To allow that course to be taken, Mr Tang applied on 2 June 2015 to be “granted leave to join the conviction appeal” of Mr Lee. On the same day he filed a notice of appeal “against conviction”: the notice of motion should be taken to seek to have his appeal heard together with Mr Lee’s appeal, which has now happened.
	
	
	The position of the director allows this Court to more readily accept that the circumstances recounted above require the quashing of the verdicts. Nevertheless, the Court should be affirmatively satisfied that that is the proper course, it being a serious matter to quash a verdict unless attended by a fatal irregularity.
	


Jurisdiction


	
	It is necessary first to be satisfied that this Court has jurisdiction to make the orders sought. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides a right of an appeal for a person “convicted on an indictment” to appeal “against the person’s conviction”, either with or without leave of the Court, the circumstances in which leave is required being presently irrelevant. [6] 
	
	
	The first question is whether Mr Lee and Mr Tang have been “convicted”. Procedurally, there is an important distinction between the announcement of the jury’s verdict and the formal step taken by the judge, on behalf of the court, in convicting the accused. The term “Conviction” is defined, but only by way of inclusion of “a finding or verdict under or in accordance with [identified sections] of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990”. [7] 
	
	
	The meaning of conviction for the purposes of criminal appeals (although not particularly with respect to s 5(1)) was considered by the High Court in Griffiths v The Queen. [8]  That was a case in which the trial judge, having accepted a plea of guilty to a number of charges declined to proceed to sentence the offender on condition that he entered into a recognisance in the sum of $200.00 conditioned on his being of good behaviour for 12 months. The Attorney General sought to appeal from that order pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, which permitted an appeal by the Attorney or the Director of Public Prosecutions “against any sentence” pronounced by a trial court. The applicant objected (unsuccessfully) that he had not been convicted, nor sentenced, and accordingly the Attorney had no right of appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	Four members of the High Court (Barwick CJ, Steven, Jacobs and Aickin JJ) found that the accused had indeed been “convicted”, for the purposes of the definition of “sentence” in s 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act. However, the term “sentence” as defined at the time of Griffiths, included “any order made by the court of trial on conviction with reference to the person convicted”. (The present definition is much amended.) Unlike s 5, s 5D was not conditioned upon the person being “[a] person convicted on indictment”.
	
	
	Ultimately, the error on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal was in finding that Mr Griffiths had been sentenced by an order for remand. However the Court (other than Murphy J) rejected his argument that he had not been convicted. Although the issue was whether he had been convicted in circumstances where he had entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court and had been committed for sentence, the leading judgments of Barwick CJ and Jacobs J also considered when a person was convicted following a jury trial. Barwick CJ held that “the return by the jury of a verdict of guilty both establishes guilt and amounts itself to a conviction.” [9] 
	
	
	Jacobs J stated: [10] 
	


“I therefore take it that a conviction precedes judgment. It seems to me that the verdict of a jury is a conviction when it has been recorded and that a confession of guilt after arraignment is also a conviction when it is recorded.”


	
	Justice Stephen spoke in somewhat more oblique terms. After referring to the judgments of Jacobs J and Aickin J, he concluded that when the primary judge “dealt with the applicant as he did the applicant was then a person ‘convicted’ for the purposes of the definition of ‘sentence’ in s 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act but was not one in respect of whom any ‘sentence’, in the ordinary meaning of that word, had been pronounced.” [11] 
	
	
	The reasoning of Aickin J was consistent with the view that no further step was required to convict an accused after a finding of guilt by a jury, although he concluded that some further step was necessary after a plea of guilty. [12] 
	
	
	The issue was again indirectly considered by this Court in Della Patrona v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [No 2]. [13]  The issue arose indirectly because the Court was concerned with the meaning of “convicted” in s 30(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth). Expressing some caution as to the value of the exercise, Kirby P dealt with the meaning of “convicted” in other contexts, including under the general law. Referring to Griffiths, he stated that the reasons of Barwick CJ “clearly support the proposition that the prisoner is convicted at the moment when, by express words or by necessary implication, the trial judge accepts the jury’s verdict of guilty.” [14]  Kirby P also referred to the reasons of Jacobs J, stating that Jacobs J had “accepted the conceptual distinction between the act of the jury in finding the guilt of the accused and the act of the judge in convicting and sentencing the prisoner, once found guilty.”
	
	
	He understood Jacobs J as finding that a conviction did not occur until the jury verdict was “formally recorded.” [15]  Noting that the need for any formal recording of the verdict had not found favour in other decisions, [16]  Kirby P accepted that all that was necessary was for the judge to accept and proceed to act upon the jury’s verdict. [17] 
	
	
	It may be accepted that, in the present case, the trial judge did take the necessary steps in accepting the verdict with respect to the present appellants and inviting the jury to proceed only with respect to the other two accused. In the course of submissions this Court was advised that both the appellants had now been sentenced.
	
	
	There is no issue as to whether Mr Lok should be separately tried, no verdict having been returned. There is also no issue with respect to Mr Phan, the jury having been discharged prior to reaching a verdict with respect to him. Nor is this Court required to consider whether the discharge of the jury was the proper course. The jury has been discharged and Mr Phan is to be put on trial again.
	
	
	It should be accepted that the Court has jurisdiction to determine an appeal against the convictions. Accordingly, the only question is whether the Court should set aside the convictions of Messrs Tang and Lee.
	


Validity of verdicts


	
	The validity of the verdicts must be considered in the context of the relevant statutory provisions and, in particular, s 73 of the Jury Act, which provides:
	


“73 Verdict not invalidated in certain cases 

(1)   The verdict of a jury shall not be affected or invalidated by reason only:

(a)   that any juror was, after being required by summons to attend for jury service, mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, whether because the juror was excluded from jury service or was otherwise not returned and selected in accordance with this Act, or

Note. For example, this paragraph prevents the verdict of a jury from being invalid if, as in R v Brown & Tran [2004] NSWCCA 324, a juror who received a jury summons reported for service a day early and was mistakenly empanelled.

(a1)    that any juror became excluded from jury service in the course of the trial or coronial inquest, or

(b)    of any omission, error or irregularity with respect to any supplementary jury roll, jury roll, card or summons prepared or issued for the purposes of this Act, or

(c)    that any juror was misnamed or misdescribed (where there is no question as to the juror’s identity).

(2)    Subsection (1) does not apply:

(a)    in respect of a juror if the juror impersonated, or is suspected of impersonating, another person, or

(b)    if there is evidence of any other attempt to deliberately manipulate the composition of the jury.”


	
	The operation of the Jury Act in a trial for Commonwealth offences was considered in R v Petroulias. [18]  In that case, a juror having been discharged before a verdict was reached, the trial proceeded with eleven persons. By majority, the Court found that the jury as a whole should have been discharged. It may be noted that the reasoning of the majority (Simpson J, Hoeben J agreeing) turned on the language of s 22 of the Jury Act which has since been significantly amended. [19]  Because the present case did not proceed with a reduced jury, there is no need to reconsider the inter-relationship of ss 19 and 22, on which that decision turned. However, Simpson J also considered the operation of s 73, which is directly relevant to the invalidity alleged with respect to the verdicts which were entered in the present case. Again, the language of s 73 has been amended since the decision in Petroulias. [20]  Petroulias remains significant for one reason, however, namely the conclusion that, following Brownlee v The Queen, [21]  s 22 (and by implication, s 73) will operate with respect to a trial in federal jurisdiction. [22] 
	
	
	Simpson J rejected the proposition that “s 73(a) [as it then stood] is to be read as including not merely the preservation of a verdict in which a disqualified person participated, but also the preservation of an unconcluded trial subject to the same defect.” [23]  Thus the Court rejected the argument that an express preservation of a verdict could not extend to the preservation of the unconcluded trial on the basis of a narrow and literal reading of the section. Because the precise issue does not arise, and because the language of the section has changed, it is not necessary to consider the validity of that reasoning.
	
	
	Section 73 means that the verdicts against the appellants cannot be set aside by reason only that there was on the jury a person who should not have been empanelled to serve as a juror. In short, it is necessary to find some further reason. In seeking that further reason, it is not necessary to disregard the circumstances in which he was discharged: those circumstances may constitute a sound basis for determining that there has been a miscarriage of justice. In the present case, the relevant circumstance was the inability to read English. If the nature of the evidence in the trial was, as both accused and the Director agreed, such as to require that ability in order to participate fully in the decision making, then an objective assessment that the juror could not read English adequately to obtain a full understanding of the prosecution case could provide a sufficient reason, beyond the mere fact that he should have been excluded. Accordingly, s 73(a) would not prevent the verdicts being invalidated in the present circumstances.
	
	
	Where the Court is satisfied that there has been a failure or breach in the integrity of the trial process, a verdict may be set aside as involving a miscarriage of justice within the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. [24]  Unlike Smith, this was not a case of alleged intimidation or overbearing of a juror: it was a case in which it was shown that a particular juror who had participated in the verdicts was illiterate and in poor health. For present purposes it is sufficient to focus on the question of illiteracy, as the facts as to when juror X’s health deteriorated, and to what degree, are not shown on the material before this Court, nor in the findings of the trial judge. It is unfortunate that the trial judge was not asked to consider this issue.
	
	
	In the course of questioning both the foreperson and the possibly ineligible juror, the judge asked the foreperson whether juror X’s behavior “has disrupted the jury or he hasn’t perhaps fully participated in the jury’s deliberations?” [25]  The juror was asked whether his difficulty in reading “affected your ability to participate in the jury’s deliberations?” [26] 
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging that the issues raised involved matters of degree (particularly in relation to ill health) the questioning was approaching the limitation on admissible evidence, namely evidence of the deliberations of the jury. The need for some flexibility in the application of that rule, lest it subvert part of the rational for its existence, was recognized in Smith. [27]  Nevertheless, the importance of maintaining the privacy of the jury room, so as to allow free and frank deliberation remains a critical consideration. None of that is to say that the trial judge overstepped the appropriate boundary in this case: no question was asked as to the nature or content of any part of the deliberations.
	
	
	A major part of the prosecution case turned on recorded intercepts of telephone conversations in Mandarin or Cantonese. The jury were supplied with voluminous material, including English translations of the recorded calls. Part of the foreperson’s concern arose from the fact that juror X was never seen to open his volumes of material, nor attempt to read the translations which were not read aloud in court.
	
	
	The illiteracy of one juror in the circumstances of this trial would be a sufficient irregularity to call for a retrial, without inquiry as to the effect of the irregularity on the deliberations of the jury. As to the factual issue, although not expressed in the clearest of language, it would seem that the trial judge was satisfied that the juror was at the time of discharge unable adequately to read English. In the absence of a reason for rejecting the finding of the trial judge in this regard (such as the application of a wrong legal test) this Court should accept the finding of fact. It followed that the convictions of the appellants should be quashed. In the event that the Court took that step, the Director indicated that they will be rearraigned at the further trial due to commence in approximately one month. There was no need for any further order by the Court.
	


Order made


	
	Accordingly, at the hearing of the appeals the Court ordered that the convictions resulting from the acceptance of the jury verdicts of guilty with respect to Man Fu Vico Lee and Hin Yiu Tang pursuant to an indictment dated 8 November 2013 be quashed.
	
	
	GARLING J: On 5 June 2015, the Court made an order in each appeal which quashed the conviction of each of the appellants.
	
	
	The Court reserved its reasons. These are my reasons for joining in with the Court’s order.
	


The District Court Trial


	
	The appellants, Mr Lee and Mr Tang were convicted by a jury after a trial before Sweeney DCJ in the District Court. They have been sentenced to, and have been serving, a lengthy term of imprisonment.
	
	
	The offence of which each appellant was convicted was that between about 17 January 2012 and 30 July 2012, they conspired with Hung Kai Lok and others to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported substance, being a border controlled drug, namely, heroin and methylamphetamine contrary to ss 11.5(1) and 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth).
	
	
	The trial of the appellants, together with Mr Lok and Mr Phan, commenced on 17 June 2014. It continued for 72 hearing days until 1 October 2014, when the jury retired to consider its verdicts with respect to each of the four co‑accused.
	
	
	On 17 October 2014, the jury returned verdicts of guilty with respect to the two appellants. The jury continued its deliberations with respect to the other two co‑accused, Mr Lok and Mr Phan.
	
	
	On 22 October 2014, the jury were discharged with respect to finding a verdict for Mr Lok because they were unable to agree on a unanimous verdict.
	
	
	The jury continued deliberations with respect to Mr Phan until 24 October 2014, when it was discharged. The jury was discharged by Sweeney DCJ in circumstances where it was brought to her Honour’s attention that one of the jurors, Juror X, was in a practical sense, illiterate, and that he also had health problems which it was said, together impaired his capacity to engage fully in the deliberations of the jury. Neither the Crown, nor counsel for Mr Phan, opposed the discharge of Juror X. That juror was accordingly discharged.
	
	
	An application was made by counsel for Mr Phan to discharge the whole jury. It was opposed by the Crown. The trial Judge, for the reasons she gave, discharged the whole jury.
	


Appeal


	
	Each appellant appeals against their conviction and seeks an order that their convictions be quashed because they were affected by a miscarriage of justice. The Crown agrees that an order quashing the convictions should be made, but relies on a different pathway to that conclusion.
	
	
	The appellants argue in this Court that a miscarriage of justice occurred in their trial because the jury, which returned the verdicts of guilty against them, included Juror X who was incapable of participating properly in the deliberations of the jury because of his practical illiteracy.
	
	
	Of particular concern with respect to whether a miscarriage of justice occurred was that the evidence in the trial included a considerable quantity of written exhibits constituting English translations of intercepts of telephone conversations between or involving the appellant in a foreign language. English translations of the telephone intercepts were not read out orally before the jury, but were put before the jury in written form only.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the question for this Court is whether Juror X was able to consider all of the evidence, including the telephone intercept material, in light of how that evidence was presented, namely, in writing, and if not, whether that incapacity deprived the appellants of a fair trial. The Crown accepts that the answer to that question ought be in the affirmative. That is, at base, that the appellants did not have a fair trial.
	
	
	This is a more than sufficient basis for upholding the appeal, and quashing the convictions.
	
	
	Whether or not there were further reasons why that particular juror ought have been discharged, or whether there were other ways in which the jury’s deliberations were less than ideal, is not a matter to which this Court should give its attention.
	


Discernment


	
	I accept that in the particular circumstances here, the irregularity created by the practical illiteracy of Juror X was of such a nature that it is not possible to conclude that the irregularity did not affect the jury’s verdict, and in that respect there has been a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the proviso does not arise for consideration.
	
	
	Thus, I was persuaded to join in with the orders which the Court pronounced on 5 June 2015.
	
	
	HAMILL J: On 5 June I joined in orders quashing the convictions of both appellants. I have since had the opportunity to read in draft the judgments of Basten JA and Garling J.
	
	
	I agree with Basten JA, for the reasons that his Honour gives, that the applicants were “convicted” and that the jurisdiction of this Court is enlivened. Once the primary Judge proceeded to sentence, there was an unequivocal step indicating acceptance of the verdicts.
	
	
	I agree with both Basten JA and Garling J, for the reasons articulated by their Honours, that the illiteracy of one of the jurors, in the particular circumstances of this case, means that the convictions must be quashed. The joint position of the parties, which I accept, is that the trial involved a great deal of reading of translated transcripts of recordings which were otherwise played to the jury in a foreign language. This leads to a conclusion, to adopt the words of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), that “on any other ground, there was a miscarriage of justice.”
	
	
	The miscarriage identified in this case constituted “such a serious breach of the presuppositions of the trial” that I do not consider that there was “no substantial miscarriage of justice”: Weiss v The Queen; [28]  Cesan v The Queen. [29]  I accept the respondent’s concession that there is no room for the operation of the proviso in this case.

2766998,Byrne v R [2015] NSWCCA 159,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: The applicant, Christopher Anthony Byrne, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying an indictable quantity of heroin and another of supplying an indictable quantity of methamphetamine. Each is an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 15 years. In addition, there were taken into account on a Form 1 offences of dealing with the proceeds of crime (s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900) and conducting drug premises (s 36Z(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act).
	
	
	On each count the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 9 months, dating from the date sentence was imposed, 12 May 2014. He sought leave to appeal against those sentences. On 25 May 2015, this Court granted leave to appeal, allowed the appeal and, taking into account the Form 1 matters, sentenced him on each count to imprisonment for a fixed term of 7 months, commencing on 25 October 2014 and expiring on 24 May 2015. Accordingly, the sentence expired on the day before the application was heard. These are my reasons for joining in those orders.
	


Facts


	
	The facts can be summarised briefly. The applicant and his partner, Lindsie Grice, were subjects of a police investigation into the supply of prohibited drugs in the Newcastle area. Investigations revealed that they were obtaining large quantities of prohibited drugs through associates in Sydney, whom they would meet in secluded bushland area on the Central Coast. They would then sell the drugs to customers in Newcastle, making arrangements for the transactions by coded mobile telephone calls.
	
	
	On 30 January 2013, police executed a search warrant at their Mayfield home and seized a quantity of methylamphetamine, heroin and cash, together with drug paraphernalia and numerous mobile phones. Police also observed exceptional security measures added to the doors and windows of the house to prevent forced access. It was the finding of the drugs and the other items, together with the security measures, which led to the charge of conducting drug premises on the Form 1. The charge of dealing with proceeds of crime on the Form arose from the finding of $650 cash in the applicant’s jeans pocket, for which he could give no satisfactory account.
	
	
	In due course, the applicant and Ms Grice each pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the charges of supplying heroin and methylamphetamine, which were representative of dealing in those drugs over a period between September 2012 and January 2013 in respect of the heroin, and October 2012 and January 2013 in respect of the methylamphetamine.
	
	
	During the search on 30 January 2013, Ms Grice surrendered to police a pistol and ammunition, which she admitted having purchased for her protection. That led to her also being charged with possessing an unauthorised pistol, contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a 3 year non-parole period. She also had charges of conducting drug premises and dealing with the proceeds of crime taken into account on a Form 1, together with two further offences under the Firearms Act, possessing ammunition without a licence and not keeping a firearm safely.
	
	
	The applicant and Ms Grice were dealt with together in the District Court. Ms Grice was sentenced to an intensive corrections order for 18 months.
	


Subjective case


	
	Given the facts of this matter, the sentence passed upon the applicant in the District Court, and in this Court, may seem surprisingly lenient. However, the applicant made out a strong subjective case, which also need only be sketched briefly.
	
	
	He was 37 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 40. He had a criminal history in Queensland, comprising mainly offences of dishonesty and some drug offences, committed between 1991 and 2004. He had a very disturbed background, which I need not recount, and commenced using illicit drugs at the age of 16.
	
	
	In 2004, in Queensland, he commenced his relationship with Ms Grice. He continued using drugs, but otherwise his pattern of offending ceased. They had two children, and moved to New South Wales. The Department of Community Services removed the children because of his drug use and that of Ms Grice. Put shortly, the circumstances of the present offences arose from their being unable to secure the restoration of the children to them despite his abstaining from drugs for a period and undergoing drug counselling. He and Ms Grice became heavily involved in drug abuse, and committed the offences primarily to support their habit.
	
	
	After being in custody for 4 months as a result of his arrest for these offences, the applicant was released on bail to enter the rehabilitation program at Bennelong’s Haven Family Rehabilitation Centre. By the time he was sentenced in the District Court, he had spent 11 months in that program and had made excellent progress. He was described in a report from that centre as having a very positive attitude to rehabilitation, as being well regarded by staff and others at the centre, and as being helpful to new residents. Ms Grice also undertook the course, and both of them attended a parenting program. At the time of sentence she was pregnant with their third child.
	
	
	In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge clearly saw the applicant’s progress to rehabilitation as a central issue in the case. His Honour had imposed an intensive corrections order upon Ms Grice immediately before dealing with the applicant but, taking the view that the applicant was “effectively the controller” of the drug supply operation, he concluded that considerations of deterrence called for a full time custodial sentence in his case.
	
	
	After serving 3 months of his sentence (in round figures), the applicant was granted bail pending the hearing of his application for leave to appeal. Accordingly, at the time the application was heard he was at liberty, having served 7 months of the 9 month term imposed upon him.
	


The application


	
	Counsel for the applicant, Ms Cox, challenged the sentence on several grounds. Among these was a ground that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the offending which would normally justify a full time custodial sentence, his Honour failed to consider the option of an intensive corrections order in his case. Reliance was placed upon the decision of this court in EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36, handed down after the applicant had been sentenced. Another ground challenged the disparity of the sentences passed upon the applicant and Ms Grice. These grounds raised matters of substance, which were the subject of written submissions by Ms Cox and the Crown prosecutor in this court.
	
	
	However, there was another ground which the Court was satisfied must succeed and which enabled the application to be dealt with in a fair and practical manner. The ground was that, in directing the sentence to commence on the day it was passed, his Honour failed to have regard to the 4 month period of pre-sentence custody.
	
	
	There is no doubt that his Honour was made aware of that period of custody in the proceedings on sentence, which were conducted on 13 March 2014. Sentence was not passed until 2 months later because, in the meantime, a report on the availability of an intensive corrections order for Ms Grice was required. In his remarks, which were brief, his Honour made no reference to the pre-sentence custody.
	
	
	In Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116, Fullerton J, with whom Ward JA and Hamill J agreed, said at [32]:
	


“Section 24 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides that in sentencing an offender the Court must take into account pre-sentence custody. This Court has held that the preferable or desirable approach, and one that is regularly adopted, is to backdate the sentence imposed by a period equivalent to the pre-sentence custody. In Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30, Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed) citing R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245, said that the desirability of that approach did not translate into a mandatory requirement that it be adopted in every case although where that approach was not taken the reason for not doing so should be clearly stated.”


	
	The Crown prosecutor in this Court fairly acknowledged that there was nothing “clearly stated” by his Honour in the present case to demonstrate that the period of pre-sentence custody had been taken into account. Nor was it open to infer that in some unspecified way it was. It appeared that his Honour had simply overlooked the matter.
	
	
	For this reason the Court reduced the sentence to 7 months, in recognition of the period the applicant had already served, backdating it so as to expire on the day before the hearing of the application and ensure that he did not have to return to custody.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Hidden J.

2766999,Leighton v R [2015] NSWCCA 156,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Wilson J in draft, with which I generally agree. I wish, however, to make some additional remarks. As her Honour mentions, the occasions relied on by the prosecution as tendency and coincidence evidence occurred over a period of about ten years. The alleged indecent or sexual assaults (for convenience referred to as “assaults”) occurred on every occasion when the appellant administered nitrous oxide (N2O) to the complainants, sometimes on a number of occasions. On the many occasions when N2O was not administered, no alleged assaults occurred. As Wilson J’s summary of the allegations shows, the patients involved numbered 19 and the allegations commenced in 1967 and then every year from 1971 (or possibly 1972) to 1982 (or possibly 1984). Taken as a whole, the evidence (if true) demonstrates that, when he administered N2O to females, he had a tendency to sexually interfere with them, one way or another. It is obvious that, during this period, the appellant would in all likelihood have had many other female patients to whom it appears likely he administered N2O but it is not known whether he assaulted them or not. However, it is not necessary to establish, when attempting to prove tendency, that the impugned conduct in question (here, the assaults) occurred on every occasion when the opportunity (here, the sedative effects of N2O) arose. It is a question of fact and degree, depending on the evidence in each case, whether the alleged tendency is capable of being sufficiently probative to overcome the potentially unfair prejudicial effect of proving some similar bad behaviour. More precisely, the learned trial judge in substance concluded that the probative weight of the evidence was capable of rationally affecting the probability that, when the complainants were affected by N2O administered by the appellant, their experience of and recollections about his sexual conduct towards them were nevertheless genuine and reliable rather than imagined or confabulated. I respectfully agree with Wilson J that this conclusion was open to his Honour; in my opinion, moreover, it was plainly correct.
	
	
	It will be seen that I have somewhat simplified the prosecution’s description of the tendency sought to be proved, which is to my mind unnecessarily complicated. Of course, the other facts mentioned: that the appellant was a dentist; that he had female patients; that he ensured he was alone with some (the complainants); and that he administered N2O to them are relevant facts. To my mind the critical “tendency” is that, in those circumstances, he “touched them in a sexual manner”.
	
	
	Whether the proposed evidence is “coincidence” evidence is, I think, a rather different question. It is whether the jury could find that the similar complaints made by the various ex-patients proposed to be called cannot be explained by mere coincidence and the inference that the conduct of which they complained in fact happened; or, at least, the number and similar character of the complaints is such as to significantly affect the determination of a fact in issue, namely, whether the evidence of the complainants involved in the charges is truthful and reliable in respect of the appellant’s sexual conduct. This approach requires attention to be paid to the circumstances in which the complaints were first made. Many of the complainants came forward because of media publicity about the appellant’s charges but, of those, many had made complaints (for example, to family members) well before any publicity. It is reasonable to infer that the complainants had no other links which might give rise to the possibility of joint concoction. Once this possible explanation for the multiplicity of similar complaints is dismissed, the remaining inference available (indeed, inevitable) is that the complainant’s evidence about the relevant events is truthful and reliable and, hence, that they in fact occurred.
	
	
	I discussed the meaning of “events” in s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) in Versi v R [2013] NSWCCA 206 at [126]-[135]; cf Basten JA at [11]-[17]. Perhaps the simplest way of putting the point is that stated in Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 482 (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ):
	


""The probative value of the evidence lies in the improbability of witnesses giving accounts of happenings having the degree of similarity unless the events occurred.""


	
	The context in which the admissibility of the other complaints was decided is the proposed evidence of the impact of N2O induced sedation on the reliability of the complainant’s evidence of sexual touching. Even if it were not for this issue, my view would be that the impugned evidence is admissible for the reasons that I have mentioned. However, its probative weight is capable of even greater significance when the suggested N2O effect is in issue, for obvious reasons. The proposed evidence is therefore admissible as “coincidence evidence”.
	
	
	There remains what seems to me to be an important logical point which I mention for completeness, although it was not raised as an issue. If it be accepted that there is a reasonable possibility that N2O sedation can lead to imagined sexual interference of the type charged, then even if one could be satisfied, looking at the charges as a whole, that they cannot be explained by that phenomenon, nevertheless, in respect of one of them it might be so explained and thus necessarily require acquittal. On this hypothesis, it might not be possible to identify the particular charges which would not be open to be explained it that way, with the result that the appellant must be acquitted of all (cf Regina v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23; 152 A Crim R 35). I hasten to point out, however, that this significantly oversimplifies the evidence to be adduced in respect of each incident (as helpfully summarised by Wilson J), which would need to be considered as well and emphasises the vital importance of identifying, in respect of each charge, the evidence relevant to that charge and the need to consider each charge separately.
	
	
	WILSON J: This is an appeal brought pursuant to s.5F(3)(a) and (3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against an interlocutory judgment and consequent orders made on 5 December 2015 by his Honour Judge Woods QC DCJ sitting in the District Court of New South Wales.
	
	
	Section 5F relevantly provides:
	


“5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order

(1)   This section applies to:

(a)   proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, and

(b)   proceedings under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and

(c)   [……..]

(2)    […..…]

(3)   Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:

(a)   if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or

(b)   if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal.”


	
	Having made the orders of 5 December 2014 his Honour granted a certificate to the appellant pursuant to s.5F(3)(b) certifying that his orders were proper for determination on appeal. His Honour confined the certificate to those of his orders based upon evidence that was before the Court as to the effects upon an individual of the gas nitrous oxide.
	
	
	The appellant (who is referred to in that way for convenience) additionally advances thirteen grounds of appeal against his Honour’s orders. To the extent that those grounds go beyond the terms of the certificate granted by the trial judge, the appellant requires leave from this Court (s.5F(3)(a)).
	


The Nature of the Proceedings in the District Court


	
	The appellant has been indicted for a total of twenty seven charges for various sexual assault offences created by specific provisions of the Crimes Act 1900. He faces fifteen counts of indecent assault contrary to s.76 of the Act, nine counts of indecent assault contrary to s.61E, one count of indecent assault spanning the period before s.76 was repealed and after s.61E was introduced, and two counts of sexual intercourse without consent with a child under 16 years contrary to s.61D(1) [1] .
	
	
	There are nine complainants. The ages of the complainants at the relevant times range from 9 or 10 years of age to 34 years of age.
	
	
	The earliest of the offences is said to have occurred in 1973, whilst the last of the offences avers a time span concluding in 1984.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the alleged offences the appellant was in practice as a dentist in the Sydney suburb of Jannali. All of the charges arise from allegations made against him by girls and young women who consulted the appellant professionally in his surgery, in the course of his practice as a dentist. Broadly, the allegations are that, having administered his patients with nitrous oxide, the appellant took advantage of the sedating effects of the gas to sexually or indecently assault them.
	
	
	The Crown sought to have all charges heard together in a joint trial, and to rely upon the evidence of each complainant as both tendency and coincidence evidence, pursuant to ss.97 and 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 [“the Act”] respectively, relevant to the determination of all charges. (Prior to the final determination of that issue by his Honour the Crown advised the appellant and the Court that it would remove counts 17 to 26 from the indictment presented before his Honour, with those charges proceeding together in a separate trial.)
	
	
	The additional evidence the Crown sought to lead was tendency and coincidence evidence from another ten witnesses, pursuant to ss.97 and 98 [“the tendency / coincidence evidence”]. The Crown had served notice upon the appellant in compliance with s.99 of the Act that it proposed to adduce evidence from a number of women who had made similar allegations against the appellant.
	
	
	By notice of motion the appellant sought the severance of all counts relevant to individual complainants from all other counts on the indictment, necessitating nine separate trials, and took issue with the admissibility of the tendency and co-incidence evidence.
	
	
	The matter came before his Honour on 19 August 2014 for pre-trial hearing to determine the matters raised in the motion. Evidence was called on the voir dire between that date and 27 August 2014, with further evidence taken on 31 October 2014. Although the statement of each was in evidence before the court, the oral evidence given by the complainants was limited to the administration to each of nitrous oxide and its effects, and the circumstances in which complaint to the police had been made.
	
	
	His Honour heard submissions from the parties on 14 November 2014, and delivered his judgment on 5 December 2014. Orders with respect to the conduct of the trial were made on that day.
	
	
	As was agreed between the parties in the proceedings before his Honour, the question of severance of the remaining counts on the indictment was dependent upon the rulings made as to the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence. That latter question was necessarily dealt with first.
	


The Disputed Evidence


	
	The Crown sought to lead evidence from each of the complainants as evidence capable of establishing the specific criminal offences that each complainant had alleged against the appellant, but also as evidence relevant to proof of counts based on allegations made by others. The Crown contended that the evidence of each of the complainants was admissible as evidence that the appellant had particular tendencies, and a particular state of mind.
	
	
	In addition to the tendency / coincidence evidence of the complainants, the Crown proposed to call evidence from another ten women, each of whom asserted that she had been indecently assaulted by the appellant at his dental surgery during a consultation at which a sedating gas was administered, but whose allegations were not reflected by a criminal charge.
	
	
	The Crown argued that the evidence of both groups of women was admissible pursuant to s.97 of the Evidence Act at the appellant’s trial as it was capable of establishing that the appellant had a tendency to act in a particular way, namely:
	



	
	“A tendency to use his position as a dentist to gain access to female patients;
	
	
	To cause himself to be alone in the consulting room with female patients;
	
	
	To touch the female patients during the consultations in a sexual manner; and
	
	
	To touch the female patients in a sexual manner while they were under the effects of nitrous oxide.”
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence was also capable of proving that the appellant had a tendency to have a particular state of mind, being a sexual interest in female patients.
	
	
	The same evidence of indecent and sexual assaults being committed by the appellant upon a number of women was sought to be tendered pursuant to s.98 of the Act as, the Crown argued, it was capable of establishing that the appellant acted as it was alleged he had by the complainants, and that he had a particular state of mind, being a sexual interest in female patients, in circumstances where the similarity of the allegations could not be explained by coincidence.
	
	
	For a proper understanding of the issues of admissibility determined by his Honour and reviewed by this Court, it is necessary to set out the evidence available to be led in the Crown case from the complainants, and from the tendency / coincidence witnesses, and to refer to expert evidence going to the effects of nitrous oxide, that was before his Honour.
	


The Evidence of the Complainants


	
	The complainants who gave evidence on the voir dire, and whose evidence the Crown sought to rely upon at trial will be here referred to only by their initials. A summary of the evidence of each follows:
	


RC – complainant relevant to counts 1 - 3


	
	RC first consulted the appellant in 1973 when she was about 12 years of age. She saw him on four occasions. On her second visit to the appellant’s surgery, RC went into the consulting room alone whilst a parent waited for her in another room. There was a dental nurse, but she did not remain in the consulting room at all times; rather, she went in and out attending to other duties.
	
	
	The appellant administered a gas to RC by placing a mask over her nose and mouth. The appellant did not appear to time the administration of the gas. After its administration, the complainant recalled the appellant commenting that she felt nice, and asking her “is that nice”, as he rubbed her breasts, upper thighs, and genital area over her underpants. The appellant rubbed his groin area against RC’s shoulders.
	
	
	In about 2010 RC was speaking with her husband about some dentist work, and told him about what the appellant had done when she was a child. In late 2012 the witness was looking through a local newspaper and saw the appellant named as a dentist who had been charged with sexual offences. She immediately rang the police, and subsequently made a statement.
	


LY – complainant relevant to counts 4 - 7


	
	LY first consulted the appellant in the late 1960s when she was about 20 years of age. She was not administered nitrous oxide by him until 1974 when she was 28 years of age and attended his surgery to have a broken tooth capped. The appellant made a number of appointments for LY that were after 5pm. On these occasions the dental nurse was allowed by the appellant to leave, having regard to the hour.
	
	
	The appellant administered gas to LY by placing a mask over her nose. On the first occasion gas was used LY felt something hard pressing against her arm and realised it was the appellant’s erect penis pressing against her through his clothing. A considerable amount of gas was administered to her, and she felt very groggy, and vomited.
	
	
	On the next occasion she consulted the appellant, LY was again administered gas. On recovering from its effects she found the appellant standing next to her with his hands inside her bra, with one hand on each breast, and his fingers on her nipples. He immediately removed his hands. The appellant helped LY from the chair and assisted her to walk around the surgery. LY saw that the appellant’s penis was outside his trousers.
	
	
	During her next appointment with the appellant LY was again given gas via a mask. She thereafter had no awareness of her surroundings until the gas stopped, and she awoke to find the appellant standing with his finger inside her underpants. He removed his finger on perceiving that LY had recovered. LY asked the appellant what he was doing, and he made some comment about having wanted to give her an orgasm.
	
	
	LY saw the appellant one final time, as the crown he had fitted needed additional work done to it. On this occasion, no gas was administered to her and, when the appellant leaned in close to her, LY told him to leave her alone. The appellant made a comment about having been under considerable stress.
	


CP – complainant relevant to count 8


	
	CP saw the appellant when she was about ten years old in 1975. On the first occasion the appellant administered gas to her by a mask over her nose. He placed his hands underneath the long cape the complainant had been given to wear, and put a hand inside her underwear. The appellant rubbed the outside of CP’s vagina. CP was unable to speak or move due to the effects of the gas. There was no dental nurse in the room.
	
	
	After the appointment concluded CP left the surgery with her mother, who had been waiting for her. She complained to her mother, but her mother “fobbed” her off. She told no-one from then until she told her partner in early 2012. After seeing a newspaper article about the appellant being charged with sexual assaults she contacted police and made a statement to them.
	


VD – complainant relevant to counts 9 - 12


	
	VD saw the appellant at his surgery in the mid-1970s when she was 32 or so years old. On a visit to have a tooth filled she was administered gas by the appellant via a mask over her nose. Whilst affected by the gas VD felt the appellant rubbing her genitals on the outside of her clothes. She does not recall a dental nurse being in the room.
	
	
	The same thing occurred when VD went again to the appellant’s surgery for a second tooth to be filled. After gas had been administered to VD, and whilst she was affected by it, the appellant rubbed VD’s genitals through her clothing.
	
	
	During her final consultation with the appellant VD was again given gas via a nasal mask. She felt the appellant move his hand underneath the long bib that had been placed around her neck and onto her underpants. VD was wearing a menstrual pad inside her underpants and, after moving his hand against the pad, the appellant then moved his hand up and onto her breasts and began to rub them.
	
	
	VD complained soon after to her husband and, a short time later to a group of friends at a tennis match.
	


SJ – complainant relevant to counts 13 - 14


	
	SJ was in her early thirties when she consulted the appellant in his surgery in the period 1976 to 1979. On each occasion she attended the surgery the appellant administered gas to her. After having attended the surgery for various treatments, and being administered gas, with nothing untoward occurring, the complainant attended an appointment in the relevant period when she was again given gas via a face mask. SJ felt that she was given a larger dose of the sedative than had previously been the case. She felt its effects more deeply than in the past. At a point when she emerged from the gas she found the appellant touching her breasts on the outside of her clothing. He then moved his hands to her genital area and began to rub her vagina on the outside of the jeans that she was wearing. SJ felt unable to stop the appellant because of the effect of the sedative.
	
	
	SJ told her husband about what had happened on returning home, and never returned to the appellant’s surgery.
	


LK – complainant relevant to count 15


	
	LK saw the appellant as a child of about ten or eleven years of age in 1979. She recalls having a mask put over her nose and perhaps her mouth through which a sweet smelling gas was administered to her. When under the effects of the gas LK felt the appellant squeeze her arm, after which he moved his hand to the top of her thigh, and between her legs. She could feel him pushing his hand against her vagina on the outside of her clothing.
	
	
	This happened on a number of occasions when LK had an appointment with the appellant. She told no-one of these events until seeing some media reports referring to the appellant facing charges. She then told her partner about what she recalled of her childhood visits to the appellant.
	
	
	LK conceded in evidence that she had read a newspaper article about the charges already brought against the appellant, which may have mentioned him assaulting girls by rubbing their breasts and genitals. Reading that material prompted her own memory of what had happened to her. She had also searched the internet for information about the appellant and read about the use by him of gas upon those patients whom he was alleged to have assaulted.
	
	
	LK conceded that, until she read the information about the appellant, she had always regarded her own experience as a dream.
	


BM – complainant relevant to count 16


	
	During her childhood years BM consulted the appellant as he was her family’s dentist. On an occasion in the period 1980 to 1983, when BM was 12, 13 or 14 years of age, she attended an appointment in the appellant’s surgery. Gas was administered to her through a mask, leaving her feeling “woozy”. The appellant placed his hand on the complainant’s breast and began to touch it through her clothing. He was not wearing gloves. BM felt unable to do anything because of the effects of the gas. The dental nurse was not in the room at this time. BM told no-one until years later about what had happened.
	


VB – complainant relevant to counts 17 - 26


	
	VB first consulted the appellant in 1983 when she was about twelve years of age. During one consultation when VB was to have a tooth extracted the appellant gave her gas through a face mask. The mask was in place for some time and VB felt very effected by the gas. The appellant put his hands under the long bib VB was draped in and began to rub her genital area on the outside of her clothing.
	
	
	After returning home VB told her mother what the appellant had done, but her mother did not believe her. Later, VB ran away from home and, after entering a refuge, was allocated a case worker, to whom she complained about the appellant’s conduct.
	
	
	On returning to live with her parents VB again had dental treatment at the appellant’s surgery. On an occasion when she went to the surgery for a tooth extraction, VB was administered gas by the appellant. Once VB was under its influence the appellant placed his hands underneath the long dental cape she was wearing and began to rub his hand very firmly against VB’s clitoris. This went on for some minutes. VB was unable to do anything to stop the appellant because of the effects of the gas. The dental nurse was not in the room at the time of the alleged assault.
	
	
	A few weeks later VB returned to the surgery for another tooth extraction. Gas was administered to her through a mask and, once VB was feeling its effects, the appellant put his hands under the dental cape and rubbed his fingers against VB’s clitoris, over her clothing. After a short period he moved his hand inside her track pants and underwear, and inserted a finger or fingers inside the complainant’s labia. With his other hand the appellant rubbed VB’s breast.
	
	
	VB was unable to protest because of the sedative effect of the gas. The nurse was not in the room when this occurred.
	
	
	Soon after, VB attended another appointment with the appellant for a final extraction procedure. As before, the appellant administered gas to her and, once it had taken affect, began to rub his hand on VB’s clitoral area on the outside of her clothing, underneath a dental gown. He was interrupted by the entry of a dental nurse into the room. The extraction proceeded thereafter.
	
	
	Some weeks later, after her gums had healed following the extractions, VB returned to see the appellant so that braces could be fitted. This required a number of appointments. At the first of the appointments VB was draped in a gown and gas was administered to her. As previously, when no dental nurse was in the room, the appellant put his hands underneath the gown and began to rub against VB’s clitoral area on the outside of her clothing.
	
	
	During the subsequent appointments to fit the braces the same things happened.
	
	
	After the braces had been fitted onto VB’s teeth by the appellant, she removed them herself to avoid going back to see the appellant. Some of VB’s teeth were damaged by the removal, and VB’s mother forced her to return to the appellant’s surgery to have them attended to.
	
	
	During the first of the restorative appointments with the appellant, VB was again given gas by him, and felt him rubbing his hand forcefully against her genitals on the outside of her clothes. She was unable to resist because of the effects of the gas.
	
	
	During another of these appointments the appellant administered gas to VB in, VB felt, a greater quantity than was usual. She felt much affected and was unable to move or open her eyes. Whilst thus affected the complainant felt the appellant rubbing his hand against her vagina on the outside of her clothing for some minutes. This stopped, and VB next felt something hard, like an elbow, pushing against her pelvic bone. This caused her pain. Next, the complainant felt the appellant slide his hand inside her underpants from the side and, after rubbing her clitoris for a short time, he forcefully inserted his fingers into VB’s vagina.
	
	
	VB heard the dental nurse enter the room. The appellant told her he was not ready and the nurse left the room. When she returned, the dental treatment was undertaken.
	
	
	When VB returned home and bathed, she saw bruising on her inner thighs and around her genitals.
	
	
	She decided to run away from her home, that being the only way she felt she could prevent the appellant from assaulting her. VB did not see the appellant again until returning to her family home in 1986 or 1987. She saw the appellant on one occasion thereafter.
	


AM – complainant relevant to count 27


	
	AM saw the appellant as a child as he was her family’s dentist. On an occasion when she was aged between seven and eleven years old, in the period 1980 to 1984, AM had to have some teeth removed. The appellant told her that he would use “laughing gas” so that she would not feel the injections of anaesthetic. He fitted a mask to her face and administered gas.
	
	
	The appellant initially sat beside AM as the gas was administered, holding her hand. He then began to push strongly against her genital area with his hand. The dental nurse was not present. The same thing happened to AM on subsequent visits.
	
	
	When, as a teenager, AM realised the wrongness of this conduct, she complained to her mother. She later told her husband and a medical practitioner.
	


The Tendency / Coincidence Evidence


	
	The statements of the women proposed to be called as tendency / coincidence witnesses were tendered to his Honour during the pre-trial proceedings, and the women were called to give oral evidence on the voir dire. With the witnesses again referred to by initials only, the evidence in summary is as follows.
	


Evidence of GK


	
	In around 1967 when GK was 14 years old she went to the appellant’s surgery for a dental consultation. She was a little frightened and the appellant suggested that she have “gas” to relax her. GK agreed and the appellant administered gas to her through a mask. No dental nurse was present.
	
	
	After GK began to feel the effects of the gas, to the extent that she could not move or speak, the appellant began to rub her breasts, and then her genitals, on the outside of her clothing. GK told no-one until many years later.
	


Evidence of LM


	
	In 1971 or 1972, when she was 16 or 17 years old, LM consulted the appellant in his surgery. No dental nurse was present. The appellant administered gas to LM through a face mask. Once under the effects of the gas, LM felt the appellant probing her genitals. On returning home she told her mother about what had happened. Many years later, having heard about a dentist being charged with sexual assaults, she told her partner about the appellant.
	


Evidence of SD


	
	SD first saw the appellant as a primary school student. He was her family dentist, and she saw him twice yearly for check-ups.
	
	
	On an occasion in 1973, when she was 14 or 15 years old and in Year 9 at high school, SD went alone to an appointment at the appellant’s surgery. A cape or bib was draped around her by the dental nurse, who thereafter left the room. The appellant asked SD if she would be willing to try some “happy gas” that he said he had just gotten, as he wanted to ensure patients could not feel pain under its influence. She agreed. When a dental nurse walked into the room the appellant told her that she was not needed and the nurse left.
	
	
	The appellant placed a face mask onto SD and, once the gas had taken effect, SD could feel the appellant forcefully pushing on her pelvic bone and vagina with his elbow. He then began to rub against her breasts. After a time, the appellant administered oxygen to SD to diminish the effect of the gas. She left the surgery soon after.
	
	
	On arriving home SD noticed that the skin around her pubic bone and vagina had a number of small cuts, and was very red. The area stung.
	
	
	On later visits to the surgery SD refused to have gas, opting for anaesthetic by injection instead. She was not assaulted again.
	
	
	SD told no-one about what had happened at the time. In September 2011 she was having a conversation with a friend who said that she had been molested by a dentist at Jannali. SD then disclosed her own experience.
	


Evidence of CF


	
	In 1973 or 1974 CF, then aged 12 or 13 years, saw the appellant at his surgery. The appellant administered “happy gas” to her via a face mask, leaving her feeling as if she was floating in and out of consciousness. The appellant then took her hand underneath the dental gown she was wearing, before moving his hand to CF’s genitals. He rubbed her genitals on either the outside or inside of her clothing. This happened on a number of occasions during dental appointments. At the time these things were occurring, CF told her sister about it.
	


Evidence of JD


	
	JD saw the appellant as her family dentist. In 1974 or 1975 when she was 14 or 15 years old she attended the appellant’s rooms for a filling. The appellant suggested that she have gas and it was administered to her. On recovering from the effects of the gas JD found that her blouse had been unbuttoned. A dental nurse came into the room. JD asked why it was necessary to unbutton her blouse.
	
	
	On the next occasion JD saw the appellant she was again administered gas. On waking from the effects of the gas JD found the appellant with his hand on her upper thigh near her underpants and in the process of pulling up her skirt. JD struggled against the appellant to pull her skirt back down again.
	
	
	JD told her boyfriend about what the dentist had done, and he accompanied her to her next appointment. She soon after began seeing another dentist.
	


Evidence of CP


	
	CP saw the appellant when she was a child living in the southern Sydney area. He was her family dentist. In 1975, when CP was about 10 years old, she had an appointment with the appellant for some treatment. In the surgery CP was covered with a long dental gown or cape, and the appellant placed a mask over her nose. The gas made CP feel strange and unable to react.
	
	
	After the dental work was completed and the dental nurse had left the room, CP felt the appellant move his hand underneath the gown and into her underpants. She felt him rubbing her vagina, although she was unable to do anything because of the sedative effect of the gas. After leaving the surgery, and going home, CP told her mother that the dentist had put his hand down her pants. Her mother fobbed her off.
	
	
	This touching happened on more than one visit to the surgery.
	


The Evidence of JW


	
	JW consulted the appellant from about 1975. She needed braces and saw the appellant for this reason. JW was generally covered in a gown, and the appellant administered “happy gas” to her through a facial mask. On those occasions when gas was administered the appellant would put his hand onto JW’s genital area and rub her vagina. Whilst this contact was initially on top of her clothing, the appellant eventually began inserting his hands inside JW’s underwear and rubbing her vagina, touching her skin.
	
	
	Once JW had finished with braces, she did not return to see the appellant. She told no-one of what had happened until many years later when she mentioned it briefly to a friend. When she heard a news report of a dentist being charged with sexual assault she immediately thought of the appellant, and contacted police.
	


Evidence of VW


	
	VW began seeing the appellant at his practice in 1975 when she was about 14 years old. At her second appointment with him the appellant administered gas to her through a mask placed over her nose. He sat beside her as she breathed in the gas, holding and stroking her hands.
	
	
	At the next appointment the gas was administered to VW by the appellant in the same manner as previously. The gas began to effect VW. She recalls the dental nurse leaving the room. Towards the end of the appointment the appellant began rubbing VW’s breasts on the outside of her clothing. VW was unable to say or do anything because of the effects on her of the gas.
	
	
	Afterwards, VW told no-one as she felt that she would not be believed. The experience had an almost dreamlike quality to her, because of the gas.
	
	
	At the next appointment the appellant administered gas to VW, and the dental nurse left the room. The appellant began rubbing VW’s breasts, before moving his hands to rub her vagina, on the outside of her clothing.
	
	
	At another appointment VW was administered gas by the appellant, who took her hands and began to stroke them. He then began rubbing her breasts, before moving his hand to her groin. He lifted VW’s dress up and put his hand inside her underwear, rubbing the outside of her vagina. VW could feel the appellant’s hand pushing against her vagina but felt that she could not move or resist what was happening. She tried to move her legs and eventually managed to kick out such that the tray of dental equipment beside the chair was knocked to the floor. A nurse came into the room but the appellant told her to leave.
	
	
	VW did not return to see the appellant, as her mother was not happy about the extent of the dental work the appellant said needed to be done.
	
	
	Many years later VW told a friend about what the appellant had done to her. She told no-one else until her friend told her that a Sydney dentist had been charged with assaulting female patients.
	


The Evidence of AS


	
	The appellant was the family dentist for AS and her family in the late nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies. In 1977 when AS was 14 years old she had a series of appointments with the appellant to have some dental work carried out. During the first of these appointments the appellant took AS’s hand underneath the dental gown she was clothed in and held it, moving it up and down on her body.
	
	
	At the next appointment the appellant administered gas to AS through a face mask. She lost all awareness of her surroundings. On recovering from the sedative, AS found that the appellant had his hand on one of her breasts. Her shirt was unbuttoned. The appellant buttoned the shirt up. There had not been a nurse in the room.
	
	
	For her next appointment, AS took a number of friends with her, hoping their presence would prevent the appellant from touching her. Her teeth were cleaned by the appellant but nothing else occurred. AS told her mother what the appellant had done, and she never returned to his surgery. Later she made a complaint to police during a public campaign urging people to report paedophiles. In September 2012 AS heard a news bulletin about a dentist being charged with indecent assault and contacted police to make a statement.
	


Evidence of CP


	
	CP saw the appellant in about 1977 as a 14 year old. She was to have a tooth filled and was given gas through a face mask. After breathing the gas in and feeling its effects, CP felt a forceful pressure against her genitals. The appellant had one arm over her legs and his fingers were pushing into her vagina underneath her underwear. CP felt his fingers push in and out of her vagina a few times. When he removed his hand the appellant carried out dental work on CP.
	
	
	CP said nothing as the experience felt unreal to her due to the effects of the gas. She did not tell her mother.
	
	
	For her next appointment CP wore tight shorts underneath her skirt. The appellant administered gas as he had previously, and told the nurse to leave as she was not needed. CP struggled against the gas to maintain awareness, and then felt her skirt being moved. She hit out with her hands and pushed the appellant away from her. She screamed and yelled to attract attention. A nurse came into the room and stayed for the remainder of the consultation.
	
	
	CP told a school friend about what had happened. When she returned to see the appellant, her mother having made appointments for her, she refused to have gas. Nothing improper happened during these consultations. She later also told one of her sisters about her experiences.
	


The Expert Evidence


	
	Three expert witnesses were called at the voir dire and gave evidence before his Honour about the effects of nitrous oxide, a drug well known as a dental sedative. There was no issue that nitrous oxide was the “gas” or “happy gas” that the appellant had administered to the complainants and to the tendency / coincidence witnesses.
	
	
	Drs. Phillip Dey and Paul Gaudrey gave evidence in the Crown case. Dr. Stanley Malamed was called by the appellant. Each was asked to provide evidence as to the properties of nitrous oxide and its effects upon persons administered it, together with the possibility or likelihood of the drug inducing hallucinations of a sexual nature.
	
	
	There was general agreement about the properties and sedative effects of nitrous oxide, a colourless gas with a slight sweet smelling odour, which is administered by inhalation to induce a reversible state of unconsciousness, loss of pain sensation, and loss of responsiveness.
	
	
	It is a weak sedative, the anaesthetic effect of which is measured by reference to the “minimum alveolar concentration” (known as MAC), that being the concentration of vapour in the lungs needed to prevent motor response in half of all patients. The MAC for nitrous oxide is 104%, indicating the weakness of its sedative effect.
	
	
	When used in a clinical setting, such as for dentistry, nitrous oxide is typically administered through a nasal mask, mixed with oxygen. For an anti-anxiety effect the nitrous oxide would be expected to be administered as a gas comprised of 20% nitrous oxide and 80% oxygen. Those proportions vary when a more sedating effect is required, typically at 50% of each gas.
	
	
	The common terms “laughing gas” or “happy gas” have arisen because of the euphoric effect the vapour can have on persons inhaling it. It can also cause hallucinations, suggestibility, and increased imagination.
	
	
	Dr. Dey holds qualifications as a specialist anaesthetist. When reviewing the literature he found anecdotal accounts of patients experiencing hallucinations of a sexual nature when affected by nitrous oxide, but no reported accounts. In the course of his professional work, Dr. Dey had heard one or two reports of patients having dreams of a sexual nature when under the influence of the gas, but they were not distressing in nature and were clearly recognised as dreams.
	
	
	Dr. Dey concluded that, whilst the correlation of sexual hallucinations and nitrous oxide exists, it is very uncommon. He regarded it as very improbable that gas induced hallucinations could account for the number of persons describing a sexual experience whilst under the influence of nitrous oxide administered by the appellant.
	
	
	Dr. Dey suggested that it would be uncommon to seek to achieve an MAC level of any more than 50% when nitrous oxide was employed in dentistry. At such a level, a large proportion of patients would be aware of verbal commands and able to respond. It is likely that the patient would retain a memory of their experience when under the influence of nitrous oxide.
	
	
	A patient who later reported being unable to move or respond whilst under the influence of nitrous oxide was likely to have been administered a dose at a higher rate, with an MAC level of 70% or more.
	
	
	Whilst there was no professionally published protocol from the Dental Board for practitioners administering nitrous oxide to female patients, Dr. Dey deposed that there were recommendations for the presence of a female chaperone on such occasions, dating from as early as the nineteenth century.
	
	
	The doctor agreed that stimulation of a particular area of the body could enhance the likelihood of an hallucination connected to that area.
	
	
	Dr. Gaudry is also a medical practitioner. He agreed with Dr. Dey that there were reports of sexual hallucinations following the administration of nitrous oxide.
	
	
	Dr. Malamed holds qualifications as a dentist and dental anaesthesiologist. He deposed that nitrous oxide is a sedative that was commonly used in dentistry to distract fearful patients. He thought that the descriptions of affect given by witnesses in police statements was suggestive of a level of nitrous oxide having been administered which was either usual or greater than usual.
	
	
	Dr. Malamed said that there were reports of patients administered anaesthetic (of any type) experiencing sexual dreams, although the incidence was quite rare. He thought it possible that accidental contact by the dentist with a patient’s chest area could cause the sedated patient to feel some sexual stimulation in that area of the body.
	
	
	Dr. Malamed referred to one study involving volunteers administered concentrations of nitrous oxide at an increasing rate from 40% to 80% and noted that the incidence of dreams increased, from 2% at the lower concentration to 29% at the higher concentration. There was no suggestion that these dreams were specifically sexual in nature.
	
	
	The doctor also relied upon a study he had himself undertaken, using students who were administered nitrous oxide and subsequently asked to complete a questionnaire. Some twelve out of fifty-two students reported some form of sexual arousal. Sexual hallucinations were not referred to. The study was one conducted apparently without scientific rigour, without the knowledge of the students and, although published, it had not been peer reviewed.
	
	
	Dr. Malamed expressed some surprise that the appellant had persisted in his use of nitrous oxide at likely high levels, particularly when there had been demonstrable problems with it (such as VW kicking an instrument tray over, LY vomiting, and CP screaming out).
	
	
	The most that could be said having regard to the expert evidence was that patients administered nitrous oxide may experience dreams or hallucinations of a sexual nature, and that such dreams could be vivid, but the incidence was rare.
	


The Conclusions and Orders of the Primary Judge


	
	In a thorough and carefully considered judgment, the primary judge considered all of the evidence to determine whether the evidence of the complainants and of the tendency / coincidence witnesses was admissible pursuant to ss.97 and 98 of the Act, and whether the indictment should be severed.
	
	
	His Honour had regard to the terms of ss.97, 98 and 101 of the Act, and to the nature and probative value of the evidence that the Crown sought to lead.
	
	
	He concluded that the probative value of the evidence was very strong, and substantially outweighed the prejudicial effect it may have on the appellant. He concluded that the evidence should be admitted.
	
	
	Referring to DSJ v R [2012] NSWCCA 9 and the approach there suggested as to the assessment of probative value, his Honour concluded (at J21),
	


“[…] excepting the case of LK, neither the possibility of the claims being the product of sexual delusions induced by nitrous oxide nor any factor of collusion, contamination or publicity causes me to think that the strong probative value of the evidence of any of these women is destroyed or substantially weakened. The probative value of their evidence is substantial and in each case outweighs the prejudicial effect arising from the admission of the evidence as tendency and/or coincidence evidence.”


	
	As to the separate trials issue, the Crown indicated during the course of the voir dire that it would present a separate indictment for those charges relating to VB.
	
	
	His Honour ordered that the counts based upon the allegation made by LK (counts 13 and 14) should be severed, because of the evidence LK had given about the media articles she had read, and the information she obtained in that way prior to making her statement to police. His Honour concluded that there was a real possibility that the evidence of the witness had been contaminated, and it was appropriate for the allegations she made to be determined as a separate trial.
	
	
	The primary judge commented on the difficulty for both an accused person and a jury to come to terms with an indictment containing a large number of counts, and concluded that, for reasons of practicality rather than legal necessity, counts 4 to 7 and 9 to 14 should be separately tried. The basis upon which his Honour selected those counts was that the complainants were older than the other complainants whose allegations were reflected by charges on the indictment.
	
	
	Having regard to those orders, the Crown is permitted by the primary judge to present a joint indictment containing counts 1 – 3 (evidence of RC), 8 (evidence of CP), 16 (evidence of BM), and 27 (evidence of AM).
	
	
	Although he had concluded that the tendency / coincidence evidence was admissible, his Honour ordered that the Crown be restricted to calling a maximum of six witnesses to give tendency / coincidence evidence. This, his Honour reasoned, would allow the Crown to properly present its case, and the appellant to fairly meet it, without the trial being so large as to be potentially unfair or oppressive to the appellant.
	


The Proceedings on Appeal


	
	After judgment was delivered on 5 December 2014 and orders made, the appellant applied to his Honour to grant a certificate pursuant to s.5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to permit him to bring an appeal to this Court against the orders. The appellant advanced thirteen purported errors of the Court in relation to which he sought a certificate.
	
	
	Whilst his Honour did not accept the thirteen “errors” as worthy of a certificate, he was prepared to grant the certificate insofar as the issue of the legal significance of nitrous oxide and its relevance to the evidence of the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses was concerned.
	
	
	His Honour posed three questions for this Court to determine.
	



	
	“Whether the effect of the nitrous oxide on the patients was to destroy or weaken the possible probative value effect of the patients’ evidence such that it could not be proper criminal proof of the charges or any of them.
	
	
	Whether there is circumstantial evidence which, taken together with the complainants’ versions of what was alleged to have occurred under nitrous oxide could be proper criminal proof of the charges or any of them.
	
	
	Whether the evidentiary rulings in my judgment of 5 December 2014, and the orders made in the judgment are properly based in law.”
	



	
	It is important to note at the outset that an appeal brought pursuant to s.5F is not a rehearing. Rather, this Court's role pursuant to s.5F is to review the correctness of the interlocutory orders: R v BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260 at [264] per Hunt CJ at CL; TS v R [2014] NSWCCA 174 at [44].
	
	
	It is for the appellant to establish that error has occurred of the type referred to in House v the King (1936) 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	The appellant’s appeal advanced thirteen grounds, each ground corresponding to the asserted errors in relation to which his Honour was asked – but declined - to grant a certificate. Two grounds, 3 and 4, were abandoned at the hearing of the appeal. The grounds are:
	



	
	“His Honour erred in finding that the Tendency Evidence sought to be led by the Crown in accordance with a Tendency Notice served on 1 May 2014 (“Tendency Evidence”) was relevant pursuant to s.55 of the Evidence Act 1995;
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the Coincidence Evidence sought to be led by the Crown in accordance with a Coincidence Notice served on 1 May 2014 (“Coincidence Evidence”) was relevant pursuant to s.55 of the Evidence Act 1995;
	
	
	Abandoned
	
	
	Abandoned
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the Coincidence Evidence and Tendency Evidence had substantial probative value;
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the probative value of the Tendency Evidence and the Coincidence Evidence substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant;
	
	
	His Honour erred in failing to consider whether the Tendency Evidence was primarily directed to excluding the possibility that the complainant experienced a sexual hallucination as opposed to demonstrating a Tendency of the Appellant;
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the expert evidence relating to the effects of Nitrous Oxide did not have the capacity to significantly diminish the effect of the Tendency Evidence and Coincidence Evidence;
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that there was no evidence as to whether the proportion of Nitrous Oxide administered by the Appellant was above 50%;
	
	
	His Honour erred by taking into account in determining whether the Tendency Evidence and Coincidence Evidence had significant probative value, irrelevant considerations;
	



	
	Complaint Evidence; and
	
	
	The absence of a nurse or a third party;
	



	
	His Honour erred in failing to consider the process by which a jury could reason toward guilt in light of the expert evidence;
	
	
	His Honour erred in denying the appellant procedural fairness by not allowing Counsel for the appellant to cross examine the complainants on the substantive allegations but relied on those versions as an unchallenged version of events; and
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that there was no substantial risk of contamination of evidence having regard to the risk of affectation by Nitrous Oxide, collusion, contamination and publicity.”
	



	
	There is a considerable degree of overlap between the grounds and they will be considered together where possible, consistent with the approach of the parties.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding that the Tendency Evidence sought to be led by the Crown in accordance with a Tendency Notice served on 1 May 2014 (“Tendency Evidence”) was relevant pursuant to s.55 of the Evidence Act 1995;

Ground 2: His Honour erred in finding that the Coincidence Evidence sought to be led by the Crown in accordance with a Coincidence Notice served on 1 May 2014 (“Coincidence Evidence”) was relevant pursuant to s.55 of the Evidence Act 1995;

Ground 5: His Honour erred in finding that the Coincidence Evidence and Tendency Evidence had substantial probative value;

Ground 6: His Honour erred in finding that the probative value of the Tendency Evidence and the Coincidence Evidence substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant;

Ground 11: His Honour erred in failing to consider the process by which a jury could reason toward guilt in light of the expert evidence.


	
	These grounds assert error in the conclusion of the primary judge that the disputed evidence was relevant, and met the tests established by ss.97, 98, and 101 of the Act.
	
	
	(It is noted that there are two grounds numbered 11 in the appellant’s written submissions. Each deals with a different issue.)
	
	
	The appellant contends that, because nitrous oxide can induce hallucinations of a sexual nature in patients, with such hallucinations capable of being vivid, neither the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses themselves, nor the experts, can be certain that the experience each witness complains of was in fact real. That being so, the evidence of the women is incapable of rationally affecting an assessment of whether the alleged assaults occurred. The applicant additionally argues that, on this basis, the evidence cannot have significant probative value, and any probative value it may have does not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect. The appellant contends that his Honour was in error in finding to the contrary.
	
	
	Relevant evidence is evidence “that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding”: s.55.
	
	
	The fact in issue in the proceedings is whether the appellant committed the offence charged by each count.
	
	
	Evidence is not admissible to establish that a person has a particular tendency unless notice provisions have been complied with, and the evidence has significant probative value: s.97.
	
	
	Evidence that two or more similar events occurred in circumstances sufficiently similar as to make it improbable that the events are explained by coincidence is not admissible unless notice provisions are complied with, and the evidence has significant probative value: s.98.
	
	
	There was no issue before his Honour about failure to comply with notice provisions. The Crown has served notices articulating the use it sought to make of evidence it contended was admissible pursuant to these provisions.
	
	
	The questions then are: is the evidence relevant; does it have significant probative value; and does the probative value substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant contends that the answer to each question should be no, but the appellant’s argument is flawed by a misunderstanding of some of the evidence that was before his Honour, and the way in which it will fall to be assessed by any jury. These misunderstandings underpin each of the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant.
	
	
	The appellant’s overall argument is based upon a fallacious understanding of the evidence, in which it is concluded that none of the women who complained of being assaulted by the appellant can be sure that the experience was real and not imagined, and, that none of the experts called to testify were able to conclude that any individual experience reported by a witness was in fact a real experience.
	
	
	Contrary to the appellant’s contention, it was not the evidence of any of the complainants or the tendency / coincidence witnesses that she was not sure if the assault complained of was real. To the contrary, each woman who gave evidence before his Honour offered a seemingly credible and realistic account of events. Whilst all referred to the effects of the nitrous oxide and the strange feelings the drug induced, none expressed any uncertainty as to the reality of the experience. As the primary judge said, at J5,
	


“Each lady presented her piece to the court convincingly, apparently firmly persuaded in her own mind of the reality of what she said had occurred in the dental surgery.”


	
	That conclusion, which was well open to his Honour, is not diminished by the argument advanced by the appellant in reliance on the expert evidence as to the nature of the recollections of the witnesses.
	
	
	On the voir dire his Honour allowed the appellant to ask the expert witnesses to express an opinion as to whether each of the witnesses who gave evidence of having been assaulted by the appellant had a genuine memory, or merely a memory of an imagined event. None of the three doctors was able to say.
	
	
	Dr. Gaudrey expressed it this way in his report:
	


“This review of the effects of nitrous oxide on patients and the ability of patients to recall events after the inhalation of nitrous oxide does not alone prove or disprove that sexual assaults occurred on the [alleged] victims.”


	
	Dr. Dey had a similar view, although he thought the number of women complaining of assault at the appellant’s hands was significant.
	
	
	Dr. Malamed asserted in his evidence on the voir dire (at T298):
	


“I cannot say that there is any one case where I am convinced it did happen.”


	
	Dr. Malamed was in error when he concluded in his evidence that each of the women had said she was not sure of the reality of the remembered experience; that was simply not the evidence. Whilst some women spoke of their experience as having a dreamlike quality, none expressed any present reservation about the reality of the assault.
	
	
	Setting that aside, however, the questions asked of the experts to elicit opinion of this type could not be asked at trial: R v Davis [2004] NSWCCA 298. To do so invites the experts to go beyond their expertise, and to usurp the function of the jury, in whose sole province the answers to such questions properly lays.
	
	
	The opinion of the doctors, or of any other witness, as to whether the accounts of the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses are to be accepted as credible is irrelevant and inadmissible. Opinion of this nature cannot aid the appellant, or lead to a conclusion that the primary judge was in error in his judgment and orders.
	
	
	Opinion evidence is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed: s.76. Section 79 creates an exception to that rule where the opinion is based upon specialised knowledge. But an expert such as a doctor is no more qualified to express an opinion as to the reliability of a complainant’s allegation than any other person. That conclusion is wholly reserved for the tribunal of fact.
	
	
	The experts in this matter can do no more than give evidence of matters within their specialised knowledge; here, that includes the nature and properties of nitrous oxide, its use and effects, any side effects including dreaming or hallucinations known through scientific and experiential research, and so on.
	
	
	It is no part of the function of the experts to assess the credibility of a witness.
	
	
	When the jury performs that task, it will be asked to do so on the basis of an assessment of all of the evidence, a feature seemingly overlooked by the appellant. The Crown has available to it evidence other than the testimony of individual complainants standing alone.
	
	
	The evidence of other women who assert similar experiences is, prima facie, admissible. But there is also circumstantial evidence which is capable of supporting the charges.
	
	
	The jury will be able to consider the fact that the appellant administered a sedating vapour to each woman in circumstances where no dental nurse remained in the room. A jury may think that ordinary prudence would suggest that a chaperone should have been present, even absent any professional standard to that effect.
	
	
	There is also evidence from which a jury may infer that the appellant made a deliberate choice to be alone in the surgery with women to whom nitrous oxide was administered. Some of the women had appointments scheduled at times when the nurse had left for the day; others gave evidence of the nurse being told to leave. Most said there was no nurse in the room. There is evidence of mishaps with patients under the influence of nitrous oxide (such as CP who began screaming and yelling, and VD who kicked over a tray of instruments) such that a jury would be entitled to question the appellant’s ongoing practice of treating women subject to the drug when alone in the surgery.
	
	
	The sedative was administered to some of the women in circumstances where there could have been no legitimate need for it, such as in the case of SD who, on attending for a check-up, was sedated by the appellant.
	
	
	A jury may conclude that the strong effect of the sedative described by most of the women is suggestive that the appellant administered a dose much higher than that which was required for proper use as an anti-anxiety or pain relief medication.
	
	
	Some of the witnesses gave evidence of physical signs consistent with the assaults alleged to have been committed. JD for example, discovered that her blouse had been unbuttoned whilst she was alone in the surgery with the appellant and heavily sedated by nitrous oxide. SD, on returning home from the appellant’s surgery, discovered reddening and small lacerations to her upper thighs and genital area. LY, on recovering from nitrous oxide intoxication, observed the appellant’s penis to be exposed.
	
	
	All of this evidence (which is not a complete account of the evidence available to the Crown) will be available to the tribunal of fact to inform the assessment made of the reliability of the evidence given by the complainants. That task will not be approached, as the appellant’s argument pre-supposes, by considering in isolation a complainant’s evidence.
	
	
	His Honour was cognisant of this and, in his judgment, he gave thorough consideration to the availability of other evidence which would bear on the assessment to be made by the jury of the Crown’s case at trial in determining whether the charges had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The additional evidence to be called by the Crown is relevant to the question of its probative value, and that was the way in which his Honour approached the question of the tendency / coincidence evidence.
	
	
	Considered against an accurate understanding of the evidence, and bearing in mind the limited role that expert testimony can play in the circumstances of this case, many of the appellant’s proposed grounds of appeal fall away as misconceived.
	
	
	Although the appellant argues that the evidence intended to be led from both the complainants and the tendency / coincidence witnesses does not meet the test of relevance, this claim presupposes that the sort of opinion evidence given on the voir dire by Dr. Malamed (as to whether or not he regarded the evidence as reliable) is admissible. It is not.
	
	
	It also presupposes that the disputed evidence will be assessed in isolation. It will not.
	
	
	For those witnesses who are to be called at trial by the Crown as complainants, the evidence of each will be tendered as proof of the elements of the offences of which each woman individually complains. As evidence going directly to the commission of the offences alleged, the evidence of each complainant is plainly relevant to the assessment of whether the appellant did that which he is alleged to have done.
	
	
	The evidence of each complainant thus meets the requirements of s.55 and is admissible as proof of the individual counts. How it is assessed will be a matter for a jury.
	
	
	The evidence of each of the women, including those whose allegations are not the subject of a charge, is also evidence capable of rebutting a defence, and is additionally relevant in that way.
	
	
	Although an accused person has the time honoured benefit of not being obliged to reveal the nature of his or her defence to the prosecution or to the Court (except in a very few limited circumstances, such as where an alibi is to be relied upon) it is open to the Crown to lead evidence which rebuts an anticipated defence. Here, it is available to the appellant to argue at trial that the complaints against him could be explained by the incidence of sexual hallucinations attributable statistically to nitrous oxide intoxication.
	
	
	The evidence in the Crown case that suggests that a significant number of women allege assaults of a sexual nature against the appellant, and some of them on multiple occasions, goes to rebut that anticipated defence.
	
	
	For those women whose allegation is not the subject of a charge, or where the Crown seeks to rely upon evidence of one complainant to go to proof of a charge or charges relevant to the allegations of another complainant, the primary judge admitted the evidence as both tendency and coincidence evidence.
	
	
	In considering the admissibility of the evidence, the primary judge had regard to the terms of ss.97 and 98, and to the additional exclusionary provision set out at s.101 of the Act.
	
	
	Sections 97 and 98 require the court to make an assessment of the capacity of the disputed evidence to rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue, to a significant extent. The use of the word “could” in the definition of “probative value” provided by the Dictionary to the Act indicates that the court is not obliged to determine that the evidence will in fact have such an affect; it is its capacity to do so which is determinative of its admissibility pursuant to s.97 or s.98.
	
	
	In the context of making the assessment, regard must also be had to whether there is a real possibility of an alternative explanation not consistent with guilt.
	
	
	The Court must have regard to the evidence on its own, or together with other evidence to be adduced by the party seeking to tender it.
	
	
	That is precisely what the primary judge did here.
	
	
	His Honour reviewed the evidence of each complainant and each tendency / coincidence witness. He considered its relevance, and its probative value, and made an assessment of the extent of its probative value. In performing the latter task, his Honour carefully examined the possibility that some or all of the witness accounts of assault were explained by nitrous oxide intoxication or, whether contamination or concoction could realistically have played a role.
	
	
	The assessment of the probative value of the evidence was, in conformity with the relevant section of the Act, undertaken by examining the evidence having regard to the other evidence to be adduced by the Crown, including circumstantial evidence. The appellant’s complaint that his Honour was not entitled to have regard to other evidence when undertaking this assessment (ground 10) is misconceived, and fails to consider the requirements of ss.97 and 98, which mandate such an approach.
	
	
	It is noted that, although his Honour heard evidence on the voir dire from Dr. Malamed, called by the appellant, that evidence did not materially contribute to his Honour’s conclusions about the probative value of the evidence of the women. Having regard to the wording of ss.97 and 98, the doctor’s evidence was not relevant to an assessment of probative value.
	
	
	In my view, the primary judge properly applied the law to the question of the admissibility of the evidence as tendency and coincidence evidence, and was correct in the conclusions he reached.
	
	
	The evidence that the appellant was alleged to have assaulted other women, in his dental surgery, during the course of a dental consultation, after administering nitrous oxide to each, was highly probative of the offences charged. Its significance is such that it substantially outweighs the danger of prejudice to the appellant. There was no error.
	
	
	Grounds 1 and 2, which I regard as encompassed by the terms of the certificate granted by his Honour and thus brought without need for leave, are unmeritorious. I would dismiss each.
	
	
	Grounds 5 and 6 refer to the tests for the admissibility of tendency / coincidence evidence. They too are encompassed by the certificate and there is no requirement for leave. These grounds have not been made out and I would dismiss each of them.
	
	
	Ground 11 is also encompassed by the certificate granted by his Honour. The ground is misconceived, and I would dismiss it.
	


Ground 7: His Honour erred in failing to consider whether the Tendency Evidence was primarily directed to excluding the possibility that the complainant experienced a sexual hallucination as opposed to demonstrating a Tendency of the Appellant


	
	Although this ground complains that his Honour failed to consider whether the tendency evidence was tendered by the Crown for another purpose, it is notable that he was not asked to do so. His Honour can hardly be in error for not doing that which he was not asked to do.
	
	
	This ground is misconceived in any event since the evidence, once admitted, is available for use for other purposes, subject to any request to limit the use to be made of it pursuant to s.136 of the Act.
	
	
	Whether the “primary purpose” of the evidence was to demonstrate a tendency on the appellant’s part, or to exclude the possibility that the alleged assaults were no more than hallucinations induced by a sedative, the evidence is available to be used for both purposes.
	
	
	The appellant’s complaint appears to be that the rulings of the primary judge in allowing tendency and coincidence evidence to be led by the Crown wrongly allows the Crown to rely upon it to rebut the defence of hallucination as accounting for the allegations. As discussed above, the evidence is clearly admissible for that purpose, and no error is disclosed.
	
	
	This ground falls outside the parameters of the certificate granted by the primary judge, and leave is required to advance it. I would not grant leave.
	


Ground 8: His Honour erred in finding that the expert evidence relating to the effects of Nitrous Oxide did not have the capacity to significantly diminish the effect of the Tendency Evidence and Coincidence Evidence;


	
	The argument underpinning this ground has been dealt with in relation to grounds 1, 2, 5, 6 and 11, above. It relies upon a misapprehension as to the admissibility of opinion evidence from the three medical and dental experts. The appellant’s argument supposes that, because none of the experts could say conclusively in evidence before his Honour that any individual allegation was not the product of hallucination, the probative value of the proposed tendency / coincidence evidence is so diminished as to be valueless.
	
	
	As discussed above, any opinion to this effect is not admissible before the tribunal of fact. It will be a matter for the jury – not the experts - to assess the reliability of the testimony of the complainants, in light of all of the evidence adduced at trial.
	
	
	His Honour was entirely correct in his conclusions in this regard. No error has been demonstrated.
	


Ground 9: His Honour erred in finding that there was no evidence as to whether the proportion of Nitrous Oxide administered by the Appellant was above 50%


	
	This ground is based upon a misunderstanding of the evidence. The complaint is that the primary judge erred in concluding that there was no evidence that the nitrous oxide administered to the appellant’s patients was administered at a rate above 50%. The purported significance of the dosage is that there is some evidence that dreams or hallucinations may be more common at a higher dosage rate.
	
	
	His Honour’s conclusions in this regard were no more than a reflection of the evidence: there was, in fact, no evidence of the rate at which the appellant administered nitrous oxide to his patients. There was evidence from the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses of the effects that each felt when administered the sedative by the appellant, and some of the symptoms described could suggest a high dosage level. That, however, was as far as the evidence went.
	
	
	The evidence from former patients of the appellant who are to be called by the Crown as to the effect of nitrous oxide was quite pronounced. Witnesses gave evidence of having felt unable to move, unable to move limbs, unable to speak or call out, frozen, unable to react, and so on. It would be open to a jury to conclude that the rate at which the appellant administered nitrous oxide to the witnesses was higher than is indicated for ordinary dental sedation. Whilst this may give rise to a conclusion that each was sedated at a high rate, and therefore more susceptible to hallucinations, another conclusion is at least equally available. That is, that the patients were deliberately administered a high rate of the drug so as to facilitate the assaults the appellant is alleged to have committed against each, by rendering the patients unable to resist.
	
	
	Patient records did not establish the rate at which the appellant administered nitrous oxide to specific patients, and there was no other evidence capable of establishing that feature of the appellant’s practice.
	
	
	The appellant, who would presumably have, at least, knowledge of his usual practice at the relevant time, did not give evidence.
	
	
	There was no error by the primary judge. This ground is misconceived. It is not encompassed by the certificate issued by the primary judge and I would refuse leave to advance it.
	


Ground 10: His Honour erred by taking into account in determining whether the Tendency Evidence and Coincidence Evidence had significant probative value, irrelevant considerations;

(i)   Complaint Evidence; and

(ii)   The absence of a nurse or a third party.


	
	This ground, numbered 10 in the pleaded grounds of appeal, but referred to as the second ground 11 in the appellant’s written submissions, reflects a misunderstanding of the task the primary judge had to perform, in compliance with ss.97 and 98 of the Act.
	
	
	The appellant complains that the primary judge was in error in having regard to other evidence to be adduced by the Crown when assessing whether the evidence of the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses had significant probative value.
	
	
	Sections 97 and 98 require the trial judge to consider other evidence when carrying out this assessment.
	


“97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value (emphasis added).”


	
	Section 98(1)(b) is in identical terms.
	
	
	His Honour was obliged by the terms of ss.97 and 98 to have regard to other evidence adduced by the Crown. Both complaint evidence, and the evidence of the absence of a nurse in the room at the time most of the women allege an assault at the appellant’s hands, have the capacity to enhance the probative value of the tendency and coincidence evidence.
	
	
	Evidence of complaint may be relevant in two ways. A majority of the witnesses gave evidence of having complained about the appellant’s conduct immediately after the alleged assault occurred.
	
	
	Where there is evidence of complaint made soon after the assault, when the event might be expected to be fresh in the memory of the complainant, the evidence is likely to be admissible pursuant to s.66 of the Act: Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606; Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297; R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49. The jury may use such evidence as proof of the fact asserted.
	
	
	Whilst a complainant who believes that an hallucination was in fact real may make complaint in the same way as a person who experienced a real event, the evidence is still available to the jury, and it may provide some support for the allegation.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, evidence of later complaint may also be admissible, to buttress the credit of a witness pursuant to s.108(3) of the Act. For those witnesses who came forward and made a police statement only after having learnt through media reports or another person that the appellant had been charged, there may be a challenge made by the appellant at trial, as there was during the voir dire hearing, to the effect that the witness has exaggerated her account, or that it has been contaminated in some way by information gained from external sources.
	
	
	In those circumstances it will be open to the Crown, with the leave of the court, to call evidence of a later complaint, not sufficiently proximate to the event to be fresh in the memory, where that complaint pre-dates the media publicity concerning the appellant’s arrest. RC for example, told her husband in 2010 about what the appellant had done to her. Evidence of this nature is capable of rebutting any claim that the witness invented her complaint after reading or hearing about the first of the charges brought against the appellant. It is capable in this way of buttressing the credit of the witness: Graham, R v DBG [2002] NSWCCA 328; (2002) 133 A Crim R 227.
	
	
	This evidence will be available to the Crown and his Honour was right to have regard to it.
	
	
	The absence of a dental nurse in the surgery when assaults were alleged to have taken place is also evidence available to the Crown, which the primary judge was correct to consider. The fact that virtually all of the women who complain of an assault gave evidence that the dental nurse was not present at the time is evidence capable of providing circumstantial support for the allegations. Particularly in circumstances where the appellant must have been aware of the possibility of adverse reactions to nitrous oxide, common sense would suggest a nurse would ordinarily be present to assist the dentist. It will be open to any jury to conclude that the dental nurse was sent home or out of the surgery to facilitate assaults upon female patients.
	
	
	This was evidence that his Honour was both entitled and obliged to consider.
	
	
	No error has been established and, the ground not being encompassed by the certificate issued by the primary judge, I would not grant leave to advance it.
	


Ground 12: His Honour erred in denying the appellant procedural fairness by not allowing Counsel for the appellant to cross examine the complainants on the substantive allegations but relied on those versions as an unchallenged version of events.


	
	The appellant advanced no argument in either his written submissions or his submissions before this Court which identified any error on the part of the primary judge in the way in which the voir dire was conducted.
	
	
	The appellant pleads that the primary judge denied him procedural fairness in declining to allow him to cross examine the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses during the voir dire hearing about any aspect of their evidence, without restriction.
	
	
	Section 189 of the Act governs the circumstances in which a voir dire can be held. It does not provide any statutory right for a party in criminal proceedings to have a voir dire. Such a hearing is only to be held to determine a preliminary question concerning, relevantly, whether evidence should be admitted.
	
	
	In determining whether the tendency / coincidence evidence should be admitted, the relevant considerations were the effect on the evidence of a witness of nitrous oxide intoxication, and the possibility that the evidence of particular witnesses had been contaminated by media reports and other external sources of information. The primary judge limited the areas of evidence to be tested to these. I can discern no error in that course.
	
	
	A voir dire is not an opportunity for open-ended cross-examination of witnesses whose evidence may be adverse to a party, and it is not an opportunity to test evidence in the way that might occur when a matter is before the Local Court for committal, assuming the tests established by ss.91(3) and 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 are satisfied.
	
	
	Here, the primary judge correctly identified the evidentiary issues relevant to a determination of the admissibility of the disputed evidence, and confined oral evidence to those issues. There was no denial of procedural fairness and no error in that approach.
	
	
	The appellant appears to rely upon a paragraph in his Honour's judgment, where he referred to the fact that a particular witness (CP) had not been cross-examined on a particular issue, as demonstrating a lack of procedural fairness. I regard that paragraph as no more than his Honour noting the limitations that applied at the voir dire hearing, where witnesses were not tested on every aspect of the evidence each could give. I do not read the two sentences of that paragraph as demonstrating or even suggesting a denial of procedural fairness.
	
	
	This ground is not encompassed by the certificate granted by the District Court and leave is required to advance it. I would not grant leave.
	


Ground 13: His Honour erred in finding that there was no substantial risk of contamination of evidence having regard to the risk of affectation by Nitrous oxide, collusion, contamination and publicity.


	
	This ground was pleaded as ground 13, but referred to in the appellant’s written submissions as ground 9.
	
	
	In support of this ground, the appellant contends that a different conclusion should have been reached by the primary judge in his consideration of the possibility that the evidence of the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses had been contaminated, but no House v The King error is identified. It is not suggested that his Honour acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, made a mistake of fact, or did not take into account some material consideration.
	
	
	Having reviewed the evidence and the judgment delivered on 5 December 2014, I can see no error. His Honour very carefully and thoroughly considered the possibility of the evidence of individual witnesses having been adversely effected by nitrous oxide intoxication and concluded – correctly in my view – that there was nothing in the evidence before him to lead to a conclusion that the evidence of alleged assaults was necessarily based upon nothing more than fantasy.
	
	
	He carefully considered all evidence that could give rise to a suggestion of concoction, but – again, correctly in my view – determined that, in all but one instance (where the evidence was excluded), there was no realistic possibility that the evidence had been concocted. He similarly considered the questions of publicity and possible contamination of evidence, but found no basis upon which to exclude the evidence of the complainants and tendency / coincidence witnesses.
	
	
	I have not found any error in the approach of the primary judge to his task.
	
	
	I would dismiss this ground.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I propose are these:
	



	
	Leave to appeal on grounds 7, 9, 10, and 12 is refused.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	


The Questions Posed by the Primary Judge


	
	I would answer the questions posed by his Honour as follows:
	



	
	No
	
	
	Yes
	
	
	Yes.

2767034,Herbert v R [2015] NSWCCA 172,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Joshua Herbert (“the applicant”) applies for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court at Wollongong by his Honour Judge Conlon SC on 18 April 2013 for three offences of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely the infliction of actual bodily harm.
	
	
	These offences are contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. There is also prescribed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole component of 7 years. This involved partial accumulation of individual sentences of 6 years, 6 years and 8 years. The first sentence was specified to date from 29 October 2011. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 28 October 2018.
	
	
	Leave is sought to appeal on the following grounds:
	


1   The sentencing judge failed to allow a separate discount for the applicant’s assistance to authorities (an “Ellis Discount”)

2   The sentencing judge erred in the way he structured the sentences

Facts


	
	There was an agreed statement of facts which disclosed that on 27 October 2011 the victim, a 55 year old woman, was walking along a beach at Callala Bay in Jervis Bay, something she had done regularly in the recent past. The applicant approached her from behind, grabbed her and put a hand over her mouth. He punched her twice to the face as he told her to stop screaming. She fell to the ground and he dragged her towards some bushes. She pleaded, “I’ve got grandchildren. Please don’t kill me”. He told her he would not if she did what she was told.
	
	
	He removed her pants, pulled her legs apart and digitally penetrated her vagina. She could smell alcohol on his breath. He said, “This is better than your poofter husband isn’t it?” and repeated, “Isn’t it, isn’t it”. Fearing for her safety she agreed. He told her to “Stop your fucking crying”. He licked and sucked her genital area and then put his hands around her neck applying pressure to her throat with his thumbs. She thought she was going to die and soon lost consciousness.
	
	
	When she regained consciousness she opened her eyes to see his face a short distance from hers. He said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that. I shouldn’t have done that”. She pleaded with him to let her go, swearing that she would not report what had occurred. He said, “You better not”. She said, “I swear on my grandchildren’s lives that I won’t” and he responded by threatening her, “Fuck your grandchildren. Be worried about your children”. He told her to count to 100 before she got up. She did so and when she got up she saw him further down the beach, ankle deep in the water.
	
	
	The victim quickly made her way home and the matter was reported. Police and ambulance officers arrived a short time later. She was examined at hospital and the nurse noted that she had significant facial swelling and bruising. Her right ear canal was swollen to the extent that the canal could not be visualised. There was also extensive bruising and a number of abrasions to her head, neck and arms. There was a red abrasion to the posterior surface of the vaginal entrance which the nurse said was typically caused by stretching or friction.
	
	
	The applicant voluntarily attended a police station two days later and told them that he had seen numerous media articles and reports on Facebook about the assault on the victim and became concerned that he may have been involved. He said that he had consumed a substantial amount of alcohol on the day as well as a number of pain killing tablets (Codeine). He said he had a history of alcohol and prescription drug abuse and experienced “black-outs” during which he would fly into a rage and become violent and aggressive. He said that after this occurs he feels exhausted the following day and this is how he felt the day after this incident. He did not remember the incident but when asked if he thought he committed the offences he said, “Yes, I think I did it”. He had experienced nightmares or flittering visions of seeing a lady getting grabbed from behind and he was not sure if these were dreams or memories.
	
	
	The applicant consented to police searching his home. They found two letters he had written to his girlfriend and the son of a friend apologising for his actions and indicating that he thought he would be “going away for a while”. The applicant’s DNA was subsequently detected in semen recovered from the victim’s vagina.
	
	
	A victim impact statement, which was tendered without objection, related the substantial psychological trauma the victim continued to experience as a result of the applicant’s conduct.
	


The applicant’s personal circumstances


	
	The applicant was born in 1984 and is now aged 30.
	
	
	He has a criminal history which is of no present significance (low-range PCA in 2006 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2008, in respect of both of which he was fined).
	
	
	Amongst the material tendered to the sentencing judge were two reports by Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, and a letter from the applicant’s mother. The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	He had an unremarkable upbringing. He was a promising junior rugby league player. His parents separated when he was 17. He tried out to play rugby league professionally but was unsuccessful. He stopped playing as a result of the increasing frequency and severity of headaches he was experiencing and he did not want to risk being knocked unconscious again.
	
	
	The applicant commenced drinking at the age of 16 when playing first grade in a country rugby league side. By the age of 19 he was drinking a substantial amount on a daily basis.
	
	
	At the time of the offences he was in a relationship and he and his partner had a 3 year old daughter. He had a 6 year old daughter from a previous relationship. He told Dr Furst that he had struggled with separations in his relationships, particularly when he and his current partner had separated two months before the birth of their daughter. He had carried out two attempts on his life at that time; one by overdosing on medication and the other by carbon monoxide poisoning.
	
	
	The applicant had received treatment for depression. In 2011 he had been observed to have ongoing depression with symptoms of hopelessness, insomnia and agitation. He had moved with his family to Callala Bay early that year but he remained depressed and reported being stressed, tired and had trouble sleeping. Around the time of the offences he was working in two jobs as a cleaner but quit one the week before. Dr Furst said that this workload only added to his chronic tiredness and low mood.
	
	
	The applicant said in his evidence that in the week leading up to the day of the offences, after having ceased work in one job and having his wages cut back in his second job he “really started pounding the drink and the drugs and the codeine too”. On the day of the offences he had consumed alcohol and codeine and the drug known as “ice” as well.
	


Findings by the sentencing judge


	
	The learned judge accepted that the offences were not planned or premeditated; “it would seem that the attack was a spur of the moment decision by the offender under the influence of alcohol and drugs”. However, he noted, it was swift and violent. The victim’s physical injuries were not long lasting but the psychological and emotional impact was such that she “will continue to suffer consequences well into the future”.
	
	
	The applicant’s intoxication by alcohol and drugs was not regarded as a mitigating factor but served to provide a possible explanation “as to how his judgment was impaired and led to this appalling out of character conduct”.
	
	
	His Honour regarded the offences as “most serious”.
	
	
	The applicant’s remorse was accepted to be genuine; indeed the judge said:
	


“I have presided over so many similar sentence proceedings yet I have not seen a more contrite offender.”


	
	His Honour accepted that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The utilitarian value of the applicant’s early pleas of guilty was rewarded with a 25 per cent reduction of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	As to the issue of the applicant having voluntarily attended the police station to disclose his responsibility for the offences, his Honour said:
	


“In accordance with the submissions of Mr Pearsall (counsel for the offender) I have taken into account the fact that it was the offender himself who came forward and handed himself in to the police. Whilst he was given the opportunity of seeking legal advice he declined and proceeded to voluntarily take part in the police interview. That factor does reflect well in respect of his contrition. In my view it also has a bearing on his prospects of rehabilitation.

However, I do not believe that it rises to a level where the offender would be entitled to a ‘significant added element of leniency’ as per an Ellis type discount. This was a small community. There was an immediate complaint and investigation launched and there was, of course, the photograph of the offender fishing at the beach on the afternoon in question.”


	
	The judge referred to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 and said that he was mindful of the legislative guideposts provided by the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	It was determined that the sentences for the individual offences should be partially accumulated so as to reflect appropriately the totality of criminality. This was said to be sufficient reason to find special circumstances so as to vary the statutory ratio in relation the non-parole and parole periods. (The overall non-parole component is 70 per cent of the total term.)
	


Ground 1 – failure to allow a “separate discount” for assistance to authorities (an “Ellis discount”)


	
	An “Ellis discount” is a reference to R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 where Street CJ said (at 604):
	


“This court has said on a number of occasions that a plea of guilty will entitle a convicted person to an element of leniency in the sentence.

…

When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.

The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well-recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.”


	
	The applicant conceded that the sentencing judge did take into account his voluntary attendance at the police station and disclosure of his responsibility for the offences but submitted nonetheless that there was error in not taking this into account in the way outlined in R v Ellis.
	
	
	It was submitted that the applicant was not a suspect. It was not a case in which he knew he was going to be found out. His motivation for handing himself in was a realisation that he may have been involved, not that he feared he was going to be caught.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that the impact of such conduct may vary from case to case. An example of a case in which there was no need to afford significant leniency was Zhang v R [2011] NSWCCA 233 where there was a real likelihood that guilt would have been established without the offender’s admission. It was submitted that this was not the case for the applicant.
	
	
	It was also submitted that an “Ellis discount” is not reserved solely for cases involving a confession of guilt for offences police did not know occurred. In Windle v R [2012] NSWCCA 222, Basten JA said (at [36]) that a voluntary disclosure might include (a) revelation of an offence unknown to the authorities; (b) revelation of the offender’s identity; or (c) revelation of an aspect of the offending unknown to the authorities. His Honour added: “The extent of the appropriate element of leniency must depend on the extent of the voluntary revelation.” In that case the victim had told police of the offence and the offender; it was only that the offender had assisted police to prove the necessary element of intention that entitled him to a reduction of sentence for assistance.
	
	
	Counsel argued that the applicant’s assistance fell into the second of the categories listed by Basten JA. It could not be assumed, as the sentencing judge did, that the applicant’s responsibility for the offences would have been discovered by police because it occurred in a small community; an investigation was being carried out; and that the police had a photograph of the applicant fishing at the beach on the afternoon in question. The photographs, it was submitted, were of such poor quality that it was not open to conclude that the applicant would have been identified. The community of Callala Bay might have been a small one but there were towns nearby; the larger town of Nowra was 20 minutes away; and it was a popular tourist area.
	
	
	It was also submitted that even if it could be supposed that investigations might eventually reveal a person’s involvement in some offending behaviour, this did not disentitle the offender from a “significant amelioration” of the otherwise appropriate sentence for promptly volunteering a confession. That was the situation in R v Hasan [2005] NSWCCA 21 where the offender received “some recognition and leniency”.
	
	
	Counsel also identified “a very strong public interest” in an offender such as the applicant coming forward, referring to Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [91]-[98]
	
	
	In short, the applicant’s submission was that he was entitled to a significant added element of leniency for his confession and the judge was wrong to dismiss this as a mitigating factor in the way that he did.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the judge did take into account the applicant’s voluntary disclosure of his guilt by finding that it reflected well in respect of his contrition and his prospects of rehabilitation. It was submitted to have been open to the judge to take into account that the applicant’s guilt would be discovered in determining that it was inappropriate to allow a further degree of leniency. Although he was not a suspect at the time, the police had other evidence both available at the time and to come, including DNA evidence which would have proved the applicant’s guilt without any admissions on his part.
	
	
	The Crown referred to s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which is to the effect that a lesser penalty imposed to take into account an offender’s assistance to authorities must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. With the 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty and the finding of special circumstances, it was submitted that any further reduction would have rendered the ultimate sentence “too far out of touch with the circumstances of the offences”.
	


Consideration


	
	In Ryan v The Queen, McHugh J said (at [15]):
	


“The statement in Ellis that ‘the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency’ is a statement of a general principle or perhaps more accurately of a factor to be taken into account. It is not the statement of a rule to be quantitatively, rigidly or mechanically applied. It is an indication that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the disclosure of what was an unknown offence is a significant and not an insubstantial matter to be considered on the credit side of the sentencing process. How significant depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.


	
	There are four components in the impugned passage of the sentencing remarks (see above at [26]):
	


The judge said he had “taken into account the fact that it was the offender himself who came forward and handed himself in to the police”.

This reflected well in respect of his contrition.

It also had a bearing on his prospects of rehabilitation.

It did not rise to a level where the offender would be entitled to a “significant added element of leniency”, implicitly because his responsibility would likely have been detected.


	
	I cannot accept the Crown’s reference to the police having evidence such as the identification of the applicant’s DNA which would have proved the offence without his admissions. The point is that at the time he went to the police station there is no suggestion that he was a suspect. And the DNA evidence only arose because he agreed to provide a sample when he went to the police station. There was no suggestion that he had previously provided a sample with which a comparison could have been made.
	
	
	I also cannot accept the Crown’s reference to the finding of special circumstances in the submission about the potential for unreasonable disproportion if the applicant had been allowed any further leniency. A finding of special circumstances, of course, only affects the non-parole component of a sentence, not the total term.
	
	
	There was ample evidence of the applicant’s remorse and his good prospects of rehabilitation aside from his voluntary disclosure of his guilt. In other words, he was entitled to have those matters of mitigation taken into account in his favour in any event.
	
	
	I cannot see that the sentencing judge has allowed the applicant any benefit over and above those two matters for his relatively prompt attendance at the police station and disclosure of what he thought might have been his guilt. There should have been some recognition by way of affording further leniency. Even if it could be said that the police investigation would at some stage have detected the applicant’s responsibility (a subject about which the evidence is far from clear and involves a degree of speculation), it would be contrary to the public interest of encouraging offenders to come forward to deny him any practical benefit for having done so. And it would not necessarily have led to a sentence that was unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences.
	
	
	I would uphold this ground.
	


Ground 2 – error in the manner of structuring the sentences


	
	Whilst acknowledging the discretion involved, the applicant’s counsel submitted that it was not appropriate for the judge to partially accumulate the sentences in the way he did. It was submitted that the three forms of intercourse were “not just a continuum but really one continuous attack on a single victim”. Reference was also made to the circumstance of aggravation, the infliction of actual bodily harm, being one and the same in respect of the three offences and the fact that they occurred within a very short time of each other.
	
	
	In short, it was submitted that the accumulation by one year each of the second and third sentences was inappropriate and resulted in a total sentence that was unduly excessive. The submissions went further and contended that all of the sentences should have been ordered to be served concurrently.
	
	
	The Crown placed particular reliance upon the discretionary nature of a decision as to the concurrency or accumulation of sentences. It referred to there being no rule that offences committed on the same day, or as part of the same criminal enterprise, should attract concurrent sentences. It was submitted that, having regard to the nature and seriousness of each of the offences, it was open to the judge to partially accumulate the sentences where the sentence for one offence could not comprehend and reflect the criminality of another.
	


Consideration


	
	The relevant sentencing principle to consider is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other. If so, the sentences should be concurrent but if not, there should be some accumulation. See Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]; and R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38 at [52].
	
	
	In this case it cannot be accepted that the applicant should have received the same sentence for having committed one offence as he should have received for committing all three of them. Put another way, it cannot be said that each offence did not make some additional contribution to the totality of the applicant’s criminality.
	
	
	The partial accumulation of sentences for multiple sexual assaults committed on the one victim on the same occasion has been held to open to the discretion of a sentence judge: R v LG [2012] NSWCCA 249. In R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; 137 A Crim R 326 it was held to have been erroneous for there to have been no accumulation in such a case.
	
	
	In my view, it was open to the sentencing judge to partially accumulate the sentences and so this ground should be rejected.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	Evidence of events which have transpired since the applicant was sentenced was provided in the form of affidavits affirmed by him and by his solicitor. They attest to the fact that he has been gainfully employed until he commenced full-time studies. He is presently engaged in tertiary preparation studies with a view to enrolling in a science degree course. He receives visits and retains family support. He has been of good behaviour. He has plans for his future following release.
	
	
	I do not believe any of this further evidence impacts upon this Court’s sentencing discretion if it proceeds upon a foundation of the findings made by the sentencing judge that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Included in the material annexed to the solicitor’s affidavit are the remarks on sentence by Conlon DCJ when he sentenced the applicant on 11 April 2014. He imposed sentences of 6 months for each of three offences of having sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 and a sentence of 3 months for an offence of inciting an act of indecency. Those offences were committed in 2005. They occurred shortly before the victim's 16th birthday. They only came to light after his arrest for the present matter.
	
	
	Conlon DCJ ordered that the sentences be served concurrently from the date of imposition. He took that course because he said that if the applicant had appeared for sentence before he committed the offences at Callala Bay on 27 October 2011 he would have imposed something other than full-time custodial sentences. He had found the offences were “very much towards the lower end of the scale (of seriousness).”
	
	
	Given the unusual circumstances of those other offences they do not appear to impact upon the assessment of sentence here.
	
	
	The present offences were found by the sentencing judge to be ""most serious"" and I agree with that assessment. However, having regard to all of the facts and circumstances, including the voluntary disclosure of guilt, appropriate sentences for each of the offences are 5 years 3 months (counts 1 and 2) and 7 years (count 3). I would notionally accumulate them to reflect the totality of criminality. The finding of special circumstances should be maintained for the same reason given by the primary judge.
	


ORDERS:

1.   Leave to appeal granted.

2.   Appeal allowed.

3.   Sentences imposed in the District Court on 18 April 2013 quashed.

4.   Pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, impose an aggregate sentence of 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years 3 months to date from 29 October 2011. The non-parole period will expire on 28 January 2018 at which time the applicant will become eligible for release on parole.


	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2767037,R v BG [2015] NSWSC 2098,"EX TEMPore Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The applicant for bail faces four charges which are currently before the Bidura Children’s Court. They all involve either robbery or stealing from the person, whether in company, and sometimes with a weapon.
	
	
	The first two sets of charges involve him allegedly participating with a group of other youths in robbing taxi drivers using violence. The third charge involves what the Crown Prosecutor colloquially but accurately described as a street mugging. The fourth set of charges involves robbery from some young children. Needless to say all the charges are extremely serious.
	
	
	The applicant is fourteen years of age. Prior to the first offence he had no exposure to the criminal justice system. He was granted bail on the first two offences but then arrested on 15 April 2015 following an investigation into the third and fourth offences. It goes without saying that the third and fourth offences involve a serious breach of the bail conditions on the first two.
	
	
	He has now spent almost two and a half months in custody. It is clearly an extremely serious matter to detain a 14-year-old boy for any period. I do not think the Court has any option but to proceed on the basis that a fourteen year old who broke his bail and has now spent two and a half months away from his family, must be given a further chance.
	
	
	In terms of the relevant forms of risk I do not consider that the risk of his non-appearance at court to be relevantly unacceptable. He does have strong family connections in the Daceyville area as well as broader support from the local indigenous community. I think one way or another they would combine to get him to court.
	
	
	Of course the relevant unacceptable risk is that he will commit a further serious offence which involves a risk of danger to the community including either taxi drivers, members of the public or even young people.
	
	
	That said, the relevant bail conditions that would be put in place to an extent can I think mitigate that risk. Further, I think he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt in terms of an assessment as to what two and a half months in custody would bring to bear upon any decision he made to commit further offences.
	
	
	Accordingly, there will be a grant of bail. Further, it is necessary to vary the existing bail conditions concerning the first and second offences so that all the bail terms are consistent.
	
	
	Accordingly, in relation to the charges listed on H57060311 and on charge sheet H57299547 bail will be varied to allow the applicant to reside at X XXXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXX instead of XX XXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXX.  
	
	
	In relation to the charges listed on H57844459 and H57783750 there will be a grant of bail on the following conditions.

		08 September 2016",2015-06-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767041,Gardener v R [2015] NSWCCA 170,"Judgment


	
	PRICE J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Guy Pearce Gardener (""the applicant"") was sentenced by her Honour Judge Murrell SC (as her Honour then was) in the District Court at Sydney on 18 January 2013 for offences of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and allowing himself to be carried in a car which he knew to have been taken without the owner's consent.
	
	
	These are offences against s 97(1) and s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalties are imprisonment for 20 years and 5 years respectively.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months, and a concurrent term of 1 year 6 months with no non-parole period. The sentences were backdated to 12 December 2011. Accordingly, the applicant became eligible for release on parole on 11 June 2015. (The State Parole Authority (“SPA”) has refused to allow release on parole and will reconsider the issue next year.)
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal on four grounds which are concerned with mental health, drug addiction and rehabilitation issues. At the hearing of the application, leave was granted to add a fifth ground asserting that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


Facts


	
	The applicant was released on parole on 1 December 2010. Twelve days later, on 13 December 2010 at about 1.50pm, he and an unknown man and woman attended a jewellery store in Crows Nest. The man and woman remained outside, appearing to look at items in the window, while the applicant entered and spoke to a sales assistant about necklaces. She produced some from the safe to show him. He said he would return with his mother.
	
	
	About an hour later, the applicant returned with the unknown male. The applicant was carrying a bag from which he took a claw hammer. The male removed an axe from a bag he was carrying. A male and two female sales assistants were present in the store. The applicant brandished the claw hammer at them whilst the male jumped over the counter and used the axe to gain access to the window display, taking several trays of rings. The applicant demanded that the safe be opened and he took from it three rolls of gold and silver chains.
	
	
	One of the sales assistants ran out of the shop and raised the alarm although the applicant tried to stop her. He then brandished the hammer at the remaining two assistants and told them to remain in the store. The applicant and the male ran to a car which was parked nearby (which had been stolen three days earlier) and drove away.
	
	
	The total value of the items stolen was about $10,000.
	
	
	On 20 December 2010, police went to the applicant's mother's home and arrested him. In a subsequent interview he denied committing the robbery but agreed that he was shown on CCTV footage speaking to a sales assistant at 1.50pm on the day it was committed. Subsequent DNA analysis of the bag he had left in the store established his involvement.
	


An ""appalling"" criminal history


	
	The learned sentencing judge said that the applicant had ""advanced very strong subjective circumstances"" but described his criminal history as ""long"", ""complex"" and ""appalling"". His first appearance in the Children's Court was when he was 10 years of age. His first experience of incarceration was when he was aged 11. He has been dealt with on a great many occasions for offences of dishonesty (stealing; stealing cars or driving or being in stolen cars; burglary; and the like) and violence (assault; assault occasioning actual bodily harm; assaulting and resisting police officers). He was sentenced in 1991 for robbery whilst armed and in company (and possession of a shortened firearm). There was an offence of robbery and three offences of robbery in company for which he was sentenced in 1998. In 2002 he was sentenced for four robberies whilst armed with dangerous weapons and one robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. He has been dealt with for a variety of other offences, including multiple instances of escaping or attempting to escape from custody.
	
	
	The applicant is currently aged 35. He spent a good part of his adolescent years in juvenile detention and has spent the vast majority of his adult years in gaol.
	
	
	On 11 April 2003, this Court upheld a Crown appeal against manifestly inadequate sentences imposed in 2002 for the various armed robbery offences I have referred to. A total effective sentence of 9 years 3 months with a non-parole component of 6 years 6 months was imposed. He became eligible for release on parole on 4 September 2008.
	
	
	The applicant was released on parole on 30 July 2009. His parole was revoked and he was returned to custody 3 months later. He was again released on parole on 1 December 2010 but returned to custody following his arrest for the present matters on 20 December 2010 and served the remainder of the sentence imposed by this Court until 1 July 2011. He was released on bail in respect of the present matters on 16 September 2011 but was arrested on 8 November 2011 and charged with damaging property. He was released pursuant to the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) the following day but was again arrested on 10 November 2011 and charged with damaging property and assaulting police officers. He has been in custody since.
	
	
	The applicant served sentences totalling 3 months 19 days for the November 2011 offences (10 November 2011 to 28 February 2012). This meant that his custody solely referable to the present matters was in the periods 1 July 2011 to 16 September 2011 and from 28 February 2012. To allow credit for this, the judge back dated the sentences to 12 December 2011.
	
	
	The applicant's custodial history discloses that he has been dealt with for disciplinary offences on a great many occasions throughout the time he has been in prison. They include drug and drug implement possession; failing urine testing for drugs or failing to submit to same; damaging property; using insulting, abusive or threatening language; failing to comply with routine or supervision; disobeying directions; behaving in a threatening manner; assault; fighting; and intimidation.
	


The applicant's personal circumstances


	
	The judge noted that the applicant is of Aboriginal heritage. He was raised in an environment of extreme domestic violence. His father had a serious problem with alcohol. The applicant witnessed what her Honour described as ""horrific violence, including sexual violence towards his mother"". He and his siblings were also the victims of serious physical and emotional violence amounting to ""extreme cruelty"" at the hands of their father. Her Honour cited as an example his mother's recollection of an occasion when the applicant was aged six or seven and he was ""literally strung from a clothesline, tarred and feathered"". She had no doubt that the applicant and other members of his family retained unresolved feelings of anger.
	
	
	The applicant was subjected to sexual abuse in a juvenile institution at an early age. Her Honour observed that he had not been treated or counselled to any extent in relation to that trauma.
	
	
	The applicant commenced the use of alcohol and cannabis at the age of about 11. He progressed to heroin at the age of 14. He has been a binge user of cocaine and has used other drugs. He was using methamphetamine at the time of the offences in December 2011.
	
	
	A report by an Alcohol and Other Drugs worker, Ms Christine Bridekirk, included an opinion that there was a nexus between the applicant's drug use and his criminal behaviour. He committed crime to support his drug habit and it was considered that his drug use had inhibited his ability to have consequential thinking.
	
	
	Dr Christopher Lennings, a clinical psychologist, expressed the opinions that the applicant's ""cognitive ability is better than the bottom 5% of the population and is best described as either very low or borderline intellectual ability"" and ""he has significant impairment of cognitive ability"". His literacy abilities were largely commensurate with these assessments and with his limited educational experience. Dr Lennings considered the applicant to be chronically institutionalised.
	
	
	The judge accepted that the applicant had a ""very low cognitive ability"" and a ""severe personality dysfunction which manifests itself in very disruptive behaviour"". She referred to Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, reporting that there was a probable bipolar disorder and a tendency to paranoia as well as symptoms of hypomania. There was also a differential diagnosis of a very severe ADHD. It may be noted that Dr Allnutt also opined that the applicant had a personality disorder with mixed narcissistic, histrionic and antisocial traits and had developed a substance abuse and dependence disorder.
	
	
	The judge referred to the applicant's ""difficult time in prison"" but commented that ""quite likely he has been, in one sense, the cause of a lot of his problems"". She accepted that he had spent a considerable proportion of his time in custody in segregation. She referred to his evidence in the sentence proceedings that he was in ""isolation"" for up to about 21 hours per day and had always been held in maximum security. She added:
	


""It is possibly due to his own attitude, that up until now, he has not received any assistance in relation to rehabilitation or his extremely serious problems of various sorts.""

Rehabilitation prospects


	
	Since the focus of Ground 4 is upon the applicant's rehabilitation it is appropriate to provide further detail on the subject.
	
	
	Dr Lennings said that the applicant ""represents a severe rehabilitation challenge"". He explained:
	


""Mr Gardener will need extensive rehabilitation and monitoring if he is to survive in the community. Whilst his behaviour is disruptive and he appears to lack life management skills such that he can adjust to community living, he is not going to gain such skills in prison. He represents a rehabilitative quandary, and referral when release is possible to an organisation such as Way Back (if he is eligible for their services) with firm supervision guidelines and a requirement for maintenance of psychotropic medication appears to be the only likely rehabilitative option he has. The risk for Mr Gardener is that he will stay in gaol until the last minute, thereby not allowing for any supervised integration plan through rehabilitation and into the community. He will benefit from a sentence that promotes his ability to make whatever use he can of rehabilitative options.""


	
	Ms Bridekirk's report included that the applicant had not experienced any treatment in the community and, due to his difficulties in prison, he had not had much opportunity there as well, although he ""has accessed AOD services where possible"".
	
	
	Ms Bridekirk referred to the applicant being assessed and accepted into the Wayback rehabilitation program. A letter confirming such acceptance was before her Honour. In relation to the applicant's rehabilitation prospects, Ms Bridekirk stated:
	


""Unfortunately, due to many factors such as his classification status and the fact that he is on a pharmacological treatment (methadone), there is no intensive program that Mr Roberts [the applicant is also known by this name] can access whilst in custody to address his AOD issues. He also seems to find it difficult in custody largely due to animosity built up over the years between himself and custodial officers, partly due to his personality disorders that tend to put him at odds with others. He spends most of his time in segregated custody, away from other offenders.

I have observed his difficulties over the years and it seems to make it very hard for him to gain any rehabilitative value out of being incarcerated. I have observed him operating much like a child would, with attention seeking behaviour and neediness. He seems to have missed the major adult milestones that he may have reached if he were in a functional family environment. He seems to have been raised by the “system” which is far from a nurturing environment. It also takes a lot of responsibility away from the individual to look after themselves, providing food, clothing etc. and telling them what to do and when to do it. To be able to live in society, Mr Roberts will need to have a lot of help to develop basic life skills, and I believe Wayback has the potential to be a stepping stone to reaching this goal. I have included a 20 page document describing the Wayback program in detail for your honour. I have also included the acceptance letter which offers him a bed on 21st January 2013.

If this option is not suitable, Mr Gardener could benefit from being sentenced to the CDTCC (Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre), for which he may be deemed suitable. The difficulty in sentencing him to the CDTCC would be that if he was deemed ineligible, he would be in the same situation as mentioned earlier, in custody with no intensive AOD treatment available.”


	
	In a letter read to the court by the applicant he said:
	


""I really want to change my life and past and I cannot do that on my own because the stark change in myself will start within myself and I have done that in the last two years but in gaol you cannot get the help or the support in gaol. They live on my past and won't let me move on from it. …

I … ask you for a chance of a lifetime, your Honour, it took me over a year to get a bed in this rehab and I do want to help myself and get my life together.

I cannot do that in gaol as all they seem to do is move me from gaol to gaol, so I never get to settle down. …

I really hope I do get the help I need. I'm asking for help to go to the Wayback rehab as in gaol, help seemed never to come, only a lot of hate and personal grudges. … I've never been to a rehab. I really need this help as I cannot do it on my own. Wayback seems like a place that will give me the support I really need, your Honour. Please help me before it's too late and I end up dead in gaol and I do need the help.""


	
	In a letter addressed to the victims of the robbery the applicant said:
	


""I am committed to improving myself as a person by attending supervised rehabilitation in a supportive environment. This will enable me to reintegrate into society, get a job so that I can support myself, pay you back for the losses that I have caused you and suffered. There is still a lot that I can achieve in my life. I'm only 33 years old and I want to make up for my mistakes.""


	
	The applicant's mother, Ms Joy Gardener, gave evidence. It was her belief that he was genuine in wanting to change. She said that he had never been in a rehabilitation centre before and had never had any assistance with any form of counselling. In cross-examination, however, she confirmed that he had completed a Getting Smart drug and alcohol program in 2010. She said:
	


""He has done all them sort of courses, yes. He has certificates for them at home. But most times when he's in segregation they don't take him out of segregation to do any courses.""


	
	The applicant's sister also perceived that he was motivated to rehabilitate and understood the need to engage with a structured program.
	
	
	The judge alluded to the evidence on this subject and said about the applicant's prospects of being able to change:
	


""Whether he is able to do so remains to be seen. It is going to be a challenge of mammoth proportions given the fact that he has never been in a normal environment. His whole life has been lived in institutions and his various problems have meant that he has probably seen the worst of those institutions.""


	
	Later in her sentencing remarks, her Honour said that rehabilitation was a very important consideration ""because his long history of incarceration, institutionalisation and offending conduct is a matter of grave concern"". She observed that rehabilitation was in the interests of the community as well as of the applicant.
	


Other matters taken into account in the assessment of sentence


	
	The judge found that the armed robbery offence was of considerable seriousness. She referred to there being ""some level of planning involved"", indicated by the applicant’s attendance at the jewellery store an hour before the robbery, and later equipping himself with a hammer concealed in a bag. It was an aggravating feature that the robbery was committed in company. The fact that there were three victims was relevant. The manner in which they were threatened and told that they should not leave, with weapons being brandished, supported a conclusion that ""it would have been an extremely frightening experience"" for them. A further relevant matter was the significant value of the property taken.
	
	
	Another aggravating feature (not relevant to objective seriousness) was the fact that the offending occurred while the applicant was on conditional liberty, having just been released on parole.
	
	
	Her Honour referred obliquely to principles relating to sentencing persons with a mental condition. (She indicated during submissions that she was well acquainted with cases such as R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228). She found that ""there is no clear causal connection established between the offender's issues and the commission of the offences"". She did accept, however, that the applicant's intellectual and psychological problems rendered him less able to exercise the judgment and self-discipline that other people might exercise.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the armed robbery guideline sentencing case of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. Some of the features of the typical case there described were present whilst others were not.
	
	
	General and specific deterrence were held to be important. Her Honour acknowledged that persons with mental disorders are ""often not seen as appropriate vehicles for general deterrence"" but immediately added, ""but given the nature of this offence that observation is not strongly applicable in this case"". Of the other purposes of sentencing (s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)), protection of the community was considered to be important, having regard to the applicant's criminal history. Accountability, denunciation and recognition of harm were also considered to be important.
	
	
	Her Honour regarded the applicant's criminal history as something disentitling him to leniency. Cf Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 478 and R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [20].
	
	
	The applicant's remorse was accepted as a mitigating feature which was also regarded as indicating some potential for rehabilitation. Her Honour accepted that he was motivated to rehabilitate but she could not find that his prospects were good. She noted in this context that he had good family support.
	
	
	The applicant entered pleas of guilty two days after the date fixed for his trial. Counsel for the applicant submitted that a discount in recognition of the utilitarian value of the plea between 10 and 15 per cent was appropriate. Her Honour determined that it should be ""probably closer to ten per cent"". (She in fact allowed 12.5 per cent.)
	
	
	Her Honour found special circumstances which justified a shorter non-parole period for the following reasons:
	


""First, there is the matter that the offender has been held in segregation for so long, making his period in custody much more arduous than if he was able to associate with other people. Second, there is the overall history of his imprisonment and related institutionalisation. Third, there is the very, very difficult task ahead of the offender in relation to rehabilitation, which will not be something that can be achieved in a year or two but will involve a number of years of support and supervision.""


	
	Towards the end of her sentencing remarks the judge referred to a submission made by counsel for the applicant that the proceedings should be adjourned pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the purpose of allowing him to undertake the program at Wayback. She referred to counsel having accepted that the applicant ""would almost certainly have to come back into prison to serve a period of imprisonment"". She concluded:
	


""I do not consider that it is appropriate to release someone onto a rehabilitation program on the basis that they are then going to be brought back into prison and deprived of the opportunity of progressing through rehabilitation to proper integration into the community. On the other hand, based on the material before me, I am well satisfied that Wayback would be an ideal program for the offender, perhaps the only program that may be suited to his needs that is available in this State. And I do sincerely hope that the authorities in due course do their utmost to secure a position at Wayback or some equivalent program, because that is possibly the only avenue open to him and to the community to see him on the path to rehabilitation.""


	
	Her Honour said that ""the question of the non-parole period is a vexed one"" and ""after considerable deliberation"", set a period of 3 years 6 months against a total term of 7 years. She made a recommendation that upon being released to parole he should enter a residential rehabilitation program such as Wayback.
	


Ground 1 - Her Honour erred in not finding that the applicant's mental health had contributed to the commission of the offences in a material way

Ground 2 - Her Honour erred in failing to find that general deterrence should not be considered to be a relevant factor upon this sentencing exercise, either altogether or at least to a reduced degree

Ground 3 - Her Honour failed to appropriately weigh the considerations of specific deterrence, the prospects of rehabilitation, his conditions of custody and the protection of all the community

Submissions for the applicant


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant’s drug addiction and his offending conduct were consequences of his mental health. The written submissions then quoted large portions from the reports of Dr Allnutt and Dr Lennings; the salient points of which are summarised or quoted above.
	
	
	The applicant conceded that “the psychiatric and psychological evidence does not in clear terms state that his offending was as a direct result of his mental health”, but it was contended nonetheless that “when combined with his offending history and the circumstances of the subject offences it becomes compelling that the offending conduct was caused by his mental health”. The submissions continued: “his drug addiction is caused by his mental health and the two are inextricably linked accordingly”.
	
	
	The written submissions proceeded to quote a lengthy extract from the judgment of Hoeben JA in R v Chandler; Chandler v R [2012] NSWCCA 135 at [37]-[42], [51]-[65]. (This was simply an example of this Court referring to the principles relevant to sentencing an offender with a mental condition and discussing their application to the facts of the case at hand.) It was then submitted that, like in that case, the present was not one where general deterrence should have played a prominent role in the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submissions then quoted from the reports of Dr Lennings and Ms Bridekirk (see above under the heading “Rehabilitation prospects”) and from the judge’s sentencing remarks where she discussed the issue of special circumstances and rejection of the submission that the matter should be dealt with under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (see above at [42]-[43]).
	
	
	The applicant conceded that “protection of the community is an important consideration in the circumstances”. But it was submitted that incarceration in the past had not curbed the applicant’s offending and the best option for protecting the community and to personally deter him from further offending was to defer sentence and release him on the condition that he enter the Wayback program. Incarceration had not deterred him in the past. He would have no prospect of being released on parole. If he was released without supervision at the end of his total term he would most likely re-offend immediately and spend the best part, if not the whole, of the rest of his life in gaol.
	
	
	The written submissions concluded with a rather terse statement that fresh evidence “in this regard” would be relied upon at the hearing of the appeal. Those submissions were dated 4 April 2014. Further written submissions dated 3 June 2015 were filed. They addressed the “fresh evidence” and Ground 4 but said nothing about Grounds 1 to 3. No oral submissions were directed to Grounds 1 to 3 either. Accordingly, these grounds will be considered on the basis of the original written submissions alone.
	


Consideration


	
	This case presented a number of difficult and conflicting issues. On the one hand there was a serious example of the offence of armed robbery committed by an offender who had just been released on parole for similar offences and who had an extensive criminal record. On the other hand, the offender had derived from a most unfortunate, deprived and dysfunctional background who had mental health and substance abuse problems and who had become institutionalised from a very early age.
	
	
	In Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 it was said by the majority:
	


“[44] Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ‘full weight’ to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.

[45] The point was made by Gleeson CJ in Engert [(1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71] in the context of explaining the significance of an offender's mental condition in sentencing:

‘A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the court in the case of Veen (No 2). Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.’”


	
	Ground 1 (error in not finding that the applicant's mental health had contributed to the commission of the offences in a material way) implicitly concedes that her Honour found there was some contribution but contends that it was not “material”. But the written submissions contend that her Honour found that there was no causal connection at all. I do not accept this.
	
	
	The judge referred, uncritically, to the applicant’s claim:
	


“[T]hat at the time that he was released on parole in December 2010, he was on medication which he did not really understand and he was not provided with any real structure to cope with life in the community. He came off the medication. He was seeking money to buy drugs. The offences were committed in the context that he was a person with intellectual and psychological problems who had been in custody for [a] decade and was released without a very strong structure around him, an absolute necessity.”


	
	True it is that the judge said that ""there is no clear causal connection established between the offender's issues and the commission of the offences"". But I have earlier referred (at [36]) to her acceptance that the applicant's intellectual and psychological problems rendered him less able to exercise the judgment and self-discipline that other people might exercise. This was recognition by her Honour that there were factors relating to the mental condition of the applicant that were relevant to his commission of the offences.
	
	
	This was an approach that was well open to her Honour in her assessment of the evidence that was before her.
	
	
	Grounds 2 and 3 (general deterrence of lesser, or no, relevance; failure to appropriately weigh specific deterrence, rehabilitation prospects, conditions of custody, and protection of the community) refer to most difficult aspects of the exercise of the sentencing discretion in cases concerning offenders with mental health issues. It was rendered all the more difficult in this case because of the applicant’s history of long standing recidivist offending of a quite serious type. Considerations of personal deterrence and the protection of the community were significant factors and it would have been wrong for the judge to have ignored or downplayed them.
	
	
	No error has been established in her Honour’s regard to general deterrence. As previously noted (at [36] and [38]), she was conscious of the principles relating to this issue in sentencing offenders with a mental condition. But this case involved a relatively serious armed robbery committed by multiple offenders with a degree of forethought. It was certainly no opportunistic or spontaneous exercise of aberrant or desperate offending by a person not fully conscious of what they were embarking upon.
	
	
	It is apparent that her Honour was acutely aware of the applicant’s institutionalisation, his custodial conditions and of the importance of rehabilitation. This was demonstrated by her substantial reduction of the non-parole period from what would normally have been 75 per cent of the overall term to 50 per cent; or from a term of 5 years 3 months to 3 years 6 months. It was also reflected in her recommendation that parole release be conditional upon the applicant entering a program such as Wayback.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that there is any error in the manner in which her Honour assessed the issues relevant to these grounds.
	


Ground 4 - Her Honour erred in finding that in the circumstances it was not appropriate to release someone into a rehabilitation program on the basis that they are then going to be brought back into prison and deprived of the opportunity of progressing through rehabilitation to proper integration into the community (Judgment upon Sentence para [24])


	
	Two affidavits affirmed by the applicant's solicitor on 3 and 22 June 2015 were read at the hearing of the application. The Crown objected to this material being received as ""fresh"" or ""new"" evidence.
	


Fresh or new evidence principles


	
	In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [104]-[121], Simpson J (as her Honour then was) set out the principles relating to the reception of additional evidence on an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Her Honour referred to the important distinction between ""fresh evidence"" (evidence the party was unaware of at the time of the original hearing and which could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence) and ""new"" evidence (evidence that was available but not used at first instance, or which could have been obtained in the exercise of reasonable diligence). Fresh evidence will be received if it had a capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance.
	
	
	An important component of the principles is that evidence of events, facts or circumstances that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account as it has no bearing upon the fundamental consideration in a sentence appeal that error be established.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to a subsidiary principle. Where the evidence concerns something that existed at the time of sentencing but was not known, or imperfectly understood at that time, the Court may receive such evidence in the exercise of its discretion upon the basis that the sentencing proceeded upon an erroneous view of the factual circumstances. ""Proper grounds"" must be established as a foundation for the exercise of this discretion.
	


The evidence


	
	The evidence proffered by the applicant in this case concerned or comprised the following:
	


A few days after being sentenced, the applicant sought and obtained from the judge a referral to the Drug Court for a determination as to whether he could be sent to the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre at Parklea. A few weeks later he was found to be ineligible for that program due to his mental condition.

The applicant was refused parole by the SPA on 10 April 2015. Reports before the SPA included that the applicant maintained a desire to undertake the Wayback rehabilitation program. The applicant's solicitor was advised on 2 June 2015 that the applicant remained eligible for admission into that program. This was confirmed in an email he received the following day, but an hour later a further email advised that the offer of a placement had been withdrawn. The solicitor thereafter made considerable efforts to obtain a placement in other rehabilitation programs but the situation remained unresolved.

Events since sentencing concerning the applicant's placement; classification; segregation; disciplinary offences; lack of availability of programs and employment; continuation on the methadone program; support of his mother; psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments.

A report by Dr Stephen Allnutt of 6 June 2014 prepared for the purpose of the present proceedings. It was based upon interviews with the applicant on 22 May and 4 June 2014 and upon a review of documents largely brought into existence since sentencing (the exceptions were the reports of Dr Allnutt, Dr Lennings and Ms Bridekirk that were tendered on sentence). It includes an expression of opinion, based upon the history provided by the applicant in the two interviews, of his state of mind at the time of the offences.

A report prepared by Dr John McMahon, neuropsychologist, in relation to an assessment carried out on 28 June 2014.

A report by Dr Laughlin Dawes, radiologist, concerning an MRI scan performed on 11 November 2014 (reporting ""normal"" results).

A further report by Dr Allnutt of 17 November 2014 following his consideration of the reports by Dr McMahon and Dr Dawes.

An email from Dr Allnutt of 29 May 2015 in relation to the MRI imaging and related documents.

A report by Dr Jonathon Adams dated 9 August 2014 following interviews on 27 May and 22 July 2014. This report was relied upon in relation to the dismissal of criminal proceedings on 16 March 2015 pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act following pleas of guilty to charges of assault, assault of a law officer, and damaging property.

A report by the Personality and Behavioural Disorders Unit dated 11 December 2014 regarding the management of the applicant in custody.

Medical records in relation to various physical and mental health issues, including self-harming incidents, in 2013 (post-sentencing) and 2014.

A letter confirming contact the applicant had made in 2014 with the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant disavowed in oral submissions any claim that the reports of Dr Allnutt and Dr McMahon amounted to ""fresh"" evidence (T8.50). But he pressed for reception at least of the opinion of Dr Allnutt as to the applicant's state of mind at the time of the offences (T9.17).
	
	
	None of this material is ""fresh"" evidence and no proper basis has been established for its reception in the Court's discretion. Moreover, there was very little put by way of explanation as to why material such as that contained in the reports of Dr Allnutt and Dr McMahon were not sought and obtained prior to sentencing. Senior counsel for the applicant said that he had an affidavit from counsel who appeared at first instance (which was not read). He simply indicated that counsel had taken a decision to rely upon the reports that were tendered, thinking that funding by Legal Aid NSW for further reports would be unlikely.
	
	
	The evidence provided in the two affidavits by the applicant's solicitor should only be received and taken into account in the event of resentencing pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Submissions in support of Ground 4


	
	It was submitted for the applicant that her Honour was in error in stating:
	


""I do not consider that it is appropriate to release someone onto a rehabilitation program on the basis that they are then going to be brought back into prison and deprived of the opportunity of progressing through rehabilitation to proper integration into the community.""


	
	Reference was made to my judgment in R v Farrell [2014] NSWCCA 30 at [48]-[61] where there is a review of principles relating to the deferral of sentence pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I referred to R v Trindall [2002] NSWCCA 364; 133 A Crim R 119 in which Smart AJ had stated:
	


""[64] The granting of a Griffiths [i.e. a s 11] remand is likely to arise for consideration in a relatively small number of cases. Generally, such a remand should not be granted unless there are good reasons for concluding that it is likely to assist the court in determining whether an offender should be sent to gaol or in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period.""

See also R v Brown [2009] NSWCCA 6; 193 A Crim R 574 at [22] (James J).


	
	It was also submitted that this case was an exceptional one having regard to the history of the applicant (as outlined in detail above), particularly given the offer of a placement at Wayback for a person with a powerful need to undergo a rehabilitation program, which made it a ""wholly appropriate case for a s 11 order"".
	


Consideration


	
	I am doubtful that the statement by her Honour upon which the applicant relied amounts to an error of principle. Her Honour announced her reasons for sentence immediately upon the conclusion of submissions and it may well involve some infelicity of expression. What her Honour said immediately prior to the impugned statement suggests that she was not speaking generally about releasing ""someone onto a rehabilitation program on the basis that they are then going to be brought back into prison"" but was referring to the applicant himself. Her Honour said:
	


""[22] … I am unable to find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. I think that rehabilitation will be very difficult and I do not know whether the offender will ultimately succeed in rehabilitating, but I do accept that he is motivated to rehabilitate. He is lucky in that he has considerable family support in that regard.

[23] There are special circumstances in this case. First, there is the matter that the offender has been held in segregation for so long, making his period in custody much more arduous than if he was able to associate with other people. Second, there is the overall history of his imprisonment and related institutionalisation. Third, there is the very, very difficult task ahead of the offender in relation to rehabilitation, which will not be something that can be achieved in a year or two but will involve a number of years of support and supervision.

[24] Ms Evers, the offender’s legal representative, submitted that I should release the offender pursuant to s11 so that he can attend Wayback and commence rehabilitation. She accepted that, if that was to occur, he would almost certainly have to come back into prison to serve a period of imprisonment. …""


	
	Even if the impugned statement is interpreted literally and amounted to a misapprehension of principle, this was clearly a case in which deferral of sentence was entirely inappropriate. Deferral for nine months (as was sought) in order for the applicant to undertake the Wayback program would have been very unlikely to be successful in circumstances where her Honour had before her such pessimistic expert opinions on the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects. As mentioned earlier, Dr Lennings said that the applicant ""represents a severe rehabilitation challenge""; ""a rehabilitative quandary"". Her Honour described rehabilitation as a challenge of ""mammoth proportions"" and ""not … something than can be achieved in a year or two but will involve a number of years of support and supervision"". More was required than just the availability of a program and motivation to undertake it.
	
	
	There is a further consideration and that is that to successfully undertake the Wayback program the applicant would need to forego his hitherto disruptive and confronting behavioural difficulties and adopt some life management skills, about which Dr Lennings spoke, at a very early stage. His history suggests that this would not be something achievable in the short term.
	
	
	A further consideration is that even if there was successful completion of the Wayback program and the applicant returned to court for sentencing nine months later, there would still likely be a need to view his long term rehabilitation prospects with circumspection. It is highly unlikely that he would qualify for a finding in mitigation of having ""good"" prospects of rehabilitation thereby warranting an assessment of sentence less than that which was imposed.
	
	
	For these reasons I would not uphold this ground.
	


Ground 5 - The sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	To establish such a ground it is necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25].
	
	
	The sentence for the offence against s 154A may be put to one side in the consideration of this ground, given that it was ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for the primary offence.
	
	
	The submissions by senior counsel for the applicant were confined to the proposition that the sentence should have been deferred pursuant to s 11. He sought to rely upon the additional evidence in support of this ground. I have dealt with those issues.
	
	
	This was a serious example of the offence of robbery whilst armed. It involved the applicant, being in company and with a degree of planning, robbing three shop assistants of property of significant value whilst he brandished a claw hammer and his co-offender used an axe. It was committed a short time after the applicant had been released on parole in respect of sentences for armed robbery offences and he had a considerable history of violence and other serious criminal offending.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the need to give full weight to the circumstances of the applicant’s background, the head sentence of 7 years cannot be regarded as unreasonable or unjust. And the non-parole period of 3 years 6 months reflected a very careful and sympathetic assessment of the applicant's subjective circumstances. Even if error had been established, and the further evidence provided in support of the appeal was taken into account, in a fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion I would not determine that a lesser sentence was warranted. I am certainly not persuaded that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.


	
	DAVIES J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2767049,New South Wales Minister for Mental Health v Brauer [2015] NSWSC 863,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 24 June 2015 the plaintiff sought that the following orders be made against the defendant on 30 June 2015:
	


1.   An order pursuant to cl. 6(5)(a) of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”):

a.   appointing one qualified psychiatrist and one registered psychologist to conduct separate examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the result of those examinations by a date to be fixed by the court; and

b.   directing the defendant to attend those examinations.

2.   An order:

a.   pursuant to cl. 10 of Schedule 1 of the Act, that the defendant be subject to an interim extension order from 1 July 2015 (“the interim extension order”); and

b.   pursuant to cl. 11(1) of Schedule 1 of the Act, that the interim extension order be for a period of 28 days.


	
	The last date on which the orders set out in prayers 1 and 2 of the summons can be made is 30 June 2015 since the defendant is due to be released on 1 July 2015, since the limiting term imposed is due to expire on that day. As at 30 June 2015 Kingsford Brauer, the defendant, was a forensic patient at Long Bay Prison Hospital.
	
	
	The plaintiff also sought an extension order in respect of the defendant for a period of 5 years from the date of the order. However, whether it is appropriate to make such an order does not arise for present consideration since the matter is before me for preliminary hearing only at this stage.
	
	
	Because of the urgency associated with the application, I made orders on 30 June 2015 (which are set out at the conclusion of these reasons) but was unable to complete these reasons on that day. My reasons for making the orders are as follows.
	


The facts

The index offence


	
	On 1 January 2011 the defendant approached a bus parked behind a block of flats in Inverell, where children aged between 2 and 11 were playing. He removed his clothes. He pulled a four-year old girl through the window of the bus and dragged her towards his residence, which was one of the units in the block. He placed her on the ground and inserted his penis into her mouth. She had trouble breathing. A 12-year old child intervened and removed the four-year old and took her to her parents. The four-year old victim was distressed. The defendant was arrested on the following day in a very intoxicated state.
	


The special hearing and the indication of a limiting term


	
	As the defendant was found unfit to plead, the matter proceeded as a special hearing pursuant to s 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900 (NSW) (the Forensic Provisions Act). On 6 November 2013, King DCJ was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed an offence contrary to s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in that he had had sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten (who was in fact aged four years) (the index offence).
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied that the defendant was significantly affected by alcohol at the time of the offence and described the circumstances of the offence as “somewhat bizarre”. His Honour said of the defendant’s risk of re-offending:
	


“Considering his current ongoing mental health issues, it is extremely difficult to make an evaluation as to the likely rehabilitation of the offender, particularly where he has a significant alcohol problem that has already caused major physical damage to his intellectual abilities.

Considering his lack of any similar offending in the past, and my conclusion that he was no doubt significantly affected by alcohol on the occasion of the offending, it might be said that in the absence of alcohol there would be a low prospect of re-offending. The difficulty is that with an individual such as Mr Brauer, who has a twenty year history of alcoholism, there can be little assurance that reform in relation to alcohol consumption will ever be achieved, particularly having regard to the effects that it has already had on him, and the Court must, apart from general and specific deterrence and rehabilitation, take into account the need for protection of the community.”


	
	On 5 December 2013, King DCJ indicated, pursuant to s 23 (1)(a) of the Forensic Provisions Act, that, had the special hearing proceeded as a normal trial and had the defendant been found guilty, he would have imposed a term of imprisonment of four and a half years. Accordingly, his Honour indicated a limiting term of four and a half years to commence on 2 January 2011, being the date on which the defendant was arrested and taken into custody. The limiting term is due to expire on 1 July 2015. His Honour referred the defendant to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) pursuant to s 24(1)(a) of the Forensic Provisions Act and ordered pursuant to s 24(1)(b) that he be detained in such place as the Tribunal directed. Accordingly, he became a forensic patient by reason of the operation of s 42 of the Forensic Provisions Act.
	


Reviews undertaken by the Tribunal


	
	The Tribunal is obliged, by s 46 of the Forensic Provisions Act, to review the case of a forensic patient every 6 months but may review the case of any forensic patient at any time.
	
	
	The Tribunal reviewed Mr Brauer on eight occasions: 26 June 2012, 13 December 2012, 20 June 2013, 12 December 2013, 17 July 2014, 2 October 2014, 5 February 2015 and 14 May 2015. Prior to the imposition of a limiting term, these reviews were conducted with a view to ascertaining whether the defendant was fit to be tried as well as determining what treatment and support were required.
	
	
	At the first review on 26 June 2012, the Tribunal noted the defendant’s long history of heavy alcohol use which was said to amount to one cask of wine a day. When he was unable to obtain wine, he was said to resort to methylated spirits. He suffered associated black-outs. At that time he was regarded as suffering from severe depressive illness and severe cognitive impairment.
	
	
	Following the review on 17 July 2014 the Tribunal determined, pursuant to s 47(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act, that the defendant be detained in the Aged Care Rehabilitation Unit at Long Bay Hospital. The Tribunal’s Determination dated 12 August 2014, noted:
	


“It was apparent that Mr Brauer’s immediate need was for the intensive psychiatric care, which was available and being provided where he is currently accommodated, with a view to discharge planning being undertaken when that became practicable.”


	
	The Tribunal reviewed the defendant on 2 October 2014 and reported, in its Determination of 16 October 2014, that he was improving on a new medication regime and that his “psychotic feature” had resolved. It also recorded:
	


Current risk assessment for harm or endangerment to self or others

In his current environment Mr Brauer does not represent a risk of danger to himself or others.


	
	At the Tribunal’s review of the defendant on 5 February 2015, the Tribunal considered the report of Dr Kheng Chan, a Psychiatric Registrar at Long Bay Hospital. Dr Chan recorded his opinion and recommendation with respect to the defendant’s psychiatric issues as follows:
	


“Mr Kingsford Brauer’s depressive illness had significantly improved. He no longer suffers from persistent low mood or psychotic symptom. Mr Brauer suffers from alcohol related cognitive impairment which is progressive and is unlikely improve in near future. The treating team is of the opinion that Mr Brauer cease[d] to become a mentally ill person as defined under the New South Wales Mental Health Act 2007.”


	
	The Tribunal made a Determination dated 25 February 2015 following its review on 5 February 2015. There is an apparent inconsistency in its description of his circumstances. On the one hand it noted that he was diagnosed as being neither psychotic nor suffering from cognitive impairment; on the other hand, it recorded:
	


“His cognitive impairment is progressive and unlikely to improve.”


	
	In the same Determination, the Tribunal noted as follows:
	


“3.   Current risk assessment for harm or endangerment to self or others:

No risk assessment was proffered by his treating team. It is assumed to be low.

4.   Any significant developments since the last review are summarised as follows:

Once again, despite prior Tribunal requests, no progress has been made regarding accommodation for Mr Brauer on his release. As this is less than five months away, it is now Extremely Urgent. He has been assessed by ACAT as needing structured care in a low-level permanent residence. He is less depressed and more assertive than formerly.

5.   Future plans in relation to care, treatment or control of the person: Mr Chan’s view is that if accommodation can be found for Mr Brauer, no CTO would be needed. But if not, there would be concerns about supervision of his living, particularly regarding alcohol abuse. Dr Sim suggests that failing all else, he should be placed on a CTO in Department of Housing accommodation.

6.   Any other matters that the Tribunal considers should be noted arising from this review:

The Tribunal has NOT been provided with either of Brauer’s ACAT assessment or his OT Function Report. He remains without an agreed residence or plan on discharge. This is extremely urgent as the discharge is in less than five months.

An early review due to the expiring of his limiting term is essential.”


	
	Because of the Tribunal’s concern as to the imminence of the expiry of the limiting term, it conducted a further review on 14 May 2015. The Tribunal recorded in its Determination dated 12 June 2015 that the defendant “is not mentally ill”. Following the review on 14 May 2015 the Tribunal noted that on expiry of his limiting term on 1 July 2015, the defendant could move to the Bexley Care Centre, which is a nursing home with special facilities for residents who suffer from dementia. The availability of a bed at the Bexley Care Centre was confirmed by letter dated 30 April 2015.
	
	
	The Tribunal’s Determination following that review said:
	


“3. Current risk assessment for harm or endangerment to self or others:

On the one hand, Mr Brauer is a low risk to others because of his physical impairment. However, Dr Bhattacharyya [the defendant’s treating psychiatrist] expressed serious concern that Mr Brauer NOT have any contact with children, to whom he would pose a risk.”


	
	The Tribunal listed the defendant’s “relevant physical conditions” as: cognitive impairment, dementia, hypertension, chronic renal failure, anaemia, hearing impairment, osteoarthritis and benign prostate hypertrophy.
	
	
	The Tribunal also noted the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) had assessed him as needing low level respite care and that he was under the control of the Public Guardian regarding financial and medical issues.
	


The defendant’s criminal history and other matters germane to risk of harm to others


	
	The defendant’s criminal history dates back to 1978. It includes convictions for driving with above the prescribed concentration of alcohol; assault (1990); assault female (1990); assault occasioning actual bodily harm (1993), malicious damage by fire (1993); malicious damage by fire with intent to cause bodily injury (1993); destroy and damage property (2000); behave in offensive manner in/near public place (2005 and 2008); common assault and larceny (2009).
	
	
	The plaintiff relied on material to establish that the defendant was also charged with sexual intercourse without consent. This charge arose in the context of a domestic relationship. Although the complainant and her daughter made statements to the police, the Director of Public Prosecutions offered no evidence when the matter was brought on for hearing. In her statement of 3 March 1993 the defendant’s then wife (who was at the time separated from him) deposed that she had been assaulted by the defendant on 1 February 2003 in the course of an argument. In the morning of 2 February 2003 she could not sleep and decided to get up and do a load of washing. As she was attending to this task, the defendant indicated that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. When she told him that she did not want to, he threatened her with a butcher’s knife, following which she complied. That afternoon her daughter visited and saw that her mother was upset and had bruising to her face and head. The defendant’s wife then told her daughter what had occurred; the narrative corresponded with that of her own statement. The daughter deposed:
	


“While my mother was telling me this I saw that she was crying and very upset. My mother was afraid to go back to her home so she stayed with me for the next four nights.”


	
	A month later, the defendant bought some petrol and set it alight at his wife’s home. He was convicted of the charge of malicious damage by fire with intent to cause bodily injury referred to above.
	


Expert opinion evidence as to the defendant’s mental state


	
	Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist, prepared reports dated 19 April 2012 and 20 June 2013 which were considered by King DCJ at the special hearing. Dr Furst described the defendant in the following terms:
	


“a 53-year-old divorced male with no dependents, living by himself in Inverell at the time of his arrest. He had been married for a short period in 1992, but at the time of the offence was in receipt of a Disability Support Pension as a result of chronic health problems. He had a history of previous work at a sawmill and abattoirs, for the local council, for the Forestry Department and various seasonal work such as fruit picking.”


	
	A report was prepared by Dr Hertz, a psychiatrist working for Justice Health, following an interview with the defendant on 5 June 2012. Dr Hertz also had available a neuropsychological assessment of the defendant. Dr Hertz opined:
	


“Mr Brauer had alcohol-induced persisting dementia. His dementia is characterised by deficits in memory and executive function and slow processing speed. Mr Brauer has a history of alcohol dependence over at least a 20-year period. He has had extensive neuropsychological testing and his head CT scan shows cerebral atrophy.”


	
	A report of Dr Susan Pullman, neuropsychologist, dated 4 November 2011 was also considered by King DCJ. Dr Pullman opined:
	


“Mr Brauer has extremely low intellectual function (second percentile). His speed of information processing was markedly impaired (well below the first percentile), his auditory memory was also extremely low. There was some evidence of frontal deficits. He also endorsed extremely severe levels of depressive stress and anxiety symptoms which could be contributing to his cognitive deficits.”


	
	Dr Pullman’s assessment was that the defendant’s intellectual capacity fell within the extremely low range. However, she considered the possibility that severe levels of depression, stress and anxiety may have masked his true cognitive abilities.
	
	
	Dr Sue Morgans, Psychiatric Registrar, assessed the defendant on 10 July 2014. She found him to be “suspicious, confused, distracted, psychomotor retarded, psychomotor agitated”; “reluctant to enter the interview room”; “not able to answer most questions” and “not oriented in time, place or person.” In her report dated 17 July 2014 (which was considered by the Tribunal at its review) Dr Morgans recorded:
	


“Mr Brauer is described as having had a slow but progressive decline in mental state over the last six months. His memory has steadily declined with an associated increase in delusional beliefs. He is described as believing that staff are poisoning him and have given him AIDS. He has been noted to be engaging in bizarre behaviours such as eating cigarette butts and talking to himself.”


	
	Dr Morgans’ diagnostic impression was that the defendant was suffering from psychotic depression.
	


Availability of other programs or facilities


	
	The defendant was found to be ineligible for assistance from the Community Justice Program as he did not meet the requirements of the Ageing Disability and Home Care Intake Policy. The Intake Panel decided on 9 October 2013 that the defendant was not shown to have a significant developmental delay.
	
	
	On 25 February 2015 the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) made a guardianship order in respect of the defendant and appointed the Public Guardian to be his guardian for a period of twelve months. The order provided that the Public Guardian’s functions included the function to decide where the defendant may reside; what health care he may receive and to make substitute decisions about medical or dental treatment for the defendant. NCAT also ordered that his estate be subject to management under the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009 (NSW) and that management of his estate be committed to the NSW Trustee and Guardian.
	


Relevant statutory provisions

The jurisdiction to make an extension order


	
	Part 5 of the Forensic Provisions Act, which deals with forensic and correctional patients, provides, by s 40, that the objects of the Act include to protect the safety of members of the public.
	
	
	Section 54A of the Forensic Provisions Act provides for the extension of the status as a forensic patient of a person in accordance with Sch 1. Clause 3 of Sch 1 to the Forensic Provisions Act permits the Minister for Mental Health, as a Minister administering Part 5 of the Act, to apply to this Court for an extension order against a forensic patient.
	
	
	The term “forensic patient” is defined in s 42 of the Forensic Provisions Act. It includes a person who is found unfit to be tried who is detained. Because the defendant was the subject of a limiting term and was detained in custody pursuant to an order made under s 24 of the Forensic Provisions Act, he is a forensic patient.
	
	
	Section 53 of the Forensic Provisions Act provides:
	


Classification as involuntary patient

(1) The Tribunal may, on a review of the case of a forensic patient detained in a mental health facility, correctional centre or other place following a special hearing, classify the patient as an involuntary patient if the patient would, by virtue of the operation of this Act or any other law, cease to be a forensic patient within 6 months after the date of the review.

(2) The Tribunal may order that a patient classified as an involuntary patient under this section be transferred from a correctional centre to a mental health facility.

Note. A person classified as an involuntary patient ceases to be a forensic patient, see section 52 (2).


	
	Section 54 of the Forensic Provisions Act provides:
	


Release from mental health facility on ceasing to be a forensic patient

A person who ceases to be a forensic patient (other than a person classified as an involuntary patient under section 53) must be discharged from the mental health facility in which the person is detained.


	
	The Forensic Provisions Act confers power on this Court to make an extension order if the forensic patient is subject to a limiting term or an existing extension order: cll 1 and 4, Sch 1. The test for making an extension order is set out in cl 2 of Schedule 1, as follows:
	


“Forensic patients in respect of whom extension orders may be made

(1)   A forensic patient can be made the subject of an extension order as provided for by this Schedule if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that:

(a)   the forensic patient poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he or she ceases being a forensic patient, and

(b)   the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under section 53).

(2)   The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person causing serious harm to others is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.”


	
	Clause 7(2) of Sch 1 sets out the matters to which this Court must have regard in determining whether to make an extension order, in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:
	



	
	the safety of the community,
	
	
	the reports received from the persons appointed under clause 6(5) to conduct examinations of the forensic patient,
	
	
	the report of the qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided under clause 5(b),
	
	
	any other report of a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided in support of the application or by the forensic patient,
	
	
	any order or decision made by the Tribunal with respect to the forensic patient that is relevant to the application,
	
	
	any report of the Director-General of the Ministry of Health, the Commissioner of Corrective Services, the Director-General of the Department of Family and Community Services or any other government Department or agency responsible for the detention, care or treatment of the forensic patient,
	
	
	the level of the forensic patient’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while a forensic patient (including while released from custody subject to conditions and while on a leave of absence in accordance with section 49 or 50),
	
	
	the views of the court that imposed the limiting term or existing extension order on the forensic patient at the time the limiting term or extension order was imposed,
	
	
	any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others.
	



	
	On the making of an extension order, the Court is neither required nor permitted to determine whether the order is one for detention of the individual or supervision within the community: it is for the Tribunal to determine these matters. Once an extension order has been made, it may be varied or revoked by the Court, on the application of either of the parties or on the recommendation of the Tribunal, under s 47(2A) of the Forensic Provisions Act: cl 12, Sch 1.
	


The procedure for applying for and making an extension order


	
	An application for an extension order must be made within the last 6 months of a forensic patient’s limiting term or of any existing extension order: cl 4(2), Sch 1.
	
	
	The applicant for an extension order is required to furnish to the Court documentation that addresses, to the extent relevant, each of the matters referred to in cl 7(2) and a report from a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner that assesses the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others, the need for ongoing management of the patient as a forensic patient and the reasons why the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means: cl 5, Sch 1.
	
	
	Proceedings under Sch 1 are civil proceedings and are to be conducted in accordance with the law relating to civil proceedings (including the rules of evidence): cl 13, Sch 1.
	
	
	The Act requires a preliminary hearing into the application within 28 days after the application is filed or within such further time as the Court allows: cl 6(4), Sch 1. If, following a preliminary hearing, the Court is satisfied that the matters alleged in the application would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order, the Court must appoint independent clinical experts to conduct examinations of the forensic patient and to furnish reports to the Court: cl 6(5), Sch 1. If not so satisfied, the Court must dismiss the application: cl 6(6).
	
	
	Clause 10, Sch 1 provides that the Court may make an interim extension order of the defendant’s status as a forensic patient if the limiting term will expire before the proceedings are determined and the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order.
	


Orders that may be made by the Tribunal in respect of forensic patients for release


	
	Section 47 of the Forensic Provisions Act empowers the Tribunal, after reviewing the case of a forensic patient under s 46, to make an order, including an order for the patient’s release, either conditionally or unconditionally. Leave of absence may also be granted pursuant to s 49, subject to safety considerations outlined in the section. Section 43 prohibits the Tribunal from making an order for release of a forensic patient unless it is satisfied that the safety of the patient or the public will not be endangered and:
	


“other care of a less restrictive kind, that is consistent with safe and effective care, is appropriate and reasonably available to the patient or that the patient does not require care.”


	
	The Tribunal may, under s 75 of the Forensic Provisions Act, impose a range of conditions as part of a conditional release order, including the appointment of a case manager, care and treatment, medication, accommodation, non-use of alcohol, drug testing, agreements as to conduct, prohibitions or restrictions on visiting certain places or associating with certain people.
	
	
	Section 74 of the Forensic Provisions Act requires the Tribunal to have regard to certain matters when determining what order to make about a person, which include: whether the person is suffering from a mental illness or other mental condition; whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control of the person is necessary for the person’s own protection from serious harm or the protection of others from serious harm; the continuing condition of the person, including any likely deterioration in the person’s condition, and the likely effects of any such deterioration; and a report of a forensic psychiatrist.
	


Involuntary detention and treatment in a mental health facility under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW)


	
	Part 2 of the Mental Health Act provides for involuntary detention and treatment of patients in mental health facilities. An involuntary patient is defined as:
	


(a) a person who is ordered to be detained as an involuntary patient after a mental health inquiry or otherwise by the Tribunal, or

(b) a forensic patient who is re-classified as an involuntary patient under section 53 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, or

(c) a correctional patient who is re-classified as an involuntary patient under section 65 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.


	
	For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the provisions that require that, before a person becomes an involuntary patient, he or she must be a “mentally ill person” or a “mentally disordered person”. For a person to be “mentally ill” the person must be suffering from “mental illness”. The term “mental illness” is defined in s 4 of the Mental Health Act to mean:
	


a condition that seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person and is characterised by the presence in the person of any one or more of the following symptoms:

(a) delusions,

(b) hallucinations,

(c) serious disorder of thought form,

(d) a severe disturbance of mood,

(e) sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of any one or more of the symptoms referred to in paragraphs (a)–(d).

Community treatment orders under the Mental Health Act


	
	The Mental Health Act makes provision for community treatment orders in respect of “affected persons”. Such orders authorize compulsory treatment of persons in the community. Section 53(4) provides that the Tribunal may not make a community treatment order unless it is of the opinion that the person is a “mentally ill person”.
	


Relevant provisions under the Guardianship Act 1987


	
	Section 4 of the Guardianship Act provides in part that “it is the duty of everyone exercising functions under this Act with respect to persons who have disabilities to observe the following principles”:
	



	
	The welfare and interests of such persons should be given paramount consideration: s 4(a);
	
	
	The freedom of decision and freedom of action of such persons should be restricted as little as possible: s 4(b); and
	
	
	Such persons should be encouraged, as far as possible, to live a normal life in the community.
	



	
	Part 5 of the Guardianship Act governs the provision of medical and dental treatment. Section 36 authorises a responsible person, including a guardian (or the Tribunal), to provide consent to the carrying out of medical treatment (minor and major). If a patient objects to the carrying out of medical treatment, the consent of the guardian has no effect (s 46(2)(a)) unless the patient has minimal or no understanding of what the treatment entails and the treatment will cause the patient no distress or reasonable tolerable and transitory distress (s 46(4). The patient’s objection may also be overridden if the Tribunal has conferred on the guardian a power to override (s 46A(1)), such power being conferred only if the Tribunal is satisfied that the objection will be made by the patient because of a lack of understanding as to the nature of, or reason for, the treatment (s 46A(2)).
	
	
	Section 11 of the Guardianship Act authorises the Tribunal, if it considers it to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case, to make an order for the “removal of the person from any premises” by an authorised officer or member of the police force, using reasonable force if necessary. Section 12 permits a police officer to apply to an authorised officer under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) for a warrant to enter and remove a person “who appears to be in need of a guardian” from premises if it is believed on reasonable grounds that a person “who appears to be in need of a guardian” is being unlawfully detained or is likely to suffer serious damage: s 12(1).
	


Relevant authorities


	
	I was referred to decisions of this Court in which the Forensic Provisions Act was considered. It was accepted that some guidance could be obtained from decisions under the Forensic Provisions Act. Judicial consideration of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the High Risk Offenders Act) is of particular relevance where the same, or similar, wording is used: see, for example: Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2013] NSWSC 1862 by Davies J at [12].
	
	
	Guidance as to the meaning of “high degree of probability” under the Forensic Provisions Act can, accordingly, be obtained from a consideration of its meaning in the High Risk Offenders Act. In Cornwall v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 (a decision under the High Risk Offenders Act), the Court of Appeal (Mason P, Giles and Hodgson JJA) said at [21]:
	


“The expression ‘a high degree of probability' indicates something 'beyond more probably than not', so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt ...""


	
	The question whether “the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order” also arises under the High Risk Offenders Act. The Court of Appeal in Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119; 70 NSWLR 448, said of similar wording in the High Risk Offenders Act at [98]:
	


“In determining whether the power to grant an interim order is enlivened, the Court is not involved in weighing that documentation or predicting the ultimate result. The power is enlivened if the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of either category of final order bearing in mind the elevated standard of proof stated in ss17(2) and (3) [of the High Risk Offenders Act]. That threshold question is to be resolved without considering what evidence might be called by the offender at the final hearing. Indeed, it is to be considered without taking into account the evidence (if any) called by the offender at the interim hearing: such evidence may go to (relevant) discretionary matters, but would not cast light upon what is alleged in the Attorney General’s supporting documentation.” 

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The phrase “unacceptable risk” is not defined in the Forensic Provisions Act. However, it is a common expression in Bail Acts: see Div 2 of Part 3, Bail Act 2013 (NSW); s 4(2)(d) Bail Act 1977 (Vic); s 6(1)(a) Bail Act 1980 (Qld). It is clear from the express terms of cl 2(1)(a) in the Forensic Provisions Act that the unacceptable risk is that of “causing serious harm to others”.
	
	
	Two approaches to the construction and application of the expression “unacceptable risk” in the Forensic Provisions Act have been applied in decisions of this Court:
	



	
	the ‘everyday meaning approach’ adopted by R A Hulme J in State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 at [20] and State of New South Wales v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 308 at [28]; and
	
	
	the ‘balancing exercise approach’ adopted by Davies J in State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) (2011) 210 A Crim R 220 at [90]. 
	



	
	The everyday meaning approach regards the test of unacceptable risk under the High Risk Offender Act as being satisfied if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex or violence offence (as the case may be) which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made. On the balancing exercise approach, the test for “unacceptable risk” involves a balancing exercise of first, the likelihood of committing a further serious offence; second, the gravity of such an offence; and third, the consequences of an order on the offender. As it was not suggested by either party that the determination of the current application turned on which test was applied, I do not regard it to be necessary to decide which test is to be preferred, unless I consider that one test would provide a different result than the other.
	
	
	Moreover, it does not appear to me to be appropriate to undertake a balancing exercise at a preliminary hearing in any event, having regard to the wording of cl 10, Sch 1 and what was said by the Court of Appeal in State of NSW v Tillman (set out above) as to the relevant threshold at a preliminary hearing.
	


Consideration


	
	As referred to above, an interim extension order can be made following a preliminary hearing if I am satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order. In other words, before I can make an interim extension order I must be satisfied that the supporting documentation is capable of satisfying the Court (at a final hearing) to a “high degree of probability” of the following two matters:
	



	
	that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient; and
	
	
	that the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under s 53 of the Forensic Provisions Act).
	



	
	I propose to address such matters in s 7(2) as are relevant for the purpose of considering whether I am satisfied that the supporting documentation is capable of establishing that there is a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient and that the risk cannot be managed by less restrictive means.
	


Report received from Ms Howell (s 7(2)(c))


	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on a report dated 22 June 2015 by Ms Howell, a qualified psychologist, in which she assessed the risk of the defendant causing serious harm to others and how the risk can be managed. Ms Howell opined that there was a moderate-high risk of sexual recidivism against either a young child or an adult female. She considered that his capacity to “groom” a victim was limited and that any such assault would be likely to be impulsive and opportunistic. His risk of recidivism would be increased were he to ingest alcohol or fail to comply with his medication.
	
	
	Ms Howell did not consider that the risk could be managed by less restrictive means than an extension order. She assessed the Bexley Care Centre and reported that the staff, although experienced with dealing with patients who had dementia, had very limited experience with prior sex offenders. Although there were mechanisms designed to prevent demented patients from wandering, the systems were not secure and did not prevent patients from exploring the grounds and coming into contact with other residents or visitors to the Centre. She did not consider there to be adequate safeguards in place at the Centre to prevent his ingesting alcohol.
	
	
	Ms Howell said (at page 24 of her report):
	


“It is my view that if the Bexley Care Centre provided their staff with training in relation to working with and managing the risk of sexual offenders in conjunction with upgrading security, they have the potential to safely manage Mr Brauer on a day to day basis. However, if Mr Brauer was determined to leave the centre at some time in the future and consume alcohol his risk of sexually re-offending would significantly increase.

Without the certainty that Mr Brauer can be safely managed at the Bexley Care Centre, it is my view that Mr Brauer would require ongoing management as a forensic patient.”

Any other report from a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist: cl 7(2)(d)


	
	The reports that were considered by King DCJ in nominating a limiting term and those that were considered by the Tribunal in its periodic reviews of the defendant have been addressed above. It is apparent that none of the authors of those reports purported to carry out a risk assessment in respect of the defendant. In so far as his risk was assessed as “low” it was either assumed to be so, or adjudged in the context of the highly structured, controlled and monitored custodial environment of the prison hospital where all residents were male, all staff members adult, the defendant had no access to alcohol and his medication was administered by staff.
	
	
	The defendant’s treating psychiatrist, Dr Bhattacharyya, expressed substantial concern that he not have any contact with children, to whom he would pose a risk.
	
	
	It was common ground that the defendant’s alcohol-related dementia tended to deprive him of insight and the capacity to control his impulses. Although Ms Kluss, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, submitted that medication and abstinence from alcohol had improved his condition, I am not persuaded that these matters were made out on the evidence or that they ameliorated the risk. That he was required to be abstinent while a forensic patient does not indicate that he would be able to be abstinent if alcohol were available. Although his depression and psychotic disturbance appear to have been cured by medication, it cannot reasonably be inferred that these conditions would not recur if he was no longer compliant with medication or if he started to drink again.
	
	
	If the defendant were no longer a forensic patient, he would be unrestrained by the controls presently in place. He would have access to adult females who were not staff members as well as children, who could not be expected to have the skills to deal with, or defend themselves against, his impulsive approaches or assaults. It was not suggested that any assault on an adult female or on a child would not amount to “serious harm” within the meaning of cl 2(1)(a).
	


Any report of the Tribunal, being an agency responsible for the detention, care or treatment of the forensic patient: cl 7(2)(f)


	
	The Determinations made by the Tribunal in respect of the defendant from time to time have been referred to above. I do not regard the reasons for these Determinations as indicating that the Tribunal undertook any real assessment of the risk posed by the defendant upon release. The Tribunal was concerned that accommodation needed to be found for him and that he might resort to alcohol upon release. However it was not required to, and did not, address the question that I am required to determine under Sch 1. The Tribunal understandably regarded Bexley Care Centre as being more appropriate than Department of Housing Accommodation and a Community Treatment Order.
	
	
	It is also of significance that the Tribunal appears to be firmly of the view that the defendant could not and cannot be made an involuntary patient within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) because he is not a “mentally ill person” in that he is not suffering from a “mental illness”. Although it is not articulated, it appears that the reason for this view is that, although the defendant is suffering from cognitive impairment arising from alcohol-related dementia, it may be that he does not meet the definition in the Mental Health Act because he no longer suffers from delusions, hallucinations, serious disorder of thought form, a severe disturbance of mood or sustained or repeated irrational behavior indicating the presence of any of these matters.
	


The level of the defendant’s compliance with any obligations to which he has been subject while a forensic patient: cl 7(2)(g)


	
	Because of the strict custodial conditions in which the defendant has been incarcerated for the last four and a half years, it is difficult to draw anything from his “compliance” since he was substantially deprived of choice (whether to take medication; whether to drink alcohol).
	


The views of the Court that imposed the limiting term on the defendant at the time it was imposed: cl 7(2)(h)


	
	It is evident from the extracts from the reasons of King DCJ set out above that his Honour adjudged the risk of recidivism to be relatively high and considered that it could not be readily controlled outside custody because of the defendant’s cognitive impairment, with its associated lack of insight and compromised capacity to control his impulses. His Honour doubted that the defendant would be able to abstain from consumption of alcohol and considered, in those circumstances, that the prospect of re-offending could not be regarded as low.
	


Any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others: cl 7(2)(i)


	
	The defendant’s criminal history is significant because it shows that the index offence was not an isolated impulsive act but can be seen as a further instance of unprovoked aggressive, sexual conduct against a vulnerable person. I have also taken into account the statements by the defendant’s ex-wife and her daughter as to the sexual assault in February 1993. Although this charge was not proceeded with because the complainant was not prepared to give evidence, the statements can be taken into account on the question of risk, since the Forensic Provisions Act does not limit the assessment of safety to conduct that has resulted in a criminal conviction.
	


Other matters


	
	Ms Kluss submitted that if an interim extension order is made, the defendant may well lose the opportunity to reside at the Bexley Care Centre because the bed will not continue to be made available to him. She contended that this militated against the granting of an interim extension order. For reasons given above, I do not consider the exercise of balancing the risk of serious harm to others against the interests of the defendant to be germane at a preliminary hearing (even if it were the applicable test at a final hearing). However, in any event, I do not consider that this submission ought be accepted. It is by no means inevitable that the defendant will lose the opportunity, since it is possible that the Tribunal, following a further review of the defendant, may make a conditional release order, entitling him to reside at the Centre, subject to such conditions as the Tribunal sees fit to impose (which may include abstinence from alcohol, compliance with medication, not approaching children and so on).
	


Conclusion as to whether the matters in the supporting documentation would, if proved, be capable of establishing unacceptable risk to the requisite standard


	
	On the basis of the matters referred to above I am satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation referred to above would, if proved, establish to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases to be a forensic patient. His lack of insight, lack of impulse control and past conduct indicate that the risk of his assaulting, including sexually assaulting, another person is high unless he is living in highly regulated and controlled circumstances. This is sufficient for the ‘everyday meaning approach’. If the ‘balancing exercise approach’ is required, it is necessary to have regard to the likelihood of the defendant’s causing serious harm to others; the gravity of such conduct and the consequences of the order on the defendant. In so far as the defendant has a right to be at liberty, I do not consider that this outweighs the harm he poses to others if he is at liberty. He has little, if any, capacity to moderate his conduct or impulses, to resist the urge to ingest alcohol if it is available or to resist the sexual urge if it arises and circumstances present him with the opportunity to satisfy it. Indeed, such is his compromised state, I do not consider that it can be regarded as being in his interests to be at liberty at all, unless the “liberty”, such as it is, is strictly controlled.
	


“Less restrictive” means available to manage the risk posed by the defendant


	
	Ms Kluss submitted that there were at least four mechanisms by which any risk posed by the defendant, even if found to be unacceptable, could be adequately managed by other less restrictive means than an extension order. They were:
	



	
	the procedure under the Mental Health Act whereby the defendant could be detained and treated as an involuntary patient;
	
	
	the procedure under the Mental Health Act whereby a community treatment order could be made in respect of the defendant;
	
	
	the protection afforded by the Public Guardian with respect to the defendant, having regard to the guardianship order made in respect of him. Ms Kluss referred to “coercive powers” being available to the Public Guardian, although she was unable to refer me to any specific provision of the Guardianship Act to make good the submission; and
	
	
	the controls in place at Bexley Care Centre for managing residents with dementia in a secure, supervised and controlled environment.
	



	
	It was not disputed that the defendant did not qualify for the Community Justice Program (which provides ongoing management of persons with an intellectual disability). Accordingly, Ms Kluss did not contend that it qualified as a “less restrictive means” for managing the risk posed by the defendant.
	
	
	Ms Wright submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that it was pure speculation whether the defendant would ever be treated as an involuntary patient and, indeed, she contended that such evidence as there was indicated that the Tribunal considered that avenue to be unavailable in respect of the plaintiff because he was not a “mentally ill person”. The same consideration applied to the availability of a community treatment order since such an order cannot be made unless the Tribunal is of the opinion that the person is a “mentally ill person”.
	
	
	Ms Wright submitted that the Public Guardian had neither the resources nor the interest in supervising the defendant for the protection of the public since the role of the Public Guardian was to act in the interests of the defendant rather than in the interests of public safety. Moreover the role did not extend to supervision on a constant basis but was largely confined to making of decisions which could then be implemented by others in respect of the person the subject of an order. For example, while the Public Guardian could decide that the defendant was to live at Bexley Care Centre, it could not ensure that he remain within its bounds or prevent his drinking alcohol while on the premises.
	
	
	Ms Wright also contended that the Bexley Care Centre could not amount to “means” within the meaning of cl 2(1)(b), Sch 1 because it was, in substance, “care”. She submitted that Parliament ought to be taken to have used the word “means” advisedly to mean something other than “care”, which was a word used elsewhere in the Forensic Provisions Act to connote the circumstances in which care was provided to a person. Ms Wright referred me to s 43 of the Forensic Provisions Act which provides that the Tribunal must not make an order releasing a forensic patient unless it is satisfied that other “care” of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available or that the patient does not require “care”. Ms Wright submitted that the adequacy of present or future arrangements at Bexley Care Centre is not relevant to the statutory test because it does not constitute a “means” of managing the risk he poses. She contended that the term “manage[ment] by other less restrictive means” refers to a legal framework, not a factual circumstance. Ms Wright submitted that, had Parliament intended to refer to facilities such as Bexley Care Centre in this context it would have referred to “care” rather than “means” and “manage[ment]”.
	


Conclusion as to means postulated for managing the risk


	
	I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the risk cannot be adequately managed by the possibility (which I accept to be speculative) that the defendant would be classified as an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act. There is a distinction between the risk posed by the defendant as a result of his alcohol-related dementia and cognitive impairment on the one hand and his classification as a “mentally ill person” under the Mental Health Act on the other. It does not appear that he meets the definition in the latter, although the risks posed by his conditions are substantial.
	
	
	Moreover, there is no prospect that the Tribunal will move to exercise its power under s 53 of the Forensic Provisions Act to classify the defendant as an involuntary patient, since if it was going to do so, it would have done so by now, having regard to its obligation to release a forensic patient who is not classified as an involuntary patient at the conclusion of the limiting term.
	
	
	I have been unable to identify in the Guardianship Act any coercive provision which could be regarded as adequate to manage the risk. The provisions pertaining to medical treatment would only permit the Public Guardian to consent to treatment. The Public Guardian’s power to override the objection of the person to certain treatment is limited by the provisions of the Guardianship Act as referred to above. In the circumstances of the present case, s 11 of the Guardianship Act would appear to permit police to remove the defendant from the Bexley Care Centre only if an order is made by the Tribunal. Section 12 of the Guardianship Act does not appear to be relevant to the present application.
	
	
	I accept that there is some force in the distinction sought to be drawn by Ms Wright between “means” on the one hand and “care” on the other. It is a fundamental principle of interpretation that all words are to be accorded meaning and effect. This means that where a word appears more than once in a document or statute it is to be given a consistent interpretation and where a different word is used it is not to be construed as if it were synonymous with another word used in the same document or statute: see, for example, Gardner v Regina [2003] NSWCCA 199 at [43], citing Scott v Commercial Hotel Merbein Pty Ltd [1930] VLR 25 at 30; see also Pearce & Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 8th edition, paragraph [4.6]. Accordingly, I would assume that “means” means something other than “care”. However, I do not consider it to be necessary to address the distinction between these words or the light that such distinction might shed on the construction of cl 2(1)(b), Sch 1 for the purposes of this preliminary hearing.
	
	
	In any event, I am satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation are capable of establishing to a high degree of probability that the risk cannot, without more, be adequately managed by the defendant living in Bexley Care Centre. The evidence discloses that Bexley Care Centre is a nursing home with special facilities for those, such as the defendant, with dementia. However, residents can move around within the precincts and visitors can come to the Centre. It is reasonable to expect that at least some of the residents will be vulnerable females in respect of whom the defendant may seek to satisfy his sexual urges and that at least some of the visitors will either fall into that category, or be children.
	
	
	This is not to say that the Bexley Care Centre is, of itself, inappropriate as the defendant’s residence. Indeed it may be that the Tribunal, as a result of the defendant’s remaining a forensic patient as a result of the interim extension order, might order that he be conditionally released to reside there. However, unless there are coercive powers to manage his risk (and there do not appear to be any unless an extension order is made), the unacceptable risk he poses cannot be adequately managed if the matters alleged in the supporting documentation are proved.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my view the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order. I am persuaded that it is appropriate, in these circumstances, to make an interim extension order for the maximum period allowed of 28 days. It may be necessary for this to be extended since the reports from a qualified psychiatrist and psychologist are unlikely to be available before the expiry of that period.
	
	
	I emphasise that this is but a preliminary hearing. My view that an interim extension order is appropriate is not intended to foreclose a contrary view being reached at a later interim application or at the final hearing in the context of further evidence (which will include the reports which I have ordered be prepared and furnished to the Court) and more developed submissions.
	
	
	In light of the view to which I have come, I am obliged by cl 6, Sch 1 to appoint two qualified professionals to conduct examinations of the defendant and furnish reports to the Court on the results of those examinations and to direct the defendant to attend such examinations. It is common ground that it is appropriate that a qualified psychiatrist and a registered psychologist be appointed, although agreement has not been reached as to the identity of such persons.
	


Timing of the application


	
	The summons in this matter was filed in Court on 24 June 2015. The preliminary hearing was listed before me as Duty Judge on 30 June 2015. The Forensic Provisions Act required a decision whether an interim extension order ought be granted to be made before midnight on 30 June 2015. In support of the application, the plaintiff relied on evidence spanning several decades which included experts’ reports, a criminal history, statements to police, reviews by the Tribunal and policy documents.
	
	
	The plaintiff has known from 5 December 2013 that the limiting term would expire on 30 June 2015 and that any application for an interim extension order would have to be made by that date. No explanation was given by the plaintiff was to why the application was not made earlier. Although the defendant’s psychiatric condition changed from time to time during the limiting term, his alcohol-related dementia and cognitive impairment, which remained intractable, coupled with his criminal history, were what gave rise to the risk.
	
	
	The decision whether to make an interim extension order is a serious one. It almost inevitably results in the continued detention of a person who would otherwise be entitled to be at liberty. The material in support of the application is often, as in the present case, relatively voluminous and may require careful reading and consideration in order to appreciate its gravamen.
	
	
	It is regrettable that the Minister did not see fit to allow me more time to make such a serious decision. Such extraordinary delay is hardly consistent with what might be expected from the plaintiff as a model litigant. Nonetheless I do not suggest that my decision was not fully considered. I read all the material tendered. I was ably assisted by counsel at the hearing.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I made on 30 June 2015 were:
	


1. Pursuant to clause 6(5) of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (‘the Act’):

a. The Court appoints one qualified psychiatrist (the identity of whom is to be agreed between the parties) and one registered psychologist (the identity of whom is to be agreed between the parties) to conduct separate examinations of the Defendant and to furnish reports on the results of those examinations to the Court, such reports to be furnished to the Court on or before 17 August 2015 or such further time as I may allow; and

b. The Defendant is directed to attend those examinations.

2. Pursuant to clause 10 of Schedule 1 of the Act, the Court makes an interim extension order in respect of the Defendant for a period of 28 days from 1 July 2015.

3. Stand the proceedings over to 9:30 am on 21 July 2015 before me to hear any application to extend the interim extension order referred to in order 2 above.

2767070,R v Cullen [2015] NSWSC 768,"remarks on sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: The deceased Victoria Comrie Cullen died on 22 January 2014 at Taren Point as the result of severe knife wounds sustained in the course of a ferocious and sustained attack upon her by Christopher Cullen. The deceased was the wife of Mr Cullen and the mother of three of his children. They had been separated since about October the previous year and were in the early stages of litigation about issues that were generated by the breakdown of the relationship.
	
	
	On 2 June 2015 Mr Cullen was found guilty by a jury of the murder of his wife following a three week trial. Mr Cullen had pleaded guilty to manslaughter for causing her death but the Crown declined to accept that plea in satisfaction of the single charge on the indictment.   
	
	
	The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In the event that a determinate sentence is imposed, a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies. In proceeding to determine the appropriate sentence, I am not required to commence by considering whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. Similarly, I am not required to make an assessment of whether or not the offence is within the mid-range of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]). The relevant statutory provisions generally, and the provisions of ss 54B(2) and (3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in particular, require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a judgment is reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]). The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27] and [31]).
	


Factual findings


	
	I acknowledge that my fact-finding role is that described in Isaacs v R (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587. I am required to find the facts material to the sentence. To the extent that my findings are based on facts led at the trial, they must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. Any findings of fact that are adverse to the offender must be found beyond reasonable doubt. Matters in mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. A judge's finding of facts upon which the sentence is based is, ""both on what was necessarily implicit in the jury verdict and on his/her own impressions"": R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [196].
	


General background


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following facts.
	
	
	Mr Cullen was born in the United Kingdom in October 1963 and was 50 years of age at the date of the offence. The deceased was also born in the United Kingdom in November 1974. She was aged 39 years at the date of her death. Mr Cullen and the deceased met whilst holidaying in Australia in 1997 and commenced a relationship soon thereafter. They were married in Fiji in February 2000. In September 2011 they moved to Australia and were subsequently each granted permanent residency here. There are three children of the marriage born respectively in 2003, 2006 and 2008.
	
	
	By October 2013 the relationship between the deceased and Mr Cullen had deteriorated to the point where the deceased had ceased to reside with her husband and had moved out of the family home. She initially stayed with friends but later secured premises of her own in an apartment block at 53B Auburn Street, Sutherland. The deceased was at that time employed as a beautician at a salon in Sylvania Waters. Mr Cullen remained living with the children at Sylvania Waters only a short distance from the salon.
	
	
	The separation and the deterioration in the relationship between the deceased and Mr Cullen spawned legal action in October 2013 in both the Local Court and the Family Court.
	
	
	On 1 November 2013 Mr Cullen attended the salon where the deceased was working and proceeded to write large signs that were displayed nearby saying that the deceased was sleeping with her clients and was a bad mother. Police attended on this occasion and Mr Cullen was told to move on.
	
	
	On 10 November 2013 the police applied for and were granted a provisional Apprehended Violence Order naming the deceased as the person in need of protection. However, the evidence from a domestic violence liaison officer to whom the deceased was referred, and the police entries relating to her complaints to them, do not establish that she had been the subject of violence at the hands Mr Cullen. On the other hand, evidence from the deceased’s friends and work colleagues suggested that Mr Cullen had been violent and had made serious verbal threats to her during the marriage and even after the separation. As late as the day of her death there were continuing disputes between Mr Cullen and the deceased. The deceased had made appointments with clients for the day that she died.
	
	
	At 9.30 am on 22 January 2014 Mr Cullen and the deceased attended the Sutherland Local Court in relation to a civil claim filed by Mr Cullen regarding damage to his car. Mr Cullen had obtained a default judgment against the deceased which the Registrar set aside. The matter was listed on a later occasion for a pre-trial review. CCTV footage clearly depicts the events at the Local Court on that morning. They include scenes depicting the deceased and Mr Cullen sitting together in the waiting area outside the court, entering the courtroom and sitting separately, sitting at the bar table during the proceedings and then leaving the court thereafter. Footage exposed inside the court shows Mr Cullen leaving ahead of his wife without speaking to her. Images captured outside the court complex show the deceased leaving the building behind Mr Cullen. No words are spoken between them.
	
	
	The evidence thereafter makes it clear that the deceased drove back to her apartment in Auburn Street, Sutherland, which was only about 500 metres from the court. She drove from the street down the common driveway and parked her car in her garage underneath the apartments. Mr Cullen followed her there in his car and also drove down to the garage area underneath. Evidence from neighbours in the surrounding apartments establishes that screams of pain were heard to emanate from the garage area. Mr Cullen assaulted the deceased in that area, breaking her nose, and forced her into the boot of his car. Later examination of the deceased’s garage and motor vehicle established the presence of her blood on the garage floor and on her car. Papers referable to the legal proceedings in the Local Court were found scattered on the garage floor beside the deceased’s car.
	
	
	Mr Cullen then drove his white Hyundai motor vehicle out of the garage area of the apartment complex with the deceased in his boot. That would appear to have occurred at some time close to or around 10.30 am. Mr Cullen subsequently drove to the Boating, Camping and Fishing store at Taren Point. CCTV footage at that location shows Mr Cullen parking his car in the car park and entering the store. The deceased was at that time still trapped in the boot of his car.
	
	
	Additional CCTV images captured inside the store show Mr Cullen purchasing a packet of two fishing knives and a black shirt. He proceeded to the cash register and paid for these items. He was issued with a receipt that contained a description of these items as well as his name. Mr Cullen left the store with his purchases and returned to the car. He then drove away from the car park at approximately 12.20 pm.
	
	
	Between approximately 12.30 pm and 1.00 pm Mr Cullen drove to the St George and Sutherland Shire Anglers’ Club on the shores of Woolooware Bay at Taren Point. He was a member of that club. Its premises are located in a small reserve at the end of a service road about 400 metres long controlled by a locked boom gate to which Mr Cullen had a key. Later that afternoon the body of the deceased was discovered on an area of lawn adjacent to the clubhouse. She was found slumped forward face down in a kneeling position with her arms in front of her and her head on the ground. Examination of her body revealed that she had sustained several stab and slicing wounds to her body and throat. The deceased was left handed and she also sustained a series of sharp force injuries to that hand that were consistent with defensive injuries. She also sustained a series of blunt force injuries.
	
	
	Mr Cullen’s car was parked a few metres away from the body of the deceased. It was spattered and smeared with both his blood and that of the deceased. The deceased’s blood was also found in the boot of the car, together with some remnants of her hair, and blood soaked tissues containing traces of mascara. The two fishing knives that Mr Cullen had purchased earlier that day were located on the ground a few metres or so from the driver’s side of his car.
	
	
	As the result of a call to emergency services, the police and ambulance personnel attended the scene at about 2.30 pm. At approximately 3.17 pm that afternoon police officers were alerted by the sound of moaning and saw Mr Cullen emerging wet and shivering from an area of mangroves lining the shore. He was wearing a black shirt and was suffering from the effects of a series of self-inflicted wounds to his chest, abdomen and wrists. His left lung had been punctured and had collapsed and he was suffering from subcutaneous emphysema, a condition caused by the internal entrapment of escaping air from his punctured lung.
	
	
	Mr Cullen was arrested at the scene and charged with the murder of his wife. He has not at any time disputed that he killed the deceased using one or both of the fishing knives purchased by him earlier that day.
	


The trial


	
	Because Mr Cullen pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased, the trial was conducted upon the basis that there were only two fundamental issues in dispute. They were whether the Crown could satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that in killing the deceased Mr Cullen acted neither in self-defence nor under provocation. Mr Cullen’s plea also carried with it the consequence that there was no issue that his actual response to any real or perceived threat was excessive, quite apart from the anterior issue of whether or not the jury were otherwise satisfied he had acted in self-defence in the first place.
	


Intention


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Cullen intended to kill the deceased. Even though the possibly different sentencing consequences of a finding that he intended only to inflict grievous bodily harm may be insignificant in this case, I am satisfied that Mr Cullen decided, from a point no later than his decision to purchase the fishing knives, that he had in mind a plan to take the deceased to the Taren Point location and kill her. It is apparent that Mr Cullen was physically capable of overpowering the deceased without the need to use a weapon. I consider that the fact that he was able to force her into the boot of his car bears eloquent testament to that proposition. Secondly, and in a related sense, I consider that Mr Cullen purchased the knives in order to kill the deceased and not merely to inflict non-lethal injuries with them. Thirdly, as was conceded by his counsel during the trial, the attack upon the deceased was frenzied. The multiplicity and severity of the sharp and blunt force injuries to the deceased are indicative of a brutal and sustained attack upon her and as such wholly inconsistent with an attempt only to cause injury or harm falling short of death. Fourthly, Mr Cullen took the deceased to a location that was either deserted or at least not the subject of large amounts of passing pedestrian or vehicular traffic at which he could kill the deceased in relative seclusion and privacy. That would not have been necessary if he had wanted to do no more to the deceased than he did in fact at the Auburn Street garage.
	
	
	There is no basis for a finding that Mr Cullen decided to kill the deceased any earlier than some time on the day that she was killed. Mr Cullen did not have the knives or any other lethal weapon with him when they arrived at the Sutherland Local Court that morning. That also applied to the events in the car park at Auburn Street. I accept that this supports the proposition that when Mr Cullen arrived at those premises that his fatal attack upon her had not been premeditated. The duct tape and rope found in the boot of his car were not used to restrain the deceased while she was in it. It is possible that Mr Cullen had decided to kill the deceased at about the time that he assaulted her in the garage of her home but there is no satisfactory evidence to support such a finding. I am however satisfied that Mr Cullen had formed the intention to kill the deceased by the time he arrived at the Boating, Camping and Fishing store where he purchased the knives.
	
	
	The Crown was not required to establish that Mr Cullen had any specific or other motive to kill the deceased as part of its case at trial. However, I consider that the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was killed as the result of considerable frustration and resentment built up over time secondary to the breakdown of the marital relationship between Mr Cullen and the deceased. The deterioration in the relationship came to a head in late 2013 when the deceased left the family home. Mr Cullen was then confronted with the day to day care of their children as well as a dispute about custody and access arrangements for them. Mr Cullen accurately suspected that the deceased was in a sexual relationship with another man, and the couple exchanged heated text messages throughout the period between the separation and her death. The temporarily unfavourable result in the Local Court proceedings on the day of the murder appears to have been the final straw in the accumulation of this resentment and frustration that led directly to the death of the deceased.
	
	
	It is apparent that the jury entirely rejected any suggestion that the death of the deceased was the result of, or was in any way connected with, self-defence. That is in my view entirely consistent with the evidence at the trial. Any suggestion that Mr Cullen was defending himself from any real or perceived threat from the deceased realistically stands or falls with a finding that he sustained a wound inflicted by the deceased. Such a suggestion seems in the circumstances of this case to be wholly unbelievable and it is unsurprising that the jury rejected it outright.
	
	
	It is equally clear that the jury was satisfied that the Crown had negatived provocation as a defence, although it is less clear which of two possible courses to that result they followed. Doing the best I can it seems probable that the jury concluded that Mr Cullen was provoked to the point of loss of self-control by what he perceived to be the words and conduct of the deceased over time in the latter stages of their marriage, even though the deceased was doing no more than acting reasonably as one party to a relationship who wished, and who was perfectly entitled, to bring it to an end. A finding that Mr Cullen was, or may have been, provoked by the deceased is not to be confused with a finding that she provoked him intentionally or maliciously or for some spiteful or hurtful purpose. The words and conduct of the deceased in this case were no more and no less than the understandable and expected reaction of any woman or man in her position. The fact, if it be the fact, that Mr Cullen was provoked by the deceased is not any reflection upon her so much as it is an indication of Mr Cullen’s own inability to deal with his situation in an ordered and civilised way. Marital breakdown and collateral discord are well documented causes of anger and frustration across an extreme range of variations from what is normal and acceptable at one end to what is violent and unacceptable at the other. Mr Cullen’s reactions were clearly and tragically at one extreme.
	
	
	Whatever conclusion the jury may have formed on this aspect of the provocation equation, I am satisfied that Mr Cullen’s response clearly exceeded the response of an ordinary person with his capacities and capabilities in his position. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt upon all of the evidence that an ordinary person in Mr Cullen’s position would not have responded as he did to anything said or done by the deceased at any time during the latter stages of the marriage. I am satisfied, consistently with the jury’s verdict that the conduct of the deceased was not such that it could have induced an ordinary person in Mr Cullen’s position to have so far lost his self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, whether the conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the acts causing death, or at any previous time.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	Mr Cullen was born in 1963 in the United Kingdom and is now 52 years of age. Apart from the details concerning his marriage to the deceased to which I have earlier referred, I am only aware that he was a self-employed carpenter and a member of the St George and Sutherland Shire Anglers’ Club where he regularly went fishing with his children.
	
	
	I have not been provided with any expert medical, psychological or psychiatric reports or other material detailing Mr Cullen’s background, his childhood, his early or later life experiences or other information or material upon the basis of which to form any opinions about him at all. This also includes his custodial experience since his arrest, his medical status, and any matters specifically affecting or relating to his period on remand. Apart from the available details of his criminal record, referred to later, I am therefore unable to express views about Mr Cullen’s personal situation in any relevant or reliable way.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	Mr Cullen has no criminal history in Australia although he does have a criminal record from his time in the United Kingdom. Mr Cullen was first convicted at the age of 13 for burglary and theft. He has a series of convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two convictions for assault occasioning grievous bodily harm for which he received sentences of imprisonment. The most significant of these offences would appear to be an assault upon a victim with a knuckleduster in late 1994 for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 2 years. Mr Cullen has served other lesser periods of imprisonment for other offences of violence.
	
	
	I am mindful of the well-known comments of the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 456 at 477. Mr Cullen’s relevant criminal history does not include an offence such as the one for which he now stands to be sentenced. In terms of the protection of society, prior to the commission of this offence Mr Cullen had not committed an offence of violence in Australia at all or in his country of birth for approximately 20 years. Moreover, having regard to the sentence that I intend to impose, Mr Cullen will be much older when he becomes entitled to be released on parole.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	There are no mitigating factors. Mr Cullen’s self-inflicted wounds do not qualify as such: see Christodoulou v R [2008] NSWCCA 102.
	


Remorse and contrition


	
	Mr Cullen did not give evidence at his trial and did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings. He has not expressed remorse or contrition for his offending either directly or indirectly. No submissions to the contrary were made on his behalf in this respect.
	


Deterrence and retribution


	
	Mr Cullen’s conduct is definitively unacceptable. It cannot be justified or excused on any legal or moral basis. The death of the deceased is another example of the extremely prevalent violence perpetrated by men in our society against women to whom they are married or with whom they share a relationship of domestic intimacy. This malignant cycle of domestic violence is given significant publicity and media attention without corresponding or equivalent success in its prevention. To the extent that a sentence in a case such as this can operate to deter its repetition in another similar case, then it should be formulated and calculated to do so. I have considerable doubt that murders or assaults that are committed by men in the context of physical or psychological dominance or control over women are ever or often influenced by a rational appreciation of the penal consequences. The importance of general deterrence, strictly understood in cases like the present, has therefore to be approached with caution. However, the importance of retribution is quite another thing. There is an uncontroversial and recognized need to emphasise clearly that violent and controlling men who commit such crimes against women will be punished severely.
	


Special circumstances


	
	It was not suggested that there were any reasons why the statutory ratio of parole to non-parole periods should not apply.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	This offence of murder in this case is subject to a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 20 years: s 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle range of objective seriousness without regard to factors affecting the sentence for a particular offender.
	
	
	In my view the murder of the deceased in this case represents an offence above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The deceased was assaulted and incarcerated in the boot of Mr Cullen’s car for some hours between the events at Auburn Street, Sutherland and her death at Taren Point. It is unknown at what stage in that period preceding her death that the deceased started to fear, or even became aware, that her death was or might have been imminent, and it is important in the absence of evidence not to speculate about it. By the same token, the deceased was clearly Mr Cullen’s captive as she lay injured, probably terrified and at the very least confused in the cramped confines of the boot of his car as he drove to the scene of her death.
	
	
	If the deceased was unaware or confused about her fate at any time up until then, her lack of awareness and confusion must quickly have dissipated as soon as the boot was opened and she was confronted by Mr Cullen by then presumably armed with the knives he would use to kill her. It is difficult if not impossible to imagine, let alone describe, the terror that must at that moment have consumed her. In so saying I accept that there is no direct or precise evidence of the order of events, or of the events themselves, that occurred from that time until the deceased came to rest in the posture described, by now dead, on the lawn behind the vehicle. However, the rear end of Mr Cullen’s car was smeared with the deceased’s blood, and it seems likely that Mr Cullen’s attack upon the deceased commenced before she was liberated from it. The nature and number of her wounds makes it plain that she was ferociously attacked. The forensic evidence reveals that stab wounds to her torso caused her death, although the deceased also sustained two very significant and gaping wounds to her throat on each side. As previously mentioned, the deceased’s left hand was also severely lacerated, suggesting clearly that she attempted unsuccessfully to deflect or shield herself from Mr Cullen’s several and repeated assaults.
	
	
	There is no evidence to establish how long the fatal attack lasted. It would appear clearly however that the deceased’s death was not instantaneous, so that combined with her uncertain journey in the boot of the car, and the patently terrifying circumstances that finally confronted her, the offence was one of awful brutality and of a very high level of culpability.
	
	
	The death of the deceased was unnecessary, unwarranted, unfair and inexcusable. Mr Cullen callously decided to kill the deceased for his own selfish and personal reasons. It is a tragedy for the deceased as well as for her family and friends, in particular for their children. It is also a tragedy for Mr Cullen.
	


Orders


	
	Mr Cullen has remained in custody since the date of his arrest. In the circumstances I make the following orders:
	



	
	Christopher Cullen, for the death of Victoria Comrie Cullen you are convicted.
	
	
	I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 30 years commencing on 22 January 2014 and expiring on 21 January 2044 with a non-parole period of 22 years and 6 months expiring on 21 July 2036.

		02 July 2015",2015-07-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767074,R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I have read the judgment of Johnson J in draft. I agree with his Honour's reasons. I agree that all grounds of appeal have been made out, that the discretion to resentence should be exercised, and that a fulltime custodial sentence is appropriate for the Commonwealth and State child pornography offences. I agree with the sentences proposed by his Honour.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: These are Crown appeals with respect to sentences imposed upon the Respondent, David Ferdinand Porte, at the Sydney District Court on 14 November 2014.
	


The Offences and Sentences


	
	The Respondent had pleaded guilty on 11 March 2014 to the following three offences:
	



	
	between 5 and 12 March 2013, he used a carriage service to access child pornography material contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth), an offence punishable by imprisonment for 15 years;
	
	
	on 12 March 2013, he possessed child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), an offence punishable by imprisonment for 10 years, and
	
	
	on 12 March 2013, he possessed a prohibited weapon without a permit contrary to s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 (NSW), an offence punishable by imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of three years.
	



	
	On 14 November 2014, his Honour Judge Maiden SC sentenced the Respondent to concurrent terms of 18 months’ imprisonment on each count and directed that the terms of imprisonment be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order (“ICO”) commencing on 21 November 2014.
	


The Crown Appeals


	
	On 12 December 2014, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions filed a Notice of Appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) with respect to the sentence imposed for the Commonwealth offence. Thereafter, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) filed a s.5D appeal with respect to sentences passed for the New South Wales offences.
	
	
	On 24 April 2015, Further Amended Notices of Appeal were filed on behalf of each of the Commonwealth and State Directors. The Commonwealth Director relied upon the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1 - his Honour failed to take into account the matters set out in Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), in particular s.16A;
	
	
	Ground 2 - his Honour erred in ordering full concurrency with the remaining sentences;
	
	
	Ground 3 - his Honour erred in ordering an ICO assessment before evidence and submissions were complete;
	
	
	Ground 4 - his Honour failed to apply the provisions of s.7(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) when ordering that the sentence be served by way of an ICO; and
	
	
	Ground 5 - the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	


Particulars

*   his Honour erred in ordering that the sentence be served by way of ICO;

*   his Honour failed to have due regard to totality in sentencing;

*   his Honour failed to have due regard to general and specific deterrence;

*   his Honour erred in giving undue weight to the offender’s physical and mental health; and

*   his Honour erred in ordering the sentence be served concurrently with the remaining sentences.


	
	The New South Wales Director relied upon Grounds 2 to 5 in similar terms to the Commonwealth Director. However, Ground 1 in the New South Wales appeal asserted that his Honour failed to take into account the matters set out in s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


Facts of Offences


	
	An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered in the District Court which revealed the following.
	
	
	The Australian Federal Police (”AFP”) were investigating child pornography material being shared or downloaded over the Internet, using “peer-to-peer” file sharing technology, which is an Internet network that allows a group of computer users with the same networking program to connect with each other and directly access files from one another’s hard drives.
	
	
	As part of that investigation, the AFP identified that, between 28 October 2011 and 20 January 2013, an Internet Protocol address subscribed in the name of the Respondent was being used to download child pornography videos and images.
	


Execution of Search Warrant on 12 March 2013


	
	On 12 March 2013, members of the AFP executed a search warrant at the Respondent’s premises in Kenthurst. The Respondent (then 47 years old) was present at the time of execution of the search warrant.
	
	
	Upon execution of the warrant, the AFP located and seized a number of computer hardware devices and numerous hard drive storage devices. The seized items included a laptop computer, a desktop computer, 14 external hard disk drives and a compact disk. Also located was a packaged canister of “Mace” which was subsequently seized (giving rise to the charge under s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 (NSW)).
	
	
	Whilst executing the warrant, AFP Agents noticed that a laptop computer located in the Respondent’s bedroom was operating and a “peer-to-peer” file sharing program was running and in the process of downloading approximately 916 files. The file names of many of the files being downloaded were indicative of child pornography material. One of the video files, which had fully downloaded, was viewed and identified by AFP Agents as child pornography material (see [28] below).
	
	
	In addition to the video referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Respondent was shown another video which had been located on one of the external hard disk drives found near the laptop (see [29] below).
	
	
	When questioned in recorded conversations conducted during the execution of the search warrant, the Respondent stated the following:
	



	
	he had stored child pornography on his laptop computer and on a number of the external hard disk drives;
	
	
	he had downloaded child pornography to his laptop computer using a “peer-to-peer” file sharing program;
	
	
	he was interested in girls aged between 12 and 15 years of age who looked like women, but not engaged in sexual acts;
	
	
	he had used search terms related to girls to locate and download the images, and he downloaded files in bulk;
	
	
	he was not sure of the legal definition of child pornography material, but understood it was illegal to download and to possess it;
	
	
	he had started to download the files some time ago, and when his laptop computer became full, he would transfer them to one of the external hard disk drives;
	
	
	he had previously watched the video referred to at [14] (and [29]), but said that he had not watched it all the way through;
	
	
	he had been caught by his wife deleting some child pornography material several weeks before, and as a result intended to delete all his child pornography material.
	



	
	Material identified by the AFP as child pornography is classified into categories according to the Australian National Victim Image Library (“ANVIL”) Schema, also known as the Child Exploitation Tracking System (“CETS”) scale. The CETS scale classifies the activity depicted in child pornography material as follows:
	



	
	Category 1 - nudity or sexually suggestive posing with no sexual activity;
	
	
	Category 2 - non-penetrative sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child;
	
	
	Category 3 - non-penetrative sexual activity between adult(s) and child(ren);
	
	
	Category 4 - penetrative sexual activity between children or adult(s) and child(ren);
	
	
	Category 5 - sadism, humiliation or bestiality; and
	
	
	Category 6 - animated or virtual depictions of children engaged in sexual poses or activity.
	



	
	ANVIL is a database of child pornography material which has been previously identified by officers from Australian law enforcement agencies. The child pornography material on the database is already classified into the above categories, together with their unique hash values. These hash values can be utilised for the analysis of electronic files. This database is continuously updated as new child pornography material is identified and classified.
	


Possession on 12 March 2013 of Child Abuse Material - s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)


	
	Subsequent examination of the seized devices revealed child pornography and child abuse material stored on the laptop computer, and on seven of the external hard disk drives.
	
	
	In total, 34,143 items, which have been classified as “child abuse material” as defined in s.91FB(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (see [80] below), were found on the devices in the Respondent’s possession. These items have been classified, according to the CETS scale of objective seriousness, into the following categories:
	



	
	a total of 27,720 images and videos were classified within Category 1;
	
	
	a total of 1,156 images and videos were classified within Category 2;
	
	
	a total of 2,161 images and videos were classified within Category 3;
	
	
	a total of 2,567 images and videos were classified within Category 4;
	
	
	a total of 240 images and videos were classified within Category 5; and
	
	
	a total of 299 images and videos were classified within Category 6.
	



	
	Out of the total number of 34,143 items possessed, 2,260 were videos. Of those videos, using the CETS scale:
	



	
	88 were classified within Category 3;
	
	
	493 were classified within Category 4; and
	
	
	27 were classified within Category 5.
	


Using a Carriage Service Between 5 and 12 March 2013 to Access Child Pornography Material - s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth)


	
	Subsequent examination of the seized laptop computer revealed that the Internet had been used to access and download 17 child pornography images and 48 child pornography videos. All of these constituted “child pornography material” as defined in s.473.1 Criminal Code (Cth) (see [81] below).
	
	
	On 11 March 2013, the day before the execution of the search warrant, the Internet had been accessed on the laptop computer and Google chrome web browser had been used to access 17 child pornography images. These 17 images were each classified within Category 1 on the CETS scale.
	
	
	Between 9 and 12 March 2013, the Internet had been accessed on the laptop computer, via the use of a “peer-to-peer” file sharing program, and 48 child pornography videos were accessed and downloaded. Using the CETS scale, these videos were classified into the following categories:
	



	
	31 videos were classified within Category 1;
	
	
	5 videos were classified within Category 2;
	
	
	3 videos were classified within Category 3; and
	
	
	9 videos were classified within Category 4.
	


Possession on 12 March 2013 of a Prohibited Weapon Without a Permit - s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 (NSW)


	
	Forensic examination of the seized canister of “Mace” revealed that the canister was a “Mace” brand pepper spray, which contained chemical compounds commonly known as tear gas (or CN) and oleoresin capsicums (or OC).
	
	
	The definition of “prohibited weapon” includes any defence or anti-personnel spray that is capable of discharging, by any means, any irritant matter comprising or containing any one or more of a number of substances in liquid, powder, gas or chemical form - including chloroacetophenone (known as CN) and oleoresin capsicum (known as OC), clause 22, Schedule 1; s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW).
	
	
	The Respondent did not have any permit to possess this prohibited weapon.
	
	
	The Respondent told the author of the presentence report that he had acquired the “Mace” in 2003 at a trade fair in the USA, and that he believed it was legal to retain it. He gave evidence to a similar effect (AB11). There was no evidence that the Respondent possessed the “Mace” for any criminal purpose.
	


Child Pornography Material Shown to the Respondent During AFP Questioning


	
	The child pornography video which was downloading on the laptop computer as the AFP Agents executed the search warrant (see [13] above), depicted a girl of Asian appearance between approximately 10 and 12 years of age in her underwear. According to the statement of facts, the girl poses “erotically” for the camera, removes her bra and continues to pose in her underpants. This item fell within Category 1 on the CETS scale.
	
	
	The video shown to the Respondent by AFP Agents during the execution of the warrant (see [14] above), depicted a girl of Asian appearance, between approximately eight and 10 years of age, engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse with an adult male who was wearing a black balaclava. This item fell within Category 4 on the CETS scale.
	


The Respondent’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Respondent was 47 years old at the time of the offences and 49 years old at the time of sentence.
	
	
	His criminal history involved an offence in 1986 of malicious injury for which he was fined $50.00.
	
	
	The Respondent was born in Chile and, at about the age of five, he relocated with his family to the United States of America and about a year later, migrated to Australia. He left school at the age of 15 and then undertook further business studies. He was self-employed between 2001 and 2011 in the import and marketing of industrial hardware. However, this business collapsed. As a result of a work-related injury in 2008, the Respondent was unemployed for a number of years. The Respondent had secured part-time employment in a management capacity for a metal fabrication company between the time of his arrest and sentence.
	
	
	The Respondent and his wife had been in a relationship for about 30 years and were married for some 21 years. They resided at their home at Kenthurst since 2003. There were no children of the relationship.
	
	
	Before the sentencing court were a presentence report dated 30 May 2014 prepared by a Community Corrections Officer, a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 11 October 2014, a letter from the Respondent’s wife and a number of reports concerning the Respondent’s health.
	
	
	The Respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing on 24 October 2014.
	
	
	The presentence report recorded the Respondent’s acknowledgement that his interest in the downloaded material related to girls in their mid-to-late adolescent years. He denied that he had intended to access offensive material involving younger girls, stating that such material was automatically included in bulk downloaded files. He told the Community Corrections Officer that he was deeply embarrassed and ashamed by his offending which he denied stemmed from seeking sexual gratification from viewing such material of younger girls. He stated that, in hindsight, he was aware that his actions contributed to the exploitation of young girls, something that he now regrets.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed the Respondent as suffering from depression and a hoarding disorder, and commented that he was not thought to have a disorder of abnormal sexual interest, such as heterosexual paedophilia.
	
	
	The report of Dr Nielssen recorded the following matters:
	



	
	the Respondent agreed that he had told the police that he was attracted to teenage girls;
	
	
	the search terms that the Respondent used included “girls”, “dorm girls”, “teenage girls” and “cheer leaders”;
	
	
	the Respondent did not use pornography more than once a week;
	
	
	although he “didn’t seek them [images of children] out”, he had viewed such images and had intended to delete them, but “didn’t delete them like I should have”;
	
	
	he had a further 200,000 files on his computer devices which were not classified as child pornography;
	
	
	he was interested in “pretty girls who look like women”.
	



	
	Other medical evidence tendered by the defence on sentence established that:
	



	
	the Respondent suffered from spinal degeneration caused by trauma which required surgical intervention;
	
	
	he was scheduled for surgical evaluation on 15 January 2015;
	
	
	he was prescribed anti-coagulant medication following a pulmonary embolism and he was scheduled to continue taking that medication until 10 December 2014;
	
	
	because of the effects of the anti-coagulant medication, he should avoid activities which may cause lacerations or haemorrhaging.
	



	
	The Respondent’s wife continued to be very supportive. Her letter indicated the assistance which she had provided to the Respondent and her intention to continue that assistance.
	
	
	The Crown tendered a psychological report dated 21 October 2014 prepared by psychologists employed by Forensic Psychology Services, Sex Offender Programs within Justice Health. The authors of this report assessed the Respondent as falling into the low-risk category for sexual reoffending.
	
	
	The Crown also tendered a report of Dr Suresh Badami of Justice Health dated 5 November 2014, which stated that facilities existed in custody which could cater for the Respondent’s medical conditions and provide the management and medication he required.
	


The Course of Proceedings in the District Court


	
	To assist an understanding of the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to outline briefly the course of proceedings in the District Court.
	
	
	The Respondent pleaded guilty to the present charges on 11 March 2014 at the Parramatta Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence.
	
	
	He appeared before his Honour Judge Maiden SC at the Parramatta District Court on 18 August 2014. After the sentencing hearing had proceeded some way, it was adjourned part heard before his Honour to 24 October 2014.
	
	
	The hearing resumed on 24 October 2014 at the Sydney District Court and the Respondent gave evidence. At the conclusion of the Respondent’s evidence, his Honour raised with the legal representatives “with the State offences if I was to find that imprisonment was under two years should I consider an ICO?” (AB38.24). Discussion ensued, leading to his Honour requesting an ICO assessment with the proceedings being adjourned until 14 November 2014. His Honour did not give reasons for taking that course.
	
	
	It should be noted that at all times, the Crown had submitted both in writing and orally that a full-time sentence of imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence in this case.
	
	
	In the course of the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered material including the Statement of Facts (to which reference has been made), a folder containing sample images possessed by the Respondent (CETS scale images in Categories 1 to 6) together with a detailed written submission on sentence.
	
	
	When the hearing resumed on 14 November 2014, a copy of the ICO assessment report was made available. The report stated that the Respondent had been assessed as suitable for an ICO. After a brief discussion with counsel, the sentencing Judge enquired of counsel (AB42-43):
	


“HIS HONOUR: How long did I indicate last time that I’d say?

HEATHCOTE [Defence Counsel]: You said not more than two years.

GRODZICKI [Crown]: Your Honour, my understanding is that it was something less than two years but that your Honour hadn’t fully determined whether it would be by ICO but that one was ordered in order to essentially save time I think in case that was going to be the --

HIS HONOUR: I’ll make it for a period of 18 months to date from seven days from today. It’s Parramatta or where would --

HEATHCOTE: Hornsby has been where he's been going.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, seven days at Hornsby. In respect of the matter my short reasons are that the Court is satisfied that having read the material produced on behalf of Mr Porte--

GRODZICKI: Your Honour, I hate to interrupt but can I just raise one thing. On the last occasion the Crown made an application to adjourn to try and get some medical evidence.

HIS HONOUR: Did you, I’m sorry?

GRODZICKI: Yes, we did obtain some - it’s only very basic material your Honour but I think I should tender it, from Justice Health, and I think my friend has a short report possibly also to hand up.

HEATHCOTE: Just a little bit of an update so far as his medication regime is concerned, your Honour. I tender a report from Dr Hon dated 4 November 2014 and also a report from Dr Patrick Ao dated 12 November 2014.

GRODZICKI: There's no objection to those your Honour.

HEATHCOTE: I've seen the Crown document.

GRODZICKI: Your Honour there’s essentially just a copy of my request to the agencies and then a letter from Justice Corrective Services which doesn’t say very much and then there’s a letter from Justice Health. It essentially just says that they think they can manage the medical conditions that he has. It’s not detailed in any way. So just for completeness your Honour I tender those.” 

The last document mentioned was the report of Dr Suresh Badami referred to at [42] above. That report related to the Crown submission that the Respondent’s health difficulties could be treated and managed in custody. It formed part of the ongoing Crown submission that the Respondent should be sentenced to a term of full-time imprisonment.


	
	The sentencing Judge proceeded immediately to deliver short remarks on sentence, which are set out below in their entirety (AB44-46):
	


“HIS HONOUR: In this matter the offender has pleaded guilty to three charges; one under the Commonwealth legislation, s 474.19(1) of the Criminal Code 1995, being use carriage service to access child pornography. That matter, how long does that carry Mr Crown, is that 20 years?

GRODZICKI: 15 years for the Commonwealth charge; ten years for the possess charge.

HIS HONOUR: 15 years. There are two State matters, namely a matter under s 91H of the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum term of ten years. The third matter is a matter under s 7, the firearms, that carries 15 years, which involved the use of a can of mace.

This is a most unfortunate matter on the factual scene. It relates to a man who had  been what might be described as very successful in his life involving lengthy work career and in particular being in sales in the provision of technical equipment. He was a married man and has a close and supporting relationship with his wife. His wife is a nurse and her reference, given on behalf of the offender, is most impressive. It shows a capacity to understand the matters that I am required to deal with, in particular in respect of issues of general deterrence and specific deterrence. This lady has shown her insight into these matters and no doubt through her professional experience.

The perhaps unusual factor in this matter is that this man is without any prior criminal history and but for these matters is a person who would be classed as a person of good character. He has at the moment debilitating illnesses, namely a degenerating spine which has gone to the extent that surgical intervention is required and most likely to be carried out in the new year. That surgical intervention will most likely involve the fusion of a number of the vertebra of his spine. He also has at the moment a number of other illnesses which have required him to use blood thinners to avoid, as I assume, the risk of stroke or heart attack. That particular affliction does cause difficulty with the surgery that is proposed. In one of the medical reports the doctor states that if he was assaulted in custody this could cause him to die.

I have read now the report provided to me by the Crown in respect of the forensic health and although the report sets out in great detail the facilities offered to inpatients it does not specifically deal with this issue, that is, would the system be able to keep him from being assaulted. I do not propose to deal with that issue but to say that I do find in this case that there are exceptional circumstances, namely:

1    The support of the offender's wife.

2.   His prior good history.

3.   The medical and psychiatric evidence where I will make the finding that he is unlikely to offend or reoffend again in respect of these matters.

There is also the further matter which relates to his ongoing medical difficulties which he will need to deal with. In all of those circumstances I am of the view that this matter would ordinarily carry a fulltime custodial sentence but taking into account what I have said and the reports I am of the view that his sentence should be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order, that order to be for a period of 18 months, taking into account his 25% for his plea of guilty at the earliest time. 

The order of the Court will be that the offender is to serve a period of imprisonment by way of an Intensive Correction Order of 18 months commencing seven days from today. He is to report to the Hornsby Probation Service within that time.

Are there any other orders, gentlemen?

GRODZICKI: Yes your Honour, is that the--

HEATHCOTE: The three charges your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, I will make them in respect of each one, entirely concurrent. Thank you.”

Some General Observations Concerning Sentencing Under Commonwealth and New South Wales Law for Child Pornography Offences


	
	Before moving to consider the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to make some general observations concerning sentencing for this class of offences.
	
	
	There are few areas where the age of the Internet has impacted upon the criminal law more severely than in the field of child pornography offences.
	
	
	A number of early cases which had commented upon this phenomenon were referred to in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at 36-40 [29]-[43], a decision now almost 10 years old.
	
	
	As mentioned in R v Gent at 37 [32], amendments made in 2005 created several new offences in the Criminal Code (Cth), including s.474.19, an offence relevant to this appeal. The Second Reading Speech for the relevant 2004 Bill stated that the Bill “continues the Australian government’s proactive approach to updating criminal laws in light of rapid technological change”: R v Gent at 37 [32].
	


A Mixture of Commonwealth and State Offences


	
	It is not uncommon to encounter the circumstances present in this case - a combination of a Commonwealth access offence under s.474.19 Criminal Code (Cth) and an offence under relevant State legislation with respect to possession of child abuse material. In R v Gordon [2009] QCA 209; (2011) 1 Qd R 429, Keane JA (as his Honour then was) (De Jersey CJ and Margaret Wilson J agreeing) said at 436-437 [37]:
	


“The Queensland offence [of possession] did not involve use of the internet. It cannot be said that the use of the internet to procure the images adds little to the criminality involved in their possession. Such a view would fail to recognise that the vice attacked by the Commonwealth legislation is the use of the internet to access the market for child pornography and the consequent boost to that market of which internet access is such an important element.”


	
	The interrelationship between Commonwealth and State offences was addressed in R v Fulop [2009] VSCA 296; 236 FLR 376, where Buchanan JA (Nettle JA agreeing) said at 379 [11]-[13]:
	


“11    The elements of the offences overlapped but they were not identical. While the appellant was able to obtain possession of the pornographic material through a carriage service, the service also enabled users to disseminate the material. The Commonwealth offence concentrates upon the internet because, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister said in his Second Reading Speech: 

Law enforcement agencies estimate that around 85% of child pornography seized in Australia is distributed via the internet. By focusing on the internet, these new Federal offences target the very heart of the abhorrent child pornography industry. 

12    On the other hand, the state offence is not concerned with the means by which the offender gains possession of pornographic material. The appellant could gain access to the material without possessing it. In this case, he took a further step by downloading the material and thereby obtained possession of it. The Commonwealth offence was concerned with the images found on the hard drive of the appellant's computer. The state offence was constituted by the CDs and DVDs made and retained by the appellant. In my opinion, the offences did not overlap to such an extent that it rendered inappropriate the degree of cumulation ordered by the sentencing judge.”

Increasing Maximum Penalties for Commonwealth and New South Wales Offences


	
	Until 2010, an offence under s.474.19 was punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment. The maximum penalty for this and other offences was increased to imprisonment for 15 years by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Act 2010 (Cth), which commenced on 14 April 2010. The Explanatory Memorandum with respect to the 2010 amendments explained the increase in maximum penalties in the following way (page 81):
	


“Sections 474.19, 474.20, 474.22 and 474.23 are currently punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. However, it is evident that the Internet is creating ever greater demands for new material of ever greater levels of depravity and corruption. The Internet is being used to access and distribute child pornography on a massive global scale and offending has become pervasive and widespread. As a result, offending behaviour is becoming increasingly destructive. Children, in addition to being victims of the initial abuse required for the production of the material, are exploited on a massive scale through the repeated distribution of the image, or images, throughout international networks. 

Maximum penalties set by the Government are intended to reflect a worst case scenario. They are also intended to indicate to the courts the Government’s position on the level of seriousness which it believes the particular conduct involves. Accordingly, the amendments will increase the maximum penalties for using a carriage service for child pornography or child abuse material, or possessing such material for use through a carriage service, from 10 years imprisonment to 15 years imprisonment.” 


	
	In New South Wales, an increase in the maximum penalty occurred in 2008 for the offence of possession of child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for that offence was increased from five years’ imprisonment to 10 years’ imprisonment. In explaining this increase in the maximum penalty, the Attorney General, Mr Hatzistergos, said in the Second Reading Speech for the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Bill 2008 (Hansard, Legislative Council, 26 November 2008):
	


“The New South Wales offences are currently split into possession, which carries a five-year penalty, and production or dissemination, which carries a 10-year penalty. The bill increases the maximum penalty for possession of child pornographic material to 10 years. These substantial penalties send a strong message to the courts that child pornography should not be tolerated. This penalty reflects the seriousness of this crime. Any person who knowingly possesses images of a child being sexually abused is perpetuating such abuse and also providing a continuing market for such material. The Government is of the view that the criminality involved in that behaviour is the same as if the offender had produced the material themselves.”

Sentencing Principles for Child Pornography Offences


	
	At the same time as maximum penalties for these offences have been increased, the courts have made clear that the ready availability of material of this type has warranted substantial penalties with general deterrence and denunciation being paramount considerations.
	
	
	The comity principle has been applied in establishing sentencing principles with respect to child pornography offences: R v Gent at 36 [29]. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v D’Alessandro (“D’Alessandro”) [2010] VSCA 60; 26 VR 477, Harper JA (Redlich JA and Williams AJA agreeing) said at 483-484 [21] (references omitted):
	


“When construing and applying Commonwealth legislation, this Court follows principles of comity in according respect to the decisions of intermediate appellate courts of other jurisdictions concerning the same legislation. It is therefore worth recording that there seems to be unanimous support across the jurisdictions for a number of propositions. First, that the problem of child pornography is an international one. Secondly, that the prevalence and ready availability of pornographic material involving children, particularly on the internet, demands that general deterrence must be a paramount consideration. Thirdly, that those inclined to exploit children by involving them in the production of child pornography are encouraged by the fact that there is a market for it. Fourthly, that those who make up that market cannot escape responsibility for such exploitation. Fifthly, that limited weight must be given to an offender’s prior good character. Sixthly, that a range of factors bear upon the objective seriousness of the offences to which the respondent in this case pleaded guilty. They include: 

(a) the nature and content of the pornographic material - including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed; 

(b) the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender; 

(c) whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of sale or further distribution; 

(d) whether the offender will profit from the offence.”


	
	These principles have been frequently repeated since D’Alessandro: Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; 201 A Crim R 243 at 261-262 [96]-[101]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [2010] VSCA 215 at [23]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Guest [2014] VSCA 29 at [25]; Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R [2014] VSCA 37 at [40]; R v Linardon [2014] NSWCCA 247 at [58]; R v Martin [2014] NSWCCA 283 at [37].
	
	
	A helpful 2010 publication, issued by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, observed that intermediate appellate courts had recognised that the prevalence of child pornography offences justified strongly deterrent sentences, and that the Internet accounts for the increase in offending: Mizzi, Gotsis and Poletti, “Sentencing Offenders Convicted of Child Pornography and Child Abuse Material Offences”, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, Monograph 34, September 2010, paragraph 2.2.
	
	
	After a thorough examination of authorities in Minehan v R (a case dealing with Commonwealth and State offences, including dissemination and grooming charges as well as access and possession offences), RA Hulme J (Macfarlan JA and myself agreeing) said at 260-261 [94]-[95]:
	


“94    Drawing primarily from the authorities to which I have referred, the following matters may be relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of offences involving the possession or dissemination/transmission of child pornography:

1.    Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material.

2.    The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed.

3.    The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material.

4.    The number of images or items of material – in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted.

5.    In a case of possession, the offender’s purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

6.    In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted.

7.    Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission.

8.    The proximity of the offender’s activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence.

9.    The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material.

10.    Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons.

11.    Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children.

12.    Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted.

13.    Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence.

95    This list of factors is, of course, not closed. Individual cases may always produce further matters relevant to the assessment of their objective seriousness.”


	
	The Minehan v R factors have been applied in a number of later decisions: R v Linardon at [53]; R v Martin at [34]; James v R [2015] NSWCCA 97 at [23].
	
	
	A number of additional propositions should be kept in mind.
	
	
	In this case, the Respondent was to be sentenced for accessing child pornography material and possession of child abuse material. He was not charged with sale, distribution or dissemination of material. The absence of features of this type do not operate to mitigate penalty for a possession offence: Saddler v R [2009] NSWCCA 83; 194 A Crim R 452 at 464-465 [49]-[50]; R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [46]; Warner, “Sentencing for Child Pornography” (2010) 84 ALJ 384 at 385.
	
	
	The possession of child pornography material creates a market for the continued corruption and exploitation of children: R v Coffey [2003] VSCA 155; 6 VR 543 at 552 [30]; R v Cook; Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2004] QCA 469 at [21]; R v Jongsma [2004] VSCA 218; 150 A Crim R 386 at 395 [14]; Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R at [40].
	
	
	The courts have stressed that possession of child pornography is not a victimless crime: R v Jones [1999] WASCA 24; 108 A Crim R 50 at 52 [9]; R v Gent at 38 [33]; D’Alessandro at 484 [23]; R v Martin at [43].
	
	
	An additional feature of harm done to victims of child pornography offences was referred to by Professor Kate Warner (as her Excellency then was) in “Sentencing for Child Pornography” (2010) 84 ALJ 384 at 385 (references omitted):
	


“The damage done to the children so abused can be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. In addition to the physical and psychological harm from the abuse itself, the New South Wales Sentencing Council has explained that harm may also result from the knowledge, as they grow older, that the material may remain in circulation, heightening the shame and distress associated with being exploited when young and vulnerable.”


	
	In an extract cited frequently in later decisions, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J), encapsulated in R v Booth at [39]-[44], the particular vice of child pornography offences and the sentencing principles which have been deployed as a response by the Courts:
	


“39    A number of previous decisions of this and other appellate courts have found that, in respect of offences of child pornography, general deterrence is, at least, a significant element of the sentencing process: R v Gent; Assheton v R [2002] WASCA 209; 132 A Crim R 237; Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181. In Assheton, indeed, general deterrence was said to be ‘the paramount consideration’. This view was endorsed in Gent. 

40    I would add my further endorsement to that view. It seems to me that possession of child pornography is an offence which is particularly one to which notions of general deterrence apply. Possession of child pornography is a callous and predatory crime.

41    In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. Often this is in underdeveloped or disadvantaged countries that lack the resources to provide adequate child protection mechanisms. The damage done to the children may be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse, and upon the poverty of the children the subject of the material.

42    What makes the crime callous is not just that it exploits and abuses children; it is callous because, each time the material is viewed, the offender is reminded of and confronted with obvious pictorial evidence of that exploitation and abuse, and the degradation it causes. 

43    And every occasion on which an internet child pornography site is accessed (or when such material is accessed by any means at all) provides further encouragement to expand their activities to those who create and purvey the material.

44    It is for that reason that this is a crime in respect of which general deterrence is of particular significance.”


	
	A common feature on sentence for this class of offence is the tender of material (and often substantial material) concerning steps taken with respect to counselling and treatment in aid of rehabilitation. Evidence of this type is important to the exercise of the sentencing discretion: s.16A(2)(n) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth); s.21A(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). However, it is important to keep in mind the further observations of Simpson J in R v Booth at [47]:
	


“Examination of the Remarks on Sentence satisfies me that undue focus was placed upon the respondent’s need for counselling at the expense of other legitimate and important sentencing considerations. While I do not dissent from the importance of achieving prevention of further offences by such means, it is not the only matter to be considered. As I have made clear, the need to deter others from involving themselves in child pornography by signalling that such behaviour will be met by significant penalties is an important consideration. So also is denunciation of those who engage in this callous and predatory crime.”


	
	Citing this passage from R v Booth, it has been said that, given the predominance of general deterrence and denunciation in the sentencing process for offences of this type, rehabilitation may have reduced significance, with the weight to be attributed to rehabilitation depending upon the seriousness of the particular offence: Mizzi, Gotsis and Poletti, “Sentencing Offenders Convicted of Child Pornography and Child Abuse Material Offences”, paragraph 2.4.
	


Classification of Images, Inspection of Sample Images and Statutory Definitions


	
	A common feature on sentence for this class of offence is classification of at least some of the material in accordance with a scale used to assess the objective seriousness of the images. Scales used have included the COPINE Scale (Combatting Paedophile Information Networks in Europe) and the Oliver Scale (drawn from R v Oliver [2003] 1 Cr App R 28): Mizzi, Gotsis and Poletti, “Sentencing Offenders Convicted of Child Pornography and Child Abuse Material Offences”, paragraph 3.3.
	
	
	The ANVIL or CETS scale (see [16]-[17] above), as applied in the present case, is the method presently used for this purpose: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Guest at [9]; Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R at [13]-[14]; R v Martin at [10]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Zarb (“Zarb”) [2014] VSCA 347 at [7].
	
	
	There is no statutory provision concerning the use of classification scales of this type. However, experience in this country, and in other jurisdictions, has demonstrated that it is a helpful way to assist a sentencing court to form a view concerning the nature and gravity of the material.
	
	
	Further, it is appropriate (as occurred in this case) for sample images to be made available to the sentencing court, and to this Court on appeal, to allow an impression to be formed of the material and its degree of depravity: R v Oliver at [10]; R v Jongsma at 404 [35]. In Smit v State of Western Australia [2011] WASCA 124, McLure P (Pullin JA and Mazza J agreeing) explained, at [17], the purpose to be served by a sentencing court viewing sample images in this class of case:
	


“It is not suggested by the English Court of Appeal [in R v Oliver] that its classification list is intended to be a substitute for the sentencing judge viewing the pornographic material the subject of the conviction. Nor should it. The relative perversion and debauchery of the pornographic material is a relevant sentencing factor. Viewing a representative sample (as identified or agreed by the parties) of the material will ordinarily be necessary for the proper performance of the sentencing judge's duties. Judges involved in the administration of the criminal law are frequently exposed to material that is deeply offensive in a myriad of different ways whilst being required to retain their objectivity and sense of proportion. Moreover, this court is assisted by findings as to the nature of the pornographic material such as those made by the sentencing judge in this case which went well beyond the limited description in the DPP's list. The classification levels can only be of marginal assistance to courts involved in imposing or reviewing sentences for offences involving child pornography.”


	
	The classification of material in accordance with the CETS scale assists the process of assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence. Although Categories 1 to 5 on the CETS scale involve escalating gravity of the conduct depicted in the images, it should not be assumed that Category 1 material is mild in content. Despite being the lowest classification level, Category 1 material itself is capable of possessing significant gravity. In Zarb, Neave and Kyrou JJA observed at [30], after viewing images:
	


“Although level 1 covers images which are not as depraved and abusive as the images allocated to higher levels, some of the images we viewed involved dreadful examples of the abuse of the child victims, who were arranged in sexualised poses displaying their genitalia. The images at the higher end of the CETS Scale depicted horrifying degradation and exploitation of young children.” 


	
	I will return to this topic when considering the sample images provided to the Court in this case (see [116]-[121] below).
	
	
	The use of random sample evidence in child abuse material cases is permitted under s.289B Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), a process which provides further assistance to a sentencing court.
	
	
	For the assessment of objective seriousness of a s.91H offence, it is appropriate, as well, to keep in mind the statutory definition of “child abuse material” as contained in s.91FB Crimes Act 1900 (NSW):
	


“91FB Child abuse material - meaning

(1)    In this Division:

child abuse material means material that depicts or describes, in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive:

(a)    a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child as a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse, or

(b)    a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child engaged in or apparently engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons), or

(c)    a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child in the presence of another person who is engaged or apparently engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity, or

(d)    the private parts of a person who is, appears to be or is implied to be, a child.

(2)    The matters to be taken into account in deciding whether reasonable persons would regard particular material as being, in all the circumstances, offensive, include:

(a)    the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults, and

(b)    the literary, artistic or educational merit (if any) of the material, and

(c)    the journalistic merit (if any) of the material, being the merit of the material as a record or report of a matter of public interest, and

(d)    the general character of the material (including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character).

(3)    Material that depicts a person or the private parts of a person includes material that depicts a representation of a person or the private parts of a person (including material that has been altered or manipulated to make a person appear to be a child or to otherwise create a depiction referred to in subsection (1)).

(4)    The private parts of a person are:

(a)    a person’s genital area or anal area, or

(b)    the breasts of a female person.”


	
	Section 473.1 Criminal Code (Cth) contains a definition of “child pornography material”, the term relevant to offences under s.474.19 of the Code. That term is defined in the following way in s.473.1:
	


“child pornography material means:

(a)    material that depicts a person, or a representation of a person, who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age and who:

(i)    is engaged in, or appears to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons); or

(ii)    is in the presence of a person who is engaged in, or appears to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity;

and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or

(b)    material the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of:

(i)    a sexual organ or the anal region of a person who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; or

(ii)    a representation of such a sexual organ or anal region; or

(iii)    the breasts, or a representation of the breasts, of a female person who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age;

in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or

(c)    material that describes a person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age and who:

(i)    is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons); or

(ii)    is in the presence of a person who is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity;

and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or

(d)    material that describes:

(i)    a sexual organ or the anal region of a person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age; or

(ii)    the breasts of a female person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age;

and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive.”

Ground 1 in the Commonwealth and State Appeals - Failure to Take Into Account Matters Set Out in s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)


	
	In the context of this appeal, these grounds may be dealt with relatively shortly.
	
	
	The crux of the Crown submission was that the remarks on sentence failed in fundamental respects to fulfil the function of sentencing remarks, and in particular to address sentencing factors under the relevant Commonwealth and State legislation.
	
	
	Mr Hunt, counsel for the Respondent, emphasised that the remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing. In oral submissions, Mr Hunt recognised, in a practical way, the difficulty in meeting a submission based upon the brevity of the sentencing remarks. His resistance to the Crown appeal was, in truth, to be found in other aspects of the case.
	


Decision


	
	In Gallant v R [2006] NSWCCA 339, Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) said at [69]:
	


“The sentencing remarks were very brief, requiring only two double spaced pages of transcript. While that is not itself an indication of error, there is the risk that a Judge in the avoidance of prolixity will go too far the other way and fail adequately to refer to or discuss matters of significance in the determination of sentence: see R v Thomas [2006] NSWCCA 313.”


	
	These observations in Gallant v R have application to the present case.
	
	
	This Court takes into account the ex tempore nature of remarks on sentence delivered immediately after a sentencing hearing: Currie v R [2013] NSWCCA 267 at [50]-[51]. However, there are minimum requirements which were not met in this case. The following observations of Adamson J (Hoeben CJ at CL and RA Hulme J agreeing) in R v West [2014] NSWCCA 250 at [28] are apposite:
	


“In the present case, the remarks on sentence contain no assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending conduct. Nor is there any assessment of the offender's moral culpability. I do not discern in his Honour's remarks on sentence anything that might permit the conclusion that these matters were taken into account. It is not satisfactory that an appeal court is left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the bench and counsel during submissions in an attempt to ascertain a judicial officer's reasons for determination: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at [19]. The latitude that is afforded to remarks on sentence given ex tempore by busy judges does not, in my view, entitle this Court to infer that a matter as fundamental to the sentencing process as the assessment of objective seriousness was taken into account when it was not addressed in the remarks.”


	
	The sentencing remarks in this case (at [50] above) focused almost exclusively upon the Respondent’s subjective case. No attempt was made to grapple with or assess the objective seriousness of the Respondent’s offences. A passing, but inappropriate, reference was made to specific and general deterrence. No mention at all was made to s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) or s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) or the factors mentioned in those provisions. There was a clear and fundamental failure to explain how the sentence to be imposed had been arrived at.
	
	
	Apart from nothing being said about the objective seriousness of the offences, there was no indication that his Honour had considered the folder of sample images provided by the Crown during the sentencing hearing (see [48] above).
	
	
	The primary task for a sentencing court is to impose a sentence for a Commonwealth offence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the case: s.16A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). An important purpose of sentencing under New South Wales law is to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence: ss.3A(a), 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). There must be a reasonable proportionality between the sentences imposed and the objective gravity of the offence itself: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. This fundamental task cannot be exercised without some assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. It is an essential element of the process of instinctive synthesis: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 473 [46]. It did not happen in this case.
	
	
	The Crown has made good the first ground of appeal in each of the Commonwealth and State appeals.
	


Ground 2 - Claim of Error in Ordering that the Sentences be made Wholly Concurrent


	
	The Crown submits that the manner in which the sentencing Judge came to determine that identical 18-month sentences should be served concurrently, demonstrated that there had been a failure to comply with the relevant principles concerning accumulation and concurrency. The Crown submitted, as it had before the District Court, that the accessing and possession offences were different so that some measure of accumulation was appropriate as between those offences: James v R [2009] NSWCCA 62 at [16]. It was submitted, in particular, that there was a difference between accessing a small number of images and possessing some 34,000 images. The Crown submitted, as well, that there was a difference in relation to the systematic saving and the way in which and the time over which the images were accessed, using peer-to-peer technology, and saved to various hard drives (T7, 13 May 2015).
	
	
	Mr Hunt submitted that the Commonwealth and State offences were inextricably linked and that the offences should be considered part of the same episode of criminality. In these circumstances, it was submitted that there was no error in directing that the sentences be served concurrently. In oral argument, Mr Hunt submitted that this is a case where, in terms of the totality principle, there was a proper basis on which sentences for the accessing and possession offences ought be concurrent (T11, 13 May 2015).
	


Decision


	
	Although the sentence Judge had received written submissions from the Crown which dealt with a wide range of issues, including accumulation and concurrency, the sentencing Judge did not advert to these topics in the remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The clear inference (see [49]-[50] above) is that his Honour had determined to impose an intensive correction order for a period of 18 months and, only when reminded by counsel, did he fix an identical and entirely concurrent sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment on each count.
	
	
	This Court has been critical of the imposition of a “one size fits all” set of sentences in circumstances where there is a clear failure to comply with the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 and to make an assessment concerning issues of concurrence, accumulation and totality: Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [59]-[60].
	
	
	That no attention to these matters occurred in this case is best illustrated by the sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment for the possession of “Mace” offence. Although not a trivial example of an offence under s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 (NSW), it did not warrant the sentence imposed at first instance. It is clear that no separate consideration was given to issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality for these three offences.
	
	
	The Crown has demonstrated that the sentencing Judge failed to give principled consideration to the question of concurrency and accumulation. There was, in reality, no proper exercise of discretion in this regard.
	
	
	Where sentences of imprisonment are to be imposed for Commonwealth and State offences, it is necessary to comply with s.19(3) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). This leads to consideration of issues of concurrency and accumulation. The question whether sentences should be concurrent or, to some extent, cumulative involves consideration whether a sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence. If it can, the sentences ought be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality for the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentences will fail to reflect the total criminality for the two offences: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27].
	
	
	Determination of whether sentences for the Commonwealth and State child pornography offences in this case ought be concurrent or partly accumulated involves a number of considerations. The offences are directed at different vices (see [55]-[56]). The offences overlap, but are not identical. In this case, there are features of the Respondent’s offences, as identified by the Crown (at [92] above), which point to the need for some measure of accumulation to reflect the differing criminality contained in the two offences. I will return to this issue should the Court determine that the Respondent should be resentenced for these offences.
	
	
	The Crown has made good this ground of appeal.
	


Grounds 3 and 4 - Grounds Alleging Errors With Respect to the Ordering of an ICO


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge made a referral for ICO assessment on 24 October 2014 during the sentencing hearing, and at a time when the evidence and submissions had not been completed. It was submitted that making a referral for assessment before the evidence had been completed was in breach of s.69(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The Crown submitted further, in support of Ground 4, that the sentencing Judge failed to apply the provisions of s.7(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) when ordering that the sentences be served by way of an ICO.
	


Decision


	
	Section 69 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides as follows:
	


“69    Referral of offender for assessment

(1)    Before imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, the court may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community.

(2)    A court is not to refer an offender for such an assessment unless satisfied, having considered all the alternatives, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years.”


	
	It is clear from the course of the sentencing proceedings that the sentencing Judge did not engage in the stepped process required when use of an ICO is under consideration: Zreika v R  at 474-475 [56]-[59]. Rather, his Honour determined to proceed by way of an ICO, and then selected a period of imprisonment that fell below the two-year threshold to facilitate that outcome.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Grounds 3 and 4 have been established.
	


Ground 5 - The Claim of Manifest Inadequacy


	
	The real area of contest on this appeal falls under this ground. The findings already made reveal a series of clear errors. It remains necessary to consider this ground.
	
	
	The Crown submits that a sentencing order involving the use of an ICO was manifestly inadequate in this case. The Crown submitted, as it did at first instance, that the only appropriate sentence for these offences was a period of imprisonment to be served by way of full-time custody.
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging the leniency involved, Mr Hunt submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge, in the circumstances of this case, to proceed by way of an ICO.
	


Decision


	
	In circumstances where the sentencing Judge did not engage in any real assessment of the objective seriousness of the Respondent’s crimes, nor any process of instinctive synthesis where such a finding was taken into account with all other relevant features, it falls effectively to this Court to undertake that process to allow an assessment as to whether the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	At the outset, and as noted in the context of Ground 2, it is clear that a sentence of 18 month’s imprisonment for the Respondent’s offence under s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 (NSW) is entirely excessive, given the objective circumstances of that offence, the Respondent’s explanation for his possession of that item and his subjective factors relevant to sentence.
	
	
	However, the focus of attention on sentence, for the purpose of this ground of appeal, is directed to the child pornography offences under Commonwealth and State law.
	
	
	An assessment of the nature and number of the images possessed or accessed by the Respondent leads to a finding of substantial objective seriousness in this case. Consideration of the images in accordance with the CETS scale fortifies this conclusion (see [16] above).
	
	
	In addition, the folder of sample images, falling within the various categories on the CETS scale, assists this Court by providing visual examples to be taken with the written description of the categories (see [76]-[77] above). This Court was informed that the folder provided to this Court was the same folder which had been handed to the sentencing Judge in the District Court (T17-18, 13 May 2015). This provides a sentencing court with something more than a formulaic classification, which may not communicate the true nature of the offending material. Young children are involved, with even the Category 1 images being significantly depraved in their content.
	
	
	As an examination of the sample folder escalates through the other categories (up to Category 5), an understanding of the gross depravity involved and the abuse of young children, both physical and psychological, becomes clear.
	
	
	To amplify these conclusions, it is appropriate to provide a short description of some of the images contained in the sample folder.
	
	
	There are nine Category 1 images depicting naked prepubescent girls (aged between about eight to 11 years) in sexual poses displaying their genitalia. In two images, there are two girls interacting in the display. The observations of Neave and Kyrou JJA in Zarb (at [77] above) have equal application to the Category 1 material in this case.
	
	
	There are nine Category 2 images depicting naked prepubescent girls (and three boys) engaged in joint or solo masturbation or fellatio.
	
	
	The nine Category 3 images depict, amongst other things:
	



	
	an adult male licking the vagina of an infant;
	
	
	an erect penis which has ejaculated onto the face of a very young girl (about three years old);
	
	
	erect penises in the vicinity of the genitalia of a baby or young children.
	



	
	The nine Category 4 images reveal, amongst other things:
	



	
	adult males having vaginal intercourse with very young children (in one photo where the head of the male can be seen, it is covered with a hood);
	
	
	young girls (aged about three to seven years) performing fellatio upon adult males;
	
	
	digital penetration by an adult into the anus of a baby girl.
	



	
	Category 5 images include the following:
	



	
	naked young children in various states of bondage and suspension;
	
	
	an adult male (wearing a hood to cover his face) having vaginal intercourse with a young girl who is bound;
	
	
	a dog engaged in a sexual pose with a young girl.
	



	
	It is not necessary to refer to the Category 6 images which depict animated or virtual images of children engaged in sexual poses or activity.
	
	
	The s.91H(2) offence involved possession of a very large number of images (see [19] above) which had been stored on multiple devices (see [12] above). Although it is not possible, on the material before this Court, to precisely quantify the number of children involved, it can be said that many children are depicted in the sample images alone. It may be inferred, safely, that the number of children depicted far exceed the number in the sample images.
	
	
	The s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offence involved accessing material over a period of time. It involved a course of conduct. Far from desisting from this conduct, the Respondent had continued to access material in the days before the execution of the search warrant (see [13], [22]-[23], [28] above). His interest in child pornography material continued despite his interaction with his wife on this issue (see [15](h) above).
	
	
	The Respondent was still actively involved in his pursuit of child pornography even at the time of their AFP attendance on his premises on 12 March 2013.
	
	
	The Respondent had a number of factors operating in his favour on the subjective side of the case, including his health. His prior good character was to be afforded limited weight: R v Gent at 40-44 [48]-[69]; D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21] cited at [60] above. Prior good character is not unusual in this area of offending. Positive personal antecedents and a reduced or absent need for personal deterrence are relatively commonplace amongst offenders in possession of child pornography: Hill v State of Western Australia [2009] WASCA 4 at [28]. Significant weight is to be given to general deterrence and correspondingly less weight to matters personal to the offender: Hill v State of Western Australia at [28].
	
	
	The Court must bear in mind the maximum penalties for these respective offences, being imprisonment for 10 years for the State offence and 15 years for the Commonwealth offence. In addition, the repeated statements of Courts throughout Australia with respect to the paramount importance of general deterrence and denunciation must loom large on sentence for these offences (see [60]-[72] above).
	
	
	Steps taken by the Respondent to progress his rehabilitation are important on sentence. However, the sentences actually imposed must be reasonably proportionate to the crimes which the Respondent committed: R v Booth at [47] (cited at [71] above). It is important that the subjective circumstances of an offender not overshadow the objective gravity of the crimes for which sentence is to be passed: R v Dodd at 354.
	
	
	This Court has emphasised the significant degree of leniency involved in the use of an ICO as a sentence. Although statements made in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225; 82 NSWLR 60 at 85-87 [112]-[123] (in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and myself) point to the breadth to the concept of rehabilitation, and the capacity of an ICO to operate as a form of punishment, it is necessary not to lose sight of the need for an appropriate level of punishment, in the form of immediate incarceration, in cases of serious child pornography offences such as this.
	
	
	The decision in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin should not be utilised to pass an entirely inappropriate sentence, which sees an offender such as the Respondent with his magnitude of offending, being dealt with by way of an ICO.
	
	
	To proceed by way of an ICO in this case meant that concepts of general deterrence and denunciation “slip through almost without trace”: D’Alessandro at 484 [24].
	
	
	Entirely concurrent sentences of 18 months’ imprisonment for the s.91H(2) and s.474.19 offences disclose error which is magnified by the order that the terms be served by way of ICO. Having regard to the quantity and nature of the images and videos accessed and possessed by the Respondent in this case, the sentences imposed are unjustifiably lenient.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the sentencing orders in this case were unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 [25]. I have reached this conclusion having considered all matters relevant to the fixing of sentence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 539 [60]. The only sentences which were reasonably open were full-time sentences of imprisonment.
	
	
	The explanation for the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences in this case may be found largely in the various errors identified in the earlier grounds of appeal, culminating in a finding that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. It is appropriate to repeat the statement of Wood CJ at CL (Giles JA and Levine J agreeing) in R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335 at [34]-[35]:
	


“34    Clearly it was a [sic] necessary and appropriate for his Honour to take the subjective matters into account, but they had to be kept in perspective. They should not have become the reason for imposing a sentence which, in my view, was weakly merciful and which did not properly reflect the objectives of punishment, retribution and deterrence, both general and personal. 

35    The result, so it seems to me, was to produce a sentence - whether suspended or not - that was not reasonably proportionate to the crime. Rather, it was of the kind which offends the principles enunciated in decisions such as Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 and the earlier decision in Regina v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594.”


	
	The Crown has made good this ground of appeal.
	


Should the Discretion to Resentence the Respondent be Exercised?


	
	The Crown has established error. Accordingly, the first hurdle on a Crown appeal has been cleared. It remains incumbent on the Crown to demonstrate that the discretion to resentence the Respondent should be exercised: CMB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 9; 89 ALJR 407 at 415 [33].
	
	
	Mr Hunt read the affidavit of the Respondent affirmed 11 May 2015, to be taken into account on the exercise of the residual discretion and resentencing.
	
	
	The Crown read the affidavit of Stephen John Grodzicki affirmed 12 May 2015 to explain elements of delay between the filing of the Crown appeals and the hearing of the appeals in this Court.
	
	
	The evidence before this Court indicates that the Respondent is taking steps to further his rehabilitation. The Respondent has been complying with the conditions of his ICO. He is required to attend Hornsby Community Corrections on Thursday of each week to perform activities, including the covering of text books and reading books for schools.
	
	
	The Respondent’s affidavit speaks, as well, of the substantial anxiety affecting himself and his wife since he learned of the Crown appeal.
	
	
	The Respondent has secured employment, which presents good prospects for him in the long term. It is said that a sentence of full-time imprisonment will endanger the family home given his wife’s limited income. The Respondent has been seeing a psychologist, who has been assisting him with respect to aspects of his personal life.
	
	
	The Respondent’s affidavit does not expand in any detail upon his health problems. It is clear from the affidavit that he has been able to work. There is evidence of the Respondent’s concerns about the risk of being assaulted in custody. He has been taking blood-thinning medication which will need to continue for some time, if not indefinitely.
	
	
	With respect to delay in the hearing of the Crown appeal, the affidavit of Mr Grodzicki indicates efforts being made by the Crown to obtain material for the purpose of the appeal. It was only on 14 April 2015 that the Crown received a copy of the sentencing Judge’s remarks on sentence of 14 November 2014.
	
	
	I do not consider that delay by the Crown in this case operates adversely to the Crown. The appeals were filed promptly and the Respondent was aware that the appeals were on foot. It was agreed in this Court that an email was sent by the Crown to the Respondent’s legal representative on 14 November 2014 indicating that a Crown appeal was being considered. The Crown took reasonable steps to bring on the hearing of the appeals.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Respondent that the approach taken by the Crown in the District Court operated against the Crown on the exercise of the residual discretion. I do not agree. The Crown advanced a submission that a sentence of full-time imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence in this case. The Crown did not acquiesce in the use of an ICO. Until the end, the Crown was placing evidence before the sentencing Court concerning the capacity of Justice Health to manage and treat the Respondent’s health problems in custody.
	
	
	It is not uncommon, in sentencing cases for child pornography offences, for there to be a body of evidence available to the Court with respect to counselling and rehabilitation. Material of this sort can provide a solid body of evidence favourable to the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	However, as the cases have made clear, prior good character has a lesser role to play on sentence in this class of offending. Further, it is important that an offender’s subjective circumstances, including prospects of rehabilitation and rehabilitative steps already underway, not be allowed to overshadow the objective seriousness of the offences for the purpose of sentence, nor the need for a sentence to reflect general deterrence and denunciation: R v Booth at [47] (cited at [71] above); Hill v State of Western Australia at [28] (see [126] above).
	
	
	I am satisfied that a “substantial wrong” has occurred in this case, arising from error under the final category in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 506; D’Alessandro at 487 [39].
	
	
	Where a manifestly inadequate sentence has been imposed, giving rise to a substantial wrong, that is a strong factor in favour of this Court proceeding to resentence on a Crown appeal. The interests of justice call for the imposition of appropriate sentences for these offences.
	
	
	I am persuaded that this Court should proceed to resentence the Respondent in the circumstances of this case.
	


Resentencing the Respondent


	
	At first instance, the Crown referred to a series of sentencing decisions to inform a range of sentences for this class of offending. Of course, caution must be exercised in any use of s.91H(2) sentencing cases for offences before 2008 or s.474.19 cases for offences before 2010, given the increase in the respective maximum penalties (see [57]-[58] above).
	
	
	The cases referred to below included the following:
	



	
		
			
			Case
			
			
			Charges 
			
			
			Volume of Material and Classification
			
			
			Sentence
			
		
	
	
		
			
			Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181

			Use carriage service to access - s.474.19(1)(a)(i) (one count)

			Use carriage service to transmit - s.474.19

			Possession of child pornography material - s.70 Crimes Act 1958 (Vic)
			
			
			About 10,000 pictures, videos and text files, of which about 8,000 fell within Category 1 of the CETS scale
			
			
			County Court - Community Corrections Order for three years and six months

	In this Court, the Crown relied upon the following recent decisions of this Court:
	



	
		
			
			Case
			
			
			Charges 
			
			
			Volume of Material and Classification
			
			
			Sentence

			On appeal - Crown appeal allowed - Offender resentenced to total effective sentence of five years and six months’ imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of three years and six months
			
		
	



	
	Although care must be exercised in considering the circumstances and sentences imposed in other cases, these sentencing decisions serve to fortify a conclusion of manifest inadequacy in this case and inform issues relating to the resentencing of the Respondent. Further support for this conclusion may be found in another recent decision of this Court in Martin v R [2014] NSWCCA 124, a decision relating only to offences under s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). These sentences operate as yardsticks, to be taken into account on sentence: Hili v The Queen at 537 [54].
	
	
	For the purpose of resentencing the Respondent, I have regard to all the evidence before the District Court and before this Court, with respect to the objective gravity of these offences and the Respondent’s subjective circumstances. I will not repeat the matters set out earlier in this judgment which bear upon these aspects of the case.
	
	
	As in the District Court, a 25% discount will be applied for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty to the State matters and for his facilitation of the course of justice on the Commonwealth charge. The sentences to be passed take into account these discounts. I am satisfied that sentences of imprisonment involving full-time custody are the only appropriate sentences to be imposed for the Commonwealth and State child pornography offences.
	
	
	Issues of concurrency and accumulation were addressed with respect to Ground 2. Where sentences are being imposed for Commonwealth and State offences, it is necessary for the Court to comply with s.19(3) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I have concluded that there ought be some measure of accumulation with respect to the sentences to be imposed for those two offences (see [98]-[100] above). The offences overlap, but they are not identical. The Respondent gained access to the material through a carriage service. However, as the Crown submitted, he undertook systematic saving, utilising peer-to-peer technology to access and then save material to various hard drives. The different vices to which the offences are directed remain significant (see [55]-[56] above). The Respondent’s criminality for the two offences requires some measure of accumulation, subject to application of the totality principle. A level of accumulation of three months is appropriate in this case: James v R at [16]; R v Fulop at 378-379 [10]-[12] (see [56] above).
	
	
	As noted earlier, a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment is excessive with respect to the offence of possession of “Mace”. The Respondent’s account for possession of this substance was not challenged. He did not possess it for any criminal purpose. Having regard to the Respondent’s subjective case, a non-custodial penalty should have been imposed at first instance. The appropriate course to adopt in this Court is to convict the Respondent, but impose no other penalty under s.10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court to adopt the different sentencing regimes applicable under Commonwealth and New South Wales law. It was common ground before this Court that any sentence of imprisonment to be imposed should commence on 21 November 2014, to take into account the period during which the Respondent has been subject to an ICO with associated restrictions upon his liberty. This approach has been adopted by this Court on successful Crown appeals where an ICO was ordered at first instance: R v Hinchliffe [2013] NSWCCA 327 at [304].
	
	
	In this case, a greater sentence should be imposed for the s.91H(2) offence which involved possession of a very substantial amount of child abuse material (see [18]-[20] above). The offence under s.474.19(1)(a)(i) is more limited in its scope (see [21]-[23] above).
	
	
	A term of imprisonment of 12 months should be imposed for the Commonwealth offence. As the effective non-parole period to be imposed will attach to the State offence, it is not appropriate to make a recognizance release order with respect to this sentence: s.19AB(3) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	For the s.91H(2) offence, a sentence of imprisonment for two years and six months should be fixed. I find special circumstances resulting from the Respondent’s health issues and the level of accumulation to be applied. A non-parole period of 15 months will be set.
	
	
	The total effective sentence will comprise a head sentence of two years and nine months with an effective minimum term of one year and six months, with both periods to date from 21 November 2014.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Crown appeals allowed;
	
	
	sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court on 14 November 2014 are set aside;
	
	
	in their place:
	



	
	(i)   for the offence of accessing child pornography material contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth), the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 12 months commencing on 21 November 2014 and expiring on 20 November 2015,
	
	
	(ii)   for the offence of possession of child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 21 February 2015 and expiring on 20 May 2016, with a balance of term of 15 months, commencing on 21 May 2016 and expiring on 20 August 2017,
	
	
	(iii)   for the offence of possession of a prohibited weapon under s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1988 (NSW), the Respondent is convicted but no other penalty is imposed in accordance with s.10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW),
	



	
	in accordance with s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the Respondent should be released to parole on 21 May 2016.
	



	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Johnson J and the orders His Honour proposes.

2767076,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sribounheuang [2015] NSWSC 901,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed on 3 July 2015, the plaintiff seeks various orders, including an order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; an order pursuant to s 12(1) of the Act that certain funds be transferred to an account held by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian; an order pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Act that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of all interest of the defendant in the property specified in Schedule One; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Act authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Act requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff, within 21 days, a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property; and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of the defendant’s illegal activities within the period of six years before the filing of the application.
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act referred to above, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 3 July 2015.
	
	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	



	
	Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 3 July 2015; and
	
	
	Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 3 July 2015 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).
	



	
	Section 10A of the Act relevantly provides:
	


“10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)   Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

…

(3)   The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)   Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)   Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)   in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)   the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities…

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based …

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.”


	
	The plaintiff’s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 3 July 2015. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities, being: supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMTA). These are serious criminal offences within the meaning of s 6(2)(b) of the Act because s 6(3) provides that offences under s 25 of the DMTA are “drug trafficking offences”. The Facts Sheet records that the defendant was charged with the offences described therein on 2 July 2015 following the execution of search warrants at premises at Blair Athol, New South Wales.
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. He deposed to a conversation he had with Detective Christopher Eisenhuth, who had prepared the Facts Sheet on the basis of information provided by investigating police officers. Detective Eisenhuth informed Mr Spark that the facts set out are, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true.
	
	
	Mr Spark also deposed in his affidavit to investigations he caused to be made into the defendant’s bank accounts.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that Mr Spark’s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark’s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark’s evidence. I accept Mr Spark’s evidence as to the speed with funds can be concealed or disposed of, which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant’s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7 of the Act. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff.

2767078,R v Weismantel (No 2) [2015] NSWDC 213,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is a criminal trial by judge alone. The accused was arraigned on an indictment containing one count. That count is this:
	


“On 31 December 2013 at Pennant Hills in the State of New South Wales, while armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a knife, did assault Sathaporn Wongsamak with intent to rob him and at the time of the assault he, the said Blake Weismantel, did inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.”

That is an offence contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900. The count in the indictment closely follows the wording of the provision. Section 98 is in these terms:

“Whosoever, be armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument, or being in company with another person, robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person, and immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after, such robbery, or assault, wounds, or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon such person, shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.”

A business and its owners


	
	Situated at 1A Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills is a restaurant known as the Tung Tong Roong Thai Restaurant. I shall merely refer to that restaurant hereafter as “the restaurant”. On the evidence before me, the owners of the restaurant business are Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak and his wife Mrs Laynookar Wongsamak. Mr Wongsamak goes by the moniker of “Paul” and his wife goes by the moniker of “Gail”. The evidence relevant to the ownership of the business is this. In a statement made on 30 January 2014, the officer in charge of the police investigation of the offence alleged, Detective Senior Constable Stephen Ireland said this in par 5:
	


“I spoke to an Asian male who was sitting down and holding his right lower leg. He introduced himself at Sathaporn Wongsamak, one of the owners of the restaurant.”

In a statement dated 17 January 2014, Mr Wongsamak said this:

“I have owned this business for the past four years. I am also the chef for the restaurant. I have nine staff that I employ at the restaurant not including my wife, Gail Wongsamak that works the counter.”

Mrs Laynookar Wongsamak in a statement dated 17 January 2014 said this:

“I currently own and operate the Tung Tong Roong Thai Restaurant situated at 1A Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills and have done so for about five years. There are currently seven staff who regularly work at the location which includes some family members and my husband Sathaporn Wongsamak.”

Ms Pilasluck Chaiklongklaw made a statement on 7 March 2014. In it she said this:

“I now work as a manager in my older sister’s Thai restaurant in Pennant Hills. The name of the restaurant is Tung Tong Roong Thai, situated at 1A Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills. I have worked there for the past five years. My sister, Gail Wongsamak and her husband, Paul Wongsamak own the restaurant.”

A statement was obtained from Ms Krisna Wongsamak. At the time that she made the statement of 31 December 2013, the date of the offence alleged in the indictment, she was 18 years old. She identifies her parents as being Laynookar and Sathaporn Wongsamak. In par 4 of her statement she said this:

“My parents own and operate Tung Tong Roong Thai Restaurant, situated at 1A Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills. They have operated the business for the past five years. Ever since they had the restaurant, I have also worked there helping as a waitress.”

Another person who works at the restaurant is Mr Adisak Wongsamak, although his surname is spelt in his statement with a final “u” rather than the final “a”. He made a statement on 7 March 2014. He was then 30 years old. In par 3 of his statement he said this:

“I work at the Tung Tong Roong Thai Restaurant at Unit 1A Hillcrest Road at Pennant Hills. My uncle and aunty own this restaurant and I am chef there.”

Later in his statement he identifies his aunty as Mrs Laynookar Wongsamak. Another employee of the restaurant is Mr Borom Pingmuangkaew. He made a statement on 29 May 2014 when he was 28 years old. In par 3 of his statement he said this:

“I work as a chef at the Tung Tong Roong Thai Restaurant which is on Hillcrest Road, Pennant Hills and [I] have [worked] there for about five years. My aunty, Gail, owns the restaurant with my uncle‑in-law [whom] I call Paul.”

When Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak was taken to the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital late on 31 December 2013, he gave a history that he was at work when a man with a knife attempted to rob “the business” and that he twisted his ankle in the course of trying to evade the person who was attempting the robbery. The evidence is all one way that the owners of the business are Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak and his wife Mrs Laynookar Wongsamak.

Legal directions


	
	Before I go further, I should give myself, as the tribunal of law, the directions which I would give to the jury, if a jury were the tribunal of fact. The first direction relates to the onus of proof. As this is a criminal trial of a most serious nature, the burden or obligation of proof of the guilt of the accused is placed squarely on the Crown. That burden rests upon the Crown in respect of every element or essential fact that makes up the offence with which the accused has been charged. That burden never shifts to the accused. There is no obligation whatsoever on the accused to prove any fact or issue that is in dispute before the Court. It is, of course, not for the accused to prove his innocence but for the Crown to establish his guilt. A critical part of the criminal justice system is the presumption of innocence. What that means is that a person charged with a criminal offence is presumed to be innocent unless and until the Crown persuades the tribunal of fact that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The next direction of law which I give to myself concerns the standard of proof. The Crown must prove the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That is the high standard of proof the Crown must achieve before I can convict the accused of the crime alleged in the indictment. At the end of my consideration of the evidence given in the trial and the submissions made to me by the Crown and by the defence, I must ask myself whether the Crown has established the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, I should ask myself: is there any reasonable possibility that the accused is not guilty? However, the Crown does not have the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt every single fact that arises from the evidence and is in dispute. The obligation that rests upon the Crown is to prove the elements of the charge, that is, the essential facts that go to make up the charge, and it must prove those facts beyond reasonable doubt. I shall in due course outline what the elements of the charge before me are. It is those elements that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt. In a criminal trial there is only one ultimate issue that the tribunal of fact has to decide. That issue is whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. If the answer to that question is “yes”, the appropriate verdict is “guilty”. If the answer is “no”, the verdict that I must return is “not guilty”.
	
	
	I now direct myself to the question of inferences. I may in my role as the judge of the facts draw inferences from the direct evidence. That is something that consciously and otherwise everyone does in daily life. Inferences are conclusions of fact rationally drawn from a combination of proved facts. If A, B and C are established as facts, then one might rationally conclude that D is also a fact, even though there might be no direct evidence that D is indeed a fact. Inferences may be valid or invalid, justified or unjustified, correct or incorrect. In a criminal trial, where I must be satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, I should be extremely careful about drawing any inferences. I must examine any possible inference that I draw to ensure that it is a justifiable inference. In the context of a criminal trial, I should not draw any inference from direct evidence unless it be a rational inference in the circumstances. Furthermore, if the inference I draw is to an essential element or essential fact that the Crown must prove, I can only draw such an inference if it be the only rational inference that might be drawn in the circumstance.
	
	
	This is a case in which the accused has not given or called any evidence in response to the Crown case. I must direct myself in accordance with Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] 205 CLR 50. Although an accused person is entitled to give or call evidence in a criminal trial, there is no obligation upon him to do so. As I have already directed myself, the Crown bears the onus of satisfying me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence charged. The accused bears no onus of proof in respect of any fact that is in dispute. I must remind myself that the accused is presumed to be innocent until I have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence led by the Crown that he is guilty of the offence charged. Therefore it follows that the accused is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove his guilt to the high standard of proof required in a criminal trial. I direct myself as a matter of law that the accused’s decision not to give evidence cannot be used against him in any way at all during the course of my deliberation on the evidence before me. The accused’s decision not to adduce evidence or to give evidence cannot be used by me as amounting to some admission of guilt. I must not draw any inference or reach any conclusion based upon the fact that the accused decided not to give or call any evidence. I cannot use the fact that he did not call or give evidence to fill in any gaps that I might perceive in the evidence tendered by the Crown. It cannot be used in any way as strengthening the Crown case or in assisting the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. I must not speculate about what might have been said in evidence if the accused had given evidence, or what might have been said by any person not called to give evidence if that person had been called by the accused as a witness in the trial.
	


Elements of the offence


	
	The elements of the offence alleged in the indictment are five in number. The first is that the accused was armed with an offensive weapon, identified in the indictment as a knife. The second is that the accused assaulted the complainant, Sathaporn Wongsamak. The third is that the accused intended to steal property from Sathaporn Wongsamak. The fourth is that the accused used violence or put Mr Wongsamak in fear. The fifth and final element is that the accused immediately before or at the time of, or immediately after the assault, inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the victim, namely Mr Wongsamak. I shall direct myself at the appropriate time as to the meaning of the term “grievous bodily harm”. The mens rea for this offence is the intention to steal. No specific intent to inflict grievous bodily harm need be proved. All that the Crown needs to prove is that the act which caused the grievous bodily harm was a voluntary act of the accused. In that regard I am directing myself in accordance with Ryan v R (1967) 121 CLR 205.
	


Evidence of the facts


	
	There are some inconsistencies in the evidence, but they do not raise any substantive issue before me. For example, Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak in his statement said that the restaurant was opened each day for dinner from 5.30pm to 10.30pm, although there is much evidence to suggest that the restaurant actually closed at 10pm. Nothing turns on such a minor inconsistency.
	
	
	It is convenient if I commence the discussion of the facts by quoting from the first part of the statement of Mr Borom Pingmuangkaew, to whom I shall hereafter refer to merely as “Borom”. Borom’s statement was obviously given by a man whose first language was other than English. Much of his grammar and syntax is poor. However, it is clear what he means, and in quoting his statement I shall quote it in full English, rather than the abbreviated English that is recorded in his statement. Commencing at par 5 he said this:
	


“On 31 December 2013 I was working at the restaurant, I started in the morning at 10.30 to 11 in the night. The restaurant normally closes at 10 in the night and I stay to 11 to clean up. It was New Year’s Eve and a lot of customers were eating quickly so that they could go to Sydney to see the lights.

6. I’m not sure what time it was, but it would be close to closing time, as the last customers had finished their meal and had just paid. I think there were about five of them, I think three men and two women. Some were standing outside the front door waiting, and some were using the toilet. I went out front of the restaurant to bring in tables. When I did I saw a man across the road, I didn’t see anyone else, just him. I noticed him because he had a dark coloured jumper with a hood up on his head and it looked like he had his hands just inside the pockets of his jumper. He had short pants on, but I can’t remember the colour and he looked big and tall. He was looking at our restaurant and I thought he might be a customer.

7. I picked up one of the tables and carried it inside, right up to the back, next to the toilet where there is storage. I was arranging the table there with my uncle‑in‑law Paul. I heard my Aunty Gail yell out from the front of the restaurant in Thai, ‘Help!’”


	
	I turn now to the description of events recorded by Mrs Wongsamak. I must point out that the photographic evidence before me, exhibit F3, shows that a number of steps lead from the footpath of Hillcrest Road up to the entrance to the restaurant. They can be shown in the photographs numbered 1 and 2. Those steps are within the front door of the restaurant itself. They lead up to the level of the restaurant where there are dining tables and chairs. As one mounts the steps, there is, on the right‑hand side, a counter. That counter extends from the side wall and forms an “L”‑shape, with the long side of the “L” being parallel to the side wall of the restaurant. The counter has on the right-angled bend of the “L” a seated Buddha statue and at the top end of the “L” is a standing Buddha statue. Between those two statutes on the long side of the “L” is a cash register. The counter has two levels, an upper level and a lower level which appears to me to be about 6 inches or 15 centimetres below the top level of the counter. On the bottom level of the counter is situated the cash register, such that only part of it appears above the top level of the counter.
	
	
	Mrs Wongsamak said this in her statement of 17 January 2014, exhibit LX:
	


“On Tuesday, 31 December 2013, New Year’s Eve, the restaurant was open for business from 5.30pm until 10pm. There were seven staff on and my four kids were also there helping out. At about 10pm we had just closed and the last customers had just walked out the front and were standing in front of the St George Bank, which is...next door to the restaurant on the left when looking at the restaurant from the outside.

There were about six customers as they had just finished dining in the restaurant. The customers were three men and three women and they were all older, in their fifties or sixties.

5. A few minutes after the customers walked out the door I was standing behind the front counter with my sister, Pilasluck Chaiklongklaw, was standing right next to me. A male walked in, he was very big, about 180 centimetres tall with a solid build. He was wearing a long sleeve jumper; it was grey or black with a hood on it. The hood was up over his head and with his left hand he was pulling the hood across his face to cover it. He had a knife in his right hand. I could only see the blade and it was silver, very long and looked sharp. I couldn’t see what he was wearing on the lower part of his body because the counter is too high.

6. He held out the blade in his right hand and pointed the blade towards me and waved it around. The blade was very close to me, almost touching my chest and stomach area. He didn’t say anything and I was so shocked I didn’t do anything. He walked around the counter to the side where my sister and I were standing. There is only one way into this side so we had nowhere to go. When he walked around towards me I got very scared, but I noticed he was wearing shorts and I remember seeing red on them. He walked to the cash register and started hitting it with the blade of the knife and said, “Empty, empty”. He yelled these words and was looking right at me. I felt so scared and shocked that I started shaking.

7. I called, “Daddy, daddy!” which is what I call my husband who was in the back of the shop. I saw that my husband, two male staff members, Mr Adisak and Mr Borom, my daughter Krisna and nephew Suchadet came out to the dining area. I think two other staff, Ms Naree and Ms Rattanaporn was still in the back of the store, but I’m not totally sure. The man who had the knife was still standing near me behind the counter within arm’s reach. I heard my husband shout, “Stop” I’m not sure exactly what, it was, “Fucking!” something. The male walked out from behind the counter into the dining area and I saw Mr Borom throw one of the dining chairs towards him. The chair didn’t hit him and the male just stood there. My husband picked up a chair and held it at about chest height in front of him and pointing towards the male. He yelled something like, “Get out!” but the male grabbed the chair and pushed hard and my husband fell to the floor.

8. The male stood over my husband and was holding the knife in his right hand with the blade facing down. He raised the knife up to his head height and swung it down really quickly to about his chest height really quickly. He did this a few times towards my husband but he wasn’t saying anything. I saw Mr Borom throw another chair at the male and I think it hit him. I think when the chair hit him, he just turned around and walked out the front door.”


	
	I should indicate that one of the inconsistencies in the evidence is whether Borom threw the first chair towards the robber before interaction of the robber and Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak or whether both chairs were only thrown by Borom after the interaction of the robber and Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak. Again, it does not make any material difference.
	
	
	As stated by Mrs Wongsamak, her sister, Ms Pilasluck Chaiklongklaw, was behind the counter with Mrs Wongsamak. Her statement contains this matter:
	


“7. I was sitting behind the front counter where the cash register is situated. I had a clear view of the front door when I saw a man enter through this door from Hillcrest Road and lean over the counter where my sister was standing. I saw that he was holding a long knife in his right hand. The man was wearing a black coloured, long sleeved woollen jacket with a hood which covered his face. He was holding the hood with his left hand so his face was covered. He was very tall and very big build. I think he was well over 6 feet tall and very heavy. He was a very big man. I don’t remember what else he was wearing as I was in shock. I don’t recall if he wear[sic] gloves.

8. I saw this man reach over the counter and jab the knife at my sister’s upper chest. I heard the man say to my sister, “Empty, empty, empty”. I saw my sister step back from the knife quickly and then the man walked to the end of the counter where I was seated and he started to bang the tip of the knife blade on top of the cash register. I got up and walked away from the man and stood behind my sister. As the man continued to bang the knife on the cash register my sister called out to her husband, Paul, “Daddy, daddy”. Her husband (Paul) came running from the restaurant and picked up a chair. The man moved from the cash register area at the end of the counter where my sister’s husband was standing with the chair. Paul pushed the chair towards [the man] but the man pushed back against the chair which made Paul fall to the ground. The man was still holding the knife in his right hand when Paul fell to the ground. As Paul was laying on the ground the man walked from behind the counter to where Paul was laying on the floor and I saw the man poke the knife towards Paul’s chest. Paul has the chair in front of him. One of the staff members, Borom...picked up a chair and threw it at the man but it missed. Borom picked up another chair and threw it at the man and this time it hit the man. I can’t remember where it hit the man. The man then walked out the front door onto Hillcrest Road where I lost sight of him.”


	
	Mrs Wongsamak’s sister confirms the entry of the would-be robber armed with a knife with which he threatened Mrs Wongsamak demanding that she empty the cash register. The proper inference to be drawn is that the would‑be robber wanted the contents of the cash register given to him, that is, the cash takings of the business.
	
	
	I shall very shortly describe the scene as described by Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak. I should, however, prefix my quotation from his statement with the observation that the woman “Nuk” referred to by him is clearly a reference to Ms Naree Horarit, a waitress at the restaurant. Mr Wongsamak’s statement contains the following:
	


“On 31 December 2013, I had all my staff working as we are busy on New Year’s Eve. About 10.30pm on that night I was in the kitchen of the restaurant. My wife was working at the counter of the restaurant. We had just had a table of customers leave the restaurant but they were out the front talking. I was talking with some of the staff in the kitchen when all of a sudden one of the server’s, Nuk, came running out into the kitchen and said in Thai, “Someone wants to get the money!” I thought she was joking.

5. I walked out to the front and I saw a big guy who is taller than my wife, standing behind the counter with my wife. She was standing near the till. He had a dark coloured hooded jacket on which he had over his head and pulled around his face. He was holding the hood with one hand and a 25 centimetre kitchen knife in the other hand. I can’t remember what hand he was holding the knife with. The male was holding the knife over his shoulder with the point of the knife towards my wife. He was yelling, “Empty the till!” Empty the till!”

6. I yelled at the man to get out of the restaurant. I was scared for my wife. I grabbed a wooden chair that was from one of the tables and I picked it up and held it towards the male. He turned around and looked at me. He started to walk towards me. He kept coming at me. He was making stabbing motions towards me with the knife still over his shoulder. I was blocking the knife from hitting me.

7. The male let go of the hood of his jacket and grabbed the chair. He started pushing backwards which pushed me backwards. As a result of being pushed backwards for about half an metre I tripped over my feet. I fell down onto the floor on my left side and my right leg and foot was all twisted.

8. The male still was coming at me with the knife when Mr Borom came from out the back and picked up a wooden chair and threw it at the male. Mr Adisak came out from the back and was standing behind me. The male was still standing there and Mr Borom picked up another chair and threw it at him. The male then just walked out the front door casually as if nothing happened. I saw him walk out towards the left.”


	
	I have already quoted the first part of the statement of Borom. It continues thus, describing what happened after he heard Mrs Wongsamak call out for help in the Thai language:
	


“8. Paul and I ran out into the front of the restaurant and Paul was in front of me. I am not sure if anybody else ran out with us as everything happened quickly. We ran out to the front of the screen which is across the hallway.

I remember I see a man standing behind counter near machine that keeps our cash. He was big and tall and had a dark colour jumper on with the hood up and short pants on. I thought it was the man that I saw standing across the road. He had a knife in his right hand and was stabbing cash machine with blade. I did not hear him say anything. I saw my Auntie Gail and my Aunty Teesar [Pilasluck Chaiklongklaw] standing near him behind the counter and they looked scared.

9. I think Paul yelled at man, “get out!” I see man walk out from behind counter and face me and Paul. He stand there with his knife in his right hand, the blade pointing at us. He was standing about 3 or 4 metres away from us. I cannot remember anything more about what he looked like or who was there as all I look at was the knife in his hand. I think this is dangerous situation so I throw chair at man but I miss.

10. I was scared for my Auntie Gail and my Aunty Teesar as they were still behind counter and man was standing near them.

11. I saw Paul pick up chair and hold it in front of him and walk towards the man and yell, “get out!” The man walked towards Paul. The man was holding out the knife towards Paul, Paul’s head and neck. Paul put the chair up and I saw the chair was touching the man’s chest. The man pushed his body into the chair and hold knife towards Paul’s head but the chair blocked him. I think the man’s left hand was up holding the hood of his jumper across his face.

12. The man pushed his body forward. He pushed forward on the chair Paul was holding and I saw Paul fall to the floor. Paul still hold the chair up between him and the man to protect himself. The man was standing over Paul and I saw him stab out with the knife two times towards Paul’s chest but Paul kept the chair up to stop him. I picked up another chair and threw it at the man and it hit him on the left side. The man ran out the front door and still knife in his hand and turned left and walked up the road.”


	
	A sketch plan annexed to Borom’s statement, the plan being marked as exhibit M2, shows the counter, then position of Mr Wongsamak and the position of Mr Borom, who was standing behind Mr Wongsamak, and then a screen which covered the entrance to a hallway which hallway gave access to the kitchen and the toilets and the storage area to which Borom had earlier referred, the storage area being opposite the toilets.
	
	
	As I have earlier stated, the police also obtained a statement from Ms Krisna Wongsamak, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Wongsamak. She was wiping dishes in the kitchen when she heard Ms Horarit running from the front of the restaurant where customers usually were, calling out for her father. She went into the hallway from the kitchen. In her statement she referred to the hallway as a “walkway”. Her statement continues in this fashion:
	


“When I was in the walkway, I could see a male standing at the front counter, near the front of the shop. I was about 5 metres from where the male was, I saw he had a knife, he was banging it on the counter; he was saying words similar to “open up”. I saw my mother and Auntie Pilasluck standing behind the counter at the cash register close to where the male was on the other side of the counter. I saw both were backing away into the corner, while the male continued to bang his hand with the knife on the counter.

10. I heard my father shouting out words similar to “what the fuck” and I saw him come from the kitchen and pick up a chair from the main seating area. At this time the male had gone behind the counter and as he saw my father, he came back from behind the counter to near where he had been when I first saw him. My father was between where I was standing and where the male was.

11. As my father went towards the male, he pushed the chair he was holding out towards the male. My father went towards him with the chair, the male held the knife in his right hand and swung it towards my father. My father pushed the chair towards him. At the same time, my male cousin Borom who had been in the kitchen came into the main seating area and picked up a chair and threw it towards where the male was standing near the front counter. About this time my father fell backwards and landed on his back and stayed on the ground. Another male cousin Adisak, who had also picked up a chair and threw it towards the male, who then slowly walked to the front door and out onto the footpath.”


	
	The final statement from a member of the staff at the restaurant is that made by Mr Adisak Wongsamak. His statement contains this evidence:
	


“I was in the kitchen which is at the back of the restaurant. I heard a woman scream and it sounded like my Auntie Laynookar Wongsamak. It was really loud and I think she say, “help, help, help”. I got excited as I didn’t know what happened, so I stopped work and ran out to customer area.

I saw a big guy standing at counter. He was tall, I am 175 centimetres tall and he was taller than me. He was a large solid build. He wear a black jumper with a hood which was on his head. He wear shorts which with white and blue on them. He wear like a sport shoe but I don’t know colour. In his right hand he had a long knife. I saw it had a black handle and a silver blade. He was holding the knife by the handle the blade facing down. With the left hand he was pulling hood across face.

7. I saw my auntie Laynookar and my auntie Pilasluck were standing behind counter and they looked scared. I saw two customer standing outside shop. My uncle Sathaporn was standing one metre from man and he was holding a chair up. I was standing about arm length behind my uncle.

8. The man raised knife above his head. He was still holding in right hand with blade facing down. He swung knife down towards my uncle. My uncle kept chair between him and man to stop him. Man pushed the chair my uncle holding and my uncle fell to floor. The man came over my uncle as he laid on ground and still swinging with knife. My uncle was using chair to keep man away from him.

9. I picked up a chair to help my uncle. My staff member in kitchen, Borom, he was a chef too, was standing near me. I saw him pick up two chairs and throw at man. Both chair missed the man. The man then ran out the front door of the restaurant and go left up the street. I went out the front of the restaurant and saw man run up street.”

Factual findings


	
	Based upon those statements it is clear that the would‑be robber entered the restaurant, walked up to the counter and threatened Mrs Wongsamak with the knife. He may have at that time demanded that she empty the cash register. Mrs Wongsamak was frightened, scared. She did not comply with the initial demand. The would be robber then walked around the counter and behind it forcing Mrs Wongsamak and her sister into the base of the counter, that is between the area between the cash register and the seated Buddha. He then made a demand (again) that the cash register be emptied, again threatening Mrs Wongsamak and her sister with the knife by striking the cash register with the knife. I accept that Mrs Wongsamak had shouted out for assistance by calling for her husband by her pet name “daddy”. She may have also called for assistance in her native language as two of the witnesses depose. In any event, it would appear that the waitress Naree Horarit perceived what was happening and ran into the kitchen and raised an alarm.
	
	
	Mr Wongsamak then left the kitchen in the company of Borom and Adisak and his daughter Krisna. Seeing his wife being threatened with the knife, he took up a chair and approached the would-be robber. He shouted out to the would-be robber, probably using foul language, the intent being that the would‑be robber quit the premises. The robber turned to confront him. The two advanced towards each other. The would-be robber still had the knife in his right hand and was threatening Mr Wongsamak with it but from a distance. Mr Wongsamak, who had picked up a chair, raised it to defend himself. The would-be robber had at that stage still the hood of his jumper pulled across his face in an attempt to conceal his identity. He let go of the hood and with his left hand grabbed the chair and pushed back against Mr Wongsamak. Mr Wongsamak was forced backwards. It is clear that the would‑be robber applied force to the chair forcing the chair against Mr Wongsamak. There was an application of force by the would-be robber on Mr Wongsamak who was pushed backwards and then, whilst still being pushed backward, fell. The action of the would be robber in grabbing hold of the chair with his left hand and pushing backwards with it was a voluntary act on the part of the would-be robber. It cannot be seen in any fashion to be an involuntary act.
	
	
	I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that Borom threw two chairs towards the robber. The first would appear to have been before the interaction of the robber and Mr Wongsamak. The second was after Mr Wongsamak had fallen to the ground and whilst the robber was standing over Mr Wongsamak who still had the chair in his hands and was using it to fend off the robber. Borom threw a second chair which struck the robber and that caused him to desist from his interaction with Mr Wongsamak, and caused the would-be robber to leave the premises walking slowly, as the witnesses perceived it, perhaps not running but merely walking.
	


The witnesses outside the restaurant


	
	The last group of diners was a group of 6. They were Mr Warren Craig Cardwell who was then aged 55 and his wife Rachel, Mr Malcolm Walker who was then aged 53 and his wife Katherine, and Mr Malcolm Logan and his wife Julianne Mary Logan who was aged 54 at the time. Statements were obtained by the police from Mr Cardwell, Mrs Cardwell, Mr Walker and Mrs Logan. The three couples were friends. They had met up with each other to enjoy a meal at the restaurant and either beforehand, or whilst dining, or immediately after dining, decided to take a train from Pennant Hills to Waverton and then to walk to Balls Head Reserve to watch the firework display at midnight.
	
	
	Mr Cardwell drew a diagram which became exhibit Q2. That shows the path taken by the would-be robber into the restaurant and out of the restaurant and the relative positions of a number of persons. The sketch plan clearly shows the “L” shaped counter, the base of the “L” on its right side adjoining the side wall of the restaurant and the position of the two female staff members as Mr Cardwell perceived them, Mrs Wongsamak and her sister. It also shows how the would‑be robber walked around the top of the “L” to behind the counter and then his route from that place out of the restaurant. Marked on that plan is a place for two staff members, the one on the right hand side, I infer is, where Mr Wongsamak was, and the other position of a staff member, indicated by a drawing of a chair, was that of Borom. Mr Cardwell has marked his position immediately outside the entrance to the restaurant with a circle and initials, WC, with the note that he had a camera. There are two other persons identified as standing outside, they were his wife Rachel and Mrs Kathy Walker.
	


LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT


	
	The relevant part of Mr Cardwell’s statement is this:
	


“Upon finalising the account for the meal, three of our party went to the toilet whilst myself and two others left the restaurant and waited outside on the pavement.

4. From where I was standing I could see inside the restaurant as the lights were still on. I observed restaurant staff outside packing up the tables and weights. I noticed a man go into the building and at the time I thought it was a staff member because he was wearing [a] dark top, similar to the uniform that staff were wearing. The man walked over to the rear of the front counter, where there was a point of sale register and a female staff member who was cashing up the takings and closing the register down. The man at this stage had pulled the hood of his hoodie fully over his head. I then noticed him bang a carving knife a number of times on the counter and shout at the lady, ‘Give it to me, give it me’. At the same time he repeatedly banged the knife on the table next to the lady.

5. The knife was in his right hand. It had a silver blade which was like a carving knife with a tapered blade which was about 18 centimetres long; I don’t think I saw the handle [as] the man’s sleeve covered it. The lady appeared to be stunned from what was happening and was not able to do as he demanded, that is give him the money from the register.

6. Other staff who were close by attempted to fend off the man by throwing a chair and a cushion stool at the man. I then tried to take a photograph on my mobile Blackberry Z10 device whilst ensuring that it was not noticed. I managed to get a couple of photographs with one clearly showing the man leaving the restaurant and running in a westerly direction up Hillcrest Road, past the ANZ Bank, which has CCTV.

7. The man was about 5 foot 6 inches tall, Caucasian with olive skin, wearing a black‑coloured long‑sleeved hoodie, striped red and blue boardies, white ankle socks and dark-coloured running shoes. I saw the man’s face and could see he had a Caucasian olive complexion. I would recognise the man again if I saw him. He was clean shaven and about 25 [years] old. He was solid build, but didn’t have strong muscles.

8. I watched as the man ran from the restaurant and still carrying the knife in his right hand. I felt the man lacked full senses and was possibly drug-affected and not drunk. The man, after about 50 metres, walked up the hill in a dazed state. I phoned triple-0, as well as my wife, and gave a description of the man according to standard protocol.”


	
	Exhibit Q3 is an image taken by Mr Cardwell on his Blackberry device. It shows the would‑be robber from the rear as he was going in a northwest direction up Hillcrest Road. It shows a person wearing what appear to be black shoes with white socks appearing above the black shoes, and shorts, which might be described as board shorts, having three horizontal bands, the upper band being white, the middle band being red and the bottom band being blue. The top of the person’s image is covered in what would appear to be a black or otherwise dark‑coloured hooded garment with long sleeves. In between the top white band of the board shorts and the bottom of the dark hooded garment is a segment that appears on the image to be light blue. I do not know whether that represents an underlying garment, such as a T‑shirt or pair of underpants, or whether it merely is an artefact and shows skin. It appears to be very light blue, but again the colour may represent an artefact.
	
	
	Mr Cardwell sought to identify the accused from a photographic array in accordance with standard procedures. The accused’s image was numbered 6 of the 20 shown to him. He did not identify the accused, but identified the person shown in image 1. The person shown in image 1 has been identified and that gentleman has made a statement which has been marked exhibit BB. Suffice to say that he has an alibi as to his whereabouts on 31 December 2013. He was with his girlfriend at his home in Rozelle. He watched the early fireworks from the rooftop of his residence at Rozelle between 8.50pm and 9.50pm and at about 10pm on the same day went with his girlfriend to a friend’s house which is on the border of Rozelle and Balmain for a house party. He identified the owners of the house, a couple who were his friends. He stated that he never attended a restaurant at Pennant Hills and that he has never attended the restaurant.
	
	
	The relevant portion of Mrs Rachel Cardwell’s statement is this:
	


“We stayed in the restaurant for approximately an hour and a half when we decided to leave at approximately 9.55pm. Kathy and Julie went to the bathroom just before we left the restaurant as Mal Walker went to pay the bill. A short time after that Mal Walker went to the bathroom as my husband and I walked outside of the restaurant with Julie and Kathy. Whilst we were standing outside I saw Kathy talking to the female workers before she joined us outside. I remember seeing two male workers come outside and start packing up the chairs and tables as they were preparing to close.

7. A short time later I heard a bit of commotion coming from inside the restaurant. I then heard Julie say ‘he’s got a knife.’ I then looked inside the restaurant and saw a male I would describe as being of Caucasian appearance, approximately 180 centimetres tall and of solid build. I recall this male to be wearing a dark‑coloured hooded top with white writing on the front. The male had the hood up over his head. I only saw this male from the waist up as my vision was somewhat obscured. The male appeared to be positioned so as to prevent the females from moving out from behind the counter area.

8. I saw the male holding a black handled kitchen knife which had a silver blade of approximately 15-20 centimetres in length. The male was holding the knife in his right hand. I then saw the male hitting the top of the counter with the knife. As the man hit the top of the counter I saw his actions as being threatening toward the female staff behind the counter area. I was concerned so I moved away from the restaurant and dialled triple 0 and requested police to attend.”


	
	Mrs Katherine Walker made a statement on 2 January 2014. She confirmed that she noticed a male wearing a long-sleeved black‑coloured sloppy joe with the hood pulled over his head covering his face. He was carrying a carving knife which she also described as having a silver blade and a dark-coloured handle. She thought the blade was about 18 centimetres long. She saw him raise the knife and plunge it towards the counter where the two female staff were standing. She also heard the sound of employees of the restaurant shouting at the would-be robber. She saw one of the male employees lift a chair with which he was about to either hit the would-be robber with, or throw at the would-be robber. She, by that stage, had formed the view that the would-be robber was attempting to rob the restaurant and she stepped back from the window. She observed to Rachel Cardwell that there was a man with a knife attempting to rob the restaurant. She confirmed that she used her mobile phone to ring the police. She saw the would-be robber leave the restaurant. The relevant portion of her statement is this:
	


“It was moments later as Rachel was still on the phone to the police that I saw the man stumble outside the restaurant and walk across the road. He didn’t appear to be in a hurry but walked slowly and was unsteady on his feet as if he was affected by alcohol or drugs. I could see that he was still carrying the knife in his right hand which was behind his back. He was headed towards the Pennant Hills police station.

6. The man was wearing surfboard shorts; they were white with blue and red stripes on one leg of the shorts. I can’t remember what shoes or thongs he was wearing. He was solid build and I estimate he was in his twenties. He was about 175 centimetres to 180 centimetres tall. At the time I did not see his face.”


	
	The statement of Mrs Julianne Mary Logan is lengthy. What it does, however, is to confirm the observations previously made by Mr and Mrs Cardwell and Mrs Walker. I shall not cite it in full. She confirmed that she saw the robber after the event walking up Hillcrest Road in a north-westerly direction. She observed that he was wearing a pair of shorts. She remembered that the colour of the shorts was white, red and blue. Her observations were sufficient to enable her to attest that the man she saw walking up Hillcrest Road wearing those distinctive shorts was the same man who had entered the restaurant and had brandished the knife therein.
	
	
	The only discrepancy that can be seen from the observations of the three former patrons of the restaurant made from outside the restaurant is whether what was thrown in the direction of the would-be robber was a chair and a stool or two chairs deposed to by the staff of the restaurant. Again, little turns on that.
	


Police attend the scene


	
	Police attended promptly to the triple 0 request for assistance. The first police to arrive were a Senior Constable Neil Wilford and Constable Laura Hoy, both performing general duty police work for the Ryde Local Area Command. I infer from Constable Hoy’s statement that the vehicle in which they were driving was called Ryde 36. Also responding were Senior Constable Alex Smith and Constable Nicholas Brylynsky, again general duties police from the Ryde Local Area Command, driving Ryde 16. Inspector Jason McSweeney and Sergeant Ronald Fornston attended together. I infer that their car may have been called Ryde 13.
	
	
	The dog squad was also called and Senior Constable Brad Atkins attended in car numbered Dog 62 which carried a police sniffer dog. The dog could not pick up the robber’s scent. Senior Constable Atkins arrived at the restaurant at about 10.24pm. He was told that the would‑be robber appeared to be of Middle Eastern appearance, was in his early twenties, was wearing a dark-coloured hooded jumper and shorts which had three horizontal sections made up of red, white and blue. As his dog was unable to locate the offender’s track, he left the “crime scene” at 10.34. He drove out onto Pennant Hills Road and headed in a southerly direction. About 100 metres north of Beecroft Road he saw a man walking south on the footpath on the eastern side of Pennant Hills Road. He noticed that the male was wearing shorts matching the description given to him by other police at the restaurant. He drove his police vehicle onto the footpath and alighted from it. He approached the man and asked him to stop there for a short while. He pointed to a brick wall and asked the man to take a seat there.
	


Arrest of the accused


	
	Senior Constable Atkins then made a cursory search of the pockets in the front of the man’s jumper and located only a mobile telephone. This conversation was then recorded:
	


“I said, ’Is that all you have on you?’

He said, ‘Yep’.

I said, ‘You got any ID?’

He said, ‘Nope’.

I said, ‘My name is Senior Constable Atkins from the Police Dog Unit’. He shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘What?’

I said, ‘You are wearing clothing similar to that of a male involved in an offence down the road, just sit there and if it’s got nothing to do with you, you will be on your way very shortly’.

He said, ‘Okay’.”

Senior Constable Atkins then attempted to obtain a detailed description from VKG of the male involved in the attempted robbery of the restaurant. There was some delay in his being provided with the description. He had a further conversation with the man whom he had asked to be seated. The conversation was this:

“I said to the accused, ‘Where have you just come from?’

He said, ‘Just a street over there’ pointing generally south.

I said, ‘Where are you going now?’

He said, ‘Just going for a walk’.

I said, ‘Where do you live?’

He said, ‘Artarmon’.

I said, ‘Righto, won’t be much longer’.

He said, ‘Okay, how has your night been?’

I said, ‘Busy’.”


	
	By this stage Inspector McSweeney and Sergeant Fornston had pulled up near to Senior Constable Atkins’ vehicle. A conversation ensued between the Senior Constable and the Inspector. The Senior Constable then heard a description from VKG of the suspected would-be robber. He was also advised in that broadcast to exercise caution as the offender was armed with a knife. Senior Constable Atkins then approached the man and took hold of his arms and helped him stand up and asked Inspector McSweeney to search the man. Inspector McSweeney was by this time standing behind the man. Inspector McSweeney found a knife in the waistband of the back of the man’s shorts. He called out “knife”. Senior Constable Atkins saw the knife being removed and being handed by Inspector McSweeney to Sergeant Fornston. The senior constable then secured the man’s arms behind his back and handcuffed him. Sergeant McSweeney then advised the man that he was under arrest for the attempted armed robbery of a restaurant at Pennant Hills. The man who had been arrested is the present accused.
	
	
	In the statement made by Inspector McSweeney, a conversation is recorded in which the man admitted that he was Blake Weismantel, that his date of birth was 11 May 1992 and that he lived at Artarmon. Inspector McSweeney asked the accused where he had been in the last hour. The accused replied: “Up the road”. When asked what he was doing there the accused said: “I don’t know.” According to Inspector McSweeney, it was only after he recorded those facts from talking with the accused that he found the knife in question and then proceeded to formally arrest the accused. The accused was then unwell. An ambulance was called and he was taken to Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital. His clothing was then taken into possession of the police. Photographs of the accused’s clothing are contained in exhibit A3, seven photographs attached to the first statement of Detective Senior Constable Stephen Ireland.
	


The accused was the would-be robber


	
	The shorts are very distinctive. They are comprised of three horizontal bands of equal thickness, white, then red, then blue. They match the photograph taken by Mr Cardwell on his Blackberry device. The accused was wearing black joggers and white socks which had a red sole but only the white material would be visible when a sock was on a foot and the foot was encased in a shoe. The clothing also included a white Adidas T-shirt. The hooded pullover is black with white writing on the front.
	
	
	The knife found on the accused had a black handle and a silver blade. The photograph does not show the colour of the blade adequately but is clearly different to the black handle and if one allows for colour differences in photographs, is probably silver. It is about 29 centimetres long and the handle and the blade appear to be of equal length or close to equal length. It can be validly described as a kitchen carving knife.
	
	
	A police crime scene examiner attended the scene and besides taking photographs, also lifted two fingerprints from the door frame of the entrance door of the restaurant. However, those fingerprints have never been identified in the evidence before me and there was no suggestion that they were the accused’s fingerprints.
	
	
	There is no direct photographic evidence of the accused taken at the scene of the crime. There is no fingerprint evidence of the accused’s presence at the scene of the crime. There is no DNA evidence of the accused’s presence at the scene of the crime. However, it was accepted by the accused that he was the relevant actor. The concession has been made by his Counsel prior to the formal commencement of the hearing.
	
	
	In any event, the evidence persuades me beyond reasonable doubt that the would‑be robber was the accused. Shortly stated, my reasons are, firstly, the board shorts are very distinctive and can be clearly seen in the photograph taken by Mr Cardwell on his Blackberry device as the would-be robber was leaving the restaurant after the attempted robbery. Secondly, all the witness describe a relatively tall man of sturdy build and the accused can be so described. Thirdly, the majority of the descriptions indicate that the offender was in his twenties and this current accused was in his twenties. Thirdly, the accused is described in various fashions as Caucasian or of Middle Eastern appearance or having swarthy skin or olive coloured skin. The accused does have olive coloured skin.
	
	
	The next matter to be borne in mind, the fourth, is that the would-be robber was thought by the former patrons of the restaurant who were standing outside to be acting erratically as if he were somehow affected by a substance such as alcohol or drugs. Immediately after his arrest, the accused was described by Sergeant Fornston in this fashion:
	


“5. At this time the accused was speaking in an incoherent manner and I formed the opinion the accused was possibly affected by drugs and he then rolled onto his stomach and appeared to fade in and out of consciousness. He was consequently placed into the recovery position and due to his state an ambulance was requested.

7. At about 11.45pm an ambulance attended and assessed the accused and advised that he needed hospitalisation. As a consequence, police then accompanied the accused to Hornsby Hospital in the ambulance where medical staff sedated the accused. At this time I seized the clothing of the accused and handed the clothing to Constable Brylynsky and bagged and sealed the clothing. I then remained with the accused whilst the hospital staff completed the sedation of the accused before I returned to Eastwood Police Station to complete my duties.”

Constable Brylynsky said this in par 10 of his statement:

“The accused was initially compliant, however was incoherent. He appeared unsteady on his feet. It was at this point that he was assisted to the ground for his safety. We formed the opinion that the accused may have been affected by drugs and/or alcohol, and subsequently an ambulance was called to the scene to assist the accused.”


	
	A fifth factor which I take into account is that when the accused was confronted by police he gave no explanation of what he was doing in the vicinity of Pennant Hills at the time of his meeting up with Senior Constable Atkins.
	


Elements 1, 2 and 4


	
	I turn to the elements of the offence. I am satisfied that the accused was armed with a knife. An offensive weapon is defined in s 4 subs(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 in this fashion:
	


“Offensive weapon or instrument means:

(a) a dangerous weapon, or

(b) any thing that is made or adapted for offensive purposes, or

(c)any thing that, in the circumstances, is used, intended for use or threatened to be used for offensive purposes, whether or not it is ordinarily used for offensive purposes or is capable of causing harm.”

A kitchen knife of nearly 30 centimetres length with a blade of approximately 15 centimetres is capable of causing harm and can be used for an offensive purpose as it was used on this evening. I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was armed with an offensive weapon.


	
	The next element is that the accused assaulted the victim. I have already found that the accused assaulted Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak by applying force to his body by pushing the chair back against Mr Wongsamak’s body forcing him backwards and causing him to fall. In any event antecedent to that he clearly threatened Mr Wongsamak with a knife.
	
	
	The third element is that the accused intended to steal property from Mr Wongsamak. This is the element in dispute in the current trial. There is no doubt that the accused intended to steal property that belonged to the business.
	
	
	It is clear that the fourth element is established because the accused used violence towards Mrs Wongsamak as well as Mr Wongsamak and he put each of those persons in fear.
	
	
	The final element I will describe later, that is, the infliction of grievous bodily harm.
	


Element 3 and the principal defence


	
	The defence has submitted that the inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the accused intended to steal from Mrs Wongsamak who had charge of the cash register containing the takings of the business which the accused wished to steal, that he threatened her with force, demanded that she open the till and was seeking to rob her of the takings. The argument clearly requires me to dissociate the attack upon Mr Wongsamak from the attempted robbery.
	
	
	Learned counsel for the accused referred me to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Foster (NSWCCA, 7 April 1995, 60325 of 1994). The Court, comprised of Hunt CJ at CL and Smart and Levine JJ, said this:
	


“The essence of a robbery is that violence is done or threatened to the person of the owner or custodian who stands between the offender and the property stolen, in order to overcome that person’s resistance and so to oblige him to part with the property; in other words, the victim must be compelled by force or fear to submit to the theft: Smith v Desmond [1965] AC 960 at 985 - 987, 997-998. It is not sufficient that the threat of violence is made after the property has been taken; both elements of the offence must coincide, R v Emery (1975) 11 SASR 169 at 173.”

The defence submits that it was Mrs Wongsamak who stood between the offender and the cash register from which it was desired to take the money. It was Mrs Wongsamak whose resistance the accused sought to overcome by his threatening her with the knife.


	
	The submission lays stress on the literal application of the dictum derived from Smith v Desmond.  It is instructive to consider the facts of that case as well as the relevant dicta. In Smith v Desmond the defendants were convicted on a count in an indictment charging them with robbery with violence. The evidence showed that Lai, a maintenance engineer, and Scott, a nightwatchman, were working by night in a bakery, when, at about 11.50pm, they were attacked by the defendants, pushed into the workshop, blindfolded and their hands tied up. They were then taken to a lavatory where their feet were tied up and they were left there while the defendants broke and entered the cash office, some 33 yards away and separated from them by two doors, at least one of which was locked. Throughout the period while they lay bound and blindfolded, which lasted some three and a half hours, Lai and Scott heard the sounds of breaking glass, heavy banging and crashes and the noise of an oxy-acetylene burner. In fact the safe in the cash office was burned and opened and money taken. The jury in the Liverpool Crown Court found each of the accused guilty of robbery with violence. The Court of Criminal Appeal comprising Lord Parker CJ and Winn and Widgery JJ allowed the appeal. However the verdicts of the jury were restored by the House of Lords.
	
	
	The senior member of the House of Lords, Lord Reid agreed with the judgments of his colleagues. Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest delivered a lengthy speech. At 979 his Lordship pointed out that the case then before the house called for an examination of the concept of what is involved when writers use such phrases as “the taking of anything from the person of another or in his presence”, part of the classic definition of robbery, that is, larceny from the person with force.
	


At 982 his Lordship refered to a very early case. His Lordship said this:

“In a case in 1651 (Crosthwayt and the Hundred of Lowden) money was taken out of a postmantle which was carried by a post boy though his master had his hand upon one end of the postmantle. For the purposes of the case it was important to decide whether the master as opposed to the post boy was robbed. It was held that there was no question but that it was a robbery of the master: ‘and it is all one as where my servant is robbed in my presence, and there the goods shall be said to be in my possession’.”

His Lordship then considered Donnally’s case (1779) 1 Leach 193 and quoted from Willes J:

“But as the judges declared, they did not mean to draw the exact line what should or what should not be construed a robbery, but that every case must depend on its own particular circumstances, it will sufficient for me to show that the facts proved in the present case are within the definition I have given of that offence.”

At 983 his Lordship said this:

“It was, however, clearly stated that a taking in the presence of the party would be sufficient to establish the third ingredient. Approval was also given to the view that there could be robbery even though the person robbed was unconscious, as in the case where somebody is knocked down ‘without any previous warning to awaken his fears, and lieth totally insensible while the thief riles his pockets’. This view had also been expressed by Blackstone (see Vol 4 p 242). This serves to illustrate that particular expressions of particular writers must not be given a wider meaning than the context would warrant. Thus when Hawkins referred to a taking of anything from someone “openly and before his face” he cannot be regarded as meaning that it is not robbery if by violence somebody is made unconscious so the moment when the thing is taken he is unaware of the taking. No real help, is, however, to be found in Donnally’s case.”

   At the foot of 984 his Lordship said this:

“My lords, in an examination of the episode the moment when it began must first be considered. Scott was the night watchman. Prominent among his duties must have been that of safeguarding the things of value that were in his charge. Though Lai had primarily the responsibilities of a maintenance engineer his duties would necessarily also involve giving reasonable support and assistance to Scott. When they were pounced upon and overpowered they were in charge of the building. Its contents were under their care and protection. The design of the accused and their associates was to reach and to take away the money in the safe. They could only achieve their purpose if Scott and Lai were mastered and then were kept under continuing and effective restraint. That was because the safe was under their protection. It was nonetheless under their protection even though they had no need to finger its contents or means to unlock its doors, and even though at some particular moment they may not have been in the part of the building nearest to the safe. They were there to guard and to protect. It could neither have been carried away (had it been of a size and weight to make this feasible) nor could it have been forced open unless their resistance was completely overcome, and the ability to give the alarm or to seek outside help entirely frustrated. Under these circumstances it seems to me that the safe was, to adopt Hawkins’ words, under their “immediate and personal care and protection”.

If this was so then the circumstance that during the period of the actual safe-breaking process and also at the moment when the accused departed with its contents Scott and Lay were some yards away from the safe and were imprisoned in another room and were unable to see what was happening did not, in my view, prevent the crime from being that of robbery. The important moment in time which has to be considered is the moment when by the application of force (or its equivalent) the care and protection of a custodian is overborne. If somebody had a number of chattels in his immediate care and protection and was then overpowered and was taken some distance away and was then left bound, gagged and blindfolded, it would still be robbery even though the actual moment when the chattels were taken away he could neither hear anything nor see anything, and even though the actual removal of the chattels only took place sometime later than the actual application of the force. It will be the same if someone was made unconscious and either left where he was or carried some distance away. There might, however, be cases in which some act of violence was designed to facilitate some stealing which was planned to be a later and separate episode. Questions of degree may, therefore, arise as to whether the violence and theft are or are not joint features of the one crime. Questions of degree may also arise where the goods are or are not in someone’s immediate and personal protection and care. Questions as to distance may in some cases arise. All such questions of degree will be for the jury to determine. In the present case there can be no doubt that the violence and theft were essentially linked. Scott and Lai were in the building to give care and protections to its contents. In a central part of the building there was money which could only be reached if they were made powerless - powerless to resist, powerless to defend, powerless to gain help:”.

At the end of that paragraph his Lordship said this:

“It is open to a jury to convict of robbery if someone through force or fear is compelled to submit to the taking of goods from his person or is compelled to relinquish or to surrender or is made powerless to prevent the taking of goods which at the time of the force or fear are in his immediate and personal care and protection”.


	
	Lord Hodson gave a speech in which he quoted from the 1824 edition of Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown. He quoted this dictum:
	


“Not only the taking away a horse from a man whereon he is actually riding, or money out of his pocket, but also the taking of anything from him openly and before his face, which is under his immediate and personal care and protection, may properly enough be said to be a taking from the person; and therefore he who having first assaulted me takes away my horse standing by me, or having put me in fear drives my cattle in my presence out of my pasture, or takes up my purse which I in my fright cast into a bush, or my hat which fell from my head, or robs my servant of my money before my face, may be indicted as having taken such things from my person”.

His Lordship then continued thus:

“These citations support the view that commends itself to me, namely that the whole of the robbery including the violence (or putting in fear) and the asportation must be taken as one transaction and not divided into component parts”.


	
	Lord Pearce also delivered a speech with which Lord Donovan specifically concurred. At 997 his Lordship said this:
	


“The essence of the offence is that violence is done or threatened to the person of the custodian who stands between the robber and the property in order to prevent or overcome his resistance and oblige him to part with the property and to submit to stealing it. Thus the offence against the person and the theft are combined.

Where the sequence of events is not planned, but there is an assault which happens to be followed by a theft, there may be room for niceties of argument. But where the whole sequence appears to be one planned transaction one must regard the events as a whole to see if together they amount to robbery. A thief cannot escape the charge of robbery by merely planning his crime in two stages, namely first violently removing the owner or custodian of the property from its vicinity to a distance at which he cannot see or hear the actual stealing of the property and then, secondly, stealing the property”.

His Lordship went on to say this:

“The only relevance of the victim’s awareness is this. Is he aware of the theft or intended theft and is he compelled by force or fear to submit to it? Or has he been prevented by violence or threat from becoming aware of the theft and has that enabled the thieves to steal? If the answer to either of these questions is yes, the offence against the person and theft are combined and the offence of robbery is constituted.

But the offence can only exist where the victim has sufficient care or personal possession of the goods to allow the Court to say that constructively the goods were taken ‘in his presence’. Were the night watchman or the maintenance engineer sufficiently the custodians of the safe and its contents to render the rifling of it a robbery ‘in their presence’? The Court of Criminal Appeal in view of some of the old cases felt a difficulty which I can well understand. They would have preferred to hold this a robbery but they felt that to do so would be an extension which they were not justified in making. With respect to that view I think that your Lordships should take a contrary view. If the night watchman had been carrying out the duty of sitting by the safe to guard its contents with his hand upon it, no one would have felt any difficulty about this case. His forcible abduction from the property which he was guarding and touching would clearly have constituted robbery with violence. He was not, however, in fact in the room where the safe was kept. It was locked and he was some distance away from it when he was set upon. But it was within the area of his vigilance. He had a duty to go his rounds every half-hour to see that all was secure. And he had a telephone at hand for summoning the police if any unlawful attempt was made on the property that he was guarding. Had he not been overpowered no doubt he would have done so. He was the temporary custodian who stood between the thieves and the money which they intended to steal. And it was in that capacity and because of it that he was overpowered and bound.

It is a question of degree for the jury to decide whether the victim of the violence was sufficiently the custodian of the property stolen, whether he had sufficient possession and care of it, to constitute the stealing as being in his presence.

The fact that the thieves thought it necessary or desirable to overpower the night watchman and his companion is cogent evidence that their possession and control stood between the thieves and their objective. There might be cases where that consideration is not cogent, where for instance, a night watchman is overpowered because he has strayed into portion of premises which he was not intended to guard, and his unauthorised and unexpected presence has led to their attacking him. But here he was performing his duty within the proper sphere of his vigilance and part of his duty was to see that the office and the safe were not broken into. There was, therefore, ample evidence on which the jury should have found a verdict of guilty on the charge of robbery with violence”.


	
	I am compelled by the reasoning of Lord Hodson to look at the transaction in question as a whole rather than to divide it into parts. I am also required by the speech of Lord Pearce to consider the question of whether the property that it was the intention of the accused to steal could be seen to be in the custody of the complainant, Mr Wongsamak. When Mr Wongsamak called out to the accused to require him to leave the restaurant, the accused did not do so. He confronted Mr Wongsamak and assaulted him, ultimately causing him to fall to the floor. The question really is when did the accused cease to intend to steal? The accused did not comply with Mr Wongsamak’s demand. He confronted him and sought to stop him interfering with the attempt that he was making to obtain the contents of the cash register. On any view of it, the accused must still have had the intention of making off with the takings. What stopped him was the fact that Borom threw the chair or a stool at the accused which struck him and caused him to leave.
	
	
	When a person intent on robbery enters premises, he might be confronted by any number of people. There might be persons standing near the property which the robber intends to carry away, but there may be other people nearby who, appreciating what is being sought to be done, attempt to prevent that occurring. Mr Wongsamak had an interest in protecting his own property as well as in protecting his own wife. The contents of the cash register belonged jointly and severally to the proprietors of the business, Mr and Mrs Wongsamak.
	
	
	It is a otiose exercise, in my view, to try to discern some different intention. The intention of the accused was to take money, the takings in the cash register. Mr Wongsamak may have had a greater concern for his wife than for his money, such is understandable. However, he sought to prevent the crime which the accused was attempting to perform. The accused did not desist immediately on Mr Wongsamak’s demand that he leave the premises but the accused turned to Mr Wongsamak to stop him interfering with what the accused wanted to do, which was to take the money. I must look at the whole transaction. The whole transaction was an attempt to rob the business. There was an attempt to rob Mr Wongsamak and Mrs Wongsamak and any of their employees who might have custody of the cash register. The accused’s intention cannot be discerned to have changed until he decided to quit the premises, which only occurred after Borom threw a second chair or a stool at the accused which struck him, and perhaps drew to his attention the fact that there might be persons to overcome other than the two ladies near the till and Mr Wongsamak who had already sought to stop him performing the act upon which he was intent.
	
	
	I decline, with the utmost respect, to draw the inference that the defence asks me to draw, in essence, that the accused desisted from his intention to steal when he confronted Mr Wongsamak. The only thing which might lead me to the view that the accused had desisted in his desire to continue with the attempted robbery was his leaving the premises. The only reason to confront and drive off Mr Wongsamak could only be the persistence of the intention of robbing the business. I am, therefore, persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to steal property of Mr Wongsamak from him and in the course of that endeavour assaulted Mr Wongsamak.
	


Jury knowledge only


	
	The remaining question is whether the complainant, Mr Wongsamak, sustained grievous bodily harm. Thus far in these reasons I have eschewed completely any knowledge I have previously acquired of the accused from dealing with an evidentiary matter in an earlier trial in which the accused eventually pleaded guilty and in dealing with the application for trial by judge alone in this case. I have based my determination solely on the evidence presented in court, all of which was documentary. As I said, I have eschewed completely any prior knowledge of the accused and his antecedents and personal circumstances. Before the next part of my deliberation, I completely eschew any knowledge or expertise I may have gained in practising for 39 years as a solicitor, barrister or judge in medico‑legal fields. I approach the matter entirely in the same way that a jury would.
	


Element 5: grievous bodily harm


	
	The law differentiates between actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm. When charging juries I provide to them a written explanation of both the terms “actual bodily harm” and “grievous bodily harm”. Actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the complainant, but such hurt or injury need not be permanent but must be more than merely transient or trifling. Bruises and scratches are typical examples of injuries that can amount to actual bodily harm. The last of those directions is contained in the Criminal Trials Bench Book and is used in charging a jury where actual bodily harm is inflicted in a case of kidnapping. Grievous bodily harm requires that the injury be a really serious one. However, it does not require that the injury be permanent or that the consequences of the injury be life threatening or long lasting. In the definitions contained in s 4 of the Crimes Act 1900 grievous bodily harm includes any permanent or serious disfiguring of the complainant, in other words, scarring.
	
	
	The latter part of Mr Wongsamak’s statement of 17 January 2014 contains this matter:
	


“10. I tried to get up off the floor but I couldn’t as I felt a lot of pain to my right ankle. It was twisted back at an abnormal angle. I just lay on the floor as I was in too much pain.

11. I believe that the customer rang 000. A short time later police and an ambulance came to help. My wife later took me to the Hornsby Hospital later in our car. The next morning I had surgery to have pins put into my ankle. They put a cast [on] my right leg which I have to wear for the next ten weeks. As a result I will not be able to work in the restaurant. I have had to hire a chef to fill in for me while I am not at work.”


	
	Dr Charles Lawrie, the deputy director of the Emergency Department of the Hornsby Ku‑ring‑gai Hospital, has prepared an expert certificate. Dr Lawrie is a fellow of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. He made his certificate from the hospital records. The certificate bears date 20 May 2014. It contains this matter:
	


“Presented on 31/12/2013 at 2353. History obtained by hospital staff was the following allegation: that he was at work, a man with a knife attempted to rob the business, and he twisted his ankle in the course of trying to evade him.

7. On examination the right ankle was swollen over the lateral malleolus and the patient was unable to weight bear. X‑rays demonstrated a spiral fracture of the fibula at the ankle. He was admitted to hospital under the care of Dr Ben Gooden, orthopaedic surgeon. He had an operation on the afternoon of 1/1/2014, with open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with a metal plate and screws. He was discharged from hospital on 2/1/2014. One of the screws was removed on 7/3/2014. He was making satisfactory progress when last seen in the orthopaedic clinic on 24/3/2014.

8. He will likely require a further procedure to remove the remaining metal hardware. He may have ongoing pain in his ankle.

9. Based wholly or substantially on the above knowledge, I am of the opinion that the findings on examination are consistent with the history obtained by hospital staff, that is, these injuries could have been caused by an alleged assault.”


	
	Of greater utility is an expert’s certificate from Dr Benjamin Gooden, an orthopaedic surgeon, whose usual rooms are at the Mater Clinic at Wollstonecraft. The relevant part of Dr Gooden’s certificate is this:
	


“Mr Wongsamak was admitted under my care to Hornsby Hospital on 31 December 2013 following an alleged assault. The patient was allegedly assaulted at work and during this event, he suffered a twisting injury to his ankle and was unable to weight bear afterwards. He was admitted to Hornsby Hospital and an x-ray demonstrated an oblique fracture of his distal fibula extending to the level of the syndesmosis. There was widening of the ankle [mortice] in keeping with instability of the ankle joint.

Mr Wongsamak was taken to theatre on 1 January 2014 and underwent an open reduction, an internal fixation of the fibula, a fracture with a 7 hole one third tubular plate and screws. The syndesmosis was found to be unstable on stressing and he therefore had two diastasis screws inserted through the plate. He was kept non weight bearing for a period of eight weeks post operatively, and was then mobilised weight bearing following this. On 7 March 2014 he returned to the operating theatre to have the diastasis screws removed. This is a standard part of treating this type of fracture.

With regards to the questions that were asked of me from Senior Constable Steven [sic] Ireland on 9 July, this particular fracture is a reasonably common one. It does require significant force to lead to fracture of the fibula in association with disruption to the syndesmosis. The metal plate and screws were required to reduce the fracture into an anatomical position and this is standard treatment for this kind of displaced fracture.

The patient underwent two procedures, the first being on 1 January 2014 to have the plate and screws inserted and the second being on 7 March 2014 to have the two diastasis screws removed. It is usual to leave the remaining fibular metal work in place, this is not routinely removed unless there are overt problems with the metal work.

The prognosis for this gentleman is good. Most people who suffer these fractures will return to full activities as tolerated over the ensuing 3-6 months post operatively. There is an incidence of patients who suffer from ongoing pain and swelling in their ankle after this and there is an incidence of the development of post-traumatic arthritis in the long-term. Post-operatively, patients require 3-6 months of physiotherapy to help regain their range of motion and full function of their ankle.”


	
	I should comment that there is an obvious error in the certificate of Dr Lawrie in that it is clear from Dr Gooden’s certificate that the two diastasis screws were removed at the second operation on 7 March 2014. Furthermore as far as Dr Gooden is concerned there is no need to remove the remaining “hardware” from the complainant’s ankle, that is 7 hole one third tubular plate and ordinary screws.
	
	
	Unfortunately the prognosis initially suggested by Dr Gooden does not appear to have been achieved. Dr Lawrie noted that the complainant might have ongoing pain in his ankle. Dr Gooden said that there is an incidence of patients, that is a number of patients, will suffer from ongoing pain and swelling in the ankle after such an injury, the prognosis being not a full recovery within six months of operative treatment.
	
	
	The complainant made a statement on 14 May 2015, sixteen and a half months after the initial surgery. In that statement Mr Wongsamak said this,
	


“My ankle is constantly numb to this day around the outside. Before I broke my ankle I exercised quite a bit. I used to walk on a treadmill two or three times a week. But since I broke my ankle I can’t do this as I get pain and soreness in my ankle very quickly when I try to walk for a long period of time.

“I had noticed it has affected my work, I work as a chef in my restaurant which means I stand up. I get soreness and pain when I stand up for a long time which I never had before I broke my ankle.

“Sometimes when I am sitting down and relaxed my ankle starts to ache which never happened before it was broken.”

In that same statement Mr Wongsamak reported that he wore the cast on his leg for “about two months”. It appears likely to me that the cast that the complainant was required to wear was between the first operation on 1 January 2014 and the second operation on 7 March 2014. The same statement also tells me that during that period the complainant needed daily injections “to stop blood clots”. I know from Dr Gooden’s certificate that after the cast was removed that there was a course of physiotherapy required for between three and six months. The evidence before me does not allow me to say for how long that physiotherapy lasted in this case. It appears that the minimum time would have been three months. Three months from 7 March 2014 takes one to early June 2014.


	
	I am persuaded, beyond reasonable doubt, that the complainant suffered a really serious injury, that he has sustained grievous bodily harm. Counsel referred me to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 205 in which Johnson J, with whom McCallum J agreed on the point, upheld a finding of grievous bodily harm. The principal judgment was given by Beazley JA (as she then was). Commencing at [130] her Honour discussed the particular facts of that case. Her Honour was of the view that the injury sustained by the victim in that case did not amount to grievous bodily harm. The majority, however, felt otherwise but agreed with the view of the trial judge, Berman DCJ, that it was at the lower end of what amounts to grievous bodily harm. In that case the victim was 67 years old at the time of the accident. He spent two days in hospital having sustained a subconjunctival haemorrhage to the right eye and a depressed right malar or cheek fracture. The accident also caused his dentures to become loose for which rectification work needed to be undertaken. The victim in that case had no problems with his right eye after the accident. The swelling which he had went away within a few days and the victim was able to go to a party about a week later at which he played a musical instrument. That party was his son’s wedding which he would not in any event have missed.
	
	
	My reasons for concluding that the complainant suffered a really serious injury can be shortly stated. Firstly this is not a simple fracture. This was an oblique spiral fracture of the distal fibular extending to the level of the syndesmosis, with widening of the ankle mortice in keeping with instability of the ankle. Plates and screws were required to put the fractured bone back into anatomical position. Open reduction surgery was required. The second procedure on 7 March 2014 was of little moment. But the fact that the 7 hole one third tubular plate and screws remain in force is a greater consideration. Mr Wongsamak was required to wear a cast on his leg for a period from 1 January 2014 to 7 March 2014, or for most of that period. Thereafter there would have been a period of at least three months physiotherapy to seek to get the complainant’s ankle back to normal function. There has not, however, been a complete recovery. Sixteen and a half months post-surgery the complainant had ongoing symptoms in his ankle which were impeding his ability to exercise and interfered with his ability to work. He also experienced at times pain in his ankle when at rest. In the circumstances it appears that the rosy prognosis initially expressed by Dr Gooden has not occurred and it seems likely that the complainant be left with ongoing symptoms referable to the fracture in his right ankle.
	
	
	The complex nature of the fracture, the extended period of treatment and the fact that there is ongoing symptomatology which interferes with the complainant’s ability to exercise and to stand up for long periods, as his work requires him to do, indicate to me that this is a really serious injury. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak sustained grievous bodily harm as a result of the assault upon him by the accused. Therefore the final element of the offence has been established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Gentlemen it’s now 25 to 5, do either of you require any further reasons for judgment.
	


CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour, no from the Crown.

SCHAUDIN: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I have inquired of counsel for the parties if any further reasons for judgment are required and I am told that none is so required.

Verdict


	
	Blake Weismantel, on the charge that on 31 December 2013 at Pennant Hills in this State, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, you did assault Sathaporn Wongsamak with intent to rob him and at the time of the assault you did inflict grievous bodily harm upon Sathaporn Wongsamak, I find you guilty.
	


DISCUSSION REGARDING DATES

2767081,R v Spadina [2015] NSWSC 933,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Radoslav Spadina, the offender, pleaded not guilty to the offence of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of a border patrol precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, contrary to s 307.11(1) and 11.5(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000.
	
	
	On 10 February 2015 the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to the offence.
	
	
	The facts as found by the jury will be summarised below. The jury have resolved most of the disputes with regard to the facts in finding the offender guilty. Some of the matters referred to in the facts are still in dispute and will require a finding by me. I should note that in most respects the facts are not in dispute.
	


FACTS


	
	The Crown provided me with an outline of their submissions as to the factual findings during the sentence proceedings for which I was grateful. The offender's counsel also provided me with extensive written submissions and those submissions together with further oral submissions are referred to in the summary of the facts and more generally in this judgment.
	


BACKGROUND


	
	The offender is an Australian resident who resided in Manly with his wife and children during the period of the conspiracy. The offender was involved in a company called Capital Access Pty Ltd which was apparently involved in lending money. Whilst it is apparent that the offender was an officer of that company, his precise role in that company remains largely unexplained. Whilst there was some effort during the trial to imply that some of the evidence relied on by the Crown, which mainly consisted of evidence provided by legally obtained listening devices, was somehow related to the offender's business interests, the jury by their verdict clearly rejected that characterisation of the evidence.
	
	
	The offender was a close friend and an associate of Adam Watt (Watt), a prominent identity in the Manly area and a previous champion kick boxer. Watt was also the managing director of a business called Satellite Newspapers and later a business known as Global News Express which was located at a business warehouse at Old Pittwater Road, Brookvale.
	
	
	Watt was acquainted with a male called Jan Plas (Plas) who resided in the Netherlands. Plas was a well-known trainer of kick boxers. Plas was also involved with an international drug syndicate (the Dutch syndicate) predominantly based in the Netherlands which was involved in the supply of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals.    The Dutch syndicate involved a number of persons including Loek Weerden (Weerden), Michael Von Hohenberg (Von Hohenberg), Rene Asbeek-Brusse (Asbeek-Brusse), Thomas Van Den Berg (Van Den Berg), Paul Van Leeuwen (Van Leeuwen), Eric de Bolle (de Bolle) and Bifort Fortunat (Fortunat). Weerden, based on the evidence, was clearly the chief operating officer and mastermind behind much of the activities of the Dutch syndicate.
	


INVESTIGATION COMMENCED


	
	As at February 2006 the National Crime Squad in Amsterdam commenced investigations into the operations of the Dutch syndicate. Investigations concerned the alleged distribution of precursor chemicals, hashish, cocaine and synthetic drugs such as ecstasy. It was also concerned with alleged money laundering.
	


THE CONSPIRACY ALLEGED


	
	I can deal with much of the facts fairly succinctly.
	
	
	There was a great deal of evidence during the proceedings designed to establish the fact that the Dutch syndicate intended to export into Australia something they described as the “Jerry shipment”. The Jerry shipment was a shipment of pseudoephedrine. Whilst there was a little variation in the evidence, the preponderance of the evidence established that the shipment was to be a quantity of 210 kilograms. Ultimately there was little dispute in the proceedings before the jury in relation to any of the foregoing.
	
	
	The question for the jury was whether the then accused, this offender here, was involved in the conspiracy to import the Jerry shipment. The jury, by their verdict, confirmed the offender’s involvement in the conspiracy.
	
	
	For one reason or another the shipment of pseudoephedrine never arrived in Australia. The precise quantity or quality or purity of the pseudoephedrine was not established in the trial as the drugs never arrived. There is now some evidence as to the purity of the drug in the sentencing proceedings and I will come back to address that evidence and the relevance of it to the sentence.
	
	
	The gravamen of this offence is the intention of the offender to import the pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	One issue raised on the sentencing proceedings was when the offender entered the conspiracy with Watt. I will address that and other areas of dispute below.
	


THE MONEY


	
	In early December 2005 Watt approached the offender's friend and associate, Gary Stewart (Stewart) and his business partner, Martin Green (Green), to transfer some money overseas. On the same occasion the offender asked one or both Stewart and Green to assist Watt with the transfer of the money. Stewart and Green were directors of Mendika Pty Ltd which traded as Chinatown Cellars. On 8 December 2005 $110,000 Australian Dollars in cash was delivered to the officers of Chinatown Cellars by Watt. It was deposited into the business account of Chinatown Cellars by Stewart and then was transferred to the account of J&L Continental Pty Ltd in Amsterdam. J&L Continental was a company controlled by Weerden. The Crown submitted in the trial that as at the date upon which the offender and Watt requested the transfer of the funds, the offender, Watt and perhaps others (the Australian Syndicate) had agreed with at least some of the members of the Dutch Syndicate to import a substantial quantity of pseudoephedrine into Sydney.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this was the only logical conclusion from the fact of the transfer, the manner in which it occurred, namely in cash, through a company that concealed its source in Australia and the company to which the money was transferred in Holland, namely one associated with Weerden. It was both disputed during the trial and on the sentence that the cash money that was deposited and forwarded to Weerden in Holland was necessarily associated with the Jerry shipment. It was submitted by the offender that I could not find beyond reasonable doubt that the money had been transferred as part of the then operations of the Australian Syndicate.    
	
	
	It was submitted that there were alternative explanations available such as the money may have been needed to be transferred overseas of Watt's then legitimate newspaper business. In my view those suggestions were fanciful and I have no doubt that the jury rejected them as I do. I find that the funds were transferred on behalf of the Australian Syndicate as part payment for the supply by the Dutch Syndicate for approximately 210 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. In other words, this offender's involvement in the Australian Syndicate can be traced back to at least this payment.
	


SOURCE OF THE PSEUDOEPHEDRINE


	
	The pseudoephedrine was originally to be sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the Congo) by the Dutch Syndicate and later from elsewhere, most likely Pakistan. Where the pseudoephedrine came from was a matter for the Dutch Syndicate. In my view it is clear from the whole of the circumstances that the $110,000 was only a down payment for sourcing the pseudoephedrine and arranging for it to come to Australia.
	
	
	Whilst it is not completely clear since the pseudoephedrine never actually arrived in Australia, I accept the Crown's submissions to the effect that there was an arrangement for a final payment to occur upon the issue of a final airway bill indicating the shipment had been dispatched to its ultimate destination in Sydney.
	
	
	The offender knew that the amount of pseudoephedrine which was to be supplied by the Dutch Syndicate was very substantial even if he was not aware of the precise quantity proposed to be imported. That is clear from the down payment of $110,000. It is inconceivable that someone would agree to such a payment without knowing what they were going to receive in return. There was clearly discussion in the evidence about 210 although there is no evidence that the offender ever knew of that precise amount. In the context of the evidence this reference to 210 had to relate to 210 kilograms of pseudoephedrine.    
	
	
	Further, accepting that the offender was involved in the conspiracy to import the pseudoephedrine I further accept that the offender intended to manufacture or have some other person manufacture methamphetamine from the pseudoephedrine following its arrival into Sydney. At trial the offender agreed (pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995) that any Australian import of approximately 210 kilograms of pseudoephedrine, either intended to use the substance to manufacture a controlled drug and/or believed that another person intended to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug.
	
	
	The offender has a previous conviction concerning possession of another precursor, sassafras oil, which can be used to manufacture a drug, the precursor pseudoephedrine is used to manufacture methamphetamine.
	
	
	I will come back to discuss the issue of the earlier conviction when addressing the need for the sentence to reflect deterrence.
	


MOTIVE


	
	Whilst it is not strictly necessary to find why the offender involved himself in this offence, in my view it is clear he was motivated to commit the offence by the prospect of obtaining a very substantial financial gain. Estimates were made as to the potential amount of money available to be made and it is sufficient to say that the amounts were in the millions of dollars.
	


WAS THE OFFENDER THE BOSS OF THE AUSTRALIAN SYNDICATE


	
	During the trial the jury was invited to find that the offender was the boss of the Australian Syndicate. That was not a finding that they were required to make beyond reasonable doubt. But on the sentence proceedings the Crown has pressed that matter as part of the circumstances of the offence. And in particular in relation to the role the offender played in the offence.
	
	
	The offender disputes that characterisation of his role. It was argued on behalf of the offender that I would not be able to make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the boss. What a sentencing court should focus on is the role played by the offender during the commission of the offence; Olbrich v R (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 279. In my view it does not matter and it is not necessary for me to find definitively whether the offender was the boss of the syndicate. It would be more important to decide if he in effect played the lead role with regard to the operation of the syndicate.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the offender's role was correctly described as the boss of the Australian Syndicate. His role could be contrasted with that of Mr Watt whose role was described by the Crown as the go-between with the Dutch Syndicate.
	
	
	Clearly Watt knew Jan Plas well and Plas knew Weerden and other members of the Dutch Syndicate. The Crown submits that the relationship between the offender and Watt was one where Watt occupied a secondary role. To the contrary, the offender submitted that I should find that he and Watt were equal participants in the scheme, both having different roles.
	
	
	The Crown referred to evidence that suggested that the offender was Watt's mentor. As noted in the trial the Crown alleged that the offender was the boss of the Australian Syndicate and Watt was the go-between or his worker. The Crown referred to an SMS message left by Watt on the offender's phone (see page 1745 of exhibit Z). In effect it is an acknowledgement by Watt of his role as the offender's fighter who watched out for the offender's back. It is an acknowledgement that demonstrates, submits the Crown, the relationship between the offender and Mr Watt, namely that the offender was the boss and Watt was his assistant. It was further submitted this was a theme that reoccurs over and again in the evidence.   
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the Dutch Syndicate understood this relationship well. There are a number of occasions when the Dutch used terms such as Jerry and Jerry's boss. There was one particular piece of evidence which comes chronologically very early in the piece. The Crown submits it is significant that Weerden discloses the identity of Jerry and also of his boss when speaking to another member of the Dutch Syndicate.
	
	
	Weerden was trying to organise meetings in July. It was to include him, Plas, Von Hohenberg, Jerry and Jerry's boss. It related to a proposed importation into Australia of a product which was the pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	On 23 April 2006 Weerden and Von Hohenberg had a conversation (see page 29 of Volume 1 of exhibit Z which is a transcript of the conversation). It was said at page 30 that Jerry was flying over with his boss. Then at page 35 there was an indication that they are to meet Jerry's boss. Weerden says, ""I want Adam or ah Jerry and Ray to arrive on Monday you know.""
	
	
	The Crown submits this evidence makes it abundantly clear that Weerden knew that Jerry had a Christian name Adam. That must have been a reference to Adam Watt, submits the Crown. And the evidence further makes it plain that Weerden's understanding was that Jerry's boss was Ray. The Crown submits that there was no reasonable doubt that Weerden is speaking about Ray Spadina. It reflects Weerden's understanding that Ray is the boss of the Australian side of the transaction.
	
	
	The offender never attended meetings in Dubai although there is some evidence Watt did attend the meeting in Dubai. I accept that Weerden was speaking of the offender in this conversation and it was his understanding that the offender was Jerry's or Watt's boss.
	
	
	How could Weerden have got that understanding. Weerden was a friend and close associate of Plas. It could be that Plas informed Weerden that Jerry's boss was Ray. Watt was closely associated with Plas so it is also reasonable to assume he was the source of the information provided to Weerden. Of course it may be that Watt was promoting Ray to the position of boss to take some pressure off himself, but if the offender was not the boss of the Australian Syndicate, he had an opportunity to make that clear directly to Weerden when he later met him in Paris. In my view it is clear from the evidence of the meeting in Paris that the offender was acting as the leader of the Australian Syndicate.
	
	
	The video evidence of the meeting in Paris in my view was particularly damning of the offender and pointed directly to his role, namely as the leader of the Australian Syndicate. Moreover, there is nothing in the evidence surrounding that meeting or thereafter that would indicate that Weerden had changed his view as to the roles that were being played by Watt and the offender.
	
	
	In my view the roles played by Watt and Spadina were both independently important. The conspiracy could not have been completed without both being actively involved. Watt had the connections with the Dutch Syndicate. In my view it is likely that it was he who was able to introduce the business to Spadina. However, Watt did not have the connections or expertise to facilitate the importation into Australia. Spadina had that expertise and had the contacts in various different fields to enable the importation to successfully arrive.
	
	
	Spadina was able through his connections to facilitate the arrival of two dummy runs which were designed to test the process of importation.
	
	
	The fact that the final importation of pseudoephedrine did not arrive is essentially outside the control of any of the persons loosely known as the Australian Syndicate. In my view the offender can be seen as the leader of the Australian Syndicate. There is simply nothing in the evidence that detracts from that finding.
	
	
	Having said that, Watt's role in the conspiracy was very significant. He can certainly be seen as the trusted lieutenant.
	


OTHER EVIDENCE WHICH TIED THE OFFENDER TO THE CONSPIRACY


	
	On 24 May 2006 the offender activated a mobile telephone number 0424948519 (the 8519 Daniel Smith number). It was activated by the offender in a false name and a false address because he intended to use it as his contact number for the importation. It was the offender's intention that the 8519 Daniel Smith number would be used as the sole Sydney contact. It was his intention that he, and he alone, would be called on that number once the pseudoephedrine had arrived in Sydney.    
	
	
	The offender used the 8519 Daniel Smith number which is described as ""the other one"" on 8, 9 and 15 July 2006 in calls between himself and Watt. It was also used to make and receive calls from various people who had actually communicated with the offender's usual mobile phone number at various times and/or from his contact list.
	
	
	Between 21 and 22 June 2006 Weerden sent the ""project list"" to Asbeek-Brusse in the Congo via email. It listed the shipments which were to be moved out of the Congo including the Jerry shipment. Weerden also sent Asbeek-Brusse packing lists for the shipments located there including packing lists in the name of Kuwait Petroleum Company to be used for the Jerry shipment.
	
	
	At some time prior to 21 June 2006 the following information was conveyed to Weerden - (a) the 8519 Daniel Smith number for use with respect to importation; (b) the name and contact details for Housewares International (HWI), the address for delivery of the importation, and (c) the name and address of Boris Kokot and Kokot Transport, the proposed transport company for the importation. Kokot was known to the offender as a truck driver through the offender's close friend, Tony Juras. Tony Rossi was a former employee of HWI and a close friend and associate of the offender.
	
	
	The information referred to above was most likely conveyed by the offender to Watt who then communicated it to the Dutch Syndicate on the offender's instructions.
	
	
	On or about 19 June Weerden (using the nom de plume Weinstein) issued an instruction to Katja Mielke (of ITS Limited) to arrange for the shipment of the Jerry shipment. The instruction, described as Project A, contained, inter alia, the information referred to above. The 210 kilograms (being a shipment of 245 kilograms gross weight) referred to in the Project A as “deshyratant” was the Jerry shipment.
	
	
	The Jerry shipment was pseudoephedrine. It came from the same source as the other shipments, two of which were seized in Belgium and tested positive for pseudoephedrine. It was Weerden's intention that the Jerry shipment would be sent from the Congo to Sydney via Brussels through a company Dissaco Airfreight. After the seizure of the two shipments there was a deal of confusion and delay with respect to the Jerry shipment. It became clear the Jerry shipment had not left the Congo.
	
	
	On 25 July 2006 the 8519 Daniel Smith number together with the fax number for the New Development Internet Cafe (an internet cafe frequented by Watt) was found on a document on a flash drive seized from the hotel of Messrs Weerden and Von Hohenberg by the Dubai Police. The flash drive also contained various draft documents addressed to Kokot and Kokot Transport. Those documents also contained the 8519 Daniel Smith number. This evidence clearly linked the offender to the conspiracy.
	
	
	The seizure of the two shipments necessitated a change in plans for the Dutch Syndicate.
	
	
	There were a number of attempts to arrange meetings with the Australian Syndicate including one that was supposed to take place in Thailand. That meeting never took place.
	
	
	The Paris meeting referred to above was preceded by a conversation which occurred on the 25 September 2006 which was intercepted on a listening device that has been installed at 7/128 Old Pittwater Road, Brookvale. Watt made the travel bookings for Paris but ultimately did not travel. The bookings were changed by the offender so as to add a flight to Malta. The booking to Paris was maintained.
	
	
	A truck driver, a close friend of the offender, Chiodo travelled to Paris in place of Watt. The offender had arranged to be in Paris on 10 October 2006. The offender made this clear to the travel agents when he made the bookings. On 10 October 2006 the offender met with Weerden in Paris.
	
	
	The meeting was a meeting between the head of the Australian Syndicate and the head of the Dutch Syndicate. The purpose of the meeting was to progress the conspiracy. Previous to the meeting Weerden had said in a call to another associate, Beekelar, that he was going to meet his ""customer tomorrow"". The offender was the customer to whom Weerden was referring.
	
	
	Plas and Van Hohenberg also attended the meeting in Paris. However, it was Weerden and the offender who broke away from the group, as seen on the video of the meeting, walking ahead and ultimately sitting at a cafe on their own. Frankly this evidence was damning of the offender and clearly indicated his involvement and role of the conspiracy.
	
	
	The conspiracy continued on after the Paris meeting. In early 2007, Watt met with Plas and Weerden in London to arrange for the delivery of the pseudoephedrine. It was during this meeting that Weerden proposed a delivery of a dummy sample of goods (dummy run) to test the method of delivery. This was proposed to see what, if any, attention the importation would attract from the authorities and see whether that method of delivery was in fact secure.
	
	
	There were a number of technical difficulties which had to be addressed for the purpose of facilitating the delivery. Ultimately there was sufficient information available to the Dutch Syndicate to enable the first dummy run to take place.
	
	
	The first dummy run arrived on 28 March 2007. It consisted of cans of coconut milk. They were collected and provided to Rossi, a member of the Australian Syndicate. At the time of the delivery the offender and Watt were conveniently away in Hong Kong.
	
	
	Part of the details for the delivery of the dummy run involved the use of another false number known in the proceedings as the 3283 David Small number.
	
	
	Between 5.15pm and 10.25pm on 7 April 2007 there was a series of exchanges of text messages between the 3283 David Small number and Plas.
	
	
	I accept the Crown established in the trial evidence that made it clear that it was the offender who sent the text messages to Plas. These were particularly damning of the offender. The following text was sent by the offender:
	



	
	Update please... please, put the name of receiver on the goods... the third.
	
	
	Please hear me. This is another. We have done as agreed. It was told and done as said. If you have delay tell us now. No more changes do we accept. Please stick to plan. We have many jobs on hold for this.
	
	
	All clean from 1st.
	
	
	Okay, he will tell you.
	



	
	Okay, I looked, once we know the 2nd position we will inform you. 3rd, must arrive within 14 days from today. Your effort is great. Please tell your friends of our deadline that we have been given. Your friend will be back in four days. All shall have a great reward. Let's remember our goal.
	



	
	The “2nd” was a reference by the offender to the second dummy run. The third, was a reference by the offender to the delivery of the real pseudoephedrine, and the messages showed both the knowledge that the offender possessed of the delivery, and also his frustration with the delays that had taken place.
	
	
	Between 9am on 12 April 2007 and 9am on 13 April 2007 there were further exchanges of texts between the offender using the 3283 David Small number and Plas. I accept that the following texts were also sent by the offender:
	



	
	Please listen. This is me. We meet before. We take it from his hands. We make this clear. We keep away from the 2nd and 3rd, when it comes it gets stored. We don't touch it. We don't touch, it's too dangerous, we don't know if it arrives for two weeks. We have set the plan from your words. Just tell us when it's sent. We cannot confirm the 2nd because we agreed to keep distance with receiver. Safety for all this way. If you have problem tell now.
	
	
	Great time is important. Please keep name on the package for    receiver. You are a good man.
	



	
	Again the offender's reference to the “2nd”was a reference to the second dummy run, and the “3rd” was a reference to the delivery of the real pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	The Crown evidence showed that by 16 April 2007 the 3283 David Small number had been returned by this offender to Watt. On 17 April 2007 there was a ""team meeting"" at the offender's home. The participants were the offender, Watt, and Rossi. The meeting was held in anticipation of the second dummy run arriving. Either during or shortly after that meeting a text was sent most likely by Watt to Plas on the 3283 David Small number. It was as follows: ""We had final meeting today. All now is ready. Please remember to put the personal name of the receiver on the parcel. Good luck friend"".   
	
	
	On 21 April 2007, Watt sent the following text to the offender:
	


""Stop. Think. Who has yours and your teams back more than me. You want to invite hang on cunts to your house. That's your call. Me, I want to kill them. But you do you want. I am your fighter. But pick worthy fight for me. Because drunk fights will put me in gaol. Understand this. Aim for greatness and so some respect to the killers, not the bullshitters"".


	
	As previously noted the Crown submitted that this text described in summary form the nature of the relationship between the offender and Watt in the conspiracy. The offender was the boss, or the team leader, it was Watt's role to look after or out for the offender and the team.
	
	
	On 9 May 2007 the products which made up the second dummy run arrived at HWI. They comprised Indian lollies and other food stuffs. The goods were accompanied by a note from Australian Customs suggesting that duty was payable.
	
	
	Despite some further messages being sent by the Dutch Syndicate to the effect that the shipment was still supposed to be coming, it never did arrive.
	


ARREST


	
	On 28 May 2008 members of the Dutch Syndicate, Von Hohenberg, Van Den Berg and Van Leeuwen were arrested. On 25 September 2008 the offender and Watt were arrested in Sydney.
	


SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCE


	
	The seriousness of the offence can be gauged by the penalty attaching to its commission. Here the maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment. That is the second most serious penalty that can be imposed with respect to any offence under Commonwealth law. The objective seriousness of the offending is to be found by examining the nature of the offence, in terms of its sophistication, the quantity of the product that was intended to be imported, the length over which the offence was committed, the danger that importing such a substance might have had on the community, and the offender's role and motivation for committing the offence.
	


THE NATURE OF THE OFFENCE


	
	Pseudoephedrine is a precursor to the drug methylamphetamine. Methylamphetamine is a serious illicit drug, the use of which is prevalent in the community. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to obtain a very substantial quantity of the precursor drug for the purpose of either manufacturing methylamphetamine, or more likely selling it to someone who would manufacture that drug.
	
	
	The quantity that was supposed to arrive in Australia was 210 kilograms. The commercial quantity for the drug is an amount of 1.2 kilograms of pure pseudoephedrine. Whilst it is not possible to be precise as to the quantity that was intended to be obtained by the offender (as opposed to what was intended to be exported by the Dutch Syndicate) I am satisfied that the offender was aware that the quantity was going to be a very substantial multiple of 1.2 kilograms.
	
	
	Purity of the drug is an issue on sentence. It is accepted by both the Crown and the offender that the purity of the pseudoephedrine could not be found to be greater than 20 per cent. Consequently, I accept that whatever quantity was intended to be imported by the offender, ultimately had it made its way into the country it would only have had a purity of no more than 20 per cent.
	
	
	The fact that the drug did not actually make its way to Australia is also a factor to be taken into account on sentence. Because the drug never was available to manufacture methylamphetamine, it was obviously impossible to distribute that illicit drug into the community. It is the distribution of the drug methylamphetamine that provides the real danger to the public. In this case that danger never eventuated, and consequently it is appropriate to recognise that fact and reduce the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	This case did display a degree of sophisticated planning. It was necessary for this offender to gather around him a crew of other participants with particular skills to allow him to safely import illicit substances into the country. Obviously to enable that to happen he needed to be sure that the persons he used were trustworthy, and would not divulge their activity to others, or to the authorities.
	
	
	I note that the evidence in this case originally arose out of a tip-off from the Netherlands Police to Australian Police. As the evidence shows the Australian Police were investigating the Australian Syndicate from early in 2006 right through until 2008. I commend them for their work and obvious professionalism. Not only did the offender have to recruit his syndicate, he also had to expend significant amounts of money pursuing the purpose. There was some travel involved that had to be paid for. It is also not clear where the $110,000 cash came from to pay for the initial deposit. I have no evidence that would allow me to find that the offender was the source, or at least the sole source of that money. He clearly was aware that the payment had been made.
	
	
	In my view this was a well-organised, criminal syndicate that planned to obtain a very significant quantity of a precursor for the manufacture of a dangerous illicit drug. It was a very serious example of this type of offending. In my view the offender's motive in undertaking the crime was obvious. It was to obtain money or pure profit. He made that clear in his communications with Plas. He could have anticipated receiving at least millions of dollars as recompense for his actions.
	
	
	The fact that the offender's motivation was naked greed is an aggravating factor on sentence. It is not so much the amount of money involved, but the moral decrepitude that such an attitude to the behaviour of offending displays. Having said that, it is not an unusual motivation for this type of offending, and might be seen to be part and parcel of the offence itself.
	
	
	Another factor to be considered is the length of time over which the conspiracy was on foot. Here the period was approximately 21 months. In that time the offender was attempting to act in a clandestine way, using false names to obtain telephone numbers, which could then be utilised as part of the conspiracy. In conjunction with Watt the offender also used false email addresses and other tactics designed to avoid detection. It is both the combination of the use of these techniques and the length of time over which the offences committed that demonstrates the seriousness of the offending.
	


ROLE OF THE OFFENDER


	
	As noted in the facts above I am of the view that the offender can rightly be seen as the leader of the Australian Syndicate. As to his precise role it is revealed in my earlier findings. I will come back to consider whether there are any issues of parity on sentence with respect to Adam Watt.
	


CONCLUSION ON OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING


	
	In my view having regard to the above mentioned factors, the objective seriousness of the offending was high. The only appropriate sentence is one of full-time custody. These are offences that require particular attention being paid to the principle of general deterrence. The sentence must attempt to act as a guide to other potential offenders that if you commit an offence of conspiracy to import a precursor substance then a condign sentence will follow.
	


CHARACTER


	
	The offender has a prior conviction involving his possession of a precursor. On that occasion the precursor was sassafras oil which was apparently a precursor for the manufacture of ecstasy. He pleaded guilty to an offence of being an accessory before the fact to the manufacture of a prohibited drug. The offence occurred in 1994. He was ultimately sentenced to pay a fine of $3,000 and was released on a good behaviour bond for a period of three years. The bond was issued on 4 January 1999 and, therefore, ended on 4 January 2002. It is of some concern that within the period of four years from the end of bond he was again conspiring to involve himself with precursor drugs. His prior criminal record does require attention being paid to specific deterrence in his case. Of course since his arrest in 2008, many years have now passed. He has committed no more drug related offences. His only other recorded offences are driving offences, and one offence of destroying property, and in each case he was fined, and it can be presumed that these were relatively minor offences.
	
	
	The offender's character is not to be judged solely on the basis of his prior offending. There is also before the court a large number of testimonials which speak of the good qualities of the offender, and that he's possessed those qualities and displayed them over a number of years. Accepting the thrust of those testimonials, he is regarded as a very generous person. He has gone out of his way to assist others, sometimes even people who he does not know well. He is regarded as a strong family man. He is married and has two children. His wife stands by him and will continue to do so.
	
	
	The offender's arrest has been difficult for the family. That is not something about which he can of course complain, he is the master of his own destiny in that regard, but the effect of his initial incarceration and then release on bail, has had on the offender and on his family, is something that I am entitled to take into account in considering the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	In my view, given the length of time the proceedings have taken to complete, about which I will have some more to say, the effect on the family is a factor that should mitigate the sentence to be imposed, at least to some extent.
	
	
	Returning to consider the character of the offender, he is described as kind and genuine. He was also described as a knowledgeable businessman, who has assisted in a number of business ventures. It is frankly difficult to reconcile the character descriptions provided in the testimonials with a person who is prepared to act in the manner in which the offender has been found to have acted in this case.
	
	
	As with most people, their characters are not merely black and white, all good or all bad. In my view the offender is a pragmatic person who was deluded by the opportunity to make a quick and substantial profit from the importation and sale of pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	That description is not necessarily inconsistent with him being a generous man who possesses real ability in the business world, and who is also a good father and family man. The question is whether he could be described as a person of good character, and in my view that is not a description that could be applied to him. It requires a certain type of moral debility to want to seek to obtain financial gain by spreading misery to other persons in the community, by being involved in the business of illicit drug production at any level. Based on his criminal history, this must ultimately be regarded as part of his character, and it is essentially for that reason that I find that he is not a person of good character.
	


MITIGATING FACTORS


	
	The offender is a 50 year old man. He is, as earlier noted, married, and has two children, who are still of school age. His wife has written to the Court outlining her assessment of her husband. I have considered her views, in particular with regard to the assessment of the offender's character. As a result of his offending the offender's family has had to move from their permanent home. They were living in a house owned by the offender's brother for some time, but recently that property had to be sold.
	
	
	Undoubtedly all of this is extremely difficult for the offender and his family, although there is nothing particularly unusual about the collateral effects on the family in such circumstances.
	
	
	The offender's wife acknowledged that the offender would by necessity be sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment, but that she would continue to support him.
	
	
	The offender clearly has many positive personality traits. People who know him from the business world have acknowledged that he has ability in that realm. It is indeed unfortunate that he has again allowed a tendency of his, to chase the easy dollar, to take hold rather than applying himself to legal business, which he appears to have some real aptitude for.
	
	
	The offender has spent a lengthy period of pre-sentence custody totalling two years five months and 19 days. After he was granted strict bail on 29 September 2010 he continued on bail until after his conviction. It was agreed between the parties that the date for commencement of sentence should be 16 December 2012 to reflect pre-sentence custody. It is further submitted that some recognition of the lengthy period of strict bail, which included strict reporting conditions and the wearing of an electronic bracelet for some time, be taken into account when setting the sentence. I agree that this is a factor that can be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	It is not the case that the period on bail is equivalent to a period of custody, or quasi custody, the situation that sometimes arises when an offender attends a full-time rehabilitation course. However, some recognition of the period is warranted given the length of the period on bail, and the strictness of the conditions, I will mitigate the sentence to some extent on this basis.
	
	
	The offender by his plea of not guilty is not entitled to a finding that he is contrite for his actions. Given his willingness to enter into this conspiracy within years of having served a period on a good behaviour bond for a similar offence, it is now extremely difficult to find that the offender has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	


HEALTH OF THE OFFENDER


	
	The offender has a history of heart conditions that resulted in a myocardial infarction in March 2004. He underwent surgery around that date, which appears to be successful. However, it was also recommended that he receive the insertion of a pacemaker.
	
	
	After his conviction I permitted him to remain on bail, and he had the pacemaker inserted on 1 April this year. That also appears to be a successful operation.
	
	
	He has been treated by a Dr Mathur, cardiologist, and a report was requested from him but unfortunately it has not been provided.
	
	
	In substitution for that report, at least to some extent, a report was provided by Dr Dylan Wynne, who is a consultant cardiologist. Dr Wynne qualified his report on the basis that he had not seen the offender for a number of months. He opined that if the insertion of the pacemaker was successful, and he had no reason to doubt that it was not, then he did not expect any particular complications with the pacemaker.
	
	
	Dr Wynne did comment that pacemakers require a regular checkup. This should certainly be undertaken whilst the offender is in custody. Dr Wynne said that the offender had complained about chest discomfort, but it was ""of no acute concern clinically"". If the offender suffers palpitations, or breathlessness whilst in custody, then he would require conventional cardiovascular follow-up.
	
	
	Dr Wynne's report should be provided to Justice Health to aid with any problems that the offender may have in custody in the future. It is submitted that the offender's medical conditions are likely to make his stay in custody more difficult for him. It does not appear that he is presently suffering any medical conditions that inhibit his activities in custody.
	
	
	I accept that, given his recent health treatments, he will understandably be concerned about his long-term health, and that might be a concern that is not shared by other prisoners. This is a factor that I will bear in mind on sentence, although in my view it is a matter of marginal significance when setting an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The offender also saw a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Farrar. Dr Farrar has provided a report to the Court. The report outlines the offender's background. I have taken that history into account on sentence.
	
	
	Dr Farrar diagnosed the offender as suffering from a major depressive disorder as well as generalised anxiety disorder. Dr Farrar recommended treatment in the form of pharmacological treatment with an antidepressant. She also recommended psychological treatment, although the doctor noted that this type of treatment is not readily available in custody.
	
	
	In my view Dr Farrar's diagnosis is of some significance on sentence. The diagnosis does not relate to, or form part of the facts of the offence itself. It appears that his depression and anxiety has arisen after being charged with this very serious offence. Despite that, the condition, if it remains untreated, will make his stay in custody markedly more difficult for him. The symptoms cause the offender clinically significant impairment in social functioning, and have led him to not wishing to participate in exercise which would otherwise aid his anxiety, and could be important to maintain his coronary health.
	
	
	It is a factor that I will have regard on sentence, and it will result in a reduced sentence on the basis the offender does not represent an appropriate person about whom to apply, at least at full value, the principles of general deterrence.
	


DELAY


	
	The Crown submitted that it accepts that there has been some relevant delay in the prosecution of this case, and which can be taken into account on sentence; see paragraph 73 of the Crown submissions. In terms of determining the period of delay, it is not an easy matter. The case has a very long history, and there are a number of decisions in earlier proceedings that could be considered. The offender was charged in 2008, and only finally found guilty in 2015. The Crown has outlined the principles which it submits ought to be taken into account when considering a submission that delay is relevant on the sentence. I note those submissions, and the authorities referred to; see Crown submissions on sentence, paragraph 67 to 71.
	
	
	In my view the offender can only have a period of delay taken into account on sentence as a mitigating factor if such a period can be found to be outside what might otherwise be regarded as a reasonable one for the conduct of the particular case brought against the offender, and for which he is not responsible. It is in this sense that I use the term 'relevant delay'.
	
	
	The offender has submitted that there is a period of unexplained delay between when the offence was detected and when the offender was charged. I disagree with that submission. It is clear from the circumstances of the offence that the police were still monitoring the behaviour of the offender and his syndicate. The police were obviously liaising with their Dutch counterparts. Once the Dutch Syndicate was charged, there was little relevant delay in charging the offender and Watt. I would reject this period as involving a relevant period of delay.
	
	
	The offender submitted that there was a lack of disclosure made by the Crown of certain intercepted material which was said to be critical to the offender's defence. That failure to disclose has allegedly led to delay in the proceedings.
	
	
	I accept that a considerable degree of leniency should be permitted to the offender in investigating the defence case in a matter such as this. The offender had to employ an expert to establish that there were some missing phone calls and transcripts. Having done so, those items had to be sought from the prosecution.
	
	
	Part of the problem with disclosure was the nature of the offence. It was an international conspiracy, covering a number of countries. At paragraphs 57 to 63 of Justice Price's judgment in R v Spadina [2013] NSWSC 4 there is identified a series of documents and transcripts summaries that were apparently unavailable to the defence which should have been provided. His Honour did not suggest that the Crown had failed to disclose the material, however, his Honour did note that Detective Aston's efforts to identify what he thought was relevant material was far removed from what the defence thought was relevant. Justice Price essentially agreed that the material sought by the defence should be provided. This decision was made after an application was made to stay the proceedings. His Honour granted a vacation of the trial at that time, and also a temporary stay of the proceedings.
	
	
	In my view this does involve a period of relevant delay. None of the delay can be laid at the feet of the offender, and he is entitled in my view to recognition of this delay on sentence.
	
	
	The judgment of Justice Price was provided on January 2013. The trial of the offender commenced in September 2014. It is not unreasonable to find that there was a period of at least a year of relevant delay which occurred resulting from this judgment.
	
	
	However, that is not the only alleged delay. It is clear that the offender ran out of funds to continue his defence at some point. As a result he was unable to brief counsel, and this resulted in a delay of some length. Ultimately this was resolved by Justice Hamill recommending to the Legal Aid Commission that legal aid be provided to the offender. That recommendation was made on 28 May 2014. The recommendation was accepted and, thereafter, the offender was represented.
	
	
	It is not necessarily easy to identify the length of delay which might have resulted from the offender's initial failure to obtain legal aid. The offender filed an affidavit in the case heard by Justice Hamill which indicated that he did have, at least initially, significant assets. It is unsurprising in the circumstances that he was refused legal aid. However, that situation changed over time as outlined in his affidavit. I cannot now judge the truthfulness of his account in that regard but accept that in December 2012 the offender made a second application, but that application was again refused. At that stage the affidavit revealed that the offender was still working, and in receipt of income.
	
	
	I cannot second-guess the decision made by the Legal Aid Commission to again refuse the offender's application for aid at that point. As indicated in the affidavit in July 2013 the offender lost his job, and at that point was no longer able to raise funds for legal costs. Consequently he made a third application for legal aid, which was again refused.
	
	
	The offender accepted in his affidavit that he made some errors in his application for legal aid but asserted that they are relatively minor and that he had been truthful in his applications.
	
	
	Given the amount of money that the offender had expended on legal fees in the preparation of his case as disclosed in the affidavit and that he seemed to have had very substantial financial support from friends and acquaintances, it is quite possible that the Legal Aid Commission was sceptical as to whether the offender had properly disclosed his assets.
	
	
	In any case the whole issue was resolved by Justice Hamill who recommended the grant of legal aid. In my view there was no actual delay thereafter.
	
	
	It is frankly impossible for me to judge, at this distance, whether the decisions made by Legal Aid Commission were reasonable or not. It is clear that the offender had not provided completely accurate information to the Commission and in my view he cannot now complain about the delay in the proceedings based on the failure of the government to pay for that defence.
	
	
	I accept that there was a delay but that in my view it should be viewed at best as a neutral factor.
	
	
	Returning then to consider the delay in proceedings that I have found, the question is what relevance that should have on sentence.
	
	
	I accept that the delay would have caused the offender some additional anxiety. The delay would undoubtedly have caused financial distress for the offender who was, up until quite recently, funding his own defence.
	
	
	It is also likely to have caused some further psychological distress for him.
	
	
	It also meant that he had to continue on strict bail conditions for a long period - in my view it is worthy of some recognition and additional leniency on sentence.
	


PARITY


	
	It has been fairly faintly submitted that some recognition should be undertaken on sentence here of the penalty that was imposed on Adam Watt.
	
	
	In my view no issue of parity of sentence arises in this case. Watt was not convicted of an offence. He was dealt with by way of a special hearing that resulted after Watt was seriously injured in gaol. He was assaulted by being hit on the head by an implement leaving him with serious brain injuries.
	
	
	Any penalty applied in such a case cannot be seen as a guide to the sentence to be applied in this case. In my view Mr Spadina could feel no justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the penalty applied to Watt.
	
	
	I have taken into account the penalty that was applied to Watt. I am of the view that it does not affect the sentence to be applied in this case.
	


WILLINGNESS TO FACILITATE JUSTICE


	
	It has been recognised that an offender's willingness to facilitate justice by cooperating with the Crown so as to shorten the proceedings is something that can be taken into account on sentence. See Damoun v R [2015] NSWCCA 109 at paragraph 51
	
	
	In this case I observed during the proceedings that the defence was willing on a number of occasions to make real concessions that substantially shortened the proceedings and resulted in the Crown not needing to call a large number of witnesses, some of whom would have been required to attend from overseas.
	
	
	Pragmatically this must have saved considerable Crown funds. In my view his cooperation is worthy of recognition on sentence and I propose to give a discount on sentence which I will set as five percent from the sentence that might otherwise be set.
	


THE LENGTH OF SENTENCE BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF MITIGATING FACTORS REFERRED TO ABOVE


	
	In this regard there have been a number of decisions provided by the Commonwealth DPP. I have read and taken note of those decisions. I have also had regard to the statistics provided from the Judicial Commission. I note in that regard that sentences ranged in length between 18 years and four years as head sentences. I can discount the sentence of 18 years - the sentence provided to offender Standen. He was a member of the Crime Commission when he committed the offence. His standing at that time and consequent breach of trust was so extreme that his offence can be seen to be significantly different to the offence committed by this offender. It was also objectively more serious. Moreover he was found to be guilty of other offences at the same time including supply prohibited drugs which led to an even lengthier sentence.
	
	
	In my view the case of Standen does not provide any accurate guide to the length of sentence to be provided in this case.
	
	
	In my view having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, the statistics to which I referred and the other cases that I have read that were provided by the Crown a sentence of 12 years imprisonment could have been applied in relation to this offence.
	
	
	Given the matters that I identified in mitigation of sentence I am of the view that the period of 12 years can be reduced to a period of ten years and six months imprisonment.
	


SECTION 16A OF THE CRIMES ACT


	
	In as much as I have not referred in detail to section 16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and the factors outlined therein I have taken those matters into account in sentence.
	


SENTENCE


	
	Mr Spadina you are convicted of the offence of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, you are sentenced to a total term of ten years six months imprisonment to be made up of a non-parole period of six years and six months.
	
	
	The non-parole period will commence on 16 December 2012 and end on 15 June 2019.
	
	
	I recommend your release to parole on that day. There will be a period of four years on parole. The sentence will be completed on 15 June 2023.
	
	
	On parole you are to accept the supervision of Community Corrections New South Wales. Such supervision should be provided at the discretion of that Service. The supervision can also be terminated at the discretion of the Service.
	
	
	Just so you are clear with the dates, the total term ten and a half. Starts when you first went into custody which we backdated to 16 December 2012. That was the agreed date when everyone was here.
	
	
	So, I then set a non-parole period, that is the period you have to spend in custody of six years and six months.

2767082,Velez v R (Cth) [2015] NSWCCA 177,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The applicant (and co-offenders Temisi Haniteli Telefoni and Viliami Tauataina Faingata’a) stood trial before Frearson SC DCJ in the District Court between 26 September 2011 and 12 December 2011. The jury was empanelled on 4 October 2011 and retired to consider its verdicts on 8 December, returning verdicts of guilty on 12 December 2011.


	
	The indictment contained a single count against each accused:
	


“Between about 31 December 2008 and 2 December 2010 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere conspired with each other, Jorge Elicier Henao Palacio and divers others to import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity being a commercial quantity.”


	
	The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $825,000 (7,500 penalty units).
	
	
	A fourth co-offender (Jorge Elicier Henao Palacio) was tried separately before Woods QC DCJ and a jury in 2013 on the conspiracy count, as well as two actual importation of cocaine counts. He was found guilty of all three offences.
	
	
	Judge Frearson heard the sentence proceedings concerning the applicant and the co-offenders Telefoni and Faingata’a on 9 March and 23 March 2012. On 27 April 2012 his Honour imposed the following sentences:
	


Velez (applicant) - imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years and 10 months with a balance of term of 7 years and 2 months.

Faingata’a – imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years and 11 months with a balance of term of 7 years and 2 months.

Telefoni – imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years with a balance of term of 7 years and 2 months.


	
	The applicant originally sought leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds
	


Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in law in concluding that there was no significant reason to distinguish between the applicant and the other offenders, Faingata’a and Telefoni, in terms of criminality.

Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred at law in the consideration of the lack of convictions of the applicant in the formulation of the sentences imposed upon Telefoni, Faingata’a and himself.

Ground 3 – The sentencing judge erred at law in the imposition of identical head sentences upon the applicant and co-offender, Temisi Telefoni, when the latter had been involved in the conspiracy for over one year longer than the applicant.

Ground 4 – The sentencing judge erred at law in his consideration of the subjective case of the applicant when imposing a similar sentence as imposed on the other two offenders.


	
	At the hearing of the appeal, Grounds 1 and 3 were abandoned. The applicant relied upon Grounds 2 and 4 as constituting a single ground of appeal.
	


Factual background


	
	The following is a brief overview of the Crown case. The relevant events occurred in 2009 and 2010, although most of the evidence concerned events in 2010.
	
	
	The conspirators comprised people from two ethnic groups – Colombians and Tongans, who were located in Australia, Tonga and Colombia or other parts of South America. Most of the evidence in the trial was focused on the actions of “the Australian Colombians” (the applicant, Henao Palacio and Lopez Rios) and “the Australian Tongans” (Telefoni and Faingata’a).
	
	
	The Crown case was that the syndicate (Colombians and Tongans) had imported into Australia a large quantity (many kgs) of cocaine in about December 2009, or early 2010. That cocaine had been shipped from South America into Tonga and then into Australia. The arrival and distribution of this cocaine had not been detected by police at that time.
	
	
	Some of this cocaine shipment (known in the trial as “the leftover”) remained in Tonga and it was the intention of the conspirators to import this “leftover” into Australia at a later time.
	
	
	During 2010 the Colombians and the Tongans were engaged in negotiations and discussions aimed at achieving three main objectives:
	



	
	Bringing the “leftover” cocaine into Australia from Tonga.
	
	
	Settling a dispute over money which the Colombians believed was owed for a quantity (4 – 6 kgs) of cocaine that had gone “missing” from the first import.
	
	
	Making plans for a future large shipment of cocaine (about 500 kgs) to be imported into Australia via Tonga.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	At trial Telefoni gave evidence but the applicant and Faingata’a did not. Neither the applicant nor the co-offenders gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. Based on the evidence at trial, it was necessary for his Honour to determine the “scope” of the conspiracy. His Honour identified his task as follows:
	


“The scope of the conspiracy has to be gleaned ultimately from the combination of all of the circumstances relied upon and put into evidence, and particularly the communications set out in exhibits 4A and 4B and the emails in exhibit 30, which are particularly instructive. I am satisfied consistently with the jury verdict, that each offender engaged in coded and guarded conversations about cocaine.” (ROS 2.8)


	
	Having reviewed the principal pieces of evidence, his Honour set out his conclusions as follows:
	


“I do make certain conclusions on the totality of the evidence and I conclude beyond reasonable doubt, a number of things. One is that pursuant to the agreement, an agreement which at all times involved Colombians and Tongans, including the offenders, four to six kilograms was imported into Australia by March 2010. ... I am prepared to sentence on the basis that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it was at least four. That cocaine I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt was in fact sold by Mr Faingataa in conjunction with Mr Telefoni and not accounted for to the Colombians.

Two, that pursuant to the agreement arrangements were made to extract the leftover from Tonga and those arrangements involved the Colombians and the Tongans and all the offenders. The only reasonable inference from the evidence is that whatever the quantity left in Tonga it involved tens of kilograms of cocaine. … my conclusion is that the amount left in Tonga was in the order of at least forty kilograms.

Three, pursuant to the agreement that involved the Colombians and the Tongans and the three offenders, arrangements were made to import 500 kilograms of cocaine from South America into Australia via Tonga. I conclude that all the offenders were parties to a genuine agreement in relation to the 500 kilograms.” (ROS 5-6.2)


	
	His Honour made further findings as follows:
	


“I do accept the manner of execution reveals a lack of sophistication in many areas. In many areas the participants were inept, inefficient, sometimes uncooperative, and sometimes they did not communicate with any real efficiency. This is a case where inefficiency does not actually substantially undermine the gravity of this offence because the gravity primarily depends upon the nature of the agreement rather than the manner of execution. But having said that I do take into account the manner of execution because clearly the more sophisticated the venture is the more grave the offence would be, because the level of sophistication in my view would enhance the gravity.” (ROS 10.1)


	
	Submissions were made by both the Crown and the applicant as to the part which he played in the conspiracy. His Honour set out his conclusions as follows:
	


“The conclusion I come to is this, I do accept that in one sense Mr Velez was a conduit between the two groups. He passed on information and any instructions and that was on the material identified by the Crown satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he played a very important role in the conspiracy. He was more than a mere conduit. He had a vital role in the conspiracy for the reasons identified by the Crown. He was privy to important information and actively engaged in the important aspects of the conspiracy. He was more than a replaceable middleman in my view. I do accept that on the isolation aspect that he has no family in Australia and that that will make imprisonment more onerous for one reason or another.” (ROS 13.6)

“It is sufficient for me to say that in terms of Mr Velez, he was a conduit between the Colombians and the Tongans via Mr Telefoni. He did communicate the green light, he was involved in securing the sponsorship letter for Mr Gomez, he was involved directly in organising the big one, he was involved in draft dropping and he had proposed to fly to Colombia to facilitate the importation. There is no evidence that he reaped any financial reward for his efforts, but clearly he must have anticipated a reward and I do accept that he did the matters that the Crown refers to in paras 62 to 74 of his submissions.” (ROS 20.5)

“All the offenders had a significant role and I accept ultimately that there is no significant reason to distinguish between them in terms of criminality.

As to financial gain, financial gain is inherent in this type of offence. The communications demonstrate the generation of amounts of money and the enterprise did generate money. There is no direct evidence in respect of Mr Velez, in particular, that he reaped any rewards. I accept the gravity of this offence is primarily determined by the nature of the agreement and the nature and seriousness of the actual enterprise. The failure to achieve the objective and to reap large financial rewards does not of itself significantly ameliorate the gravity of the offence. As I have said already, the manner of execution bears upon the degree of sophistication and it will bear upon the assessment of the gravity of the offence in a more general sense.” (ROS 21.5)


	
	His Honour made further findings as to the scope of the conspiracy as follows:
	


“What is necessary to do is actually to look at the combination of the evidence. All sorts of arguments can be extrapolated from various parts of the material but one needs to look at the combination of the evidence and the combination establishes the scope of the conspiracy. It is not necessary that the conspirators had any direct contact with each other. The agreement to import at all times involved Colombians and Tongans. It did encompass the four to six kilograms, the leftover in Tonga and the 500 kilograms. I am satisfied of those matters beyond reasonable doubt.” (ROS 20.1)


	
	His Honour made findings as to the applicant’s subjective case. Unlike his co-offenders, the applicant had no convictions whatsoever and his Honour took that into account in his favour, although his Honour accepted that in this type of offence the fact of good character was less significant in terms of mitigation than otherwise.
	
	
	In support of the applicant’s case on sentence, his Honour had before him a report, dated 23 March 2012, from a psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro. His Honour made the following observations in relation to the contents of that report:
	


“It is instructive because of his presentation as a cooperative though highly anxious man. He has never used any illicit drugs and he has had a longstanding involvement with sport as a soccer coach. The report goes on to detail an interesting social history. He was born in Colombia in 1959. …

He came to Australia in 1995 because of poor job opportunities. He is an

Australian citizen. In Australia he studied English, and his English is apparently good. He took up cleaning jobs to survive and he did have a coaching position with the Mt Pritchard Soccer Club in 1999, but he went on to work in, essentially, cleaning and security. …

The report goes on to deal with the drug, alcohol and psychological history. Mr Velez describes himself as a social drinker. He has acknowledged longstanding symptoms of depression and anxiety which predate him being charged. He has had considerable adjustment issues referable to his decision to leave Colombia, the breakdown of his first de facto relationship and the breakdown of his second relationship has in fact, reinforced his sense of isolation and despair.

He has had a difficult time in custody. He has not been able to access treatment programs in Long Bay and he does feel isolated to the extent that he has no immediate family here and limited visitors. He presents as someone who is clearly depressed and anxious. It said that he acknowledges an adjustment disorder upon his immigration to Australia, and he has a continuing sense of failure and depression. Those feelings have become entrenched.

There is nothing in the report that actually diminishes the gravity of the offence, and there is nothing in the report that is explanatory of why someone like Mr Velez would get involved in this type of conduct.

None of the offenders has shown any remorse; none of the offenders has accepted any responsibility. In each case, nevertheless, I can see that each of them has fair prospects of rehabilitation, and I consider that each is unlikely to re-offend in this way.” (ROS 23.5 – 25.2)


	
	His Honour set out his conclusion as to the objective seriousness of the offending as follows:
	


“Whilst it is true that the gravity may be enhanced by the objectives and

the quantities that it was proposed to import into Australia, I do accept that the quantity is not decisive to criminality, but it does remain a significantly relevant consideration. The quantities involved here, once you include the 500 kilograms, were enormous.

I am mindful of the role of each of the offenders, I am mindful of the

degree of organisation, the number of persons who were involved in the

agreement, the number of countries that were involved and mindful of the

actual roles played by each of the offenders in giving effect to the conspiracy.” (ROS 25.9 – 26.3)

Grounds of Appeal 2 and 4


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to give any significant weight to his subjective case. The applicant submitted that as between his co-offenders and himself, the applicant was the only one to have a subjective case of any substance. He had no criminal record, he had a depressive condition which pre-dated the offending and which was making his time in prison more difficult. His incarceration was made more difficult because he was isolated from family and friends who still lived in Colombia. The applicant submitted that since the sentencing judge had found that his criminality and that of his co-offenders was the same, it was clear that an inadequate allowance had been made for his subjective case in the sentence finally imposed (1 – 2 months).
	
	
	In making that submission, the applicant was mindful that a lack of previous convictions was of less importance in drug importation matters than in other offences.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that while the sentencing judge may not have made any distinction between the applicant’s subjective case and that of his co-offenders, this did not necessarily amount to error. It submitted that the weight to be given to an offender’s subjective case was not a matter of arithmetic, but of discretion. It submitted that his Honour had in fact adjusted the applicant’s sentence downwards in his favour, albeit in a modest way.
	
	
	The Crown referred the Court to the following observation by Davies J (with whom R A Hulme and Adamson JJ agreed) in Lam v R [2014] NSWCCA 50:
	


“41   In considering the issue of parity two things are important. The first is that it was the same judge who sentenced both offenders and he expressly made reference to the issue of parity between the Applicant and the co-offender. He concluded:

Given the differences between the offender and Mr Pan, both in a favourable and in an unfavourable sense to this offender, I determine the sentences to be imposed on the offender with only limited regard to the sentences imposed on Mr Pan.

42   It has been said in many cases that this Court will be cautious before determining that one co-offender has a justifiable sense of grievance because of different sentencing outcomes where the same judge has sentenced each and has had regard to the differing criminality and the different subjective circumstances of each: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71] per Barr and Howie JJ. The various authorities are gathered in Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215 at [91]- [96].”

Consideration


	
	The statement of principle in R v Lam is undoubtedly correct but it does not answer the applicant’s submission. While the sentencing judge had some regard to the different subjective circumstances of each offender, a differentiation of 1 – 2 months in favour of the applicant in circumstances where his co-offenders had no helpful subjective case, and where the criminality of the three was assessed as being the same, was so disproportionate as to be indicative of the error referred to in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505:
	


“It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.”


	
	While the applicant’s subjective case could not properly be characterised as strong, there were important considerations in it which needed to be taken into account and which were absent from the cases put forward on behalf of his co-offenders, i.e. he was aged 53 and had no criminal record and his time in prison would be more difficult because of his depression and sense of isolation.
	
	
	Since the sentencing judge’s discretion miscarried in this way, it is the duty of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factual findings which his Honour made and which have not been challenged in this appeal. As was said in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; 88 ALJR 947:
	


“42   … A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. …

43   After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law.”


	
	In the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion and taking into account the findings made by the sentencing judge, the sentence I would impose is imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years and a balance of term of 7 years. Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Application for leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on the applicant in the District Court on 27 April 2012 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years, commencing 2 December 2010 and expiring 1 December 2020, with a balance of term of 7 years expiring 1 December 2027. The applicant will be eligible for release on 1 December 2020.

2767084,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Armstrong [2015] NSWSC 873,"Judgment


	
	By Summons filed 25 September 2014 the Director of Public Prosecutions applies to have this Court set aside orders made on 26 June 2014 by Magistrate WG Pierce sitting at Burwood Local Court. On that date the Magistrate re-opened an earlier proceeding of 3 November 2009 in which he had sentenced the First Defendant, Ms Armstrong, for driving while disqualified on 10 August 2009. The Second Defendant to the Summons, the Local Court, has taken no active part in these proceedings. I will therefore refer to Ms Armstrong simply as “the Defendant”.
	
	
	The case concerns the operation of a statutory provision for automatic disqualification from holding a driver licence, consequent upon conviction for driving whilst subject to an existing disqualification: s 25A, Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (NSW). This Act was repealed with effect from 1 July 2013. It has continued to apply to offences committed whilst it was in force: cl 6, Sch 4, Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW). The current equivalent provision is s 54 of the Road Transport Act which employs language identical to that of s 25A in many respects.
	
	
	The issue upon which the Summons will be determined is whether, for two convictions of drive while disqualified which occurred less than a month apart, the two year automatic disqualification periods imposed by s 25A, one for each offence, are cumulative or concurrent.
	
	
	A chronology of the Defendant’s relevant offences and convictions is set out in the table below. The description of the outcome of sentence proceedings is abbreviated and will be expanded as necessary later in these reasons. The events are established from a proforma record of court orders completed by the Magistrate and dated 3 November 2009, from JusticeLink entries for the outcome of proceedings on that date and from two Traffic Record Reports extracted from the database of the Roads and Traffic Authority (Ex A and Ex 1).

	As at each of the dates of the offences with which the present proceedings are concerned (that is, 15 July and 10 August 2009), s 25A of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act provided as follows (omitting irrelevant parts and with emphasis added):
	


“25A Offences committed by disqualified drivers or drivers whose licences are suspended or cancelled

(1) A person who is disqualified by or under any Act from holding or obtaining a driver licence must not:

(a) drive a motor vehicle on a road or road related area during the period of disqualification, or

(b) …

Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence).

…

(7) If a person is convicted by a court of an offence under subsection (1), (2), (3) (a) or (3A), the person:

(a) is disqualified by the conviction (and without any specific order) for the relevant disqualification period from the date of expiration of the existing disqualification or suspension or from the date of such conviction, whichever is the later, from holding a driver licence, and

(b) may also be disqualified, for such additional period as the court may order, from holding a driver licence.

Note. Section 26 of the Road Transport (General) Act 1999 provides for the effect of a disqualification (whether or not by order of a court).

(8) The disqualification referred to in subsection (7) is in addition to any penalty imposed for the offence.

…

(10) In this section, the relevant disqualification period is:

(a) in the case of a first offence under subsection (1), (2) or (3) (a)—12 months, or

(a1) in the case of a first offence under subsection (3A)—3 months, or

(c) in the case of a second or subsequent offence under subsection (1), (2), (3)(a) or (3A)—2 years.

….”


	
	The Local Court record shows that on 3 November 2009 the Defendant’s two offences against s 25A(1)(a) (Events Nos 5 and 6 in the chronology) were dealt with as follows:
	


“[Serial number for offence of 15 July 2009] – drive while disqualified from holding a licence.

No Plea entered.

The Court disqualified the offender BRIDGET SHARLEENA ARMSTRONG from holding a driver’s/rider’s licence for 2 years from 15 August 2011 to 14 August 2013.

The Court quashed the Habitual Traffic Offender Declaration against the offender.

The offender, BRIDGET SHARLEENA ARMSTRONG is convicted and is directed to enter into a good behaviour bond for 2 years pursuant to Section 9(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 to commence on 3 November 2009 and accept the following conditions: The offender must be of good behaviour and appear before the Court during the bond term if required.

[Serial Number for offence of 10 August 2009] – drive while disqualified from holding a licence.

A plea of guilty is accepted. …

The Court disqualified the offender BRIDGET ARMSTRONG from holding a driver’s/rider’s licence for two years from 5 August 2013 to 4 August 2015 [sic – by comparison with Magistrate’s signed proforma order, clearly an error which should read ‘15 August 2013 to 14 August 2015’].

The Court quashed the Habitual Traffic Offender Declaration against the offender. ALL HOD quashed.

The offender, BRIDGET ARMSTRONG is convicted and is directed to enter into a good behaviour bond for 2 years pursuant to s 9(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 to commence on 3 November 2009 and accept the following conditions: The offender must be of good behaviour and appear before the Court during the bond term if required.”


	
	On the hearing of the Summons there has not been brought up into this Court or tendered any record of the Local Court which would show the legal basis upon which the Magistrate considered that it was open to him to make the two disqualification orders quoted above. There is no record of the Magistrate’s reasons for deciding that the orders were appropriate to the circumstances. Neither party has adduced evidence of any other kind to establish what were the Magistrate’s reasons for ordering the two cumulative disqualification periods.
	
	
	There has been tendered a transcript of the Defendant’s application to the Magistrate to re-open the sentence proceedings, heard on 26 June 2014. From that it is clear that the Magistrate, understandably, had no recollection in June 2014 of the matter before him on 3 November 2009 or of the manner in which he had then disposed of the case or of his reasons.
	
	
	On 3 November 2009, the effect of the Magistrate convicting the Defendant of the earlier of the two offences dealt with that day (driving while disqualified on 15 July 2009) was that by s 25A(7)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act she was automatically “disqualified by the conviction (and without any special order)” for a period of two years “from the date of expiration of the existing disqualification”. The further words of subs (7)(a), “or from the date of such conviction, whichever is later”, may be ignored throughout these reasons because on any view the expiration of the existing disqualification was the later event. The automatic disqualification period was two years by force of subs (10)(c) because this was a “second or subsequent offence” against s 25A(1)(a) – as explained below.
	
	
	It is necessary to interpret what period of disqualification is referred to in subs (7)(a) as “the existing disqualification” for a case such as the present where the sub-section is engaged by reason of conviction for an offence against subs (1)(a). It seems clear that in its setting in s 25A(7) “the existing disqualification” refers to the disqualification which was in force when the offence of driving while disqualified was committed and which constituted an element of the offence. That is, “the period of disqualification” referred to in subs (1)(a).
	
	
	This follows primarily from the use of the definite article and from the fact that the expression is in the singular. Subsection (7)(a) contemplates that whenever it is engaged by the conviction of a person under subs (1)(a), there will be one and only one identifiable disqualification period which answers the description “the existing disqualification”. The only such singular period which would always be identifiable in relation to every engagement of subs (7)(a) upon conviction under subs (1)(a) would be the period of disqualification which constituted an element of the offence.
	
	
	The disqualification to which the Defendant was subject when the offence of 15 July 2009 was committed was a combination of three years from 15 August 2007 to 14 August 2010 plus a further twelve months from 14 August 2010 to 15 August 2011. The second component had taken effect from 14 July 2009 (Event No 4 in the chronology) by operation of s 25A(7)(a) and s (10)(a) upon the Defendant’s conviction for the offence of 14 April 2009 (Event No 3). These two consecutive periods had both been imposed before commission of the offence of 15 July 2009. Together they constituted “the period of disqualification” referred to in subs (1)(a) and “the existing disqualification” referred to in subs (7)(a), with respect to that offence.
	
	
	It follows that upon the Defendant’s conviction for the first of her offences dealt with on 3 November 2009 her automatic disqualification was for a further two years, from 15 August 2011 to 14 August 2013. The Magistrate’s order for disqualification for that period was unnecessary: R v Sirocic [2000] NSWCCA 325 at [14], [15] and [21]; Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Papadopoulos [2010] NSWSC 33; (2010) 77 NSWLR 189 at [84]. The making of the order did not displace or alter the operation of the statute; the order was simply redundant. Confusion would be avoided if the Local Court were to refrain from making orders for disqualification which duplicate the effect of sections such as this. An alternative course would be to enter upon the Local Court record a note that automatic disqualification by statute has taken effect, including reference to the period and to the section under which this has occurred.
	
	
	The second of the Defendant’s offences dealt with on 3 November 2009, driving while disqualified at Belmore on 10 August 2009, was also a “second or subsequent offence” within the meaning of s 25A(10)(c) – at least because the Defendant had been convicted on 14 July 2009 under s 25A(1). It is not necessary to consider whether her conviction for the first of the two offences dealt with on 3 November 2009 (that of 15 July 2009) was separated temporally from the conviction for the 10 August 2009 offence so as to provide an additional basis for treating the latter as a “subsequent offence”. The Defendant’s conviction of the offence of 10 August 2009 also attracted automatic disqualification under subs (7)(a), for two years from “the date of expiration of the existing disqualification”.
	
	
	“The existing disqualification” relevant to the offence of 10 August 2009 was the same as that for the earlier offence of 15 July 2009. That is because in the interval between 15 July 2009 and 10 August 2009 no further conviction had been recorded against the Defendant and thus there had been no occasion for any additional disqualification to be imposed, either by operation of statute or by order. Consequently, “the date of expiration of the existing disqualification”, which would be the commencement date for the two year statutory disqualification under subs (7)(a), was the same for the two offences: 15 August 2011. The statute therefore gave rise to two concurrent automatic two year disqualifications.
	
	
	The Director has submitted that s 25A(7) “does not contemplate concurrent disqualifications”. It is true that the sub-section does not expressly refer to or recognise that its engagement may give rise to concurrence. But as “the existing disqualification” is the period which was in force at the time of the offence it follows that should two or more offences be committed during that period and before any extension of it has arisen pursuant to a further conviction (either by order or by operation of the statute) then each of those two or more offences would attract an automatic disqualification period under sub (7)(a) which would commence from a common date. They would commence from the expiry of a single existing disqualification period common to each of the two or more offences.
	
	
	On the facts of this case, the automatic disqualification for the later of the two offences dealt with on 3 November 2009 would only be cumulative upon that for the earlier offence if “the expiry of the existing disqualification” for the purposes of the second offence should be taken to be the end of the additional automatic period attracted by the first conviction, recorded the same day. That would require that “the existing disqualification period” be interpreted to mean whatever period existed and was in force at the time of the second conviction, rather than that which was in force when the second offence was committed. The language of s 25A does not support such an interpretation. It is a result that would require quite different phraseology, such as that of s 219(6) of the Road Transport Act:
	


“The period of any disqualification under this Division does not commence until all other disqualifications, and all other periods of licence cancellation or suspension, imposed on the person by or under this or any other Act have been completed.”


	
	The Director further submitted that the “clear underlying policy” of s 25A is “to ensure that a person is automatically disqualified from driving for the relevant disqualification period for each conviction of driving while disqualified”. I am not able to discern a policy intention that periods of automatic statutory disqualification which may be imposed in consequence of two or more such offences in breach of a disqualification period common to both of them should necessarily be cumulative rather than concurrent. I find in the wording of the section itself and in its setting in the Act no basis for inferring a policy at that level of detail with respect to the operation of s 25A.
	
	
	The predecessor of s 25A, Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act was s 7A of the Motor Traffic Act 1909 (NSW). Section 7A was introduced by an Amending Act of 1951 and employed language similar to that of s 25A of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act. Subsection (2) of s 7A created an offence constituted by a person “disqualified for holding or obtaining a driver’s licence” driving a motor vehicle on a public street “during the period of disqualification”. Subsection (3) prescribed an automatic statutory disqualification upon conviction for that offence, “for a period of six months from the date of expiration of the existing disqualification…or from the date of such conviction, whichever is the later”. Emphasis has been added in the above quotations.
	
	
	Section 7A of the Motor Traffic Act 1909 was amended in 1998 by (amongst other things) the addition of subs (2)(b) which defined the meaning of “a second or subsequent offence” and subs (3A) which increased “the relevant disqualification period” to twelve months for a first offence and two years for a second or subsequent offence of driving while disqualified. The Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act with which the present case is concerned substantially re-enacted s 7A of the Motor Traffic Act, 1909 as s 25A.
	
	
	If any Second Reading Speech could be of assistance in relation to the history of the expression “the existing disqualification” in subs (7)(a) of s 25A, it would likely be a speech concerning the introduction of s 7A into the Motor Traffic Act 1909, by the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Act 1951 (NSW). The wording which I am required to interpret has not relevantly changed since then, either in s 7A or its successor. I do not see in the Second Reading Speech for the Bill by which s 7A was introduced anything which throws light upon the meaning of the expression as it appeared in s 7A or as it appears in the current section. In Hansard of 4 December 1951, p 4740, the Second Reading Speech of Mr Sheahan includes the following:
	


“Therefore, the bill provides for insertion in the Motor Traffic Act of a new section to the effect that where a person is disqualified from holding a licence… and while such disqualification…is in force he drives a motor vehicle… he shall be liable to imprisonment [etc] and the period of any existing disqualification…will be extended by six months or such additional period as the court may order” (emphasis added and irrelevant words omitted).”


	
	Mr Sheahan’s employment of the expression “any existing disqualification”, which is inconsistent with the expression “the existing disqualification” enacted by Parliament, does not indicate that consideration was given by the speaker to how the amended s 7A would operate if two or more offences of driving while disqualified should be committed, each on a separate date, during an interval throughout which a period of disqualification remained in force and was not extended.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that I should consider an Explanatory Note and a Second Reading Speech associated with the amendment to s 7A which was introduced in 1998 (as referred to in [20] above). There is nothing in those materials, either, to contradict or to support the interpretation which I have adopted. That is unsurprising as the important phrase which defined the commencement of the statutory disqualification (namely, “expiration of the existing disqualification”) was left unchanged by the 1998 amendment.
	
	
	The conclusion that “the existing disqualification” refers to that which was extant at the date of the offence does not lead to absurdity or inconvenience or frustration of the operation of s 25A, so as to suggest that this could not be what Parliament intended. This is illustrated by the present case, where the same disqualification period was in force at the dates of multiple offences. Although each of the two year automatic disqualification periods imposed by subs 7(a) ran concurrently, it was open to the Magistrate to order an additional period of disqualification under subs 7(b) if he considered that the circumstances warranted this course. Subsection (7)(b) provides that a person convicted of an offence under s 25A(1) “may also be disqualified, for such additional period as the court may order, from holding a driver licence”.
	
	
	When one takes into account the automatic operation of subs (7)(a) and the orders which the Magistrate made on 3 November 2009, the effect with respect to disqualification flowing from the proceedings that day was as follows:
	



	
	for the offence committed 15 July 2009, automatic disqualification from 15 August 2011 to 14 August 2013 (the redundant order to the same effect may be ignored) and
	
	
	for the offence committed 10 August 2009, automatic statutory disqualification from 15 August 2011 to 14 August 2013 and an order disqualifying the Defendant for an additional period of two years from 15 August 2013 (that is, following expiry of the statutory disqualification) up to 14 August 2015.
	



	
	The Defendant’s application to the Magistrate to re-open the sentence for her offence of 10 August 2009 was brought under s 43, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Relevantly, that section is in the following terms:
	


“s 43(1) This section applies to criminal proceedings (including proceedings on appeal) in which a court has:

(a) imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or

(b) failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law,

and so applies whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence in those proceedings.

(2) The court may reopen the proceedings (either on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings) and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard:

(a) may impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and

(b) if necessary, may amend any relevant conviction or order.”


	
	On the hearing of her application the Defendant’s solicitor submitted that in the Magistrate’s orders of 3 November 2009 his Honour “ran the disqualifications consecutively … whereas I say they should run concurrently. … you’ve dated … one of them, which we will call the first, from the end of that existing [disqualification period] and then you’ve done the second from the end of that new one”.
	
	
	The Magistrate, clearly without recollection of the proceedings of 3 November 2009, said: “I must have just looked at it wrongly, I think, because I don’t do that”. Having ascertained that the Prosecutor who was present in Court on 26 June 2014 did not wish to be heard on the Defendant’s application, the Magistrate without further consideration and giving no reasons amended his order of 3 November 2009. The effect of the amendment was that the period of disqualification he had ordered for the offence committed 10 August 2009 would commence 15 August 2011 instead of 15 August 2013.
	
	
	Section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act did not confer upon the Magistrate power to amend in this respect because the original order was not “contrary to law” within the meaning of the section. In the sentence proceedings of 3 November 2009 the Magistrate had been empowered by s 25A(7)(b) to make his order for two years disqualification dating from 15 August 2013.
	
	
	In this Court the Defendant’s counsel argued for the interpretation of subs (7)(a) which I have adopted and for resultant concurrency of the automatic disqualification periods attracted by the two offences respectively, both commencing 15 August 2011. He submitted that when the Magistrate originally made his disqualification order for the 10 August 2009 offence, for two years from 15 August 2013, he must have intended to do no more than defer commencement of the period which was automatically imposed by subs (7)(a) for that offence. It was submitted that deferral of commencement of the statutory period was “contrary to law” and that the Magistrate had properly corrected this in the proceedings before him under s 43, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act on 26 June 2014.
	
	
	Even if, on 3 November 2009, the Magistrate intended only to give effect to the automatic two year disqualification which the statute imposed for the second offence and thought that he was required or had power to defer commencement of that disqualification until expiry of the two year period which was automatically attracted by conviction for the 15 July 2009 offence on the same day, those misconceptions would not have rendered the order for two years disqualification dating from 15 August 2013 “contrary to law”. As it happens, there is no Court record or other foundation upon which to attribute these subjective intentions to the Magistrate.
	
	
	In Achurch v R [2014] HCA 10; (2014) 88 ALJR 490 four Justices joined in holding that s 43 “does not authorise the re-opening of proceedings in which a sentence open at law was reached by a process involving error of law”: at [4]. This decision established that in order for the jurisdiction under s 43 to be enlivened what must be shown is that the result or outcome was “contrary to law”, not the findings or reasoning which led to it.
	
	
	At [32] their Honours said:
	


“[32] Section 43 confers upon courts exercising jurisdiction in criminal proceedings a power to re-open those proceedings and to impose a penalty that is in accordance with law. The section only applies to criminal proceedings in which one of two conditions is fulfilled. The condition directly relevant to this appeal is that ‘a court has…imposed a penalty that is contrary to law’. On the ordinary meaning of that collocation, what must be contrary to law is the ‘penalty’. That condition is not satisfied merely by demonstrating that the court has erred in law or fact. Notwithstanding such error, the penalty imposed may not be contrary to law. It may fall within the range of penalties permitted or required by the relevant statutory provisions and may also be consistent with the reasonable exercise of a discretion applicable to the particular offence and offender… A penalty which lies outside the range of penalties that could have been imposed in a reasonable exercise of discretion is not, thereby, contrary to law in the sense required by s.43, not least because reconsideration of such would involve an evaluative exercise which must be dealt with by way of appeal.”


	
	The Magistrate’s original order for two years disqualification from 15 August 2013 was a penalty open under subs (7)(b) of s 25A as an “additional period” to the automatic two years (which ran from 11 August 2011). If the Magistrate made this order in the mistaken belief that it would merely duplicate the automatic effect of the statute, that would not have rendered his order “contrary to law” as those words have been explained in Achurch v R (supra). If on 3 November 2009 the Magistrate had been actuated by such an erroneous understanding, the result could only have been challenged by way of appeal, not under s 43.
	
	
	The Defendant’s counsel cited Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v O’Sullivan [2011] NSWSC 1258 as authority for the proposition that a Magistrate has no power to order that a disqualification period should commence at a date earlier than or later than the date of conviction. On that basis he said the Magistrate’s order for two years disqualification commencing 15 August 2013 was “contrary to law”.
	
	
	However O’Sullivan’s Case (supra) was concerned with provisions quite different from subs (7)(a) of s 25A. With respect to a speeding offence in that case, r 10-2, subr (3)(b) of the NSW Road Rules 2008 provided that a driver is:
	


“(b) disqualified from holding a driver’s licence by a conviction for the offence (and without any specific order) for 6 months from holding a driver licence or, if the court on the conviction thinks fit to order a different period of disqualification determined in accordance with sub-rule (4) is disqualified for the period specified in the order.”

Sub-rule (9) provided:

“(9) A period of disqualification imposed by or under this rule commences on the date of conviction for the offence to which it relates.”


	
	At [15]-[17] James J noted that the automatic period of disqualification under r 10-2 was required to commence on the date of conviction. Although the Court was given power to lengthen or shorten the period it was not given power to order that it commence on any date other than that of conviction. His Honour noted that subr (9) expressly excluded any such power.
	
	
	This is an entirely different regime from that under subs (7) of s 25A. In that subsection, because automatic statutory disqualification under par (a) runs from the date of conviction, any “additional period” under par (b) necessarily must be ordered to commence from the expiration of the automatic period.
	
	
	Also in O’Sullivan’s Case (supra) the Court considered provisions relating to disqualification for driving with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol: s 9(4) of the Road Transport Safety and Traffic Management Act 1999 (NSW) and s 188, Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW). Paragraph (d) of s 188(2) of the latter Act provided as follows:
	


“(d) where the conviction is for any other offence:

(i)   the person is automatically disqualified for a period of 3 years from holding a driver licence, or

(ii)   if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 12 months) or longer period of disqualification – the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order.”


	
	At [27] James J held that, as with r 10-2, the automatic period of disqualification under s 188(2)(d) must commence from the date of conviction. Rothman J had reached the same conclusion in Hei Hei v R [2009] NSWCCA 87.
	
	
	Again it can be seen that the regime of s 188(2)(d) is materially different from that of s 25A(7) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act; the latter permits an order for an “additional period” which, inherently, must commence from a deferred date, being the end of the automatic disqualification.
	
	
	The Magistrate erred on 26 June 2014 in re-opening the sentence proceedings of 3 November 2009. Section 43(2), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act had no application to the circumstances brought before him by the Defendant because his disqualification order of 3 November 2009 for two years from 15 August 2013 was supportable by subs (7)(b) and not contrary to law.
	
	
	In the result the Director succeeds on the Summons. Although the Director sought his costs I will not order that they be paid by the Defendant, having regard to the Prosecutor’s failure to raise any objection to the Defendant’s application when it was heard by the Magistrate on 26 June 2014. I accept that the construction and operation of s 25A requires careful analysis and consideration. The Prosecutor who appeared that day may not have been in a position to argue the matter with the care that might have prevented the Magistrate falling into error. It may be said that the Defendant invited the Magistrate to make what I have concluded was an erroneous decision. However the Prosecution must bear a degree of responsibility for having acquiesced in the Defendant’s application in the Local Court.
	
	
	The Summons may be viewed as, in substance, an appeal pursuant to s 56(1)(a), Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), against a sentence imposed by the Local Court. The powers of this Court on such an appeal include setting aside and varying the sentence: s 59. The relevant sentence is that of 26 June 2014, imposed by the Magistrate’s order of that date in lieu of his order of 3 November 2009. Subsection (5) of s 43, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that for the purposes of an appeal against a penalty imposed in exercise of a power conferred by s 43, the time for lodging an appeal commences on the date when the s 43 power is exercised.
	
	
	The Director alternatively invoked the power of this Court under s 69, Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). The Magistrate’s order of 26 June 2014 involved an error of law that appears on the face of the record of the proceedings, within the meaning of s 69(3). It was a jurisdictional error, well within that concept as expounded in Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 176-178 and in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [71]-[73].
	
	
	The conclusions expressed in these reasons can be given effect, under either head of the power of this Court, by setting aside the Magistrate’s order of 26 June 2014. The original sentence of 3 November 2009 will thereby be reinstated and the disqualification, by order of the Local Court, for the 10 August 2009 offence will run for two years from 15 August 2013.
	
	
	The evidence does not reveal whether the Defendant has held a driver licence since the Magistrate made his order of 26 June 2014. From that date until the giving of this decision the Defendant has not been subject to the original disqualification order, the end date of which was 14 August 2015, whereas she should have been. The Court has not been asked by the Director to make any order for disqualification extending beyond 14 August 2015 by way of adjustment.
	
	
	The only order of the Court is therefore as follows:
	



	
	The order made by the Local Court of New South Wales sitting at Burwood on 26 June 2014 in proceeding “2009/00184179-001/actual offence – drive while disqualified from holding a licence”, being the order “sentence disqualification commencement date corrected so that disqualification commences on 15 August 2011”, is set aside.

2767088,R v Stoupe [2015] NSWCCA 175,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: This is a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to an aggregate sentence imposed upon the Respondent, Nikki Bjorn Stoupe, by his Honour Judge Craigie SC at the Parramatta District Court on 28 November 2014 for a number of sexual offences committed against an eight-year old girl.
	


The Offences and Aggregate Sentence


	
	The Respondent pleaded guilty to the following charges:
	



	
	an offence of aggravated filming of a person engaged in a private act contrary to s.91K(3) Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	three counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of eight years.
	



	
	On 28 November 2014, the sentencing Judge imposed an aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of eight months to commence on 28 November 2014 and to expire on 27 July 2015, with a balance of term of eight months commencing on 28 July 2015 and expiring on 27 March 2016.
	
	
	The indicative sentences with respect to each of the four counts were as follows:
	



	
	Count 1 - the s.91K(3) offence - imprisonment for six months;
	
	
	Count 2 - the first offence under s.61M(2) - imprisonment for one year;
	
	
	Count 3 - the second offence under s.61M(2) - imprisonment for one year;
	
	
	Count 4 - the third offence under s.61M(2) - imprisonment for one year and three months.
	



	
	A Notice of Appeal, signed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions on 19 January 2015, was filed and served upon the Respondent that same day.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. What follows is drawn from that statement.
	
	
	The Respondent (then aged 27 years) was employed as a child care worker by Cubby House Child Care, an organisation which provided before-and-after school care at Oakhill Drive Public School, Castle Hill. He had been so employed for six years and was the supervisor from 16 July 2012 until 29 October 2012.
	
	
	At relevant times, there were usually between 20 to 30 children at the Centre and two to three staff, depending upon the number of children booked in that day. The children were all school age children from Kindergarten to Sixth Class.
	
	
	The before-and-after school care at Oakhill Drive Public School operated out of a demountable classroom separate from the school building, but within the school grounds. The classroom was a single room with a storeroom at one end and a food preparation area at the other end. Access to the storeroom was not granted by the primary school until 16 July 2012, when the school provided a key to the supervisor only.
	
	
	The Respondent would normally sit at the supervisor’s desk, which had a 1200 mm high partition on one side obstructing the view of anyone sitting at this desk area. As supervisor, the Respondent was also in charge of other staff members.
	


Count 2 - Aggravated Indecent Assault on 23 July 2012


	
	On 23 July 2012, the Respondent was the supervisor during the after-school period. “Kate” (not her correct name), aged eight years, was in his care and under his authority. “Kate” played with her friends until they left to go home.
	
	
	After her friends had departed, “Kate” went over to the Respondent to talk with him. He picked her up and put her on his lap, then put his hands under her school uniform and underpants and rubbed her on the outside of her vagina and anus and the surrounding area. He then removed his hands from underneath her clothing, lifted her off his lap and put her down.
	
	
	“Kate” was collected that afternoon by her mother. On the way home, “Kate” told her mother that the Respondent had touched her inappropriately. Her mother told her not to sit on the Respondent’s lap, and texted a friend as to what “Kate” had told her. The mother made an entry in her diary about the incident.
	
	
	“Kate’s” mother did not speak with the Respondent, or any other staff at the after-school care as to what “Kate” had told her, nor did she report it to the authorities.
	


Count 3 - Aggravated Indecent Assault on 10 October 2012


	
	On 10 October 2012, the Respondent was the supervisor during the after-school period and “Kate” was in his care and under his authority. She walked over to the supervisor’s desk and spoke with the Respondent, who picked her up and sat her on his lap. The Respondent put his hands under her school uniform and her underpants and rubbed her buttocks and the outside of her anus.
	
	
	A parent who came to collect her two children that afternoon saw “Kate” sitting on the Respondent’s lap when she approached the supervisor’s desk. She thought he looked surprised. “Kate” was sitting with her back against the Respondent. Her eyes were wide open and she was not smiling.
	
	
	That parent collected her two children and, as she was leaving, spoke to a staff member, Marcella D’Souza, saying that she thought it was inappropriate that a child was sitting on the Respondent’s lap.
	
	
	When Ms D’Souza came inside, she saw “Kate” lying on a couch with a towel on her forehead. “Kate” was collected that afternoon by her mother, who also saw “Kate” lying on the couch with a container near her which looked to contain vomit.
	
	
	The Respondent said that “Kate” had been unwell and that he thought it was a migraine. “Kate’s” mother took her home and again “Kate” told her that the Respondent had touched her inappropriately. The mother made another diary note.
	
	
	On 11 October 2012, “Kate” and her mother attended an appointment with a paediatrician. This appointment was made on referral by “Kate’s” general practitioner in relation to “bed wetting and migraine”. The mother spoke with the paediatrician privately, whilst “Kate” was in the waiting room, and told him that “Kate” had told her about the Respondent touching her inappropriately. The paediatrician then spoke with “Kate”, who told him that the Respondent had been touching her under her underpants. The paediatrician wrote a letter to the general practitioner that included the disclosure by “Kate”, but he did not report the matter to authorities.
	
	
	On 12 October 2012, Ms D’Souza spoke to the Respondent about the concerns that had been earlier expressed by the parent who had seen “Kate” on the Respondent’s lap. The Respondent admitted that he sat “Kate” on his lap, but said she was unwell and he knew her mother.
	


Count 4 - Aggravated Indecent Assault on 26 October 2012


	
	At about 4.00 pm on 26 October 2012, the Respondent took a spray bottle and napkins and told Ms D’Souza that he was going to clean in the storeroom. The Respondent would routinely get equipment out of the storeroom, but Ms D’Souza had never seen him with cleaning spray before.
	
	
	The Respondent, as supervisor, was the only member of staff with a key to the storeroom and children were not permitted inside. The storeroom door was open and the Respondent walked inside.
	
	
	A work-experience placement, Nathan Dallas, saw “Kate” enter the storeroom whilst the Respondent was inside.
	
	
	The Respondent shut the door to the storeroom and told “Kate” to kneel in front of a plastic chair and to place her hands on the seat. He knelt down behind her and slowly pulled down her sports shorts and underpants to around her knees, before rubbing her bottom and between her buttocks with both hands. “Kate” stated that she needed to go to the toilet. The Respondent let her leave the room and she went to the toilet.
	
	
	At 4.30 pm, “Kate’s” father collected her from after-school care. “Kate” parents are divorced. When “Kate” got to her father’s house, she called her mother and informed her that the Respondent had touched her bottom again. The mother came to the house and “Kate” told her in detail what the Respondent had done to her.
	
	
	On 29 October 2012, “Kate’s” mother reported the matter to the Principal of Oakhill Drive Public School, who reported the matter to the Director of Cubby House Child Care Centre who, in turn, reported it to the Department of Family and Community Services and the Police.
	
	
	On 1 November 2012, “Kate” was interviewed by Police and she disclosed that the Respondent had touched her inappropriately underneath her clothing on the genitals and the surrounding area.
	
	
	At 9.30 am on 13 November 2012, the Respondent was arrested in relation to this matter and was taken to the Castle Hill Police Station where he declined to participate in an interview after receiving legal advice. He provided a DNA sample by way of a buccal swab. Police seized the Respondent’s mobile phone and he was charged.
	


Count 1 - Aggravated Filming of a Person in a Private Act Between 4 - 6 April 2012


	
	Police examined the Respondent’s mobile phone and discovered a video file that contained video footage of “Kate” sitting on the toilet. The time/date stamp on the file showed it was recorded at 4.23 pm on 5 April 2012.
	
	
	The footage showed the Respondent walking into the female toilets at Oakhill Drive Public School. He then held the camera over the top of the toilet door and filmed inside the cubicle. “Kate” was sitting on the toilet with her dress pulled up and her underwear pulled down. It was clear that “Kate” was unaware that she was being filmed.
	
	
	As “Kate” finished going to the toilet, the Respondent walked out of the toilets and the recording ended.
	


Entry of Pleas of Guilty in Local Court


	
	Following his arrest and charging on 13 November 2012, the Respondent was refused bail and remained in custody until his release on conditional bail on 22 November 2012.
	
	
	After a period of time between November 2012 and March 2014, during which the Respondent indicated that the charges against him were to be defended, he entered a plea of guilty to the present charges based on the above facts in the Parramatta Local Court on 17 March 2014.
	


The Respondent’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Respondent was aged 27 years at the time of the offences and 29 years at the date of sentence. He had no prior criminal history.
	
	
	The Respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing as did the Reverend Dr Peter Powell, a psychologist who conducts the Pastoral Counselling Institute.
	
	
	A presentence report of Ms Vivienne Weir dated 15 August 2014 was tendered together with a report of Mr Neil Ballardie, psychologist, dated 19 July 2014 and a report of the Reverend Dr Powell dated 25 October 2014.
	
	
	The presentence report described the Respondent’s childhood and family situation as turbulent. He completed Year 11 at school and, after leaving high school, had been employed in a number of different jobs. The Respondent commenced working in childcare in 2006, continuing in that capacity for the six-year period until the present charges led to the cessation of his employment in October 2012. Since that time, the Respondent had been working for a company supplying food products to a major supermarket chain.
	
	
	At the time of the presentence report, the Respondent had participated in 10 private psychological counselling sessions, in addition to commencing an intensive three-year sex offender program to address his offending behaviour.
	
	
	Mr Ballardie recorded that the Respondent had real difficulties in establishing appropriate relationships with girls due to difficulties he had faced throughout his formative years and during his schooling. The Respondent told Mr Ballardie that he believed that he was encouraging an emotional relationship with the victim, which he conceded was highly inappropriate, and that led him to offend.
	
	
	Mr Ballardie considered the Respondent to be emotionally naïve and underdeveloped. He had poor self-esteem and persisting negative ideations. He felt isolated and self-conscious in situations where he may engage with potential peer sexual partners, which was compounded by the Respondent’s excessive weight. Mr Ballardie considered that the Respondent’s dysfunctional relationship with his parents, and other aspects of his upbringing, impacted on him emotionally during a critical age of development. Mr Ballardie considered that the Respondent’s explanation of engaging in an emotional relationship with the victim was partly explained by his general lack of emotional and sexual engagement and attachment to his female peers.
	
	
	In his first report, Mr Ballardie said that the Respondent had, in February 2014, scored in the extreme range for stress and depression and in the high range of anxiety. He had some suicidal ideation, but Mr Ballardie did not consider that he was a high risk of danger to himself.
	
	
	In a further report dated 22 October 2014, Mr Ballardie noted that the Respondent no longer had suicidal ideation.
	
	
	Mr Ballardie noted the Respondent’s continuation in a sex-offender’s treatment program and expressed the view that the Respondent was genuine in his remorse and was highly unlikely to reoffend. Similar conclusions were expressed in the report and evidence of the Reverend Dr Powell.
	
	
	In his evidence, the Respondent said that he had had a problem with his weight since he was 10 years old. He said that he suffered from haemochromatosis, which is a surplus of iron in the blood, which caused fatigue. He also suffered from chronic asthma.
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing Judge commenced his remarks on sentence with references to the charges, maximum penalties and applicable standard non-parole periods.
	
	
	His Honour described the offence giving rise to Count 1 and then said (ROS3/AB8):
	


“Although this was of itself an undoubtedly disgraceful act, the filming offence was of a markedly lesser order of criminality than the succeeding offences. However, it preceded a course of conduct against the victim in which there is an identifiable escalation in criminality particularly in the fact that the offending continued even after some, as it appears, at least inappropriate aspects of his behaviour towards the victim had come under notice. Although he was subject to a warning he persisted in what was in fact serious criminal conduct.”


	
	The sentencing Judge referred to the Respondent’s evidence that, at the time of this offence, he had visited the toilets to check on “Kate’s” welfare. His Honour said (ROS4/AB9):
	


“However, in the course of his evidence the offender admitted that such an explanation included a degree of self-deception, as he now concedes that his motive in going to the toilet block was that he wanted to see the victim, as he put it, ‘in a vulnerable act’.

There is certainly no rational explanation nor a decent one at all for filming the victim. It was an act that constituted a gross interference with the little girl's privacy and dignity and it was committed by a person entrusted with her care.”


	
	The sentencing Judge recited the facts surrounding the three aggravated indecent assault offences and the subsequent reporting of the offences to the authorities. His Honour accepted that the Respondent was in a state of despair following his arrest and charging and loss of employment, and that he had suicidal thoughts and was admitted to a psychiatric unit at Hornsby Hospital for one week.
	
	
	It was noted that, although there had been delay between November 2012 and March 2014, the Crown had conceded that the Respondent’s pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest opportunity in the circumstances (ROS9/AB14).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge found that the offences revealed “aspects of some escalation in the acts following the commencement of impropriety towards the victim with the initial filming incident, an incident that typified, one must observe, a certain brazenness” (ROS9/AB14).
	
	
	His Honour turned to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences (ROS9-10/AB14-15):
	


“As to the first of the offences I would have regarded it, if assessed in isolation, as an act of unpleasant voyeurism probably at the lower end of the scale, however what followed in the commission of aggravated indecent assaults was much more serious.

The first indecent aggravated offence might have been the point at which the offender, having been frightened by the disaster he knew plainly that he was courting, might have desisted; he did not desist, in fact no doubt tempted or comforted by the fact that he knew [the victim’s] mother and that she had not taken the matter further he was not deterred.

The next offence was on the occasion when [the victim] was also rendered even more vulnerable by her own unwell state, of which the offender was well aware. Finally, there is the last offence which in particular is marked by the offender's persistence in what he knew had at least been perceived by others as inappropriate contact with the child. In fact, that perception was a mild one compared with the reality of what had been happening, which in each instance was a plainly criminal act of interference committed upon a vulnerable child.

The offender, after having almost been caught in the act as it were in the second of the aggravated sexual assaults, proceeded even further persisting.

This renders his awareness arising from the warning in particular as an aggravating circumstance. As a consequence, I regard it as appropriate to treat the last offence as the culmination of individual acts that amounted to a course of escalating offending. As such, I assess the last offence as being above the mid-level of seriousness and forming part of a body of offending which in totality reaches a point constituting a grave breach of trust. As to that trust, one aspect is that placed in those who are specifically given the professional care of a child. That trust is in addition to the basic obligation of decency and care owed by any adult towards any child in their care. Any offending of the present kind is harmful, both for the individual child and to society, where it is now an essential part of its working that there is an ability to place trust upon those who are given the responsibility of being professional carers or teachers, particularly of very young and vulnerable children.”


	
	“Kate” had made a victim impact statement, which she read personally by way of audio-visual link at the sentencing hearing. His Honour referred to this statement (ROS11/AB16):
	


“I have in the present instance taken due account of the victim impact statement that was read by the victim by the way of an AVL transmission. Although it was apparent that the statement was a prepared one and the victim read it with some commendable calm I might say, I also accept and acknowledge that she has suffered a good deal of distress and has, as the content of her statement indicated, had her confidence and trust in adults badly shaken. 

I note that in the course of her statement she recorded a complaint of having had migraines and other physical problems. Those matters I approach with some care. I do not regard it as appropriate to sheet home those matters to the offender as harm of an additional kind over and above the level of harm that is inherent in any offending that entails the betrayal of trust by a carer or teacher, particularly one known very well to the child concerned. The harm of that kind is of a more than sufficient evil.”


	
	The sentencing Judge outlined the Respondent’s subjective circumstances, including references to the various reports before the court on sentence. His Honour dealt with the Respondent’s explanation for the offences in the following way (ROS16/AB21):
	


“The explanation for the current offending as given by the offender is one I infer to have arisen from the development of an inappropriate emotional relationship with the victim. The particular offences, as explained by the offender himself, are depicted as incidents that arose without any planning or particular intent to engage in sexual behaviours. The offender told Mr Ballardie that he believes that he was encouraging an emotional relationship with the victim which was in fact highly inappropriate and that led him to offending. I also infer from the history of the offending as given to Mr Ballardie that there is a strong suggestion that initially at least it was a hunger for affection and physical contact rather than any sexual motivation that promoted the offender's otherwise inexplicable risk taking in the present offences, at least when he picked the child up. That was something that was of itself inappropriate in the circumstances, even if it went no further.”


	
	With respect to the Respondent’s prior good character, his Honour said (ROS17/AB22):
	


“It is appropriate that I note and give weight to the fact that the offender has no prior contact with the criminal justice system. Similarly, that he is a person of prior good character. Having said that, those factors of good character are often present in matters of the present kind. Consequently their overall impact is not as great as it might be in the instance of other kinds of offending.”


	
	His Honour stated that he was “mindful of acute tension between the offender’s strong and significant subjective case and the other matters that are to be considered” (ROS18/AB23). His Honour referred to the importance of specific and general deterrence in cases of this type and the need to “be vigilant to dispel any notion that the presentation of a strong, even compelling, personal case might result in a sentence that does not reflect the objective seriousness and result in a sentence less than the bare minimum required to meet that seriousness’ (ROS19/AB24).
	
	
	His Honour continued (ROS19/AB24):
	


“Offences of the present kind, and I refer particularly to the aggravated sexual assaults, are relatively easy to commit. There also needs to be a powerful sense of assurance in the community that people who are given the care of young children should be fully aware of the risk they run if they breach the trust placed in them. Any sentence imposed in respect of these offences must include a clear message directed to people tempted to offend in this way.”


	
	The sentencing Judge proceeded to explain that a sentence of full-time imprisonment was the only appropriate sentencing alternative in this case (ROS19-20/AB24-25).
	
	
	His Honour determined to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence, with a finding of special circumstances to be made (ROS20/AB25):
	


“In the circumstances of this offender and given his particular level of vulnerability, I find that it will add a measure of extra hardship to his imprisonment and I have taken that into account. I have determined that the appropriate mode of sentencing will be by way of an aggregate sentence. That sentence will reflect a finding of special circumstances that is made on the basis of some implicit accumulation that will be part of the aggregate sentence and also by reason of my view that the offender will require a longer period of supervision than would be the case if the normal ratio of 75% between the non-parole period and overall sentence was to be maintained.”


	
	The indicative sentences referred to earlier (at [5]) were then stated, followed by the imposition of the aggregate sentence involving a non-parole period of eight months and a balance of term of eight months.
	


The Crown’s Ground of Appeal


	
	The Crown relied upon a single ground of appeal particularised in the following way - the aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period are each manifestly inadequate in that:
	



	
	they are plainly unjust, being so far below the range of sentences that could justly be imposed;
	
	
	the sentencing Judge erred in law by failing to give effect to his stated intention to apply the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, in that the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour does not reflect the total criminality of the Respondent, and does not reflect any or any appropriate degree of accumulation for multiple offences which escalated in objective seriousness over a period of seven months.
	


Claim of Manifest Inadequacy


	
	The propositions contained within the ground of appeal may be considered at the same time.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown did not contend that there was express error in the remarks on sentence, but rather that the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, being an entirely inadequate response to the findings made by the sentencing Judge and on the application of relevant principles.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the findings of the sentencing Judge indicated a strong need for personal deterrence and the protection of the community, which was then not reflected in the aggregate sentence imposed.
	
	
	Further, it was submitted that the aggregate sentence imposed only slightly exceeded the indicative sentence on Count 4, so that the conclusion ought be reached that there was in reality no degree of accumulation for the earlier serious offences.
	
	
	Having determined upon an aggregate sentence which the Crown says was flawed in this way, his Honour then proceeded to make a finding of special circumstances thereby reducing the non-parole period to 50% of the head sentence of 16 months.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the process involved led to a clearly inadequate aggregate sentence for the Respondent’s objectively serious crimes.
	


The Respondent’s Submissions


	
	Ms Burgess, counsel for the Respondent, submitted that the sentencing Judge did not err either in the approach to the determination of sentences or in the consideration of factors relevant to sentence.
	
	
	It was submitted that the sentencing exercise lay within the discretion of the sentencing Judge and that the Respondent’s strong subjective case was taken into account, but in a way which still left the Respondent serving a period of full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Respondent that the sentence imposed was not manifestly inadequate.
	


Determination


	
	An appeal to this Court with respect to an aggregate sentence is directed to that sentence, and not the indicative sentences relating to each offence: Truong v R [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [227]; JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [40] (paragraph 11).
	
	
	It is for the Crown to demonstrate that the aggregate sentence imposed in this case was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].
	
	
	The gist of the Crown appeal is that there is a substantial disconnect between the findings made in the remarks on sentence and the aggregate sentence actually imposed. To test this proposition, it is appropriate to refer to a number of features of the case.
	
	
	Count 1 was an offence under s.91K(3) Crimes Act 1900. Section 91K(3) and (4) provide as follows:
	


“91K Filming a person engaged in private act

…

(3)    Aggravated offence

A person who, for the purpose of obtaining, or enabling another person to obtain, sexual arousal or sexual gratification, films another person who is engaged in a private act:

(a) without the consent of the person being filmed to being filmed for that purpose, and

(b) knowing that the person being filmed does not consent to being filmed for that purpose, and

(c) in circumstances of aggravation,

   is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 5 years.

(4)    In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which:

(a)    the person whom the offender filmed was a child under the age of 16 years, or

(b)    the offender constructed or adapted the fabric of any building for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the offence.”


	
	Section 91I(2) provides that a person is “engaged in a private act” if:
	


“(a)    the person is in a state of undress, using the toilet, showering or bathing, engaged in a sexual act of a kind not ordinarily done in public, or engaged in any other like activity, and

(b)    the circumstances are such that a reasonable person would reasonably expect to be afforded privacy.”


	
	Offences now contained in s.91K were introduced by the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008. In the second reading speech with respect to that legislation, the Attorney General, Mr Hatzistergos, said concerning offences under s.91K (Hansard, Legislative Council, 26 November 2008):
	


“The bill also introduces new voyeurism offences. The new offences provide for a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for observing or filming, for the purposes of obtaining sexual arousal or gratification, a person who is engaged in a private act. A ‘private act’ includes a situation in which a person is undressing - for example, in a changing room - or using a toilet, showering or bathing, or during a sexual act, and in circumstances when he or she would reasonably have expected to be afforded privacy. The aggravated version of the offence provides a maximum five-year penalty when the person being observed or filmed is under the age 16, or if the offender altered the fabric of the building in order to observe the person. This covers situations in which an offender may have constructed a peephole in order to observe someone in a changing room or a toilet.

The bill further creates a new offence of filming a person's private parts, which criminalises the filming of a person's private parts in circumstances when he or she can reasonably expect not to be filmed. This captures such behaviours known as upskirting, which involves filming up a person's skirt for the purposes of obtaining sexual arousal or gratification. However, it will also cover situations in which a person's private parts are filmed when the person is engaged in a usually private act, but not necessarily in a private place, such as a public urinal. This surreptitious filming of people without their consent has become prevalent with the emergence of new technologies that allow anyone with a mobile phone to film another person without that person's consent, in inappropriate circumstances. It is important to send a clear message that such behaviour is not acceptable and will be taken very seriously by the courts.”


	
	It may be seen that the offence in Count 1 is serious in itself, but that a number of features serve to further aggravate it. Firstly, “Kate” was eight years old, being half the age limit of 16 years contained in s.91K(4)(a) which rendered this offence an aggravated one. Secondly, the offence was committed by a childcare worker, inside the female toilet at the childcare premises, in circumstances where he was entrusted with the care and protection of the child who was filmed. On its own, this was a serious example of an aggravated offence under s.91K(3) of the Act.
	
	
	The observation of the sentencing Judge that Count 1, if assessed in isolation, involved “an act of unpleasant voyeurism probably at the lower end of the scale” (at [53] above) was unduly favourable to the Respondent in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The aggravated indecent assault offences which constituted the three remaining counts were offences under s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900. Section 61M is in the following terms:
	


“61M    Aggravated indecent assault

(1)    Any person who assaults another person in circumstances of aggravation, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.

(2)    Any person who assaults another person, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 10 years, if the other person is under the age of 16 years.

(3) In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which:

(a)    the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or

(b)    (Repealed)

(c)    the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or

(d)    the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or

(e)    the alleged victim has a cognitive impairment.”


	
	It will be observed that the Respondent’s offences were under s.61M(2), being aggravated offences by reason only of the age of the victim. “Kate” was eight years of age, being half the relevant limit of 16 years contained within that provision.
	
	
	Where a s.61M(2) offence is committed against a child in circumstances where the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, a significant additional aggravating factor applies on sentence by operation of s.21A(2)(k) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [73].
	
	
	There is a further feature which operates against the Respondent on sentence in this case. Section 21A(5A) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is in the following terms:
	


“(5A)    Special rules for child sexual offences

In determining the appropriate sentence for a child sexual offence, the good character or lack of previous convictions of an offender is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor if the court is satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence.”


	
	The term “child sexual offence”, as used in s.21A(5A), includes offences under s.61M (where the person against whom the offence was committed was under the age of 16 years) and offences under s.91K (where the person who was being filmed was then under the age of 16 years): s.21A(6). Accordingly, all of the Respondent’s offences fell within the definition of “child sexual offence”.
	
	
	Section 21A(5A) was also introduced by the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008. In the second reading speech, the Attorney General said with respect to this provision (Hansard, Legislative Council, 26 November 2008):
	


“The bill also makes important changes to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to ensure that when sentencing an offender for a child sexual offence the court is not to take into account the offender's prior good character or lack of previous convictions if that factor was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence. The simple fact of a person's clean record and good character may assist an offender to gain the trust of the child, or the child's parents, in order to commit a sexual offence against the child. Any offender who has misused his or her perceived trustworthiness and honesty in this way cannot use his or her good character and clean record as a mitigating factor in sentencing.”


	
	Counsel for the Crown and the Respondent accepted in this Court that s.21A(5A) applied in the circumstances of this case where the Respondent was working as a childcare worker. It may be accepted that the Respondent’s prior good character assisted him to hold the position of childcare worker, which he abused by the offences committed against the victim: R v Lord [2013] NSWDC 16 at [158], [160]. Although there may be circumstances where s.21A(5A) has no application (see, for example, AH v R [2015] NSWCCA 51), the present case falls squarely within the terms of that provision.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the approach adopted by the sentencing Judge with respect to the Respondent’s prior good character (see [56] above), was unduly favourable to the Respondent. The Respondent’s prior good character and lack of prior convictions were not to be taken into account at all as a mitigating factor.
	
	
	A further aspect which bore significantly upon sentence in this case was the existence of a standard non-parole period of eight years (as against a maximum penalty of 10 years) with respect to each of the three s.61M(2) offences. The unusual relationship between these two periods has been the subject of comment by this Court in a number of cases.
	
	
	In Corby v R, with the agreement of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Kirby J, I said at [69]-[71]:
	


“69    An offence under s.61M(2) carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of eight years. The oddity of this situation was noted by the New South Wales Sentencing Council in its report ‘Penalties Relating to Sexual Assault Offences in New South Wales’, Vol 1, August 2008, page 56, at paragraph 3.47:

‘Recently, the SNPP for a s 61M(2) offence was increased to 8 years. This amendment has, however, had the effect of precluding the setting of an additional term under s 44 of the Act of one third of the NPP, for the simple reason that the resulting sentence would exceed the maximum sentence by eight months. The 8 year SNPP exceeds the two-thirds worst case scenario of 7 years 6 months, by six months.’

70    The New South Wales Sentencing Council returned to this topic at paragraphs 3.65 (page 63) and 3.68 (pages 64-65) of that report, before suggesting that consideration be given to a number of changes, including (page 69):

‘Giving consideration at the time of any wholesale review of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to standardising the SNPPs for sexual (and other) of sentences within a band of 40-60% of the available maximum penalty, subject to the possibility of individual exceptions, by reference to an assessment of the incidence of off ending and special considerations relating thereto.’

71    This Court has adverted to the ‘somewhat curious and inconsistent approach of the legislature’ in the specification of standard non-parole periods for certain offences, where the standard non-parole period is not too distant from the maximum penalty for the offence: R v Dagwell [2006] NSWCCA 98 at [38]. Although it is difficult to reconcile the two statutory guideposts in the form of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period for a s.61M(2) offence, it remains the position that the legislature has made statutory provision for a standard non-parole period and that it is necessary for sentencing courts to give proper attention to the standard non-parole period, particularly when the term of that period approaches the maximum term provided for the offence: Hudson v R [2008] NSWCCA 90 at [28].”


	
	Accordingly, it remains necessary for sentencing courts to give proper attention to the standard non-parole period in passing sentence for offences under s.61M(2).
	
	
	Each of Counts 2, 3 and 4 had a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of eight years. It is difficult to see how the standard non-parole period played any real part as a sentencing guidepost in accordance with the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27] in the sentencing of the Respondent.
	
	
	The Respondent committed a number of serious offences against “Kate” over a period of months. All offences were committed in circumstances where he was in a position of trust, with the responsibility to care for and protect the young children at the childcare centre, including “Kate”.
	
	
	The system of childcare, now widely utilised in the Australian community, depends upon persons in positions of trust and authority not abusing that position. What the Respondent did in this case involved serious, repeated and escalating criminal conduct against a young girl in his care.
	
	
	The victim impact statement made by “Kate” adverted to the effects of the offences upon her, including confusion, anger, fear, loneliness and a lack of trust of others, as well as intrusive memories of the offences. It must be kept in mind that she was only 10 years old when this statement was made. The long-term consequences of these offences cannot be quantified at this time, but the Court should proceed upon the basis that there will be damaging consequences flowing from the Respondent’s acts.
	
	
	In R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56, this Court said at [110]:
	


“This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. In R v G [2008] UKHL 37; [2009] 1 AC 92, Baroness Hale of Richmond (at [49]) referred to the ‘long term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do’. The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity: Clarkson v R [2011] VSCA 157; 32 VR 361 at 364 [3], 368-372 [26]-[39].”


	
	Child victims are especially vulnerable. It is important that sentences passed for sexual offences committed against child victims recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	These were repeated offences committed against the same victim over a period of some months.
	
	
	The Respondent’s subjective circumstances were to be considered without regard to his prior good character: s.21A(5A) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He had significant health issues, including haemochromatosis. However, his health difficulties had not interfered with his capacity to hold down a responsible position as supervisor at the child care centre.
	
	
	The Respondent had taken significant steps towards his rehabilitation and was entitled to have that taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	A somewhat puzzling feature of the case is the failure of the victim’s mother, and the paediatrician who was consulted, to take prompt action to report “Kate’s” complaints to the relevant authorities. When that was finally done, prompt action was taken. Whatever else may be said about this aspect, it cannot be said that it assists the Respondent on sentence. He had come under a form of notice and had received a type of warning, but he persisted with the final (and most serious) offence committed on 26 October 2012.
	
	
	The clearest measure of manifest inadequacy is that the aggregate sentence of 16 months exceeded by only one month the indicative sentence for Count 4. There has been a failure to have proper regard to the first, second and third offences, in considering the application of Pearce v The Queen, and associated issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality, for the purpose of determining the aggregate sentence. As a result, the aggregate sentence falls far short of reflecting the total criminality involved in the Respondent’s offences. This aspect operates to confirm the manifestly inadequate aggregate sentence imposed upon the Respondent.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge’s remarks on sentence encapsulate appropriate findings, subject to the two areas referred to earlier (at [79] and [87]). However, there is a substantial disconnect between those findings and the aggregate sentence imposed. The Crown has demonstrated that the sentence imposed represented a “substantial wrong”: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.
	
	
	I am satisfied that what were thought to be persuasive subjective considerations have unduly overshadowed the substantial objective gravity of these crimes, with the result that there has been a clear failure to ensure reasonable proportionality between the seriousness of the offences and the sentence imposed: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.
	
	
	The Crown has made good its claim that the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	


Should the Discretion to Resentence the Respondent be Exercised?


	
	The Crown has established error. It remains incumbent on the Crown to demonstrate that the discretion to resentence the Respondent should be exercised: CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; 89 ALJR 407 at 415 [33]-[34].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court should proceed to resentence the Respondent .
	
	
	Further evidence was placed before this Court by Ms Burgess concerning the position of the Respondent since sentence was imposed. An affidavit of the Respondent sworn 8 May 2015 was read, together with an affidavit of his solicitor, Kerry Ann Robinson affirmed 15 May 2015. This evidence was relied upon by the Respondent with respect to the exercise of the residual discretion and, if the Court moved to resentence the Respondent, on resentencing.
	
	
	The affidavit of the Respondent outlined his shock at learning of the Crown appeal, together with a number of difficult experiences he has had in custody. The Respondent requires venesection (regular blood extractions) as treatment for haemochromatosis. The need for this procedure has given rise to some difficulties in custody although, on 29 April 2015, the Respondent was moved to the MSPC Long Bay and was classified C2 MSPC on medical hold. It appears that this transfer has provided a measure of stability for his treatment in custody.
	
	
	The affidavit of Ms Robinson attaches records evidencing the Respondent’s threats of self-harm following notification to him of the Crown appeal. A report of Dr Toby Nasr dated 7 May 2015 is attached to the affidavit of Ms Robinson. Dr Nasr’s report concerns the treatment of the Respondent’s haemochromatosis.
	
	
	There was some delay between the sentencing of the Respondent on 28 November 2014 and the filing of the Notice of Appeal on 19 January 2015. Given the time of year, some allowance can be made for this delay. In my view, this is not delay of a type which operates in any significant way against the Crown on the issue of discretion.
	
	
	The Crown maintained at first instance that full-time custodial sentences were appropriate in this case. Nothing said by the Crown at first instance can be said to have led the sentencing Judge into error.
	
	
	It is appropriate to have regard to the actual stress and anxiety triggered in the Respondent as a result of notification of the Crown appeal. It is appropriate to take into account as well the evidence of the Respondent’s post-sentence experiences in custody.
	
	
	It has been said that the primary purpose of Crown appeals is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2].
	
	
	I have reached the clear view that the aggregate sentence imposed in this case was manifestly inadequate. For reasons already expressed, these were serious offences committed against a young child by a person in a position of trust and authority.
	
	
	It is in the public interest that an appropriate sentence be imposed upon the Respondent, given the clearly erroneous sentence imposed at first instance. An important part of the jurisdiction to hear Crown appeals is to ensure that there will be uniformity of sentencing, which is of great importance in maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice.
	
	
	In Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295, McHugh J said at 306:
	


“Uniformity of sentencing is a matter of great importance in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice in any jurisdiction. Sentences that are higher than usual create justifiable grievances in those who receive them. But inadequate sentences also give rise to a sense of injustice, not only in those who are the victims of the crimes in question but also in the general public. Inadequate sentences are also likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their part in deterring the commission of crimes. To permit the Crown, as well as convicted persons, to appeal against sentences assists in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice.”


	
	The present judgment will serve to lay down or emphasise a number of sentencing principles. However, it is appropriate for the Court to proceed to resentence the Respondent. This will serve to maintain public confidence in the due administration of justice.
	
	
	The Crown has demonstrated that it is appropriate for the Court to resentence the Respondent in this case.
	
	
	Factors bearing upon the objective seriousness of these offences, and the Respondent’s subjective circumstances, have been touched upon at various points in this judgment. It is not necessary to repeat them.
	
	
	Reference should be made to a submission advanced for the Respondent that, in some way, the theoretical possibility that offences under s.61M(2) and 91K may be disposed of summarily could be taken into account by this Court in the Respondent’s favour in the event that he is resentenced. At the outset, it should be observed that no argument of this sort was advanced at first instance: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 476 [70]ff. In any event, it is not realistic to consider that the Respondent’s offences, committed against this victim in breach of his position of trust, could ever realistically have been considered as appropriate candidates for summary disposal. This aspect provides no assistance to the Respondent on resentencing before this Court.
	
	
	In having regard to the Respondent’s subjective circumstances, I have not treated his prior good character not being a mitigating factor in compliance with s.21A(5A) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	I take into account the hardship being experienced (and likely to be experienced) by the Respondent in custody arising from his health problems.
	
	
	The sentencing of the Respondent must reflect each of the purposes of sentencing contained in s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999:
	


“3A    Purposes of sentencing

The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:

(a)    to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)    to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)    to protect the community from the offender,

(d)    to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)    to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)    to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”

The need for adequate punishment, general deterrence and denunciation have particular significance in this case, together with the need to recognise the harm done to the victim and the community.


	
	In determining to resentence the Respondent, it is appropriate to proceed again by way of aggregate sentence. In adopting this approach, it is necessary to comply with s.53A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by indicating the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. With respect to Counts 2, 3 and 4, each of which carries a standard non-parole period, it is necessary for the Court to indicate the non-parole period that would have been set for each offence if a separate sentence had been imposed: s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The 25% discount for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty should be applied with respect to each indicative sentence.
	
	
	Having regard to the objective seriousness of each offence, the guideposts applicable in the form of the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period (for Counts 2, 3 and 4), and the subjective circumstances of the Respondent, the indicative sentences to be applied are as follows:
	



	
	with respect to Count 1, imprisonment for nine months;
	
	
	with respect to Count 2, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 months with a balance of term of five months;
	
	
	with respect to Count 3, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of term of six months;
	
	
	with respect to Count 4, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of nine months.
	



	
	The indicative sentences for Counts 2, 3 and 4 reflect a finding of special circumstances (see [130] below).
	
	
	Having determined indicative sentences, it is necessary for the Court to consider notional issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality for the purpose of reaching the aggregate sentence to be imposed. Consideration will be given to the existence of special circumstances in fixing a non-parole period for the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Having considered issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality, I am satisfied that an aggregate head sentence of four years’ imprisonment should be fixed.
	
	
	I find special circumstances by reference to the Respondent’s increased hardship in custody resulting from his health problems, together with the need for a longer period of supervised liberty on parole to assist his return to the community. A non-parole period of two years and six months should be set.
	
	
	A non-parole period of two years and six months represents the minimum period for which the Respondent should be imprisoned to properly reflect the gravity of his offences and the manifold purposes of sentencing: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 717 [59].
	
	
	The sentences should date from 19 November 2014, to take into account the nine-day period when the Respondent was in custody, bail refused, following his arrest.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Crown appeal allowed;
	
	
	sentence imposed at the Parramatta District Court on 28 November 2014 is set aside;
	
	
	in its place, the Respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 19 November 2014 and expiring on 18 May 2017, with a balance of term of one year and six months commencing on 19 May 2017 and concluding on 18 November 2018;
	
	
	the earliest date upon which the Respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 19 May 2017.
	



	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with the reasons of Johnson J and the orders His Honour proposes.

2767091,Swain v R [2015] NSWCCA 176,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and background

The applicant stood trial at Parramatta District Court on 24 March 2014 on an indictment that contained six counts. All of the charges related to offences of a sexual nature alleged to have been committed by the applicant (aged 38 years) on the complainant JP when she was 14 and 15 years old. The complainant's family and the applicant's family lived in the same street and had been close family friends for a number of years. The complainant's father and the applicant worked together.


	
	The six charges relate to two separate incidents. Counts 1 - 3 related to what can be referred to as the ""shower incident"" and occurred at the complainant's home. The remaining counts (4 - 6) relate to a subsequent incident which can be referred to as the ""Boxing Day sleep over incident"" which allegedly occurred at the applicant's home.
	
	
	After deliberating for just under a day on 8 April 2014, the jury found the applicant guilty of the charges which related to the shower incident but not guilty of the Boxing Day sleep over counts.
	
	
	The counts brought against the applicant were as follows:
	


Count 1 – Between 1 August 2011 and 30 September 2011 at Ruse in the State of New South Wales did assault the complainant, a person under the age of 16, namely 15 years, and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on her in contravention of s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 2 – Between 1 August 2011 and 30 September 2011 at Ruse in the State of New South Wales had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely at the time of the offence the complainant was a person under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years in contravention of s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 3 – Between 1 August 2011 and 30 September 2011 at Ruse in the State of New South Wales had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence the complainant was a person under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years in contravention of s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

Count 4  - On or about 27 December 2011 at Ruse in the State of New South Wales had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence the complainant was a person under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years in contravention of s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.

	The applicant was sentenced on 5 September 2014. He received an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 5 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months. A Notice of Intention to Appeal against conviction was filed on 19 September 2014. There is no appeal against sentence.
	
	
	At the time of sentence, the trial judge delivered reasons for finding the applicant not guilty of a related summary offence of assault, which was alleged to have occurred in January 2011, when the children were playing hide and seek. The trial judge determined this matter pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The applicant initially relied upon three grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1 – The trial judge erred in not directing the jury as to the manner the jury could approach the delay in complaint when assessing the complainant’s credibility.

Ground 2 – The verdicts of guilty on Counts 1 – 3 were inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on Counts 4 – 6.

Ground 3 – The verdicts on Counts 1 – 3 are unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence.

Ground 1 was not pressed at the hearing of the appeal.


	
	The remaining grounds do not involve a question of law. The applicant therefore requires leave to appeal. I have accordingly referred to him as “the applicant” throughout the judgment.
	


Crown case and evidence


	
	The complainant was the daughter of the applicant’s friend and work colleague. The two families lived across the road from each other in Ruse in Sydney’s south west. The applicant and the complainant’s father worked together at the same building excavation company. The two families socialised together regularly, including going on holidays.
	
	
	The first occasion on which something is alleged to have happened between the applicant and the complainant was at New Year 2011, a month after the complainant’s fourteenth birthday. The two families were holidaying together at Nambucca Heads, staying in cabins. On the first night of the holiday, the children of both families, including the complainant, were playing “hide and seek”. The complainant and the applicant’s younger daughter went into one of the cabins in order to “count”. They were looking out the bedroom window, standing next to the bed, spying on where the other children were hiding.
	
	
	The complainant said that the applicant entered the cabin and asked what they were doing. They told him and he told his daughter to go to the front window instead. Once she had left, the applicant shut the door. He pushed the complainant onto the bed and lent over her body. The lights were off. The complainant heard the younger daughter’s footsteps running back and the applicant quickly got off her. This evidence was led as tendency evidence and as a s 166 certificate matter – (s61 common assault).
	


Shower incident


	
	The shower incident was alleged to have occurred in August or September 2011 when the complainant was close to 15 years old. She was driven home from school by her mother on a Tuesday being the only day of the week when she was home alone. Her father and grandfather were still at work and her sister, B, was at a dance club with their mother. She said that the incident occurred “around about 3.30 to 4.30pm”. The complainant’s mother confirmed that she would collect her daughters from school by car, drop the complainant off at home with the house keys at about 3pm and then drive B to dance club, which started at 3.15pm.
	
	
	The complainant let herself in with her mother’s keys, leaving the front door closed but unlocked. She went to have a shower. In cross-examination she clarified that this was about 30 – 40 minutes after she arrived home because before having the shower she had rung her boyfriend BF. While she was having a shower the complainant heard somebody inside the house calling out “is anyone home”. Shortly thereafter the applicant came into the bathroom where the complainant was showering. The complainant was shocked and said “What are you doing here? What are you doing here?” The applicant laughed and left the bathroom.
	
	
	The complainant turned off the shower and put on her bathrobe. She left the bathroom and saw the applicant standing in the hallway. She walked past him into her bedroom and he followed her inside. He grabbed her from behind and started to hug her. He then turned her around and looked her in the eyes. The complainant said “What are you doing. What are you doing here”.
	
	
	The applicant pushed the complainant onto her bed and climbed on top of her. She tried to push him off but he was heavy and she could not do it. The applicant said “I can’t help it, I’m sexually attracted to you, you’re beautiful, you’re pretty, don’t ever let anyone put you down”. The applicant asked the complainant when her parents were getting home and she answered that she was not sure.
	
	
	The applicant started to kiss her on the lips, while trying to remove her bathrobe. He remained clothed in a shirt and board shorts. He opened up her dressing gown and moved down her body, kissing her breasts and stomach (count 1 – s 61M(2) - aggravated indecent assault – child under 16 years).
	
	
	The applicant moved to the complainant’s crotch and began licking her vagina (count 2 – s 61J(1) – aggravated sexual assault – child under 16 years).
	
	
	The complainant pushed the applicant’s head away and said “get off me you need to stop”. He then briefly inserted his finger into her vagina. She could tell it was one finger and described it as feeling like a tampon (count 3 – s 61J(1) – aggravated sexual assault – child under 16 years).
	
	
	The complainant managed to push the applicant off, then curled up in a ball on the floor. He picked her up, put her back on the bed and lay on top of her. She could feel his penis through his shorts, pushing against her crotch. It felt a bit hard. She tried to push him off her. The applicant then got off her and as he did so, he said “Don’t tell anyone”. He then left the premises by the laundry door and went to the outside garden shed, where he got a tool and left.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was put to the complainant that this did not happen. She disagreed.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother said that it was unusual for the front door to be locked after the complainant had let herself in. The complainant’s father said that the back door was deadlocked but that the key was kept in the lock on the inside. The complainant’s mother confirmed this arrangement.
	
	
	The investigating police officer, Detective Kirkwood, gave evidence that he had obtained the applicant’s mobile phone records for August and September 2011 and that on every Tuesday, other than 20 September 2011, the records showed phone calls from the applicant’s handset between 4pm and 5pm through towers nowhere near the Ruse area (where the complainant and the applicant lived).
	
	
	The mobile telephone records of both the applicant and the complainant’s father were tendered through a Telstra employee, Adam Gelfe. He explained the records and how telephone towers work. The Telstra records showed five phone calls made from the applicant’s mobile to the complainant’s father’s mobile between 16.09 and 16.15 on 20 September 2011. Each time the call went through to the voicemail for five seconds or less. All five calls went through the Telstra base station at Ruse, Junction Road.
	
	
	The complainant’s father gave evidence that on 20 September 2011 he went from his work site at Catherine Fields to Leumeah to do some tiling work for a friend, rather than going home. He said that his work group, including the applicant, finished up and left the site at the same time, about 3.30pm. Usually it would take him 25 minutes to get from Catherine Fields to his home at Ruse. On 20 September 2011 he thought that he arrived at Leumeah around 4 – 4.30pm and stayed there until late. In cross-examination he agreed that he told his employer that he finished work that day at 4pm “or thereabouts” – the workmen could leave 5, 10, 15 minutes early if they arrived early. An email of his work hours for that week showed he finished on 20 September 2011 at 4pm. The employer confirmed the practice of his employees rounding off their start and finish times to the half or whole hour, such that a recorded time of 4pm could mean a quarter to, or ten to four finish.
	


The Boxing Day sleep over incident


	
	This incident, which comprised the matters on which the applicant was acquitted, was alleged to have occurred on or about 27 December 2011, a few days after the complainant’s fifteenth birthday. The complainant described the incident as having occurred on the day after Boxing Day. The evidence at trial suggested that it was in fact the night of Boxing Day.
	
	
	The evidence to that effect was that the complainant said in cross-examination that she and her grandmother went shopping the next day and saw the applicant and his wife at the shopping centre. The complainant’s mother recalled that a dinner with the neighbours at the applicant’s house took place on the night of Boxing Day and that the shopping trip was the following day. The applicant and his wife agreed that the dinner party took place on Boxing Day and that the shopping trip was the following day. The applicant’s daughter published an update on her Facebook page on 27 December 2011 that she “went to the pool ‘til 11.30 last night”, i.e. 26 December and confirmed in evidence that she was referring to the night of the sleep over.
	
	
	On this night the complainant and her family had attended the applicant’s house with other neighbours. Everyone’s Christmas and Boxing Day leftovers were eaten for dinner. The children had been playing in the swimming pool. The complainant’s parents left at midnight but the complainant was asked by the applicant’s daughters to watch a movie with them and then to stay the night. The complainant agreed to stay over – she briefly went home to seek her parents’ permission and change into her pyjamas – then returned to watch the first Harry Potter film with the applicant’s daughters in their (absent) brother’s room because he had the largest bed and television. The three girls started watching the film at about 1am.
	
	
	The complainant said that at some time during the movie, the applicant came into the room and said “Mum’s asleep”. He lay down next to the complainant, who was at the edge of the double bed closest to the door. The other two girls were next to her. After about 10 minutes, the applicant asked his daughters if they wanted to get under the blankets. They agreed and the applicant pulled the covers over the complainant, his daughters and himself. A few minutes later the applicant moved his right hand near the complainant’s buttocks. She was lying on her side, facing the two girls with her back to the applicant. The applicant put his hand up the complainant’s boxer shirts, pushed her underpants to one side and inserted his finger in her vagina. He moved his finger in and out with increasing intensity. This lasted about 3 seconds (count 4 – s 61J(1) – aggravated sexual assault – child under 16 years).
	
	
	The complainant felt pain at the start. She was surprised at what was happening. She said it was disgusting. She was scared and wanted to go home. Her heart was pounding and she could not watch the film. She pushed his hand away and rolled onto her back. The applicant remained next to her for a few minutes, then got up and left the room. The film was about half way through. The complainant described the applicant going in and out of his room and then coming back to the room where the girls were.
	
	
	The complainant said that the applicant returned and carried his youngest daughter, who had fallen asleep, into her own bedroom. When he did this, the older daughter said to the complainant “I’ll bet you he’ll put me to bed”. When the applicant came back she asked him not to move her if she fell asleep. He agreed. She fell asleep shortly before the end of the film. After the film finished, the applicant turned off the DVD player and TV and carried his older daughter out of the room. The complainant protested on her sleeping friend’s behalf but the applicant said “No, no she likes her bed”.
	
	
	About 5 minutes later when the complainant was just falling asleep, the applicant returned to the room where she was now alone. He shut the door, pulled the covers off the complainant and lay on top of her on the bed. At that time he was wearing boxer shorts and a shirt. She could feel his hard penis pushing against her as he simulated having sex with her and was breathing heavily. He kept saying to her “I could have sex with you right now” (count 5 – s 61M(2) – aggravated indecent assault – child under 16 years).
	
	
	The complainant said “You need to stop, get off me now”. The applicant said “J – I can’t help it. I’m really sexually attracted to you and I just can’t stop”. The complainant managed to get out from under him and get off the bed. She backed up against the wardrobe, shaking, saying repeatedly “Seriously. Get out you cannot do this”. The applicant grabbed her by both arms and got her back onto the bed. He pushed her so that she was lying on her back. He lay on top of her and began kissing her slowly, all over her face. She was saying “Go away, get out”.
	
	
	The applicant moved to the floor and positioned himself between the complainant’s legs. He pulled her boxer shorts and underwear to one side, he began licking her vagina. She could feel his tongue moving in and out of her vagina. She was saying “Nathan stop. Please stop” (count 6 – s 61J(1) – aggravated sexual assault – child under 16 years).
	
	
	After about five seconds, the applicant stopped and said to the complainant “After you have sex with BF, I’m going to have sex with you” (BF was the applicant’s nephew and the complainant’s boyfriend). He added “You really cannot tell anyone about this” and then left the room. It was about 3.30 or 4am.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was put to the complainant that the applicant did not do any of the things complained of, that the older daughter took herself off to bed and that the last person to see the complainant that night was the applicant’s wife who came to check if she was comfortable. The complainant disagreed with all of those propositions.
	


The complaints


	
	The complainant said that about a month after the shower incident, she disclosed to her best friend, TB, that the applicant had walked in on her in the shower, was hugging and kissing her and pushed her onto the bed. She did not disclose the full allegation. TB told the complainant to tell their friend, BF, the applicant’s nephew and the complainant’s boyfriend. The girls rang BF (the complainant did not specify when) and the complainant told him what she had told TB. In cross-examination the complainant agreed that the phone call to BF was “sometime later”.
	
	
	TB, who was aged 14, made a recorded interview with police on 8 May 2012. Her evidence of the complaint largely accorded with the complainant’s account. She added that it was “last year in September/October”. The incident had happened “Maybe a week or a few days before”. They were in the complainant’s bedroom talking about how they were both late for their menstrual periods and the complainant became upset. The complainant disclosed “what happened when he came over”. TB said that she had never seen her friend so upset before. This made her upset too. The complainant was worried about her missed period because “She didn’t know if she could fall pregnant by anything that had happened”. TB also said it was about two or three weeks later that they telephoned BF while at the complainant’s house one night after waiting “for everyone to go to sleep”. Both she and the complainant were in tears and BF also got upset on the phone. She confirmed in cross-examination that she had heard all of what the complainant told BF on the phone and that she spoke to him briefly to tell him that they were okay.
	
	
	BF was aged 15 and made a recorded interview with the police. This took place on 25 June 2012. His evidence was that on a few earlier occasions the complainant had been upset on the phone to him but would not tell him what was wrong. His recollection of the phone disclosure “in September maybe” was that the complainant said that after she hopped out of the shower, the applicant had touched her “downstairs” meaning her vagina and that he told her to tell the police but that she said she did not want the applicant to go to gaol. She was crying. He confirmed in cross-examination that it was the complainant who told him about the incident. He said that he could hear TB crying in the background and that the word “vagina” was mentioned.
	
	
	On 8 February 2012 the complainant went out for a meal in the city with BF and his mother. She had been wanting to tell someone about what else had happened with the applicant as she was concerned things would get worse, given the applicant’s comment that he would have sex with her when she turned 16 (the age when she was allowed by her dad to go out with BF). She felt she really had to tell someone. She decided she would tell BF and his mother as she did not feel comfortable telling her parents first. She knew that BF and his mother would tell “Marissa”, a woman who lived with them who had also been abused as a child.
	
	
	As soon as the complainant told BF and his mother what had happened, they told her to ring Marissa. The complainant did so and Marissa told her that with her permission, she would ring the applicant to tell him that an adult knew what he had done so he would be too scared to do it again. The complainant felt comfortable talking to Marissa as she had gone through the same thing so the complainant thought she would know what to do.
	
	
	As a result of Marissa speaking to the applicant, the applicant confronted the complainant’s father at work about her accusations. The complainant’s father rang her and told her to take the day off school and when he returned home, she disclosed the shower incident to him.
	
	
	The complainant’s father gave evidence that the applicant had approached him on a worksite on a day in February 2012, and that he appeared shaken up saying that he needed to talk to him about a couple of things. The first was a work matter and the second was that the complainant had accused him of molesting and touching her. The applicant said he was sick of it, that he was going to fight it, that he did not do it, that he would kill himself before he went to gaol and that it was an emotional time. The complainant’s father was dumbfounded. The applicant asked him to stay at work but the complainant’s father said that he had to go and talk to his daughter and the applicant said that that was okay and left. The complainant’s father denied that the applicant said to him “try to sort this out, then come and see me again to see whether we can make any sense of it”.
	
	
	The complainant’s father rang his wife and told her to keep the complainant at home and told her what he had been told. When he got home the complainant disclosed the shower incident to him, which mostly accorded with the complainant’s account to the police, apart from her saying that she was kicking the applicant when she was fighting him off. The complainant’s father asked why she had not said anything earlier and she said that she was scared to ruin her parents’ friendship. He spoke to his wife and then went to the applicant’s house to see if the applicant’s wife was okay. They had a short conversation and he left.
	
	
	A couple of days later, a family friend, Rachael Tweedie, came over to discuss things with the complainant’s parents. The complainant told her about the shower incident but Rachael said “J -, I’ve known you long enough to know when you aren’t right”. The complainant then disclosed all three incidents to her, which mostly accorded with her account to police apart from her kicking the applicant during the Boxing Day incident. In cross-examination Ms Tweedie agreed that her words were “J -, I’ve known you long enough to know when you are lying” but stated that the complainant had never lied to her. She also confirmed that the complainant said she had kicked the applicant “in the shoulder on the last occasion”.
	
	
	The complainant’s father confirmed that Ms Tweedie came back inside after speaking privately with the complainant and said to him and his wife “It’s happened on more than one occasion”. The complainant then started to disclose the Boxing Day incident, but did not go into too much detail, and at that point the complainant’s father said that they needed to go to the police.
	
	
	The next day they went to the Campbelltown Police Station. On 5 March 2012 the complainant gave a video recorded interview to the Liverpool Joint Investigation Response Team (now Child Abuse Squad) complaining of the “hide and seek” incident, the “shower” incident and the “Boxing Day sleep over” incident. This became the complainant’s evidence in chief.
	


DEFENCE CASE AND EVIDENCE


	
	The applicant gave evidence. He denied that he had committed any of the offences charged.
	


Hide and seek incident


	
	His evidence in relation to the Nambucca Heads holiday was that he had a twisted knee and was having trouble walking and that on the night of 2 January 2011 they had all gone to the bowling club together for dinner. He was pushed on a scooter because of his injured knee and afterwards they all went back to the caravan park and he retired to his cabin with his wife and packed up his knee with ice. He denied playing hide and seek with the children. The complainant’s father agreed in cross-examination that the applicant had a knee injury during that holiday and that they had all been to the bowling club on the night of 2 January and that the applicant had been pushed on the scooter. The complainant’s mother also agreed with the knee injury and the club dinner.
	
	
	The applicant’s wife gave evidence about this incident which accorded with his account.
	


The shower incident


	
	The applicant’s evidence in relation to Tuesday 20 September 2011 was that he left the work site at Catherine Fields at about 4pm, went first to his mother-in-law’s house at St Helens Park to collect his children (a 40 – 45 minute drive in the work truck) and then went home (10 – 15 minutes drive – reduced to 10 to 12 minutes drive in cross-examination). He denied going into the complainant’s house that day. He remembered the day because his older daughter was sick. He said that usually it would take him at least half an hour to drive from that work site to his home at Ruse.
	
	
	In cross-examination he said that it was possible he had left work at 10 minutes to 4, but not as early as a quarter to. In relation to the phone records, he said that he was driving at that time and had no memory of making those calls. He denied that the reason his phone was recorded as connecting with the Telstra network at Ruse was because he was at home and he denied he was recorded as ringing the complainant’s father to see if he were home and if “the coast was clear”.
	
	
	The applicant’s wife gave evidence that the applicant picked up the children from her mother’s and that the older daughter was sick and that he rang her to say that he had picked the children up and was at home.
	
	
	The applicant’s mother-in-law gave evidence that both her granddaughters were ill and at home with her on 19 September 2011 and that the older daughter was still ill and stayed at home with her again on 20 September. This was supported by contemporaneous status updates on her Facebook profile. She recalled that on 20 September she took the younger daughter to school in the morning and picked her up at 3pm. The applicant arrived in the afternoon in the work truck to pick up the children. It was between 4 and 4.30pm that he arrived, but she was not sure when they left. She gave him an ice cream container because the older daughter was vomiting everywhere.
	
	
	In cross-examination she accepted that she was not in a position to disagree with the applicant’s evidence that he did not get to her place until 4.30 pm but in later cross-examination, she was not sure. She said that she knew he was wearing his work clothes when he picked the girls up that day because he was “always in his work clothes” and she knew this because she would “always stop him at the door to take his boots off”.
	


Boxing Day sleep over incident


	
	The applicant’s evidence in relation to the incident after the Boxing Day dinner party was that no-one was under the covers as it was a hot summer night, that he sat on the edge of the bed and watched the film with the girls only briefly, that his wife was with him when he returned to pick up his younger daughter and that he did not recall what happened to his older daughter. He said that he went to bed after putting the younger daughter in her room and did not emerge until the next morning. He said that the next day he was at Macarthur Square with his wife and daughters when he heard his surname being called out, thought it was a practical joke and later learned that it was the complainant.
	
	
	The applicant’s wife gave evidence that he checked on the girls for 5 – 10 minutes, then an hour to an hour and a half later they both went in. The applicant picked up his younger daughter and the older daughter walked herself to her bed. The applicant’s wife asked the complainant if she was okay, then closed her door. She said that they kept their bedroom door open and that she was a light sleeper and that she would wake up if the applicant moved in their bed.
	
	
	The applicant’s older daughter gave evidence that the complainant was lying on the side of the bed which was against the wall, she was in the middle and the younger daughter was on the side where the applicant sat down. She said no-one changed positions and that no-one got under the covers. She could not remember how long the applicant stayed with them. She did not hear him come in a second time. She said that when her dad was in the room, he carried out the younger daughter. After this, her mother came and checked on them then she walked herself to bed. She denied in cross-examination that she fell asleep during the film and that her father lay down next to the complainant.
	


Other evidence


	
	The applicant said that he received a phone call from Marissa who told him “J has accused you of touching her”. He met her at a mutual friend’s place with his wife to clarify what Marissa had said, but was not given any more detail. He then decided that he would speak to the complainant’s father the following morning. The applicant said that he told him:
	


“J has been accusing me of touching her and it’s a serious thing that she’s saying and people do go to gaol for this kind of thing. You really need to go home and sort it out.”

He denied the conversation as recounted by the complainant’s father.


	
	The employer, Mr O’Neil, was called by the Crown to confirm their working arrangements. He gave evidence in cross-examination that the applicant was an honest and trustworthy employee, good at his job and that the allegations were completely out of character. The applicant’s mother-in-law said that he was an honest person, who would do anything for you. She was aware of the allegations and was a very watchful grandmother, who had observed the applicant with his children and had “seen nothing, nothing”.
	
	
	An old neighbourhood friend of the applicant and his wife, Linda Kable, gave evidence that the applicant had a strong community spirit, was honest and reliable, a good dad and that she could not link the allegations of sexual misconduct towards the complainant “to the person she knew”.
	


Ground 2 – The verdicts of guilty on Counts 1 – 3 were inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on Counts 4 – 6.


	
	The applicant submitted that it was plain that there were divergent verdicts in respect to each incident. He submitted that it was also plain that his guilt in respect of each incident relied heavily, if not exclusively, on the evidence of the complainant. He submitted that for the jury to acquit him on the second incident, they must not have accepted the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that the jury should have had the same doubt in respect to the first incident. He submitted that there was no rational basis upon which the jury could have convicted him on counts 1 – 3, but acquitted him of counts 4 – 6.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the jury must have had reservations concerning the complainant’s credibility and that those reservations must logically have extended to her evidence on counts 1 – 3. The applicant submitted that by reference to the following factors it was clear that the Crown case was weaker in relation to the first incident when compared to the second.
	



	
	There was a real issue as to whether he would have had time to commit the offences in counts 1 – 3 (the detail underlying that submission is set out in relation to Ground 3). The applicant submitted that on one view of the evidence, the timings were so tight as to make the occurrence of the offending most unlikely and on the other, the timings were such as to make the occurrence of the offending impossible.
	
	
	The complainant said that he was wearing board shorts and a shirt whereas his mother in law gave evidence that he was wearing work clothes. For the complainant’s evidence to be accepted, he must have returned home, showered, got changed and committed the offences before travelling to his mother in law’s home to pick up his sick children.
	
	
	The theory that he travelled to the complainant’s home and quickly sexually assaulted her before picking up his sick children from his mother in law’s home was inconsistent with the evidence from a number of people that he was a devoted father and family man.
	
	
	He could not have known whether or not the complainant was home alone at the time of his entering her home, since the five phone calls which he made to her father went unanswered.
	
	
	There was an inconsistency in the details of the shower incident in that the complainant added a recollection of kicking the applicant when she recounted the incident to her father in February 2012.
	
	
	The complainant could not recall the date of the incident, despite speaking to a friend about it some days or a week later.
	
	
	The actions of the complainant following the shower incident were inconsistent with it occurring in that she continued to attend his home on a regular basis and even decided to stay the night on Boxing Day, only a couple of months after the alleged incident.
	
	
	The fact that the jury experienced a reasonable doubt concerning the complainant’s evidence on counts 4 – 6 must be taken into account in assessing her reliability in relation to other counts.
	



	
	The applicant submitted that the allegations and evidence in respect of the Boxing Day sleep over incident were not affected by such problems and simply amounted to a contest between the evidence of the complainant and him. The difficulties for the complainant in relation to her allegations in respect of the second incident were that it occurred in his home at a time when his wife and children were present.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was no reasonable and acceptable explanation for the divergent verdicts.
	


Consideration


	
	Leaving aside the time issue which is considered in Ground 3, there were otherwise a number of important differences between the evidence relating to counts 1 – 3 and counts 4 – 6 which adequately explained why the jury was able to find the applicant guilty of counts 1 – 3 but not counts 4 – 6.
	
	
	The legal principles relating to whether verdicts were inconsistent are now relatively well settled. In MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said:
	


“33   In MacKenzie v The Queen, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated a number of general propositions concerning the significance that may properly be attached to what is sometimes referred to as factual inconsistency between verdicts. In that respect, it is to be noted that, where an accused is charged with multiple offences, differences between the verdicts may not, in truth, involve inconsistencies even of a factual kind. …

34   Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.

35   It appears from the review of decisions of trial judges and intermediate appellate courts undertaken in Markuleski that some judges have taken Jones as authority for the proposition that where multiple offences are alleged involving the one complainant, then verdicts of not guilty on some counts necessarily reflect a view that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable, and that an appellate court should consider the reasonableness of guilty verdicts on the basis that the complainant is a person of damaged credibility. That view is erroneous. …”


	
	In MFA similar statements of principle were made by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ, although expressed slightly differently:
	


“85   The principles in MacKenzie apply to the present case. This is not an instance of ""legal or technical inconsistency"", whereby the jury have returned two or more verdicts which, in law, cannot stand together. Nor is it a case where ""logic and reasonableness"" necessarily dictated a common approach to the several verdicts concerned. In judging suggested inconsistency, this Court said in MacKenzie that ""if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted"". The Court cited with approval the remarks of King CJ in R v Kirkman to the effect that juries may not always act ""in accordance with strictly logical considerations"" or even ""in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them"". Juries sometimes give effect to ""their innate sense of fairness and justice"" as well as to their sense of proportion and compassion.

86   Nevertheless, cases do arise where different verdicts returned by a jury represent ""an affront to logic and commonsense"" and suggest a compromise in the performance of the jury's duty. Such a conclusion ""depends upon the facts of the case"". There can be no ""hard and fast rules"" except that the obligation to demonstrate inconsistency in jury verdicts rests upon the person making the submission.”


	
	There was in this instance a reasonable basis for the jury distinguishing between the shower incident and the Boxing Day sleep over incident without necessarily forming an adverse view of the complainant’s reliability or veracity.
	
	
	With the shower incident, there was supporting evidence that the complainant was home alone on Tuesday afternoons generally and specifically on Tuesday 20 September 2011. Her father confirmed that he did not go home after work on 20 September 2011 but went straight to a friend’s house to assist with tiling. There was, accordingly, the opportunity for the offences to be committed in the manner described by the complainant when other family members were not at home. The phone calls from the applicant’s phone to the complainant’s father’s mobile phone on Tuesday 20 September 2011 were consistent with the applicant being at or near his home at a time consistent with the complainant’s evidence.
	
	
	Perhaps the strongest evidence differentiating the shower incident from the Boxing Day sleep over incident was that relating to complaint. Within a relatively short period of time, the complainant told her best friend, TB, about the shower incident. According to TB, she was told within a few days or a week after the incident occurred. The description given by TB of the circumstances in which she was told is compelling. TB described the complainant being in the most distressed state that she had ever seen her. Her description of the sexually inexperienced complainant being concerned about her period being late and not being sure if she could get pregnant from what had taken place, is poignant and redolent of truthfulness.
	
	
	The subsequent complaints to her boyfriend, BF, to BF’s mother, to Marissa, to her father and to Rachael Tweedie support the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant’s evidence concerning the shower incident. There is substantial consistency in the elements of the complaints. Given the age of the complainant and the close relationship between her family and that of the applicant, the delay in complaint is of little significance. It is not surprising that counsel for the applicant made little mention of delay in complaint in his submissions to the jury.
	
	
	The complainant’s evidence was that the incident occurred in August or September 2011. The applicant’s mobile phone records showed that there was only one Tuesday within that timeframe (namely 20 September 2011) when his phone was used anywhere near Ruse between 4 and 5 o’clock. The phone records showed that on Tuesday 20 September 2011 five calls were made from the applicant’s mobile phone to that of the complainant’s father between 4.09pm and 4.15pm (16.09.34, 16.10.25, 16.10.54, 16.14.59, 16.15.11). In each case the calls went through to voicemail for a matter of 3, 4 or 5 seconds. These calls were consistent with the applicant being at home or nearby at the time and wanting to contact the complainant’s father with some urgency. They were consistent with the complainant’s evidence that the applicant opened the closed (but not locked) front door, entered and said “is anyone home” at some time between 3.30pm and 4.30pm on the relevant Tuesday afternoon. The phone records were consistent with the complainant’s evidence as to the time when her mother dropped her off at home and her having a shower after speaking to BF for between 30 and 40 minutes after she arrived home.
	
	
	In contrast, there was not the same supporting evidence in respect of the Boxing Day sleep over incident. There were factual disputes as to the complainant’s position on the bed and that of the applicant. There was a factual dispute as to the sequence of events. There was a factual dispute as to how and in what circumstances the older of the applicant’s daughters went to bed. Finally, there was the delay in the disclosure of the incident, i.e. not telling BF and his mother on 8 February 2012, nor Marissa, nor when first speaking to her father. It was not until she spoke to Rachael Tweedie that the applicant disclosed that the sleep over incident had occurred.
	
	
	It follows that a satisfactory explanation of the jury’s process of reasoning is that they were looking for extrinsic evidence to support the complainant’s evidence. Such evidence was available in respect of the shower incident, but not in respect of the Boxing Day sleep over incident.
	
	
	Leaving aside the timing issue, the other matters relied upon by the applicant to challenge the occurrence of the shower incident, are not persuasive.
	
	
	By reference to the evidence of Rachael Tweedie it is clear that the “kicking” response to the applicant’s conduct was told to her in relation to the Boxing Day sleep over incident. When giving her statement to the police, the complainant attributed her kicking response to the shower incident. To the extent that there was any inconsistency in relation to “kicking” it affected both incidents.
	
	
	The complainant’s conduct subsequent to the shower incident is readily explainable. The families were close and did many things together. The complainant clearly had a close relationship with the applicant’s family, in particular his daughters. She was aware of the close nature of the relationship between her parents and the applicant and his family. Given her age and relative inexperience, one can readily understand why the complainant was not prepared to give any overt signs that the relationship between her and the applicant and his family had changed.
	
	
	The jury were correctly directed by his Honour that they must give separate consideration to the individual counts and also that they were entitled to bring in verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on others if there were a logical reason for that outcome. The difference in verdicts in respect of counts 1 – 3 and counts 4 – 6 show that the jury complied with this direction in that there was a logical basis for them doing so.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 3 – The verdicts on Counts 1 – 3 are unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence.


	
	In written submissions the applicant submitted that because the jury must have had a reasonable doubt as to the complainant’s evidence concerning the Boxing Day sleep over incident, which caused them to enter a verdict of acquittal on the three offences stemming from that incident, there was a sufficient basis to argue that the jury ought to have had the same concerns in relation to the first instance. In that regard, the applicant substantially repeated the arguments advanced in respect of ground 2.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that this was a classic case in which the determination of his guilt or innocence should have been approached in the manner set out in R v Anderson [2001] NSWCCA 115 at [26] where Kirby J stated:
	


“26   Directions along these lines are customarily given, although I prefer the following formulation:

""First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit.

Second, if you find difficulty in accepting the evidence of the accused, but think that it might be true, then you must acquit.

Third, if you do not believe the accused, then you should put his testimony to one side. The question will remain; has the Crown, upon the basis of evidence that you do accept, proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt?""”


	
	The applicant submitted that when those questions are asked in relation to this matter, it is clear that his conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory because his evidence could not be completely rejected, particularly considering its partial corroboration from his wife, mother in law and his older daughter. In addition, regard had to be taken of the good character evidence which was adduced on his behalf.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in this case there was no fingerprint evidence, no DNA evidence and no real independent evidence other than that of the complainant. He submitted that the complainant’s evidence was substantially undermined by the following considerations:
	


The delay in complaint generally.

The unlikelihood that the complainant would sleep voluntarily and of her free will in his home if he had sexually assaulted her only a couple of months earlier.

The unlikelihood that the complainant would continue to attend his home on a regular basis, including spending whole days in the swimming pool if he had sexually assaulted her only months before.

The inability of the complainant to recall the date of the alleged shower incident and at best simply nominate a Tuesday in the months of August to September 2011 was difficult to accept. He submitted that it was only as a result of his phone records that the date of 20 September 2011 was able to be identified.


	
	In oral submissions the applicant submitted that given the evidence as to timings, it was simply impossible that the shower incident could have occurred on the day and in the way asserted by the complainant. The applicant relied upon the following evidence to demonstrate that proposition:
	


The complainant’s evidence in her statement was that the assault occurred on a Tuesday at around 3.30 to 4.30pm (Q/A 65, Q/A 67) (T.170.45).

It would have taken him approximately half an hour to drive from his place of work to his home at Ruse (which was opposite that of the complainant) (T.212.40).

Exhibit F, the work log, showed him leaving his place of work at 4pm.

He would have travelled the same route through Ruse in order to get to his mother in law’s place where he was to pick up his children.

The drive from his residence to his mother in law’s residence would take approximately 12 minutes, i.e. the total time for him to drive from his place of work to his mother in law’s house would be between 40 – 45 minutes (T.213.2) (T.235.11).

The five phone calls to the complainant’s father’s phone were sent at the following times: 16.09.34, 16.10.25, 16.10.54, 16.14.59, 16.15.11 (exhibit E). It follows that those five phone calls must have been made before he picked up his children.

His recollection was that he left work on 20 September 2011 at 4pm and that he would have driven directly to his mother in law’s house to pick up his children. He particularly remembered that day because his older daughter was sick.

He had no clear recollection of when he arrived at his mother in law’s house but estimated it would have been somewhere between 4.35 and 4.45, depending on when he left work (T.244.40 – 245.10).

There was a phone call between him and his wife at 16.46.41 which lasted over a minute during which he advised her that he was at home and that he had the kids with him (T.302.37, 309.45).

The evidence from his mother in law was that he arrived to pick up the children between 4 and 4.30pm on 20 September 2011 (T.381.37).

He was in his work clothes when he arrived at his mother in law’s house to pick up his children (T.412.21, 413.40).


	
	The applicant submitted that if the complainant’s evidence were correct, he would have had to leave work, drive to his home, shower and change his clothes, assault her and then drive to his mother in law’s home, pick up his children and return to his home in time to make the call to his wife at 4.46pm. The applicant submitted that even if he had left work at 3.45pm, it would not have been possible for him to have showered, changed his clothes and assaulted the complainant within that timeframe. Moreover, there was a direct conflict between the complainant’s evidence as to what he was wearing and that of his mother in law. In that regard, the applicant submitted that his mother in law had good reason to remember that day because his older daughter was quite sick.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the telephone records provided independent evidence which fundamentally undermined the complainant’s evidence concerning the shower incident and supported his evidence. He further submitted that the evidence of his mother in law and of his wife was in direct conflict with that of the complainant. He submitted that there was a good reason why both his mother in law and his wife would remember 20 September 2011, i.e. because of the illness of his older daughter. He submitted that in those circumstances this Court should conclude that on the whole of the evidence, in particular the telephone records, it was not open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had committed the offences in counts 1 – 3.
	


Consideration


	
	The question for the Court is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences in counts 1 – 3. This is a question of fact. In considering this ground, the Court must undertake its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. In M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 the plurality (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
	


“7   Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence

to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude

that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the

court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the

evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable

doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.”


	
	The test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in MFA v The Queen at [58]. McHugh, Kirby and Gummow JJ said that the reference to “unsafe or unsatisfactory” in M v R is to be taken as “equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as “unreasonable” or such as “cannot be supported having regard to the evidence”.
	
	
	These principles were restated by the majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 as follows:
	


“13   The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses[5]. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

…”


	
	In W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 Bathurst CJ (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) said on the same issue:
	


“151   It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for the jury (or in this case the trial judge) to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559. In a passage with which Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed, his Honour made the following remarks:

""[113]    It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence that the complainant and the appellant gave that was relevant to the issue of consent to the digital penetration that had occurred in the park. That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.""

(Emphasis in the original, citations omitted).

152   However, it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. So much is made clear in the passage from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, cited in SKA v The Queen supra at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the court is left in reasonable doubts as to the verdicts, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt, the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [26] and [55]-[56]).”


	
	Nearly all of the matters identified and relied upon by the applicant in support of this ground are commonly present in child sexual assault matters such as the present. They include the presence of some delay in complaint, the complainant continuing to interact with the applicant after the initial sexual acts, particularly where the applicant holds a position such as he did here as a close family friend, the inability of the complainant to identify a precise date for the offending and a lack of DNA and fingerprint evidence. These matters do not support a conclusion that the jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt about the applicant’s guilt as distinct from might have.
	
	
	As already indicated in relation to Ground 2, there were a number of powerful indicia supporting the complainant’s evidence. Those matters have been taken into account when considering this ground. There are, however, some additional matters.
	
	
	It is apparent from the fact that the applicant made five phone calls to the phone of the complainant’s father within a space of a little over five minutes that he urgently wished to contact him. Those calls were picked up by the Ruse mobile phone tower and support the proposition that at the time the calls were made, the applicant was in the Ruse area. The complainant’s evidence that the applicant opened the unlocked front door and called out “Is anyone home?” is consistent with the applicant continuing his attempts to contact the complainant’s father. If that be so, consistent with the overall Crown case the assault by the applicant on the complainant was entirely opportunistic and unplanned. The applicant’s question of the complainant as to when her parents were going to get home is consistent with that scenario. So also is the complainant’s evidence that for part of the time the applicant was keeping the front yard under observation (Q/A 53, Q/A 87).
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions concerning the timing of events depends very much upon an acceptance by the jury of the reliability of the evidence of the applicant’s wife and mother in law. It also depends upon giving a level of precision to the evidence of the mother in law which is not warranted.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence was initially that he did not leave work until 4pm. Under cross-examination he conceded that it could have been as early as 10 to 4. Other evidence, however, would suggest that it was probably about 3.45pm. That evidence comes from the telephone records as amplified by the evidence of the applicant’s wife (T.302.21) to the effect that at 15.37.20 the applicant rang her to advise that he had finished work early. That evidence is consistent with that of the complainant’s father and the employer Mr O’Neil to the effect that an entry on the work-card of 4pm did not necessarily mean that work finished at 4pm, rather it covered a situation where work may have finished at 3.45pm. The telephone records also show the complainant’s father’s phone being picked up by the Leumeah mobile phone tower at 4.07pm which is also consistent with him leaving work at about 3.45pm or slightly earlier.
	
	
	The applicant is unable to say when he arrived at his mother in law’s house. His evidence in chief and in cross-examination was an estimate based on a total driving time of between 40 and 45 minutes from his place of work. The reliability of that estimate was dependent upon the time when he left work and an acceptance of his evidence that he did not stop at Ruse on the way but travelled directly to his mother in law’s house.
	
	
	There were a number of difficulties with the evidence of the applicant’s mother in law. She was first ask to remember the events of 20 September 2011, two and a half years after the event (T.412.46). It was only after she saw her Facebook entries that she was able to remember what happened that day. Despite the passage of time, she was definite about the time that the applicant arrived:
	


“… It was between 4 and 4.30 that he got to my house but I cannot tell you what time he left my house and the reason I know that is my husband gets home at 10 to 4 every afternoon and Nathan wasn’t far behind him.” (T.381.37)


	
	The fact that the last of the applicant’s phone calls from the Ruse area to the complainant’s father’s phone was made shortly after 4.15pm must place some doubt on the accuracy of that estimate. This is because it would have taken him between 12 and 15 minutes to travel from his house to that of his mother in law.
	
	
	When it was put to the mother in law that the applicant may not have arrived before 4.30pm she was not in a position to disagree with that proposition (T.389.15, T.413.11). Importantly, the following evidence was given by the mother in law:
	


“Q. Now it’s the case that you actually don’t have an independent recollection of when he arrived on that day but you’re relying more on the fact that your husband would usually get home just before 10 to 4, do you agree with that or not?

A. My husband gets home at 10 to 4, between 10 to 4 and 4 o’clock.

Q. Yes and you’re relying upon that when you gave your estimate that Nathan arrived between 4 and 4.30?

A. Yes it gave me the timeslot.” (T.413.24)


	
	On the basis of that evidence and the effluxion of two and a half years before she was asked to turn her mind to what happened on 20 September 2011 it was well open to the jury to conclude that the mother in law was reconstructing her evidence on the basis of what usually happened rather than having an independent recollection of what actually happened on that particular day.
	
	
	The same problem exists in relation to her evidence concerning what the applicant was wearing (T.412.21, T.413.40). Again, when giving this evidence the mother in law relied upon what usually happened:
	


“Q. And today when you’re giving evidence about what he wore on the day 20 September 2011, you’re not relying upon your own independent recollection but what you say he usually or always wore when he picked the kids up?

A. No that’s not true. I know what Nathan had on because as I said I always stop him at the door to take his boots off.” (T.413.37)


	
	In relation to what the applicant was wearing when he picked up the children, there was the added difficulty that the mother in law made no mention of his clothing when she prepared her initial statement for his solicitors. The evidence as to what he was wearing on 20 September 2011 emerged for the first time at the hearing.
	
	
	The evidence was:
	


“Q. And you’d agree with me that you took care to be accurate with that statement?

A. Yes.

Q. And that you took care to give a full account of what you could recall about that day?

A. Yes.

Q. Now I suggest to you that nowhere in that statement - and that was done, for the record on 18 March 2014?

A. Yes.

Q. And I suggest to you that nowhere in that statement did you say what Nathan was wearing when he picked the kids up?

A. No I didn’t.

Q. You understand that it’s an important issue in this trial?

A. I do, very important issue.” (T.414.4)


	
	In relation to the applicant’s wife, there was no doubt that the applicant telephoned her slightly after 4.46pm on 20 September 2011. Unfortunately, the phone records do not indicate his location at the time of that call. What is in issue is what he said when he made that call. His wife’s evidence is:
	


“Q. All right we will go further down the page to the very bottom entry. There’s a phone call from Nathan to you at 16.46.41, that lasts for over a minute. What is your view of that phone?

A. That Nathan’s home, he’s got the kids, what do you want out for tea, because he always prepared tea before I got home if he was home early.” (T.302.34)

“Q. Okay he was finished early, okay. Now you say that the call that was made at 16.46 so at 4.46 from Nathan to you was when he was already at home, is that right?

A. That’s what I presumed yes, he was at home and that he was home with the children and what did we want for tea.

Q. Now you just presumed didn’t you, you presumed that to be the case?

A. Yeah he was home.

Q. Can I just say, just to let you know his evidence is that he arrived at his mother-in-law’s place that afternoon between 4.35 and 4.45 and he stayed there a short time before going home?

A. I can’t –

Q. Assuming, that’s his evidence, assuming that’s the case, is it possible that in fact when he’s rung you to ask what you want for dinner that he’s actually rung you whilst he’s still at your mother’s place?

A. No.

Q. You don’t?

A. I don’t know, I have no idea but I don’t believe that.

Q. You have no idea, that’s the case, you can’t discount it, in fact --

A. I can’t say “yes” and I can’t say “no”.

Q. So can I suggest to you what actually happened is that he just rang you to say what do you want for dinner, he didn’t actually say “I’m home now” but you’ve just assumed because as a matter of practice he would often give you a call when he was at home, would you agree with that?

A. Not always he’d give me a call, no.

Q. But when he did, that often was when he had got home?

A. Not often that he is always home early.

Q. But you can’t say can you that he in fact was home when he rang you?

A. No I can only --

Q. You’ve assumed that?

A. Yes, “I’m at home” when he says “I’m at home”.

Q. So your evidence is now he actually said he words “I’m at home”?

A. I’m at home.

Q. Are you sure about that?

A. Positive.

Q. So why did you say you presumed he was at home?

A. It’s just a word that I’ve come up with, I’m under a lot of pressure here, stress.

Q. I suggest you didn’t actually say he was at home, do you agree with that?

A. No.” (T.309.1 – T.310.2)


	
	The applicant’s submission that the timing made the occurrence of the shower incident impossible, really depends upon the evidence of his wife as to what he said in the phone call of 4.46pm. Her answers set out above are somewhat strange and not particularly convincing. If the applicant had told her “I am at home” it is difficult to understand why she would respond on a number of occasions to the effect that she “presumed” that he was home. It was open to the jury not to accept that evidence and not to accept that those answers were given by the applicant’s wife because she was “under a lot of pressure here, stress”.
	
	
	In any event, the assessment of the evidence of the applicant’s wife was a quintessential jury question. There are difficulties with her evidence, which are clear from its terms. It could not be said that in the circumstances it was unreasonable for the jury to reject her evidence on that issue and to conclude that the applicant was not at home when he made that phone call to his wife.
	
	
	I have concluded that the evidence relied upon by the applicant does not have the effect which he contends for. None of the evidence is of an “objective” or “independent” kind. It depends upon an acceptance in part of the mother in law and most particularly of his wife as to the contents of the conversation which occurred slightly after 4.46pm. The acceptance or rejection of that evidence was a matter for the jury. There is nothing in the evidence which would oblige the jury to either accept or reject it. For the reasons already articulated, there are some problems with the evidence given the lapse in time and the element of prevarication in his wife’s answers. In assessing this evidence, the jury had an advantage which this Court does not of seeing and hearing the witnesses.
	
	
	It is one thing to say it was open to the jury to fully accept the evidence of the mother in law and the applicant’s wife, but quite another to say that they were obliged to do so. They were not so obliged. There were, as indicated, sound reasons why they could reject that evidence. For example, any issue as to time would disappear if in fact what the applicant said to his wife was along the lines of “I’ve picked the children up and I’m on my way home” rather than the version given by her.
	
	
	It should also be noted that the complainant’s evidence was that the shower incident took place over a very short period of time. Her estimate of the digital penetration was that it occurred for three seconds.
	
	
	Most particularly the jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the complainant. As indicated in relation to Ground 2 and as set out at [69] – [72] there was compelling evidence in support of the complainant’s version of events in relation to counts 1 – 3. On the whole of the evidence I do not consider that the jury must have entertained a doubt about the applicant's guilt. The suggested doubts which in this Court the applicant has submitted should have led to acquittal were capable of being resolved by the jury given their advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	R A HULME J: Having made my own assessment of the evidence I find myself in agreement with the analysis and conclusions of Hoeben CJ at CL in relation to both grounds. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		03 July 2015",2015-07-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767092,O’Grady v R [2015] NSWCCA 168,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J and with his Honour’s reasons. I would, however, add the following remarks.
	
	
	As Rothman J pointed out, no warning was given in the present case that an increased sentence may be imposed as a possible outcome of the re-exercising of the sentencing discretion under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In those circumstances, it would have been erroneous to impose a greater sentence on the appellant than that imposed by the primary judge.
	
	
	In the present case, Rothman J has indicated the sentence which he regarded as appropriate on re-exercising the sentencing discretion in the manner required by Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 88 ALJR 947. I agree that the sentence suggested by Rothman J was warranted. I also agree with Rothman J that where, as in this case, the Court is of the view, on the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, that a greater sentence than the one imposed by the sentencing judge is warranted, it is not always necessary to specify the actual sentence which the Court believes is warranted. My present view is that it would generally be sufficient that the judgment demonstrates that the re-sentencing exercise has in fact been carried out and provides reasons as to why the Court was of the view that a greater sentence was warranted in law. However, it is not necessary to come to a final conclusion on this matter.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: Andrew O’Grady (the applicant) seeks an extension of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal. If the extension of time were granted, the applicant also seeks leave to appeal and to appeal the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Sydney on 17 September 2010. The application for the extension of time, the application for leave to appeal and the appeal, to the extent that the extension of time and leave to appeal were granted, were heard concurrently.
	
	
	The application for extension of time was initially heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 21 October 2013, but the application was dismissed on 18 November 2013 (the first appeal judgment). The applicant thereupon appealed to the High Court of Australia and the High Court, on 9 October 2014, allowed the appeal against the first appeal judgment, set aside that judgment and remitted the matter back to this Court for determination in accordance with law.
	
	
	The charge against the applicant was contravention of s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, being the charge of specially aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely robbery, for which is prescribed a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	The offence was committed on 12 May 2008. The applicant pleaded not guilty and was convicted after trial. The sentence imposed by the District Court was a sentence of a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months, commencing 23 May 2010 and expiring on 22 November 2015, with the balance of term of 3 years and 6 months expiring on 22 May 2019.
	
	
	One ground of appeal is raised, namely, what is known as “Muldrock error”. More formally, the ground is expressed in the following terms:
	


“(i) Her Honour erred in her approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.”


	
	The appeal was filed on 27 June 2013, almost 3 years after the imposition of the sentence. It is necessary to reiterate the facts, which have now been summarised a number of times, and to deal briefly with the Remarks on Sentence and the subjective circumstances of the applicant.
	


Facts


	
	On 12 May 2008, the applicant and two other men (together, “the offenders”), consumed drugs and alcohol before driving around for approximately 2 hours in a stolen vehicle. The applicant had been involved in a “bad drug deal” and wanted to “rectify the situation with the dealer” (see evidence of co-offender).
	
	
	The offenders drove to the apartment building of the victim, whom the applicant knew. They approached the victim’s unit through a car park, up the fire escape stairs and through the fire escape door, which the applicant opened with a screwdriver.
	
	
	The victim was alone in his apartment and when he opened his apartment door, the offenders pushed him onto a couch. As the victim attempted to protect himself, the situation “erupted” and the offenders seriously assaulted him, during which assault the victim lost consciousness.
	
	
	The offenders stole the victim’s television, DVD player and other items of value. They left the victim’s apartment and the two co-offenders dropped the applicant at a location in the Central Business District. The robbery occurred during the time that the victim was unconscious.
	
	
	The victim regained consciousness the next morning and went to the hospital. He was diagnosed with severe lacerations to his face and scalp and fractures to the floor of his right orbit.
	
	
	These matters were reported to police and later that morning police found the two co-offenders in the stolen vehicle with the items from the victim’s house. On 6 April 2009, after the arrest of the two co-offenders, the applicant was arrested.
	
	
	I should also note that the sentencing judge found that it was “probably” the applicant who, prior to the assault, had demanded that the victim disclose the location of his money and drugs. A more complete summary of the facts is set out in the first appeal judgment: O’Grady v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 281 at [10]-[19].
	


The Ground of Appeal 


	
	As earlier stated, the only ground of appeal is the adoption by the sentencing judge of the approach to sentencing mandated by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. It is appropriate to set out the salient passage from the Remarks on Sentence (ROS at [2]), in which the sentencing judge stated:
	


“The offence carries a maximum available penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period of 7 years represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type. When determining the sentence for the offence, the Court is to set the standard non-parole period unless the Court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than a standard non-parole period. The relevant reasons are confined to those referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.”


	
	The foregoing represents an impermissible approach to the exercise of the sentencing discretion, as was clarified by the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. In that judgment, the High Court expressly disapproved the approach previously applied by this Court, arising from the judgment in R v Way.
	
	
	As a consequence, the sentencing judge, while applying the law as she was then bound to do, adopted an erroneous two–stage approach to sentencing, involving the setting of the standard non-parole period, with additions or subtractions depending upon reasons considered appropriate for departing from the said standard non-parole period.
	
	
	As is conceded by the Crown on appeal, the approach of the sentencing judge was, in hindsight, an error of the kind described by the High Court in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, being a misapplication of the principles, or the application of a wrong principle, in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	There is identifiable error, which may possibly have affected the sentence that was imposed.
	


Extension of Time and Leave to Appeal 


	
	In Kentwell v The Queen (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 96, the Court, as presently constituted, summarised the principles associated with an extension of time, leave to appeal and the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	The appeal with which these reasons for judgment is concerned was heard at the same time as the appeal in Kentwell v The Queen (No 2). Further, the High Court heard the appeal in the applicant’s appeal together with the appeal to it in Kentwell v The Queen: see O’Grady v The Queen [2014] HCA 38; (2014) 88 ALJR 960 at [1] and Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 88 ALJR 947.
	
	
	In Kentwell v The Queen, the High Court held that the determination of an application for an extension of time involves the consideration of the interests of justice in the circumstances of a particular case: see Kentwell v The Queen at [30]. The High Court acknowledged that the interests of justice varied and often pointed to different conclusions, or pulled in different directions.
	
	
	As has been made clear by the High Court, the discretion conferred on a court to extend time is not confined to cases in which the refusal of the extension of time would occasion substantial injustice: see O’Grady v The Queen in the High Court at [13]. The High Court there held that, while the prospect of success in the appeal itself is a relevant factor, that assessment does not end with the establishment of error, but also involves consideration of the issues under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, as to whether some other sentence is warranted in law and any other factor affecting the interests of justice.
	
	
	In this case, as in Kentwell v The Queen (No 2), the Crown no longer opposes an extension of time.
	
	
	The applicant had initially instructed legal representatives to lodge a Notice of Intention to appeal against both conviction and sentence. A Notice of Intention to appeal was, it seems, only filed in relation to the conviction appeal. The conviction appeal was dismissed on 13 April 2012. It appears that there had been a refusal of the grant of Legal Aid for an appeal against sentence, as originally instructed.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing, it seems to me that the reasons for delay have been explained and the interests of justice are such that the application for an extension of time ought be granted. I am comforted in that view by the consent of the Crown.
	


Leave to Appeal and Appeal 


	
	The sentencing judge determined that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. There is no appeal ground seeking to overturn that categorisation.
	
	
	The applicant was the “orchestrator of the offence” and was the only offender who possessed the motivation to seek out the victim. The applicant identified the victim and the victim’s apartment to his co-offenders and opened the fire door to the victim’s apartment building door with a screwdriver.
	
	
	The sentencing judge acknowledged, as do I, that the victim’s injuries were “towards the lower range of seriousness”. However, her Honour found that the “robbery itself was a matter of a very considerable seriousness” and I agree with that description. The robbery involved the actual use of serious violence. The violence continued until the victim was unconsciousness and the offence occurred in the victim’s home.
	
	
	The applicant had three prior convictions, which, while not for offences of the seriousness of the instant offence, denied the offender the leniency available to a first offender. Further, the offence was committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty (a 12 month s 9 bond).
	
	
	As earlier stated, the assault and robbery occurred in the victim’s home, which the sentencing judge determined was “a very significant factor” and I agree with that assessment. Next, the applicant committed the offence with two other persons and, although the sentencing judge determined that that was not “a significantly aggravating factor”, in my view, it renders the offence more serious in a way not encompassed by the special aggravation in the offence itself.
	
	
	The sentencing judge determined that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, partly as a result of the psychologist’s report. The sentencing judge also determined that special circumstances existed and imposed a non-parole period significantly shorter than the prescribed ratio, because the applicant would need an extended period of supervision when he ultimately returned to the community.
	
	
	I agree with the finding of special circumstances and would independently so find. The applicant is, on the current sentence, due to return to the community (or first eligible for parole) on 22 November 2015.
	
	
	One cannot ignore the psychologist’s report when determining the applicant’s subjective circumstances and mental health. The applicant had, according to the psychologist, witnessed the stabbing murder of his partner, after which he developed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. The psychologist testified that, to deal with the symptoms of those conditions, the applicant began to use drugs heavily, which led to the circumstances of the offence in question. The applicant had consumed a substantial quantity of drugs and alcohol, in the company of the co-offenders, prior to the commission of the offence.
	
	
	While evidence has been adduced of courses undertaken by the applicant during his prison sentence and of the effect of the prison sentence on his family, these effects are ones that an experienced sentencing judge, such as the sentencing judge below, would necessarily contemplate. They do not affect the correctness of the finding that there were special circumstances and that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. Indeed, the material adduced in the affidavits, available on re-sentencing, attests to the correctness of the finding of the sentencing judge and allows a degree of comfort in independently coming to the same conclusion.
	
	
	Issue is taken, in the applicant’s submissions on appeal, with the determination by the sentencing judge that the objective seriousness of the offence was within the middle range of objective seriousness for the offence of “specially aggravated” break, enter and commit serious indictable offence. As stated, the “error” in the categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offence is not a separate ground of appeal.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I should make clear, given that I am required to re-sentence the applicant, that there is no error in the categorisation by the sentencing judge below. Since the violence was perpetrated to a point where the victim was unconscious, was done in the company of two others and was premeditated, the circumstances warrant the offence being categorised in the mid-range.
	
	
	The maximum sentence is 25 years’ imprisonment. The standard non-parole period is 7 years’ imprisonment. Each is a guidepost in fixing the sentence for the offence. The sentence imposed upon the applicant was a 5 1/2 year non-parole period as part of a head sentence of 9 years.
	
	
	However, the sentence imposed below ought be given no weight in the process now being undertaken. Once leave to appeal is granted and error disclosed, this Court must independently come to its conclusion on the sentence to be imposed. I note that the Court did not warn the applicant that an increased sentence may be imposed as a possible outcome: see Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 and also see Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55; (1982) 149 CLR 305.
	
	
	The applicant points to statistics that show that only 15% of offenders were sentenced more severely than the applicant. There are significant limits in the manner in which one may use statistics. Apart from any other aspect, such an approach becomes a self-perpetuating limitation on the sentencing discretion to be exercised.
	
	
	Ultimately, the sentencing judge relying, as her Honour did, on the decision of this Court in R v Way, was led into error. The correct approach to the exercise of the sentencing discretion is that described by the High Court in Muldrock and does not involve adding to and subtracting from the standard non-parole period. Error having been identified, which error could have affected the sentence imposed (see Kentwell v The Queen (No 2)). Leave to appeal should be granted.
	
	
	As earlier stated, error having been disclosed and leave having been granted, the Court must independently come to a view as to the appropriate sentence for the applicant and impose that sentence. The guideposts are the objects and purposes of sentencing (Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465), and the maximum sentence and standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In my view, given the subjective circumstances and the objective culpability, a head sentence over 9 years’ imprisonment is warranted. I would fix between 9 years and 10 years as a head sentence. It is unnecessary, in the present circumstances, to be more precise.
	
	
	Further, a reduction of the standard non-parole period to allow three and a half years’ parole gives too much weight to the special circumstances. The statutory ratio would result in 6 years and 9 months non-parole period and a reduction of 9 months would, in my view, suffice.
	
	
	However, no warnings having been given, I do not suggest an increase in the sentence. Exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, no lesser sentence is warranted in law and I would not interfere with the sentence imposed by her Honour.
	
	
	The foregoing comments relating to the sentence I would have imposed are not intended to suggest that the sentence imposed by her Honour below is outside the range available to be imposed; the sentence below is at a low or the lowest end of the range. Nevertheless, I am required to exercise the sentencing discretion independently and, when exercising that discretion independently, would have arrived at a sentence of the kind described above.
	
	
	Further, the above analysis of the sentence I consider should have been determined is not intended to suggest the Court needs, in all cases, or at all, to specify the sentence it would have imposed, before coming to the conclusion that no lesser sentence is warranted. It is simply unnecessary, in this case, to deal with the issue.
	
	
	I propose that the Court make the following orders:
	



	
	Extension of time granted;
	
	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	MCCALLUM J: I agree with Rothman J and with the additional remarks of the Chief Justice.

		03 July 2015",2015-07-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767095,R v Lachlan [2015] NSWCCA 178,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: This a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentences imposed on the respondent, Ryan Lachlan, by Acting Judge Phegan at the Campbelltown District Court on 21 November 2014. The sole ground of appeal is that the sentences are manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The sentences relate to two charges relating to possession of firearms and a prohibited weapon, in respect of which the respondent had earlier pleaded guilty at the Campbelltown Local Court on 20 August 2014.
	
	
	The first offence alleged unauthorised possession of more than three unregistered firearms (a rifle and three shotguns), at least one of which was a prohibited firearm contrary to s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 20 years. A standard non-parole period of 10 years is prescribed.
	
	
	The other offence alleged unauthorised possession of a prohibited weapon (a stun gun) contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW). The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 14 years. A standard non-parole period of 3 years is prescribed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by his Honour were as follows:
	



	
	in respect of the firearms offence (and taking into account the additional offences on the Form 1 referred to below) – 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 29 November 2013; and
	
	
	in respect of the prohibited weapon offence – a fixed term of 1 year imprisonment commencing 29 November 2013.
	



	
	In sentencing for these offences the judge took into account, at the request of the respondent pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act), his guilt in respect of eight further offences listed in a Form 1 document, namely:
	


(1)   possessing ammunition without authority contrary to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act, for which the maximum penalty is 50 penalty units;

(2)-(5)   possessing a prohibited weapon (stun gun; extendable baton; two pairs of knuckledusters; and a taser) contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act for which, as already mentioned, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years;

(These offences occurred at the time of the principal offence on 11 November 2013.)

(6)   entering inclosed land without lawful excuse contrary to s 4(1)(b) of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty is 5 penalty units;

(7)   damaging property contrary to s 195(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years; and

(8)   resisting an officer in the execution of their duty contrary to s 58 of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years.

(These offences occurred at the time of the respondent’s arrest on 29 November 2013.)


	
	On 7 January 2015, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions filed a notice of appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of both the firearms offence and the prohibited weapon offence. At the commencement of the hearing, the Crown indicated that the focus of the Crown appeal was on the asserted manifest inadequacy of the sentence on the firearms offence.
	
	
	It is to be noted that the sentence for the prohibited weapon offence was a fixed term. No complaint is made by either party that the judge failed to record his reasons for declining to set a non-parole period for this offence: Sentencing Act, s 45(2). The matter is now moot as this sentence expired in November 2014.
	


Circumstances of the offences


	
	The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts. The relevant facts may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	On 11 November 2013 police conducted surveillance at an address at Airds near Campbelltown. The respondent was observed to leave the premises. He was stopped in a vehicle and spoken to by police. He told police the premises he was leaving was his girlfriend’s residence. While police were conducting further checks the respondent ran from police and was not chased.
	
	
	A short time later police executed a search warrant at the Airds premises and located four firearms which had been “shortened” to less than the dimensions required by the Firearms Regulation 2006 (NSW), namely:
	



	
	a shortened .22 rifle found on the kitchen bench (the magazine contained 15 rounds);
	
	
	a shortened single barrel shotgun and a shortened double barrel shotgun, both found in a sports bag in a bedroom; and
	
	
	a loaded and shortened single barrel 410 shotgun located in another bag in the same bedroom.
	



	
	Subsequent ballistics examination showed each firearm was in working order. The respondent’s DNA was later matched to the rifle and his fingerprints were found on one of the single barrel shotguns. The possession of these four firearms constituted the s 51D(2) offence. Each was a “prohibited firearm” as defined in s 4(1) because the firearm, or any part, had a dimension less than the minimum dimension prescribed for the firearm under the Firearms Regulation: see Schedule 1, cl 16 to the Firearms Act. The minimum length of the barrel (or largest barrel if more than one) for rifles is 40 cm: reg 129(1)(b); and for shotguns is 45 cm: reg 129(1)(a).
	
	
	The police also located a “X6” brand stun gun on a coffee table. The respondent’s fingerprints were later found on that weapon. A stun gun is a prohibited weapon for the purposes of the Weapons Prohibition Act: Schedule 1, cl 18. The possession of this prohibited weapon constituted the s 7(1) offence.
	
	
	Other items located and seized included additional prohibited weapons (another stun gun; an extendable baton; two tasers; two pairs of knuckledusters – see Schedule 1, cls 2(17A), 2(18), 2(18A) and 2(19), Weapons Prohibition Act), ammunition, firearms magazines, a firearm bolt, a knife and two balaclavas. (The possession of four prohibited weapons and the ammunition constituted five of the offences on the Form 1.) The police also found two paintball guns under the bed.
	
	
	On 29 November 2013 police attended premises at Swansea in connection with an unrelated matter. The respondent was found hiding against the side of the house. He gave a false name and ran from police. He kicked over a compost bin and jumped a fence while being pursued. He was arrested a short time later attempting to climb a 6 foot fence. (This conduct constituted the remaining three of the offences on the Form 1.) He was taken into custody and refused bail on that date.
	
	
	After his arrest, police downloaded the contents of the respondent’s mobile phone and found photographs of knuckledusters and firearms. The agreed facts record that the police retrieved many messages on the mobile phone between July 2013 and November 2013 where the respondent was engaged in the buying and selling firearms for financial gain. It is only necessary to refer, by way of example, to one such message conversation that took place in October 2013 (the “incoming” message being received by the respondent and the “outgoing message” being sent by the respondent):
	


Incoming:   talking to a fella now got a semi auto 22 16 round clip with a 8 aswell dosnt wana sell but im tryna convince him.. Delete this msg after just to be safe

Incoming:   Yeah bro he reckons he comes acroos them all the time even tradded a bb gun not long ago for a sawn off shotty things are looking good bruva guna be armed to the teeth soon

Outgoing:   Haha good bro I’ll probably come c u this arvo

Outgoing:   Did that bloke wanna get rid of that toy

Incoming:   Hes thinking about it he hasn’t got any semi auto bullets for it so its useless to him …tried selling me a chromed out paintball gun haha laughed at that..

Outgoing:    Tell him I’ll get it off him today for the right price or if Hell take pot for it [sic]

The respondent’s subjective case


	
	At the time of sentence, the respondent had been in custody for approximately 12 months (since his arrest on 29 November 2013). The respondent was aged 19 at the time of the principal offence, had just turned 20 at the time of his arrest and is presently aged 21 years.
	
	
	The materials before the sentencing judge comprised a pre-sentence report from Community Corrections, a psychologist’s report from Mr Ballardie and letters from the respondent’s mother and stepfather. The respondent did not give evidence.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report outlined the respondent’s family and social circumstances noting that his father left the family home when he was a young child. The judge recorded that the respondent had two older brothers who engaged in a degree of physical violence directed both at him and, in the case of his older brother, his mother.
	
	
	The respondent encountered difficulties early in high school. He was expelled when he was 13 years old because of various misconduct on his part. He then went to Queensland to stay with his father. He attended school there intermittently and finally left school at 15 and moved back to Sydney to live with his mother. Between the ages of 15 and 17 years he did not work or study. He then returned to his former high school to attempt year 10 but left again after a few months. He started a cabinet making apprenticeship but discontinued within a short time.
	
	
	The respondent commenced using drugs at the age of 13, initially cannabis and later pills including ecstasy, MDMA, cocaine and speed. He started drinking alcohol at the age of 14 years and consumed it moderately to heavily. He told the psychologist that he realised he had a serious problem with alcohol and was drinking heavily most days prior to his arrest in November 2013. Since his arrest the evidence before the sentencing judge was that he had been drug free whilst in custody.
	
	
	The respondent commenced his interest in firearms whilst residing with his father in Queensland who took him shooting at a firing range from the age of 15 years.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report noted that the respondent accepted responsibility for his actions, but he displayed a “lack of insight with and a complete disregard for the lack of safety measures in securing the large number of illegal firearms appropriately”. Although the respondent acknowledged the potential for the firearms to be utilised in a negative or criminal manner, the report noted that the respondent struggled to identify who might be affected in doing so.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report assessed the respondent “as an immature individual who appeared to struggle to understand the gravity” of his current situation. The report observed that “[h]is juvenile presentation and thinking patterns were reflected when discussing his attitude to the offences” and concluded that “his level of insight into his actions is questionable”.
	
	
	The psychologist’s report also addressed the respondent’s attitude to the offences. It recorded that the respondent appeared genuine when he told the psychologist that he knows what he did with the weapons in his possession was wrong and sincere in his regret and remorse about the offences.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report assessed the respondent as having a “medium to high” risk of reoffending. The psychologist expressed a more favourable view that the respondent had a “low to moderate” range for risk of future reoffending. The psychologist considered that the respondent would not benefit from extended incarceration which would expose him to further negative influences and reinforce antisocial values and behaviours.
	


The judge’s reasons


	
	After summarising the statement of agreed facts, the judge noted that the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for the principal offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act indicated the seriousness of the offence and the general need for a sentence of imprisonment of some length, wherever the case may fall on the scale of objective seriousness. The judge continued:
	


As far as the standard non-parole period is concerned it remains of relevance in terms of general guidance with regard to the appropriate sentence although its effect is mitigated in this case by the plea of guilty.


	
	The judge referred to Mack v R [2009] NSWCCA 216 where at [40] a number of considerations bearing on the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence against s 51D(2) are listed. Applying those to the facts in the present case his Honour addressed as relevant considerations: (a) the number of firearms; (b) the nature and type of firearms; (c) the purpose of possession; and (d) the location and storage of the weapons.
	
	
	Relevantly the judge considered that the four firearms, together with the weapons the subject of the matters listed on the Form 1, could be reasonably described as “approaching an arsenal of weapons”.
	
	
	The judge considered that the nature and type of the firearms was implicit in the principal offence and the number of weapons the subject of the s 7(1) offence (relating to the stun gun) and a number of similar offences on the Form 1.
	
	
	However, although the judge had earlier recorded in his summary of the agreed facts that each firearm was a prohibited firearm because it had been “shortened”, his Honour did not expressly refer in this part of his reasons to the number of unregistered firearms that were also prohibited firearms (being another relevant consideration identified in Mack v R).
	
	
	The judge noted that the agreed facts recorded that the weapons were kept for, amongst other things, the purpose of profit on the part of the respondent who was clearly engaged in dealing in those weapons. His Honour accepted that there was evidence that at least “some” of the weapons were for recreational use. (This finding was most generous given that each of the firearms had been “shortened”. His Honour seems to have conflated the evidence in the psychologist’s report concerning the respondent’s early use of his “gun” in the bush to shoot “to feel better”, with his later acquisition of other weapons which had been “shortened”. The psychologist did not record that the respondent provided a history of using “shortened” firearms for recreational purposes.)
	
	
	His Honour also accepted that there was no evidence to suggest that the weapons were either used by or intended to be used by the respondent in some criminal activity. Nonetheless his Honour found that by being engaged in the distribution of weapons the respondent was contributing to the potential use of those weapons for purposes which may have led to serious injury and indeed death, and that this bore directly on the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The judge had earlier referred in his reasons to the location and manner of the storage of the weapons at the Airds premises – one rifle was located on a kitchen bench, and the three shortened shotguns were located in two sports bags in a bedroom. The judge considered that the weapons were readily accessible to anyone who gained entry to the house.
	
	
	The judge concluded that the offences “fall somewhere short of but certainly not far from the mid-range of objective seriousness”.
	
	
	The judge then summarised the respondent’s subjective case, which has been already outlined above. He noted the respondent’s relative youth and that he had spent his 21st birthday in custody during the sentencing proceedings. He also noted the evidence that the respondent had been drug free during his period in custody.
	
	
	The judge next considered a number of aggravating and mitigating factors.
	
	
	With respect to aggravating factors, the judge noted:
	



	
	the respondent’s criminal record which included drug offences, driving offences and the offence of common assault;
	
	
	of greater significance was a previous conviction for similar related firearms offences on 27 November 2011 involving possession of a shortened shotgun, for which the respondent received a 9 months intensive correction order which expired on 10 February 2013;
	
	
	the present offences were committed while the respondent was subject to a s 9 bond for driving whilst disqualified;
	
	
	the offences had the potential of causing extensive injury and damage had the weapons and ammunition been subsequently used by others; and
	
	
	the degree of planning or organised criminal activity was a relatively minor (“if any”) aggravating factor, having regard to what the judge considered to be the somewhat disorganised way in which the respondent seemed to have conducted the business aspect of his activities. (This finding was most favourable to the respondent when one examines the content of the messages on his mobile phone.)
	



	
	With respect to mitigating factors, the judge referred (without making any express finding) to the conflicting assessments in the pre-sentence report and the psychologist’s report of the likelihood of the respondent re-offending.
	
	
	As to the prospects of rehabilitation, the judge accepted the psychologist’s assessment that “the respondent would respond well to a supported and managed return to productive engagement in the community”, which the judge concluded was sufficient to enable a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The judge noted the observations of the respondent’s mother and stepfather to the effect that, since his arrest there had been a very significant change in the respondent’s attitude, not only towards the offences themselves but in terms of his general social behaviour. These observations included that the respondent had committed himself to a fundamental change in his lifestyle with the intention of gaining appropriate qualifications, finding appropriate employment and putting his drug and alcohol abuse behind him.
	
	
	The judge observed that only limited weight could be given to the respondent’s expression of remorse to the psychologist, in the absence of scrutiny by way of cross-examination (the respondent not having given evidence on the sentencing hearing).
	
	
	The judge allowed a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the respondent’s early guilty plea, and recorded that he had taken account for the purpose of sentence the offences on the Form 1.
	
	
	In imposing the sentences mentioned above, the judge referred to the need for both specific deterrence and general deterrence. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act to provide for the respondent’s supervision upon his release from full time custody in order to promote his rehabilitation. The judge also took into account that this was the respondent’s first time in custody. The non-parole period of 2 years on the firearms offence represents two thirds of the head sentence.
	


Crown submissions


	
	As already mentioned, the focus of the Crown appeal was on the asserted manifest inadequacy of the sentence on the firearms offence. The Crown submitted that the sentence is lenient to the extent of being “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25].
	
	
	In written submissions the Crown emphasised a number of matters relating to the objective seriousness of the firearms offence including:
	



	
	there were four firearms;
	
	
	all four firearms were prohibited weapons by reason of being shortened;
	
	
	shortened firearms have no legitimate purpose but by reason of ease of concealment are suited for serious criminal activity;
	
	
	the firearms were not stored in an appropriate manner and could be accessible to any associate of the respondent;
	
	
	two of the firearms were loaded and the other two firearms were in a sports bag with a substantial quantity of ammunition and balaclavas; and
	
	
	the respondent was buying and selling firearms, ammunition and other weapons for financial gain.
	



	
	The Crown pointed to the respondent’s previous conviction for a serious firearms offence and the messages on the respondent’s mobile phone which it said indicated that he had multiple contacts with whom he conducted his business. The Crown also pointed to those messages as evidence that the respondent was trading in firearms and other weapons from 28 July 2013, which was less than 6 months after completing a 9 month intensive correction order on the previous firearms offence.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised that the offences were aggravated by being committed whilst the respondent was subject to a bond.
	
	
	The Crown contended that there was little to assist in the respondent’s subjective case other than his youth.
	
	
	The Crown further contended that the sentences imposed failed to account for the objective seriousness of the offences and the need for general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	In supplementary written submissions, the Crown described sentencing judge’s finding of below mid-range objective seriousness as “generous”, but did not directly challenge this finding. The Crown submitted that the starting point for the sentence of 4 years, before applying the 25% discount for the guilty plea, suggested that the judge had little regard to the matters he found to be of aggravation, and matters which contributed to the seriousness of the firearms offence. The Crown also submitted that the starting point leads to the conclusion that the judge had little regard to the guideposts provided by the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period for the firearms offence.
	


Respondent’s submissions


	
	Counsel for the respondent emphasised that it was not alleged that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account any relevant factor. It was contended that the judge had paid careful attention to all relevant legal and factual matters in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences and had taken into account the relevant subjective material including the respondent’s youth and the 12 months he had already spent in custody prior to sentence.
	
	
	It was contended that the sentences imposed were significant custodial sentences which appropriately balanced the need for deterrence with the promotion of rehabilitation of a young offender.
	
	
	The respondent took issue with the Crown’s submission that it would have been abundantly clear to the respondent that he was facilitating serious crime which involved significant risk to life. Counsel noted that the sentencing judge had considered this issue, but came to a different factual finding (see [33] above) which counsel said was open to the judge and moderated the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The respondent also took issue with the Crown’s submission that the sentencing judge should have taken into account the extent of the respondent’s trading of firearms, ammunition and prohibited weapons. Reference was made to R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383. It was submitted that as the respondent had not been charged with offences with respect to buying and selling either firearms, ammunition, or prohibited weapons, the respondent is not to be sentenced for more serious uncharged acts.
	


Principles relating to Crown appeals against sentence


	
	The principles relating to Crown appeals against sentence are well established. It is only necessary to mention that the right of appeal by the Crown against a sentence which is said to be manifestly inadequate is an exceptional one. It must be exercised with restraint, in order to allow the Court to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of the courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons: Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at 310 (Barwick CJ); Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 300 (Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ); Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1] and [36] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ). This particular purpose of Crown appeals is the reason why Crown appeals should be exceptional or a rarity: R v NT [2015] NSWCCA 136 at [54] (Rothman J; Simpson and Bellew JJ agreeing); Attorney General for New South Wales v CMB [2015] NSWCCA 166 at [25].
	
	
	Of course, it must also be accepted that this Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because it would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15].
	
	
	As the High Court observed in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [24], the weight to be given to the evidence and the various, conflicting, purposes of sentencing is a matter for the sentencing judge. It is not sufficient that this Court would have given greater weight to deterrence and less weight to an offender’s subjective case. The High Court also emphasised (at [24]), that an appellate court’s power could only be engaged if it was satisfied that the sentencing judge’s discretion miscarried because in the result the judge imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards.
	
	
	The High Court has recently reaffirmed these principles in CMB v The Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; 317 ALR 308.
	
	
	An appellate court can only intervene in a sentence when the applicant, be it the offender or the Crown, establishes that the sentencing judgment is affected by an error that is either identifiable or to be inferred: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. Manifest inadequacy is a conclusion. It is well established that the Crown must show that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [6]-[8]; Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321.
	
	
	Even if error in a sentencing judgment is found, there is a residual discretion to dismiss the appeal. As explained in CMB v The Attorney General for New South Wales at [33] (French CJ and Gageler J) the discretion is residual in the sense that it does not fall to be considered, unless an error has been established: see also at [54] (Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).
	


Manifest inadequacy


	
	In the present case the Crown does not rely on any specific error of principle. It relies upon the residual category of error in House v The King described in the context of criminal appeals as manifest inadequacy.
	
	
	The Crown did not attempt to demonstrate that the result arrived at by the sentencing judge is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases: see Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58]. Although counsel for the respondent referred to Mack v R as a comparative case, counsel accepted in this Court (at tcpt 15, lines 25-26) that so few cases have been decided under s 51D(2), that no range of sentencing discretion is discernible: Yammine v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 123 at [52]. In Dionys v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 272; 217 A Crim R 280 at [45] Hoeben J (McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing) accepted that the sentencing statistics in relation to, relevantly, s 51D of the Firearms Act were of very limited value in that there were only a small number of cases which had been decided. That remains the case.
	
	
	The Crown’s submission of manifest inadequacy rested upon the proposition that the starting point for the sentence of 4 years, before applying the 25% discount for the guilty plea, is erroneously lenient, especially having regard to: the fact that all four firearms were prohibited weapons by reason of being shortened; the conduct of the respondent; his Honour’s characterisation of the firearms offence as not far below the mid-range of objective seriousness; and the absence of any substantial mitigation other than the respondent’s youth.
	
	
	As to the nature and type of firearms it is necessary to bear in mind the nature of the firearms offence in the present case.
	
	
	The basic offence under s 51D(1) of the Firearms Act prohibits the possession of more than three firearms if the firearms are not registered and the person is not licenced to possess them. This offence attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Section 51D(2) is directed to an aggravated form of this offence and applies where a person is in possession of more than three firearms at least one of which is a prohibited firearm or pistol. The higher maximum sentence of 20 years under s 51D(2) reflects that this is an offence which the legislature regards with considerable gravity: R v Brown [2006] NSWCCA 249 at [20] (Spigelman CJ; Howie and Rothman JJ agreeing).
	
	
	In R v Brown at [21]-[22] Spigelman CJ explained the rationale behind s 51D as follows:
	


When s51D was introduced by the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2002, the Minister said:

“Firearm related crime is a major concern for both police and the community.”

The offence, in a series of offences relating to firearms in the Firearms Act 1996, is directed to persons who are engaged in the warehousing of firearms for sale. A person so engaged plays a critical role in the perpetration by other criminals of the worst crimes of violence in this community. The maximum sentence reflects the important role that such conduct plays in the injuries inflicted upon members of the community by deadly weapons.


	
	Subsequent cases have emphasised that the possession of firearms, except where necessary and by persons authorised to have them, is calculated to lead to substantial damage. Accordingly sentences imposed for such offences must “operate as real disincentives to those otherwise attracted to the illegal position of firearms”: R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219 at [71] (R S Hulme J; Giles JA and Latham J agreeing). See also R v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348 at [66] (Spigelman CJ; Grove J and Smart AJ agreeing); Dionys v The Queen at [47]-[48] (Hoeben J; McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing).
	
	
	As to the conduct of the respondent, although he had the benefit of a finding that there was no evidence to suggest that the weapons were either used by or intended to be used by him in some criminal activity, it remains significant that the judge found that the weapons were kept for, amongst other things, the purpose of profit on the part of the respondent who was clearly engaged in dealing in those weapons.
	
	
	Although there is no challenge to his Honour’s characterisation of the firearms offence as just below the mid-range of objective seriousness, the respondent’s conduct was a serious example of the offence under s 51D(2).
	
	
	First, the circumstance of aggravation referred to in s 51D(2) is that at least one of the three unauthorised firearms in the accused’s possession be a “prohibited firearm”. Here, all four firearms in the respondent’s possession had been shortened and hence was a prohibited firearm.
	
	
	Secondly, and related to the first matter, shortened firearms could have no legitimate purpose. Compact firearms are particularly dangerous because of their capacity for concealment: R v Brown at [23]. This makes them suited for serious criminal activity.
	
	
	Thirdly, all of the firearms were in working order. Two were loaded with ammunition, the other two were in a sports bag containing a quantity of ammunition and none were safely secured at the Airds premises. Again this was particularly dangerous by reason of the accessibility of the firearms to others, including associates of the respondent.
	
	
	Fourthly, on the facts, the respondent was a young person who was in possession of the firearms for the purpose of buying and selling them for financial gain. The text messages on his mobile phone indicate that he had multiple contacts. Even accepting the judge’s finding that the respondent did not have any intention of using the firearms for any criminal activity, the offence was significant because, as the judge found, by engaging in the distribution of firearms the respondent was contributing to the potential use of those weapons for purposes which may have led to serious injury or indeed death.
	
	
	Viewed against the maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years and the standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years, the sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years for the firearms offence, even taking into account the discount for the respondent’s plea, can only be regarded as too short. Together with the maximum penalty, the standard non-parole period was a legislative guidepost to be taken into account on sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. Although not the subject of a separate ground of appeal, it should be noted that the sentencing judge adopted an erroneous approach to the standard non-parole period in the passage cited at [27] above. Since Muldrock v The Queen, it is not correct to approach the use of a standard non-parole period upon the basis that its effect is mitigated by a plea of guilty: Muldrock v The Queen at [22]-[25].
	
	
	The erroneous leniency in the sentence is reinforced by two further matters - the respondent’s prior firearms offences in November 2011 and the seriousness of the five additional weapons and ammunition offences on the Form 1.
	
	
	As to the prior offences, one involved possession of a shortened firearm, namely, a shotgun. The prior offences must have brought home to the respondent the illegality of what he was doing in possessing the firearms the subject of the current charge.
	
	
	As to the matters on the Form 1, the nature of the s 7(1) prohibited weapon offences were serious. This is reflected in the maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and standard non-parole period of 3 years. There could be no legitimate purpose for the possession of these weapons (stun gun; extendable baton; knuckledusters; and taser). The ease of their concealment also made them particularly dangerous. While the maximum penalty for the unauthorised possession of ammunition is only a fine (50 penalty units), in view of the related prohibited weapons and firearms offences, the unauthorised possession of ammunition was nonetheless serious.
	
	
	In taking these additional offences on the Form 1 into account, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate on the principal offence, the sentencing judge was required to give greater weight to the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences: Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42].
	
	
	Against these matters it is to be accepted that the respondent’s youth operated in mitigation of sentence, as did his dysfunctional childhood and adolescence, his problems with alcohol and drugs and his social isolation and distrust of others. However, none of this provides an explanation let alone excuse for the possession of shortened firearms, along with an assortment of other prohibited weapons and ammunition, which the sentencing judge fairly described as approaching an arsenal of weapons.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent argued that rehabilitation took precedence over deterrence and retribution in the present case. Reference was made to R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112, and R v DM [2005] NSWCCA 181 at [61]. Both of those cases involved minors who were 15 years of age at the time of sentencing and in both cases, s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) was engaged. In the case of an extremely young offender such as a minor, more emphasis can be given to rehabilitation, even at the expense of deterrence.
	
	
	It may be accepted that similar principles may apply in the case of a young offenders who are no longer a minor: Tammer-Spence v R [2013] NSWCCA 297 at [37]. Accordingly, in cases such as the present, regard should be had to the age of the young person and the circumstances of the offence: R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92; 145 A Crim R 434 at [28].
	
	
	Nonetheless, in R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 469, Hunt CJ at CL (McInerney and Sully JJ agreeing) observed:
	


… where a youth conducts himself in the way an adult might conduct himself and commits a crime of considerable gravity, the protective function of the criminal courts would cease to operate unless deterrence and retribution remained significant considerations in sentencing that youth: Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135; Allam (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 April 1993) at p 4; Hawkins (1993) 67 A Crim R 64 at 66.

Similar statements appear in KT v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571 at [23]-[26] (McClellan CJ at CL) and [102]-[106] (Hall J; Price J agreeing); and Em v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 336 at [110]-[111] (Giles JA; Grove and Hidden JJ agreeing).


	
	In the present case the respondent had prior convictions for similar related firearms offences two years earlier. Notwithstanding his youth, the respondent conducted himself in the way an adult might and committed a crime of considerable gravity. The sentence imposed on the firearms offence leads inevitably to the conclusion that the judge wrongly allowed the respondent’s subjective case, in particular his youth, to so dominate matters relevant to sentence, that it became determinative of the sentence imposed on the firearms offence. His Honour characterised the firearms offence as just below the mid-range of objective seriousness. It is difficult to reconcile that assessment, in light of the finding as to the purpose of the firearms, with the sentence imposed on the respondent.
	
	
	I conclude that a manifestly inadequate sentence has resulted in the sense that it can be properly described as being “unreasonable or plainly unjust”.
	


Resentence


	
	There remains the question of the residual discretion to decline to intervene with the sentence even where it is found to be manifestly inadequate: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [1]-[2].
	
	
	It is for the Crown, when asserting manifest adequacy, to negate any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised: CMB v The Attorney General for New South Wales at [32]-[39] (French CJ and Gageler J); [57]-[66] (Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).
	
	
	The Crown submits that there is no apparent reason why the residual discretion not to interfere should be exercised. Although the category of factors to be considered in the exercise of the residual discretion is not closed, relevant factors were collected in R v Reeves [2014] NSWCCA 154 at [17]. Factors relevant in the present case are: any delay in the institution of the Crown appeal or the period in which there was likely to be a resolution of the Crown appeal; the length of time which the respondent has already spent in custody and the timing of his likely release on parole; and the disruption of the respondent’s progress towards rehabilitation.
	
	
	As to the first matter, there is no dispute that the filing of the notice of appeal was prompt. The matter has been heard with reasonable expedition. There has been no relevant delay in the institution or resolution of the Crown appeal.
	
	
	As to the second matter, that the respondent has served a large part (approximately 19 months) of the 2 year non-parole period is attributable, in large part, to the time spent in custody before the sentencing hearing occurred. The respondent first entered into custody on his arrest on 29 November 2013, and remained in custody up until his sentence on 21 November 2014. There is no evidence which explains this delay in the proceedings. Counsel for the respondent stated from the bar table, and this was not controverted by the Crown, that the time between arrest and sentence was related to discussions and negotiations with the Crown as to the formulation of the various charges and the matters listed on the Form 1. Reference was also made to suggested delays in the provision of the Crown brief, but there was no evidence in this regard.
	
	
	The impending expiry of the non-parole period at the end of November 2015 is a relevant consideration to be taken into account: Green v The Queen; Quinn v the Queen at [43]. However, in all the circumstances, it may not be determinative: see R v Machtas (1992) 62 A Crim R 179. In the present case, the imminence of the respondent’s eligibility to apply for release on parole needs to be balanced against the absence of any relevant delay in the Crown appeal and the matter next considered.
	
	
	As to the third matter, counsel for the respondent relied upon an affidavit from the respondent sworn 30 May 2015 as evidence of what has happened between the time of sentence and the hearing of the appeal. The following matters relevantly emerge from the respondent’s affidavit:
	



	
	he has been drug and alcohol free since being taken into custody on 20 November 2013 ([sic] 29 November 2013);
	
	
	in January 2015 he commenced the Getting Smart Program for drug rehabilitation but the program was cancelled for reasons unrelated to the respondent;
	
	
	he has completed a vocational and community engagement program and workplace safety program, being a three day course. He has also undertaken an IT course; and
	
	
	he has maintained regular phone contact with his mother who remains supportive and upon his release he proposes to live with his mother in Bradbury and work with his stepfather doing gyprocking and plastering.
	



	
	Against this there have been two breaches of gaol discipline in 2014. One related to possession of a mobile phone and sim card; the other related to possession of an offensive weapon or instrument. Counsel for the respondent tendered a letter from the Parklea Correctional Centre, dated 25 September 2014, where the respondent is now housed, concerning the mobile phone and sim card infringement. It seems to have been accepted by Mr Jones, the Correctional Manager at Parklea, that at least with respect to the mobile phone, the respondent had been forced to take ownership by another prisoner.
	
	
	The respondent’s affidavit demonstrates an acceptance that he needs to undertake relevant counselling with respect to use of drugs and alcohol, but he has not yet had an opportunity to participate in an appropriate program. To the extent that the respondent has completed some vocational programs, these are relatively minor. Whilst the evidence is that the respondent has remained drug free in custody, his progress towards rehabilitation can only be described as limited.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider that the Crown has established that this Court should decline to exercise its discretion not to re-sentence the respondent.
	
	
	In resentencing on the firearms offence, an appropriate commencing point is 7 years which, after the 25% discount for the plea, reduces to 5 years and 3 months. The Crown did not challenge the finding of special circumstances below or in the Court. I would make the same finding and impose a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	Accordingly the orders I propose are:
	


1.   Appeal allowed.

2.   Quash the sentence imposed on the respondent by Phegan ADCJ on 21 November 2014 with respect to the firearms offence.

3.   In lieu thereof sentence the respondent, in respect of the charge under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 29 November 2013 and expiring on 28 November 2016, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 29 November 2016 and expiring on 28 February 2019.


	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with Gleeson JA.

		03 July 2015",2015-07-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767097,Siddiqi v Regina (Commonwealth) [2015] NSWCCA 169,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Wilson J, where the relevant facts and circumstances have been set out. It is unnecessary to restate the facts of the offence.
	
	
	I agree with her Honour, for the reasons she gives, that Ground 1 of the appeal must be upheld. The consequence of that is that this Court must proceed to resentence, exercising its own sentencing discretion, without using the sentence imposed at first instance as a starting point or measure: see Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90 at [76]-[84].
	
	
	That being so, it is unnecessary to consider whether, and if so, to what extent, the error influenced the sentence imposed by Walmsley DCJ.
	
	
	Strictly speaking, it is also unnecessary to rule upon Ground 2, which raises an interesting, and to my knowledge, previously unexplored, question in relation to sentence appeals where parity is raised as a ground.
	
	
	That question is whether, when one or more of the disparate sentences under consideration follow trial, and one or more follow a plea or pleas of guilty, the measuring rod is the starting point of the sentence or sentences which have been reduced by reason of the plea(s) of guilty, or the sentence(s) actually imposed after reduction for that reason. To an offender, of course, the issue is the time to be served: see Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. But where parity issues are raised, it is necessary to examine the sentence(s) in order to establish whether there are legitimate circumstances that explain and justify the disparity. Such circumstances include the whole range of sentencing considerations such as the age of the offender, past criminal history, level of involvement in the offence(s), prospects of rehabilitation, any mental illness or intellectual disability that affects culpability, and any evidence of disadvantaged background, to name the most common.
	
	
	The weight to be given to all of these factors is a matter for the sentencing judge (Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451), but may go some way to explaining an otherwise obscure disparity in the sentences imposed on co-offenders. A reduction allowed in respect of a plea of guilty to a state offence is, unlike the weight given to other sentencing considerations, usually quantified: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. That is not necessarily the case where the offence in respect of which sentence is to be passed is an offence against the law of the Commonwealth.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the significance attributed to the reduction allowed in respect of pleas of guilty, I would stop short of holding that reduction(s) allowed in respect of sentences that are before this Court only peripherally, as they are when parity is in issue, was excessive. Nevertheless, the reduction may explain otherwise disparate sentences. As will be seen below, that is so in this case. Absent his plea of guilty, Lee, with a greater role in the offence, would have been sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years. Absent his plea of guilty, Ngo, with a role equivalent to that of the applicant, would have been sentenced to imprisonment to 7 years and 6 months.
	
	
	In the resentencing exercise in this case, the principles of parity must be borne in mind. There are a number of distinguishing circumstances. One is the sentencing judge’s finding with respect to the prospects of rehabilitation of each of the offenders. In the applicant’s case he expressed caution by reason of the applicant’s continued denial of his involvement. In Ngo’s case he found that the prospects were “good” and that Ngo had done well since his release on bail. In Lee’s case he noted “very good references” and found that Lee had also had good prospects of rehabilitation and was at low risk of reoffending, and had gone a very long way to rehabilitating himself. He described this as “a remarkable achievement”.
	
	
	Another relevant differentiating circumstance was the applicant’s criminal record (which, it is already been established, was wrongly taken into account). Ngo had “one minor criminal matter” and was held to be entitled to some leniency. The applicant ought to be treated similarly, reliance on his criminal record ought be discarded.
	
	
	Lee’s criminal record was said to be “not good”, but nevertheless such as to “permit some leniency”.
	
	
	As to the roles in the commission of the offence, his Honour held that the applicant and Ngo were roughly equivalent; Lee’s involvement was slightly greater.
	
	
	In my opinion, the sentences imposed on Ngo and Lee have considerable bearing on the resentencing exercise this Court must undertake. But that brings me back to the question posed earlier: does this Court have regard to the starting point of the sentences, or the reduced sentences? At least in the circumstances of this case, it is the starting point of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders that must guide the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	In my opinion, it is appropriate that the applicant be sentenced similarly Ngo. I would therefore impose a sentence of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months, which coincides with the sentence imposed by Walmsley DCJ. In keeping with the structure of the sentences imposed on both co-offenders, I would impose a non-parole period of 50 per cent of the head sentence, that is, 2 years and 10 months. That, too, coincides with the non-parole period imposed by Walmsley DCJ.
	
	
	The consequence is that I agree with Wilson J that, while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal ought to be dismissed.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I have read in draft the reasons for judgment of Wilson J. Her Honour recites the relevant facts and circumstances. Those facts and circumstances are relatively uncontroversial.
	
	
	I have also had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Simpson J.
	
	
	I agree that ground one of the appeal has been made out and, for that reason, the appeal must be upheld. Further, I accept that the error disclosed by taking into account an offence or offences found proved in 2006, which offences did not proceed to a conviction recorded against the applicant, is an error that could have affected the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge and, in my view, warrants the grant of leave to appeal.
	
	
	In the foregoing circumstances, it is, pursuant to the principles established by the High Court of Australia in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 88 ALJR 947, necessary to proceed to re-sentence and, therefore, it is unnecessary to determine whether the second ground of appeal has been established as an error by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	On the question of re-sentencing I have a different view from that expressed by Simpson J and Wilson J and, therefore, this judgment will be in dissent. As a consequence, I will summarise the basis upon which I differ from those judges more succinctly than might otherwise be the case.
	
	
	As expressed by Wilson J, there is no real issue between the Crown and the applicant that the objective criminality of the applicant and the co-offenders was similar, if not identical, in most relevant respects. Further, there is no real issue between the Crown and the applicant that each of the co-offenders (including the applicant) had similar subjective cases. However, of the three co-offenders, only the applicant had no relevant criminal history. I refer to the recitation of objective and subjective circumstances in the reasons for judgment of Wilson J.
	
	
	As the High Court has made clear, equal justice is an embodiment of the norm expressed in the term “equality before the law”: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28]. The principle of equal justice requires identical treatment of cases that are relevantly identical. It also requires different treatment of cases that are relevantly different.
	
	
	Moreover, a court of appeal interferes in the case of different sentences on the ground of disparity only where the disparity is such that it gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295. That sense of grievance is measured on an objective basis: Green & Quinn at [31].
	
	
	Courts will, on appeal, refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by relevant differences between co-offenders: Green & Quinn at [31]. Implicit in the foregoing is that, in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, a sentence should be set which differs from the sentence imposed upon co-offenders only to the extent justified by such relevant differences, namely, the subjective and objective circumstances of the offender and the offence. So much accords with the norm of equality before the law and/or equal justice.
	
	
	Differences between persons who are sentenced or to be sentenced must be rational. In other words, even in cases where the circumstances of different co-offenders point to the imposition of a different sentence, the sentence imposed on each should be different only to the extent that it rationally reflects the relevant differences between them.
	
	
	A comparison of the applicant and his two co-offenders, particularly Mr Ngo, discloses that they were relevantly identical. The only relevant difference between them was the plea of the applicant’s two co-offenders. In each case, the plea was entered on the morning of the trial. As such, in accordance with principle, a discount of approximately 10%, and on no basis more than 15%, would ordinarily be allowed.
	
	
	In the words of Hall J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J agreed) in Petterson v R [2013] NSWCCA 133, recited at length by Wilson J in her reasons for judgment in this appeal:
	


“The parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28].” Petterson v R [2013] NSWCCA 133 at [43].


	
	The only “different circumstances” between the applicant and the co-offenders are the pleas of guilty, which rationally explain a difference in sentence such that the co-offenders would receive a sentence 10-15% lower than the applicant.
	
	
	It is not for this Court, in this appeal, to determine that the sentence imposed upon each of the applicant’s co-offenders was otherwise than that authorised by authority or was wrong in law. Those sentences were imposed and were not the subject of a Crown appeal. It is not suggested that the sentences imposed upon the applicant’s co-offenders were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing, there is a rational basis for a difference between the applicant’s sentence and the sentence imposed on his two co-offenders in that each of the co-accused was entitled to a discount for his plea of guilty. There can be no justifiable sense of grievance (objectively determined) associated with a different sentence that reflects those pleas of guilty.
	
	
	As earlier stated, it is not for this Court, in these proceedings, to determine that the sentence imposed upon the co-offenders was wrong or inconsistent with authority. The sentence must be taken as valid and, particularly given the absence of an appeal by the Crown, should be taken as a sentence within range for the offences and offender concerned.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the co-offender with the most severe sentence received a head sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment and a non-parole period of 3 years’ imprisonment. Rationally, the plea of guilty can explain as much as 15% of the sentence that the co-offender received less than the applicant. In my view, the appropriate sentence for the applicant is therefore one which accommodates that rational difference but no other difference.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I would propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal granted;
	
	
	The sentence imposed by the District Court on the applicant on 20 March 2013 be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentence by imposed;
	



	
	The applicant be sentenced to a head sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.
	



	
	WILSON J: On 15 October 2012 the applicant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Walmsley SC, sitting in the District Court, on an indictment charging a single count of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug into Australia, an offence contrary to ss.11.2A(1) and 307.2(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995. He entered a plea of not guilty. Nine days later, on 24 October 2012, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge.
	
	
	On 20 March 2013 a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months was imposed upon the applicant. A non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months was specified. The sentence commenced on 28 January 2013 and expires on 27 July 2020. The non-parole period expires on 27 October 2016.
	
	
	The maximum sentence specified for this offence is one of 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on two grounds: the first asserts error in taking into account offences in the applicant’s criminal history where no conviction was imposed; the second ground raises a parity issue. The second ground was added at the hearing of the appeal with the Court’s leave. The Crown did not oppose leave being granted.
	


The Proceedings in the District Court


	
	The Crown case against the applicant was that he and two others, Christian Lee and Andrew Ngo, were involved in the importation into Australia of a quantity of 2.184 kilograms of cocaine. The cocaine had an average purity of 67.62 per cent, giving a pure weight of 1.48 kilograms.
	
	
	In February or March 2010 the applicant went to the Chester Hill home of a school friend, Mitchell Carney, and asked Mr. Carney’s brother if he could have a package mailed to that address. The applicant offered $500 in return. Although the applicant attended the home subsequently on a number of occasions, no package in fact arrived.
	
	
	In late June or early July 2010 the applicant approached Mitchell Carney, whom he had known as a friend since primary school, and asked him to accept delivery at his home address of a package containing car parts. When Mr. Carney told his father about the delivery, his father refused to have the package sent to the home. Mr. Carney told the applicant what his father had said, and was then offered $500 to take delivery of the package which, the applicant said, was already on its way.
	
	
	The applicant also offered another school friend, Josh Hamilton, the same sum to accept delivery of a package to his home address.
	
	
	Both Mr. Carney and Mr. Hamilton were asked to write down their names and telephone numbers, and to let the applicant know when the packages arrived. They were instructed not to open the packages.
	
	
	The applicant subsequently attended the Carney home on a number of occasions, inquiring of Mr. Carney’s sister if the package had arrived.
	
	
	Using a mobile telephone with false subscriber details, he attempted to contact Mr. Carney on a number of occasions. He was also in contact at around this time with Christian Lee and Andrew Ngo, who were also using mobile telephones subscribed with false information.
	
	
	On 20 July 2010 Mr. Lee, driving a white Audi, was stopped by police officers from the Highway Patrol. He was found to be in possession of a number of items, amongst them two mobile telephones, boxes and invoices from the purchase of other mobile telephones and, on the back of a mobile telephone he had secreted inside his underwear, a number written on a post-it note affixed to the telephone.
	
	
	The number was later determined to be the consignment number of the package shipped to Mr. Carney’s address.
	
	
	The package arrived in Australia on 21 July 2010 and was intercepted by police. Inside were a number of Spanish language books that had been published in Mexico. Cavities in the books contained cocaine.
	
	
	Mitchell Carney, as the consignee, was spoken to by police. He provided them with the applicant’s details.
	
	
	On 19 January 2011 police executed a search warrant upon the applicant’s home in Chester Hill. In his bedroom, a handwritten note relating to the false subscriber details of one of the mobile telephones used by the men was found. The applicant was arrested by police.
	
	
	The applicant was interviewed, but denied any knowledge of the consignment addressed to Mitchell Carney. He acknowledged knowing Mr. Carney and Mr. Ngo from school, and having visited the Carney house, but claimed his attendance there was in relation to something else. He gave evidence in similar terms at his trial. Inherent in the jury’s verdict is the rejection of that evidence.
	
	
	Andrew Ngo was arrested on 3 March 2011. On 8 September 2011 premises where Christian Lee stayed were searched, and he was subsequently arrested.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded that, although he could not fully identify the individual roles of the applicant and Andrew Ngo, he was satisfied that each was actively involved in the recruitment of innocent agents to receive the cocaine, and each was an active participant in the plan. His Honour found that the roles of the applicant and Andrew Ngo were roughly equal, with that of Christian Lee involving slightly higher criminality. The applicant’s motivation, his Honour found, was financial, although the return to him would have been very modest.
	
	
	The applicant was aged 19 at the time of the commission of the offence. He was born in Afghanistan in 1991 and came to Australia in 1999. The applicant initially did very well at school but, towards the end of his school years he suffered a broken leg which affected his sporting activities, and thereafter his school work. He completed his Higher School Certificate.
	
	
	A report from a psychologist indicated that the applicant had a major depressive disorder.
	
	
	His Honour was not able to give the applicant the benefit of any expressions of remorse, since he continued at that stage to deny his guilt. Because of that, his Honour was also cautious as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The applicant had an entry against him from the Children’s Court, and the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant’s criminal record did not permit “much leniency”.
	


The Application for Leave to Appeal against Sentence


	
	If granted leave, the applicant advances two grounds of appeal against the purported severity of sentence.
	


“Ground 1: His Honour erred in taking into account on sentence offences found proved without a conviction recorded in 2006”


	
	The entries that the sentencing judge referred to in his remarks on sentence were from Bidura Children’s Court on 3 October 2006, reflecting a finding of guilt with respect to two counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, and one of entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse. No convictions were recorded for any of the offences.
	
	
	In relation to the two counts of armed robbery, the Children’s Court imposed bonds upon the applicant for a period of two years, with the supervision of the Juvenile Justice Office. An unsupervised bond for twelve months was imposed for the enclosed lands offence.
	
	
	The applicant had no other entries in his criminal history.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant’s criminal record, the sentencing judge said,
	


“His record does not permit much leniency. There was a significant matter in the Children’s Court.”


	
	The applicant contends, and the Crown concedes, that, in taking the Children’s Court entries into account, the sentencing judge erred.
	
	
	His Honour’s attention was not drawn to s.15(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, which provides,
	


“15 Evidence of prior offences and other matters not admissible in certain criminal proceedings

(1) The fact that a person has pleaded guilty to an offence in, or has been found guilty of an offence by, a court (being an offence committed when the person was a child) shall not be admitted in evidence (whether as to guilt or the imposition of any penalty) in any criminal proceedings subsequently taken against the person in respect of any other offence if:

(a) a conviction was not recorded against the person in respect of the first mentioned offence, and

(b) the person has not, within the period of 2 years prior to the commencement of proceedings for the other offence, been subject to any judgment, sentence or order of a court whereby the person has been punished for any other offence.

(2) Subsection (1) or (3) does not apply to any criminal proceedings before the Children’s Court.

(3) The fact that a person has been dealt with by a warning, caution or youth justice conference under the Young Offenders Act 1997 (being in respect of an alleged offence committed when the person was a child) is not to be admitted in evidence (whether as to guilt or the imposition of any penalty) in any criminal proceedings subsequently taken against the person in respect of any other offence.”


	
	In accordance with s.15 of the Act, in circumstances where no conviction was recorded and there were no further offences recorded against the applicant within two years of the non-conviction, the Children’s Court entries were not admissible in the sentence proceedings before his Honour.
	
	
	Whilst the Crown’s submission is that the extent to which the inadmissible evidence affected the sentence imposed upon the applicant is unclear, it plainly had some affect, and perhaps not an insignificant one. His Honour’s comment, extracted at [30] above, suggests that the applicant was denied the leniency which might ordinarily be expected to be allowed to an offender with no relevant criminal history.
	
	
	Error having been established, I would grant leave to the applicant to advance this ground. Whether some other, lesser, sentence is warranted, will be considered below.
	


“Ground 2: The disparity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentences imposed on the co-offenders Lee and Ngo is such as to leave the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance”


	
	His Honour Judge Walmsley sentenced each of the co-offenders. Andrew Ngo, who was convicted of one count of aiding and abetting the importation of a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 10 months. Christian Lee was sentenced for the same offence, with a term of 6 years imprisonment imposed. A non-parole period of 3 years was specified.
	
	
	Each of the co-offenders entered a plea of guilty to the charge brought against him, and each received a reduction of 25% in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. That reduction was allowed despite the pleas having been entered in each case at a late stage of the proceedings.
	
	
	The applicant contends that the only real difference between his case and that of his co-offenders was the late plea of guilty entered by Ngo and Lee; he argues that the late plea does not justify the difference in the sentences and he is left with a legitimate sense of grievance. He relies upon Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 in support of his argument.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the two co-offenders received an unduly generous discount in recognition of the willingness of each to facilitate the course of justice, but it is not in any event the discounted sentences with which the applicant should compare his own. The Crown contends that the appropriate comparators are the sentences that would have been imposed upon Mr. Lee and Mr. Ngo prior to the application of the discount.
	


Consideration


	
	There appears to be no real issue between the parties that the objective criminality of the applicant and the co-offenders was similar, and each had similar subjective cases, although the applicant, alone of the three, had no relevant criminal history.
	
	
	The role of the applicant and that of Andrew Ngo was about the same in the assessment of the sentencing judge, with each recruiting innocent third parties to accept the delivery of packages, and maintaining contact with the third party and each other to facilitate the delivery. His Honour regarded the criminality of Christian Lee as slightly higher than that of the applicant or Ngo. No issue is taken by either party with those conclusions.
	
	
	Each offender was young: the applicant was aged 19 years at the time of the commission of the offence; Ngo was aged 18; and Lee was 23 years of age.
	
	
	The applicant had no criminal convictions. In sentencing Ngo his Honour referred to him as having “only a minor matter on his criminal history” which entitled him to some leniency. In relation to Lee, the sentencing judge said, “his criminal record is not good but it does permit some leniency”.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was unable to reach any positive conclusion about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. Andrew Ngo was by contrast found to have good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour found that Christian Lee also had good prospects of rehabilitation, having “gone a very long way towards rehabilitating himself” by the date of sentence.
	
	
	The non-parole period his Honour fixed in each case was fifty per cent of the total sentence. There is no usual ratio of sentence applicable to Commonwealth offences, and so the sentencing judge must have determined that the non-parole period specified for each was the minimum term that justice required be served, having regard to all of the circumstances of the offence: Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). See generally Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520, and Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525.
	
	
	Nothing in the evidence before the sentencing court suggests any marked distinction between the three offenders.
	
	
	As senior counsel for the applicant submitted in this Court, the only real distinguishing feature was the discount allowed to each of Ngo and Lee in recognition of their pleas, and willingness to facilitate the course of justice.
	
	
	The circumstances and timing of the pleas entered by the co-offenders would not ordinarily suggest that such a significant discount was warranted. In each case the plea was entered on the morning of trial. For Mr. Ngo, this was some six months after the committal for trial and nineteen months after arrest and charge. For Mr. Lee, the plea was entered six months after a committal at which evidence was contested, and thirteen months after arrest and charge.
	
	
	Although this was a federal offence the timing of the plea is still a relevant consideration in determining the extent of the discount to be allowed an offender in recognition of his or her willingness to facilitate the course of justice. Whilst the guideline judgment of R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 in relation to sentence discounts does not strictly apply, the principles have general application to Federal offences: R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196 at [24] to [27].
	
	
	For my part, I would characterise pleas entered in such circumstances as these as late, and not ordinarily attracting a discount of more than 10% on sentence. See generally R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102.
	
	
	The question of a discount to reflect the plea is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge, to be exercised in accordance with principle.
	
	
	Here, his Honour determined to award Lee a discount of 25% because, he said, the Crown had not indicated to the offender at a stage earlier than the trial date that it would not proceed with an additional offence relating to proceeds of crime were Mr. Lee to plead guilty to the importation charge. In relation to Mr. Ngo, the sentencing judge awarded a discount of 25% to him because, although the offender was committed for trial on an importation charge, the indictment presented at arraignment and on the trial date was for aiding and abetting importation.
	
	
	Although the approach adopted by his Honour is contrary to authority and, arguably, the sentences imposed upon Ngo and Lee were too low by virtue of the unduly high discount allowed to each, it is noted that the Crown did not bring an appeal against the sentences imposed upon the two co-offenders.
	
	
	The question for present purposes is, does the sentence imposed upon the applicant give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance in light of the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders such that this Court should interfere to resentence the applicant, and reduce his sentence.
	
	
	The principles relevant to an issue of parity were conveniently summarised from Lowe v The Queen  and Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 by Hall J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J agreed) in Petterson v R [2013] NSWCCA 133 at [43]. The summary is as follows:
	


“(1) It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account: Lowe at 609.

(2) The parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances: Green at [28].

(3) The consistency required by the parity principle is focused on the particular case and applies to the punishment of ""co-offenders"": Green at [29].

(4) The foundation of the parity principle requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application: Green at [30].

(5) Nevertheless, as observed above, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant: Green at [30].

(6) In the exercise of the statutory powers of an appellate court, in appeals by convicted persons, a court may ""reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender"": Green at [31] citing Lowe at [609]-[610].

(7) The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of a person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.

(8) Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a Court of Criminal Appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive: Green at [32].”


	
	Merely pointing to a sentence imposed upon a co-offender which is perceived to be lesser does not of itself establish appealable error or, necessarily, a basis upon which to seek the intervention of an appellate court. It is only where the disparity between sentences is so marked as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance in the offender upon whom the harsher sentence was imposed, or where it gives rise to an appearance of justice not having been done, that the discretion of this Court to intervene is enlivened: Lowe at [610] per Gibbs CJ; Lowe at [618] per Brennan J, and at [624] per Dawson J. See also Green at [32].
	
	
	At the hearing of the application, senior counsel for the applicant provided the Court with a table setting out the sentences of the applicant and the two co-offenders. The table showed the sentences as actually imposed and, for the co-offenders, the sentences as they would have been if the sentencing judge had allowed a discount of 10% on sentence to reflect the willingness of the offenders to facilitate justice, rather than the discount of 25% actually allowed.
	
	
	The applicant’s argument was that the sentencing judge had allowed an overly generous discount in circumstances where the pleas entered by the co-offender’s were late, and should not have merited a 25% reduction. The application of too large a discount had left the applicant “stuck with” a sentence which was considerably longer than those imposed upon Ngo and Lee.
	
	
	The disparity between sentences is completely explained by the discount applied by the sentencing judge to reflect the pleas of guilty. Without any discount, the sentences imposed would have been slightly higher than that imposed upon the applicant, as below:
	



	
		
			
			Applicant
			
			
			Ngo (Without  Discount)
			
			
			Lee (Without Discount)
			
		
		
			
			7 years 6 months imprisonment
			
			
			7 years 7 months imprisonment
			
			
			8 years imprisonment
			
		
		
			
			Non-parole period: 3 years 9 months
			
			
			Non-parole period: 3 years 9 months
			
			
			Non-parole period 4 years
			
		
		
			
			(50% of head sentence)
			
			
			(50% of head sentence, rounded down)
			
			
			(50% of head sentence)
			
		
	



	
	The slight variation in sentence that exists between that imposed upon the applicant and what must have been the starting point for the sentence imposed upon Ngo, whose role and circumstances, other than a minor criminal history, were comparable, is of no significance. Certainly, it is not the sort of marked disparity that the authorities refer to as indicative of possible error.
	
	
	The disparity between the sentences actually imposed upon the three co-offenders is explained by the discount given to Ngo and Lee to reflect the pleas of guilty entered by them. The applicant, who was found guilty at trial, was not entitled to any discount on sentence in recognition of his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. Considered in that way, it cannot be concluded that the applicant’s sense of grievance is a legitimate one.
	
	
	The applicant’s argument, however, is that the discount allowed to Ngo and Lee was erroneously generous and should, having regard to the lateness of the plea, have been no more than 10%. It is the erroneous generosity of the discount which gives rise to the size of the disparity by which the applicant is aggrieved.
	
	
	If the leniency of the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders is explained by error in assessing the extent of the discount allowed them, this Court is not bound to accept those sentences as the yardstick by which the applicant’s sentence is to be judged. An inappropriately low sentence imposed upon a co-offender cannot dictate a reduction in an applicant’s sentence where that sentence is not manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The Crown referred the Court to the decisions in R v Diamond (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 February 1983, unrep), R v Steele (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 17 February 1997, unrep), and R v McIvor [2002] NSWCCA 490; [2002] 136 A Crim R 366 at [371], as authority for the proposition that the applicant’s sentence cannot be legitimately compared with an inappropriately low sentence.
	
	
	Those authorities support a conclusion that the discretion that rests in an appellate court to mitigate disparity should not be exercised to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence to an inadequate level. That view is consistent with both Lowe at [617], and Green v The Queen at [33].
	
	
	The principle was set out by RA Hulme J (with whom Beazley JA and Hidden J agreed) in Youkhana v R [2011] NSWCCA 37 at [49]:
	


“[…] the Court has a discretion and is not bound to intervene if a sentence offends the parity principle. A reason for not intervening is if the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is manifestly inadequate and intervention would ""produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved.""


	
	Intervention is justified where inconsistency of punishment could lead to a loss of public confidence in the administration of our system of criminal justice, but I do not regard that to be the position here. Whilst the applicant’s sentence is higher than that of his co-offenders, and there is disparity, the disparity is explained by the discount on sentence that featured in the sentences of each of the co-offenders, that feature being irrelevant to the applicant.
	
	
	It was submitted by both the applicant and the Crown that, in assessing the extent of the discount on sentence to be allowed to the co-offenders, the sentencing judge’s discretion miscarried. Whilst I agree with those submissions, that does not, of itself, dictate the intervention of this Court in relation to the sentence imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	In such circumstances, for this Court to intervene to reduce the sentence imposed upon the applicant to mitigate the disparity between his sentence and the inappropriately reduced sentences of the co-offenders merely compounds the error.
	
	
	As Brennan J noted in Lowe, at 617,
	


“To say that an appellate court is bound to take the lesser sentence as the norm even though it is inappropriately lenient is tantamount to saying “where you have one wrong sentence and one right sentence [the] Court should produce two wrong sentences” – a proposition that cannot be accepted: per Roskill LJ in Reg. v Stroud [(1977) 65 Cr. App.R. 150 at 152]. I agree with Nagle CJ at CL who said in Tisalandis [[1982] 2 NSWLR 430 at 441]: “to lay down as a principle of law that once disparity was shown to exist a sentence appealed against should be interfered with is so obviously wrong that it needs no argument.”


	
	There is no complaint by the applicant that the sentence imposed upon him is manifestly excessive. Indeed, a ground advancing parity ordinarily signals an acceptance that the sentence is otherwise appropriate: McMullen v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 261 at [49]; England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [251]. That principle was more recently applied by this Court in Saraya v R [2015] NSWCCA 63 at [39].
	
	
	The Crown cited three decisions of the District Court on which it relies to demonstrate that the sentence is an appropriate one.
	
	
	In R v Andrew Zhang (SC08101054), the offender was sentenced by Frearson SC DCJ on 31 July 2009 on one count of aiding and abetting the importation of a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, pursuant to ss.307(2)(1) and 11(2)(1) of the Criminal Code. The offender approached five different people, some of whom were only 16 years of age, asked them for their names and contact details, and had them agree to accept a delivery for him in return for monetary payment. Customs intercepted the five packages finding cocaine concealed within the packages. The gross weight of cocaine was 1971.9 grams. Subsequent analysis revealed the purity of cocaine was between 79.8% and 87.1%, with the net weight of pure cocaine of 1645.8 grams. The value of the intercepted drug, if sold at bulk, was calculated to be between approximately $400,000 and $700,000.
	
	
	The offender was also involved in transferring a total of $25,800 overseas over a period of 4 months.
	
	
	Whilst it was accepted that the offender acted on instructions from another individual, the sentencing judge found the offender to be a highly active organiser and co-ordinator with a middle or upper role in the importation enterprise.
	
	
	The offender was 20 years of age. He was residing with his mother and grandmother. He had a caring and supportive upbringing. He was educated to year 12 level. He had prior convictions for drug possession, assault, damage property and weapons charges. He had been using drugs since the age of 15. He committed the offence motivated by the desire for financial reward in order to support his own substance abuse habit, although the sentencing judge concluded that there was an element of greed in it. He was remorseful and was found to have fair prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The offender received a 25% discount for his willingness to facilitate the course of justice as demonstrated by his plea of guilty.
	
	
	He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 11 months.
	
	
	In R v Vinh Van Tang (SCO81026238) the offender was sentenced by Zahra SC DCJ on 11 December 2009 for 3 counts of importing a marketable quantity of cocaine to Australia contrary to s.307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). 
	
	
	The offences came to light when police intercepted a package that had been delivered to a newsagency and sent from South America. The package contained religious statues in which cocaine was secreted with a bulk weight of 401.1 grams and a pure weight of 264.9 grams. The package was destined for a ‘Keep Me Posted’ post box rented by the offender in a false name. Police also intercepted a package at another newsagency containing cocaine concealed within a facemask. The bulk weight of the drug was 449.9 grams with a pure weight of 264.4 grams. Again, the offender had rented the post box in a false name. A third package was intercepted at a Sydney airport containing cocaine concealed within wooden flutes. It was addressed to a post office box rented by the offender at a third newsagency. The bulk weight was 278.3 grams with a pure weight of 216.5 grams. The offender claimed that he was paid to collect the packages for a friend and had no knowledge of their contents.
	
	
	The offender was 19 years of age, born in Malaysia and of Vietnamese descent. He arrived in Australia as a refugee with his family. He had substantial family support. In Year 10 he suffered a bicycle accident and as a result of extensive rehabilitation, he felt unable to return to Year 11 as he had missed a significant period of schooling. His Honour concluded that the offender had an intellectual disability and was susceptible to manipulation by the principal offender. The offender had no prior criminal history. Judge Zahra found that the offender was motivated by financial reward.
	
	
	The offender was sentenced for 5 years imprisonment for each of the three sentences with an accumulation of one year between each sentence. The total effective sentence of was imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period 4 years.
	
	
	In R v Vahe Georkjian (SC071011158) the offender was sentenced in the District Court on 21 December 2009 for one count of aiding and abetting the importation of a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, pursuant to ss.307(2)(1) and 11(2)(1) of the Criminal Code. He was also dealt with on one count of Supply Prohibited Drug pursuant to State legislation.
	
	
	In intercepted telephone conversations with a man in the United States, the offender arranged importation of a package and discussed sending his offsider to the States. Customs subsequently intercepted and examined a suspicious packaged addressed to John of Body King Smash Repairs, a business registered in the name of the offender’s brother and operating out of premises owned by the offender’s company. The consignment was a large box attached to a small wooden pallet with a weight of approximately 68 kilograms. Inside the box was an item declared to be a 2002 Volvo brake drum. AFP officers detected the presence of cocaine welded within the lining of the brake drum. The consignment was unique in design so substitution of the drugs was impossible.
	
	
	Police intercepted telephone calls made by the offender regarding the receipt of the consignment. The package was delivered to the Smash Repair premises and the offender was arrested.
	
	
	The total weight of the substance within the drum was 2,950 grams with a net weight of 1,753.2 grams of pure cocaine. The street value was between approximately $1 million and $1.4 million.
	
	
	The offender was 47 years of age, of Armenian descent. He had migrated to Australia with his family at the age of 13. He completed an apprenticeship in panel beating, and had established a successful panel beating business. However, the company went into liquidation after the collapse of the insurance companies HIH and FAI. The offender’s attempts to recover the business led to great stress and the breakdown of his marriage, which in turn led him to commence using cocaine some two years prior to the offence (although there was a much longer history of cannabis use). The offender subsequently managed to establish a successful property development company, and he was described as a hardworking man of prior good character.
	
	
	The offender purchased cocaine from the principal. Whilst acknowledging he knew that the principal imported cocaine, he denied any knowledge of this particular importation until the day the package arrived. Other explanations for the intercepted conversation were offered. The sentencing judge did not accept the offender’s claims, and found the offender’s involvement to be more substantial. Nevertheless, the offender’s role was assessed to fall at a lower end, below that of two co-offenders.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial to an alternative count. The sentencing judge took into account the offender’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice but noted the plea was a recognition of the inevitable in light of the strong Crown case. The offender offered assistance to the authorities and undertook to give evidence against his co-offenders. He was afforded a discount of 35% in recognition of the plea and assistance.
	
	
	The offender had no criminal record, was remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Having considered sentences imposed on the co-offenders, on the relevant charge the sentencing judge sentenced the offender to 5 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The total effective sentence incorporating the State offence was imprisonment for 6 years and 10 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.
	
	
	Three sentencing decisions of the District Court do not, of course, establish a range for an offence of this nature: Hili, at [53]. They do though, support the concession of the applicant, implicit in the parity ground, that the sentence of which he complains is not manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Such grievance as the applicant may feel when comparing the sentence imposed upon him is not, in my view, justifiable. His sentence compares favourably to those imposed upon Ngo and Lee prior to the application of the discount. The fact that the sentencing judge reduced the sentences by too great an amount, leading to the imposition of inappropriately lenient sentences on the co-offenders may leave the applicant feeling aggrieved, but his grievance is not legitimate.
	
	
	Although I would grant leave to the applicant to advance this ground, I do not regard error as having been established, and would not uphold this ground.
	


Should this Court Impose a Lesser Sentence?


	
	Error having been established in relation to ground 1, the question remains as to whether or not this Court should intervene to re-sentence the applicant. Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is in these terms.
	


“(3) On an appeal under section 5 (1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.”


	
	Even where error has been established, an appellate court is not obliged to interfere with the sentence imposed at first instance if no lesser sentence is warranted in law. The task of the appellate court in such circumstances is to re-exercise afresh the sentencing discretion: Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90, at [84].
	
	
	The underlying principle, however, is that the sentence imposed must not be one which is disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved. Having regard to both of those features, I do not think this Court should intervene to reduce the sentence imposed upon the applicant. Having considered all of the admissible evidence that was before the sentencing judge to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, I would not impose any lesser sentence than that which was imposed at first instance. Any lesser sentence would, in my view, amount to one which is inadequate.
	
	
	That is particularly so with respect to the non-parole period. A ratio of 50% of sentence, leading to a non-parole period of three years and nine months, represents a markedly lenient approach.
	
	
	Any reduction in the sentence imposed would have the effect of lowering it to one which is incapable of reflecting the serious criminality of which the applicant was found guilty, or of fulfilling other relevant purposes of sentence, including that of general and specific deterrence, denunciation, and adequate punishment.
	
	
	That being so, although I would grant the applicant leave, I would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Order that leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	Order that the appeal be dismissed.

2767099,R v Gilmore; R v Pleace; R v Vatalis [2015] NSWDC 215,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Appearing today for sentence are three people, Jordana Vatalis, Troy Pleace and Troy Gilmore. They have each pleaded guilty to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. In addition, Mr Gilmore has pleaded guilty to an offence of break and enter with intent to steal, and when I sentence him for that matter he asks that I take into account a number of other matters, two offences of attempted break, enter and steal, an offence of possess housebreaking implements, and an offence of common assault. All of those offences were committed at around the same time as the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence. I will deal firstly with the facts of that offence.
	
	
	In early December 2013, a man by the name of Benjamin Greeney, who had previously been in a relationship with Ms Vatalis, was at home. There was a knock at the door. He answered the door and he saw Mr Pleace. He knew Mr Pleace from previous dealings. He knew that Mr Pleace was involved in a relationship with Ms Vatalis. He allowed Mr Pleace to come into his home. After a while, Mr Greeney asked Mr Pleace to leave his unit and he did so. However, about half an hour later there was another knock at the door. When he opened the door this time, Mr Pleace had returned and so had Ms Vatalis and Mr Gilmore. Mr Greeney knew Mr Pleace, as I mentioned, and he also knew Ms Vatalis. Indeed, earlier that day he had had an argument with her.
	
	
	Violence erupted soon afterwards. Mr Gilmore punched Mr Greeney to his face, which caused him to stumble backwards into his unit. Mr Gilmore punched him a further number of times as Mr Greeney put up his arms around his head to protect himself. He fell over near a doorway within his unit and was kicked in the stomach by Mr Pleace. Mr Gilmore then picked up an acoustic guitar and hit Mr Greeney across the back with it. He tried to get up but was grabbed by one of the offenders and tackled to the ground.
	
	
	Mr Pleace then went over to the victim. Everyone noticed that he was holding a knife that he had obtained from Mr Greeney’s bedroom. It is accepted by the prosecution that neither Ms Vatalis nor Mr Gilmore knew of the presence of a knife before Mr Pleace armed himself with it. It was a knife with a significant blade, about 30 centimetres long. Mr Pleace threatened Mr Greeney by saying “don’t tell anyone about this. If anyone asks, you don’t know anything, otherwise I’ll come back and kill you.” Mr Greeney, perhaps thinking that the matter was over, went to stand up. In response, Ms Vatalis struck him to the head with the acoustic guitar.
	
	
	Ms Vatalis then walked towards the front door and told the others “let’s go.” She walked out of the unit. As a parting gesture perhaps, Mr Pleace approached Mr Greeney and held the knife towards him and said something, verbally threatening Mr Greeney with the use of the knife. Mr Greeney closed his eyes in fear and when he opened them he saw Mr Pleace and Mr Gilmore leaving the unit. Mr Greeney closed the door. He did not call police at first. He noticed that he was injured and fell asleep.
	
	
	The following day he did contact police and report the assault. The injuries that he sustained in the attack were photographed. He sustained a fractured left middle finger, which was managed without an operation being necessary by being immobilised in a splint, as well as bruising, tenderness and abrasions to his face, head, left shoulder and forearm. The three offenders were arrested fairly soon after the events I have described. As I mentioned, Mr Gilmore is not only to be sentenced for that matter but also for another offence.
	
	
	The other offence for which Mr Gilmore is to be sentenced occurred in the following circumstances. The offender and another person walked into the grassed common lawn area of a block of units in Surry Hills. Accessible from that area is a balcony of a man by the name of Robin Stevenson. Mr Gilmore has seen Mr Stevenson’s balcony and pushed through some bushes onto that balcony. The female accompanied him. Mr Gilmore produced a screwdriver and began looking closely at the lock of the balcony door. It is clear, and his plea of guilty acknowledges it, that he was intending to break into the premises, using the screwdriver if necessary, and then steal whatever he could within it. Before he did that he put his face to the glass balcony door to look inside.
	
	
	Mr Stevenson observed all of this and he smacked the glass door to scare Mr Gilmore away. He opened the glass sliding door and yelled through the steel security door “get off my balcony, get the fuck off my balcony.” Fortunately, Mr Gilmore and the female did. They started to run away.
	
	
	Mr Stevenson took his camera phone and began following the two, intending to take a photo of them. He did manage at one stage to take three good quality photos of Mr Gilmore and the female from about 2 metres away. That is the offence for which Mr Gilmore must be specifically sentenced. When I sentence him for that matter I take into account a number of other offences which I will shortly describe. Whilst following the two, Mr Stevenson called police. At one stage, Mr Gilmore turned around and threatened Mr Stevenson saying “wanna go mate?” running at Mr Stevenson as he did so. This caused Mr Stevenson to run away in fear of being assaulted.
	
	
	All of this occurred in the evening of 9 December. The following morning the offender tried to break into two other premises, in each case by trying the glass door on the balcony of a home unit. As he did so, he was being observed by a witness who contacted the police. Eventually he was arrested and when searched he was found to have a number of items in his possession, in particular a screwdriver with a yellow and black handle, and a green coloured gardening glove. By his plea of guilty he admits that those items and others found with him were housebreaking implements.
	
	
	It is to be noted that Mr Gilmore had been released from custody only very shortly before committing the offences that I have described. He was on parole at the time of this offence. I regard that as an aggravating feature of his offending but in order not to double count, despite the fact that his parole was revoked, I will commence the sentence that I will impose upon him from the date of his arrest. While mentioning breaches of conditional liberty I should refer to the circumstances at the time of her offending. Ms Vatalis was on a s 9 bond.
	
	
	Each of them has pleaded guilty to the offences that I have described but not in identical circumstances. Ms Vatalis and Mr Pleace pleaded guilty in this Court relatively shortly before a trial was due to commence after negotiations resulted in them pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. Mr Gilmore offered to plead to that offence whilst the matter was in the Local Court but the prosecution did not accept that offer, I am told on the basis that because Ms Vatalis and Mr Pleace were not willing to plead guilty at that stage, Mr Gilmore’s plea would not be accepted either. He pleaded guilty to the attempt break enter matter with intent to steal in the Local Court. Accordingly, the sentences I impose upon Ms Vatalis and Mr Pleace will be 15% less than they would otherwise have been, and the sentence on Mr Gilmore 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Of course, I have to ensure that no offender has a justifiable sense of grievance when he or she compares the sentence that he or she has received with sentences imposed upon co-offenders. I have taken into account the various differences between the objective and subjective circumstances. I have also taken into account when the pleas of guilty were entered. As it turns out, the sentences for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company that I will impose upon Mr Pleace and Mr Gilmore are identical, but that is not the result of overlooking the principle of parity but applying it.
	
	
	Each of the offenders has faced a number of challenges as they were growing up. I will deal with Ms Vatalis first. She was brought up in a loving and caring home. She has two sisters, one of whom is a twin to her. There is nothing in her home life which would explain the problems she has caused to her family, apart from the significant circumstance that she has been sexually abused by extended family members over a number of years. As a psychologist noted, not unexpectedly, she acted out in her high school years with major behavioural problems. She began to be attracted to antisocial activities including fascist ideology and neo-Nazism. She told the psychologist that she was full of hatred and did not know how to express herself. She left school at 16, before she was to be suspended. She says she was bullied at school and had few friends.
	
	
	It is in these circumstances that it is not terribly surprising to learn that Ms Vatalis is one of those whose life has been dominated by illicit drug use and the desire to obtain funds to support that drug use. Although she has been able to get jobs from time to time, she was unable to keep a job because she was using too many drugs. At the demand of one of her past boyfriends, she began to support her drug use through sex work. She has a criminal history, solely referable as I see it to her drug use. This is her first time in prison. She is currently bail refused. She has made attempts at rehabilitation but they have failed. In one case indeed she was granted bail pending resolution of this matter on condition that she go to WHOS but discharged herself without completing the program, thus breaching her bail, and she went back into custody.
	
	
	She is supported in court today by her family. They are willing to have her home again. It is to their great credit that they are prepared to do so despite the enormous pain that she must have caused them in the past. She has a good relationship with her sisters and her parents. I am not under any illusions about the ease with which Ms Vatalis will be able to conduct herself lawfully upon release from custody. We regularly see long term drug addicts with the best of intentions leaving custody and falling back into their drug‑using ways at the first sign of stress or upset.
	
	
	Ms Vatalis has desires for the future. Whether she succeeds or not is entirely up to her. She must know however that if she reoffends, not only will she cause her family even more suffering but she will go back to gaol for longer and longer periods until she is one of those terribly sad offenders, such as one of her co-offenders, who spends such a significant part of her life in custody that it is effectively wasted, missing out on important family events. One such family event which is coming up is the marriage of her sister. It was Mr Hallas’s submission that the sentence of imprisonment imposed on Ms Vatalis should be such that she could attend that wedding on 18 July. Ordinarily I would have imposed a sentence which was slightly longer than a sentence which would have allowed such attendance, but given the small difference between the sentence I initially contemplated and a sentence which would allow her to go the wedding, and in acknowledgement of the circumstance that there is no one correct sentence for any particular matter, I have decided to impose a sentence which will allow Ms Vatalis to go this happy event. Whilst there, I want her to consider the possibility that if she offends again there will be many such events she misses out on.
	
	
	In contrast to Ms Vatalis, Mr Pleace’s parents separated when he was quite young. Until then his father had been physically abusive towards his mother. As a result of the separation, he and his mother moved from country New South Wales to Ashfield. Mr Pleace told a psychologist that he considers this to be the start of his problems as he was sexually abused at the Ashfield swimming pool at the age of 13. He began misbehaving in a significant way at around that age. Although he started year 7 at Ashfield Boys High School, he only completed that year because he was sent to Rivendell and then to BoysTown. He told a psychologist that he escaped from BoysTown after three days and went to live on the street. He reported that he had a long drug history starting at age 14 when he first experimented with cannabis, and moved quickly to heroin, beginning by experimenting with that drug at 15. That has remained for many years his primary substance abuse.
	
	
	Mr Pleace’s psychiatric condition is uncertain. When he was seen by the psychologist he was in an extremely agitated state. He was displaying paranoid behaviour. The psychologist in her report noted that she was unable to verify information provided to her by Mr Pleace despite making a number of attempts to contact a psychiatrist, whom Mr Pleace said he had been seeing, and a general practitioner. Whilst she notes that some aspects of psychosis can be feigned, it is difficult to feign other aspects of the disorder, and so not without qualification she believed that Mr Pleace was suffering from schizophrenia with a medication induced psychotic disorder. Mr Pleace made it clear to his lawyer and indeed to me that he did not wish these sentencing proceedings to be delayed so that further enquiries could be made about his psychiatric condition. Because of that condition, Mr Pleace will do his time in custody much harder than would be the case if he was mentally well, and he becomes a person upon whom it is inappropriate to impose a sentence which contains a significant component of general deterrence.
	
	
	Let me turn now to Mr Gilmore. He is the person I referred to earlier as a person who has suffered greatly from being in custody in recent times because he has suffered a great deal of loss. Like Mr Pleace, he was a child of parents who were in an abusive relationship. His father would abuse alcohol and beat both him and his mother. On occasions Mr Gilmore’s mother would attempt to leave his father, but he always managed to find them. Eventually an apprehended violence order caused him to cease coming after them. Not surprisingly in those circumstances, having a mother who was willing to go to such lengths to protect him, he had a close relationship with her and described her as his rock. She was affectionate, supportive and loving, and always there if he needed her. Tragically she passed away a few months ago and not surprisingly he continues to miss her acutely. In addition, his partner has died whilst he was in custody and so has a grandmother with whom he was very close. These are the sorts of events which will occur to people while they are in custody. They are indeed part of the unfortunate but obvious consequential events which will occur when people will commit offences and as a result necessarily be sent to gaol.
	
	
	What led to Mr Gilmore’s early brushes with the law at about the age of 11 are difficult to understand given the close affection he had with his mother. Perhaps it was related to his attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder with which he has been diagnosed. In any case, he told the psychologist who saw him that his behaviour as a child was problematic and that at the age of 11, in conjunction with his emerging drug use, he began to engage in criminal behaviour, primarily stealing for financial gain. Despite her best efforts, his mother was unable to enforce rules. In common with the other two offenders, he too was sexually abused as a child. He left home at a very early age, at about 12 or 13, and criminal convictions are recorded from the age of 13.
	
	
	Mr Gilmore has spent a large part of his life in gaol, although there have been times when he has been able to work productively outside gaol. Not surprisingly however, his ability to find work and maintain positions has been affected by his drug use. He was sentenced not so long ago by her Honour Judge Flannery. As part of the sentence she ordered that Mr Gilmore be assessed as to his suitability to enter the compulsory drug treatment correctional centre. He was successful and so did spend a significant period of time receiving such intervention and counselling. He records that he was able to achieve 15 months of abstinence, which is significant for him. Unfortunately however, it is apparent that any gains that were achieved through his time in that program were soon lost. He reoffended only about two and a half months after being released from custody.
	
	
	His late mother wrote a letter in which she expressed her opinion as to why people like her son reoffend. Effectively she blames the lack of counselling facilities for offenders released from gaol. What she writes there of course must to some extent be true, but ultimately the only person who can decide what to do about his drug use is the offender himself. No amount of counselling or supervision or intervention can deter a person who is determined to take drugs from doing so. If Mr Gilmore does wish to avoid further periods of custody then he must understand that he must not use drugs because, as is commonplace, it is largely his drug use which has led to him spending so much time in gaol.
	
	
	It should be noted when describing the attempted break and enter offences that I consider that they display a fairly low level of criminality. It is important to remember that they were just that, attempts, and fairly flimsy ones at that.
	
	
	As far as the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence is concerned, I note that this took place in the victim’s home, that it was not a case where there was a single act of violence but numerous acts of violence, albeit over a fairly short period of time. A guitar was used as a weapon and although neither Mr Gilmore nor Ms Vatalis actually produced the knife, once it was produced they did not immediately desist but remained in the victim’s premises whilst he was threatened and struck again. The injuries that the victim suffered were not terribly serious, but of course if they were terribly serious then they would have been grievous bodily harm. It is important therefore not to underestimate the severity of these injuries as they are in the scale which extends from very minor actual bodily harm to something just short of grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	When I sentence Mr Gilmore, I need to give consideration to elements of general deterrence as well as personal deterrence. As is obvious, the deprivation of liberty that accompanied the sentence imposed by Judge Flannery was insufficient to encourage him to give up his life of offending. By that I in no way mean to suggest that her Honour’s sentence was inadequate, I merely intend to note that personal deterrence as far as Mr Gilmore is concerned appears thus far to have been ineffective. That of course is not to abandon that principle. He must be reaching the age where a period of reflection will show him how much he has lost by his repeated offending and repeated sentences of imprisonment. Not only must he realise that he has spent time in custody but whilst in custody his mother has died, his partner has died, and his grandmother has died too. It is to be hoped that this will act as a reminder to him of what happens when a person is in gaol, having deliberately committed offences which see him sent there.
	
	
	I was asked to make a finding of special circumstances in his favour. Having abused the leniency shown to him in the past, I would ordinarily make no finding of special circumstances in his favour. However, what has persuaded me to make this finding is the circumstance that this period of custody comes so closely on top of the earlier period of custody imposed by Judge Flannery. Effectively the sentence is much longer than will be imposed merely by me.
	
	
	I have already recorded many of the things I would like to say about Mr Pleace. As my recitation of the facts has noticed, he was not responsible for any direct act of violence but, on the other hand, he did arm himself with a nasty weapon, a knife, and made two threats to the victim whilst armed with it. I will make a finding of special circumstances in his favour based on the disturbing features identified in the psychological report, in particular the suggestion that Mr Pleace has been coasting under the radar, quite possibly presenting with a primary presenting problem of substance abuse which has led to his psychiatric diagnosis not being adequately addressed.
	
	
	I will impose sentences therefore as follows.
	
	
	In Ms Vatalis’s case I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non‑parole period of nine months and 21 days commencing from 19 September 2014 with a head sentence of 19 months. Thus she is to be released to parole on 9 July 2015.
	
	
	In Mr Pleace’s case I impose a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of two years to commence on 18 July 2014 with a head sentence of three years and six months. He will be eligible to be released to parole on 17 July 2016.
	
	
	In Mr Gilmore’s case I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of three years commencing from 10 December 2013 and a head sentence of four years six months. He will become eligible to be released to parole on 19 December 2016.
	
	
	Had I not imposed an aggregate sentence I would have imposed the following sentences of imprisonment. For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company a sentence of three years six months, and for the offence of attempt break and enter with intent to steal, taking into account the Form 1 matters, a sentence of one year and six months.

2767113,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 1) [2015] NSWSC 894,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: By Notice of Motion filed 2 June 2015, the Accused (A2, KM and Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri) seek the exclusion of all evidence obtained pursuant to two interception warrants issued by a Federal Magistrate in August 2012 under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) (“TIA Act”).
	
	
	The short but important point raised on this application is whether a Federal Magistrate was authorised to issue interception warrants under the TIA Act.
	


The Criminal Proceedings


	
	A brief outline of the charges against each Accused, and the nature of the Crown case, will suffice for the purpose of this judgment.
	
	
	A2 is charged with the following offences:
	



	
	between 18 October 2009 and 29 August 2012 at Wollongong in the State of New South Wales, mutilating the clitoris of C1 contrary to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, whilst in the company of another person, assaulting C1 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	between 1 January 2012 and 29 August 2012 at Baulkham Hills in the State of New South Wales, mutilating the clitoris of C2 contrary to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, whilst in the company of another person, assaulting C2 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	KM is charged with the following offences:
	



	
	between 18 October 2009 and 29 August 2012 at Wollongong in the State of New South Wales, mutilating the clitoris of C1 contrary to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, whilst in the company of another person, assaulting C1 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	between 1 January 2012 and 29 August 2012 at Baulkham Hills in the State of New South Wales, mutilating the clitoris of C2 contrary to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, whilst in the company of another person, assaulting C2 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	Mr Vaziri is charged with the following offences:
	



	
	between 12 August 2012 and 9 October 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being an accessory after the fact to the commission by A2 and KM of the serious indictable offence of mutilating the clitoris of C1 contrary to s.45(1)(a) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, being an accessory after the fact to after the commission by A2 and KM of the serious indictable offence of, whilst in company, assaulting C1 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	between 12 August 2012 and 9 October 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being an accessory after the fact to the commission by A2 and KM of the serious indictable offence of mutilating the clitoris of C2 contrary to s.45(1)(a) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, being an accessory after the fact to the commission by A2 and KM of the serious indictable offence of, whilst in company, assaulting C2 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	Each of the Accused is a member of the Dawoodi Bohra community, which is a world-wide sub-sect of Shia Islam.
	
	
	A2 is the mother of C1 and C2. KM is a retired midwife. Mr Vaziri is a senior figure in the Dawoodi Bohra community and teaches at the Auburn Mosque.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that female circumcision (“khatana”) was performed on C2 (now aged nine years) and C1 (now aged 11 years) by KM in the presence of A2. The Crown alleges that the procedure undertaken in each case falls within the terms of s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that A2 encouraged KM to perform the procedure with A2 being present during the procedure conducted upon each child. The Crown asserts that A2 is liable for the procedure conducted on each of the girls as she was an accessory before the fact, a principal in the second degree and a party to a joint criminal enterprise with KM.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that KM was a principal in the first degree, being the person who carried out the procedure on each girl.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that Mr Vaziri encouraged witnesses to lie in their police interviews and encouraged members of the Dawoodi Bohra community to tell police that they did not believe in or practise female circumcision. On the Crown case, such actions were performed, directly or indirectly, to assist A2 and KM in avoiding police detection. In this way, the Crown contends that Mr Vaziri was an accessory after the fact to the offences.
	
	
	The trial of the Accused is scheduled to commence before a jury on 17 August 2015.
	
	
	The Crown will seek to adduce evidence at trial of a number of conversations recorded pursuant to the two interception warrants presently under challenge.
	


Hearing of the Present Application


	
	The hearing of this Notice of Motion proceeded before me on 30 June 2015. Mr Jordan SC and Ms Lewer of counsel appeared for the Accused. Leave was granted for the Commissioner of Police to appear and Mr Temby QC appeared for the Commissioner. Ms Williams appeared for the Crown.
	
	
	An affidavit of Trudie Cameron affirmed 2 June 2015 was read for the Accused.
	
	
	A bundle of documents was tendered by the Crown (Exhibit A).
	
	
	There was no oral evidence. The parties had filed and exchanged written submissions on the application and counsel spoke to those submissions.
	
	
	The sole issue addressed at the hearing and requiring determination, is the legal question whether the Federal Magistrate who issued the warrants had authority to do so.
	
	
	In the event that the Court found for the Accused on that issue, further questions would arise as to whether s.75 TIA Act had any application (New South Wales Crime Commission v Vuletic [2005] NSWSC 614; 64 NSWLR 301) or whether any evidence obtained pursuant to the warrants was admissible after application of s.138 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	It was agreed that these issues should be put to one side for the moment. If the Court found in favour of the Accused, it will be necessary to consider these matters at a later hearing.
	


Factual Matters Surrounding the Issue of the Warrants under Challenge


	
	The facts relevant to this application are not in dispute.
	
	
	As at August 2012, New South Wales Police were investigating the Accused with respect to the events giving rise to the charges now on foot against each of them.
	


The Warrants


	
	On 7 August 2012, Detective Senior Constable Denise Ross applied for two interception warrants with respect to two telecommunications services. On that day, Stephen Hugh Scarlett, a Federal Magistrate, issued warrants bearing the Nos. C09789-00-00 and C09790-00-00.
	
	
	The opening paragraph in each warrant was in the following terms:
	


“I, STEPHEN HUGH SCARLETT, an eligible Judge within the meaning of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the Act), acting under section 46 of the Act, authorise interceptions of communications made to or from the telecommunications service mentioned above.”


	
	The balance of each warrant recited other matters, with the warrant to remain in force until 25 October 2012. Mr Scarlett signed each warrant with the words “An eligible Judge” appearing under his signature.
	
	
	On 8 August 2012, recording and monitoring by officers attached to Strikeforce Longfield of the two telecommunications services began. Each warrant expired on 25 October 2012.
	
	
	On 1 November 2012, Acting Assistant Commissioner Mark Hutchings issued, with respect to each warrant, a certificate under s.61(4) TIA Act confirming that each warrant was acted upon, with recordings being made as a result. The Second Schedule to each s.61(4) certificate identified the relevant warrant in the following way:
	


“Warrant under section 46 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 issued to the New South Wales Police Force by Mr Stephen Hugh SCARLETT (Federal Magistrate), an eligible Judge, on 7 August 2012 in respect to telecommunications service [XXX].”


	
	It may be taken that a number of significant conversations (in an evidentiary sense) were recorded pursuant to the interception warrants C09789-00-00 and C09790-00-00 issued by Federal Magistrate Scarlett on 7 August 2012. A schedule at Tab 2 of Exhibit A indicates (by highlighting) conversations upon which the Crown relies, which were recorded as a result of one or other of the challenged warrants.
	
	
	It is not necessary to say more than this as the present judgment is confined to the legal question concerning the authority to issue the warrants in question.
	


Consents and Declarations


	
	A number of instruments made for the purpose of the TIA Act related to Federal Magistrate Scarlett. They are attached to the statement of Inspector Timothy Charles Lowe dated 18 June 2015 (Exhibit A, Tab 5). Given the issues requiring determination, it is appropriate to set out in full each of these instruments.
	
	
	On 4 July 2001, the then Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia, the Hon Daryl Williams, made a declaration under s.6D(3) TIA Act in the following terms:
	


“I, DARYL ROBERT WILLIAMS, Attorney-General, acting under subsection 6(D)3 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, declare the Federal Magistrates of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in relation to whom written consents are in force under subsection 6D(2) of that Act and whose names appear in the attached Schedule, to be eligible Judges for the purposes of that Act.”


	
	The schedule attached to the declaration of 4 July 2001 included the name “Stephen Hugh Scarlett”.
	
	
	On 5 April 2001, Federal Magistrate Scarlett had given his consent for the purpose of s.6D TIA Act:
	


“I, Stephen Hugh Scarlett, a Federal Magistrate of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, a court created by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, hereby consent to be nominated under subsection 6D(3) of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 by the Minister for the time being administering the Act.”


	
	On 22 June 2006, the then Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia, the Hon Philip Ruddock, made a declaration under s.6DB(1) TIA Act in the following terms:
	


“I, PHILIP MAXWELL RUDDOCK, Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, acting under subsection 6DB(1) of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, declare:

•    the Federal Magistrates listed in Schedule 1,

•   the judges of the Family Court of Australia listed in Schedule 2, and

•   the judges of the Federal Court of Australia listed in Schedule 3

to whom written consents are in force under subsection 6DB(2) of that Act, to be issuing authorities for the purpose of subsection 6DB(1) of that Act.”


	
	On 12 May 2006, Federal Magistrate Scarlett had given his consent for the purpose of s.6DB(2) TIA Act:
	


“I, Stephen Hugh Scarlett, a Federal Magistrate of the Federal Magistrates Court, a court created by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, hereby consent under section 6DB(2) to be declared an issuing authority for the purposes of the Telecommunications (interception and Access) Act 1979.”


	
	The significance of these consents and declarations will become apparent shortly.
	


Outline of Submissions on the Application


	
	Detailed written submissions were made by counsel in advance of the hearing. The transcript reflects oral submissions made on 30 June 2015. It is not necessary to set out in detail the submissions made. An outline will suffice.
	


Submissions for the Accused


	
	Mr Jordan SC emphasised the general prohibition on the interception of telecommunications, with lawful interception only permitted in prescribed circumstances and only under the authority of those persons entrusted by the legislature with the function of issuing interception warrants: ss.7 and 105 TIA Act.
	
	
	It was submitted that s.46(1) TIA Act referred to an application for a warrant to be made to “an eligible Judge or nominated AAT member”. No reference was made to Federal Magistrates in this provision.
	
	
	Counsel referred to s.6D and the definitions therein of “eligible Judge” and “Judge”. No reference was made in s.6D to Federal Magistrates.
	
	
	Mr Jordan SC contrasted s.6DB, which provides for an “issuing authority” to issue a “stored communications warrant” under Chapter 3 of the TIA Act. Unlike s.6D, it was emphasised that s.6DB(1) makes express reference to “a Federal Magistrate”.
	
	
	Mr Jordan SC accepted that the Federal Magistrates Court was created by the Commonwealth Parliament for the purpose of s. 71 and 72 of the Commonwealth Constitution. However, he submitted that this did not resolve the present question of statutory construction. He submitted that Federal Magistrate Scarlett was not a Judge, and could not be an “eligible Judge”, so that he was not authorised by s.46 TIA Act to issue the warrants.
	
	
	It was submitted that the juxtaposition of “Judge” and “Federal Magistrate” in s.6DB TIA Act indicated that the legislature comprehended the difference between both offices, and intended to limit the power conferred upon Federal Magistrates. This power extended to “stored communications warrants” only and did not empower Federal Magistrates to authorise the interception of live communications as they pass over telecommunications systems.
	
	
	It was submitted that the differences between Judges and Magistrates was reflected in s.16C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth).
	
	
	Mr Jordan SC referred to the savings and transitional provisions with respect to past acts of Federal Magistrates in Schedule 2 to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (Cth). He submitted that this saving provision confirmed, to avoid any doubt, that the amendments did not affect the validity of previous acts of Federal Magistrates. To the extent that previous acts of Federal Magistrates were valid, he submitted that they remained valid, but that the provision did not purport to retrospectively validate previous acts that were without lawful authority.
	
	
	It was noted that the definition of “eligible Judge” in s.6D TIA Act was not amended by the Federal Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Act 2013 (Cth), which amended many statutes consequent upon the change in title of the Federal Magistrates Court to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, effective from 12 April 2013.
	
	
	It was noted that the definition of “issuing authority” in s.6DB TIA Act was amended by the 2013 Act by deleting the reference to “Federal Magistrate”. It was noted that these consequential amendments included a saving provision in Item 514 of Schedule 1 to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Act 2013 (Cth), which provided that a thing done by a Federal Magistrate, as an issuing authority under the TIA Act before the commencement of this item was to have effect, after that commencement, as if it had been done by a Judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia as an issuing authority under the TIA Act.
	
	
	Mr Jordan SC submitted that an important feature of this saving provision was that it dealt only with the previous eligibility of a Federal Magistrate to be an “issuing authority” under s.6DB TIA Act. If the legislature had intended that Federal Magistrates be empowered to issue interception warrants under s.6D, this ought to have been made clear at the time of the amendments.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused that the scheme manifested the legislature’s intention that private telecommunications may only be lawfully intercepted in tightly prescribed circumstances, and that the lawful authority of the persons entrusted by the legislature with the function of issuing such warrants being fundamental to the integrity of the legislative scheme.
	
	
	Mr Jordan SC referred to provisions in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). He drew attention to ss.5, 27 and 129A of that Act. He pointed to s.5(5) Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) which states:
	


“(5)   To avoid doubt, a federal magistrate is taken to be a Judge of a Court having jurisdiction under this Act.”


	
	Reference was made as well to the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) where a Family Law Council is provided for, consisting of “a judge of the Family Court and such other judges” (s.115(2)). Section 115(11) provided:
	


“(11)   For the purposes of this section, a federal magistrate is taken to be a judge.”


	
	Mr Jordan SC contended that deeming provisions of the type seen in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) are of assistance. They illustrate the way in which the Commonwealth Parliament has characterised Federal Magistrates as not being Judges unless they are, in effect, deemed to be so.
	
	
	Mr Jordan SC relied upon Project Blue Sky Inc and Ors v Australian Broadcasting Authority (“Project Blue Sky”) [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at 388-391 [91]-[93], in support of the submission that the lawful authority of a person issuing an interception warrant was essential to the validity of such a warrant. He submitted that it was necessary to construe the relevant provision (s. 6D) so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute: Project Blue Sky at 381 [69].
	
	
	It was submitted that it was consistent with the prescriptive nature of the legislative scheme, and the limited circumstances in which telecommunications may lawfully be intercepted, that there should be certainty in relation to the validity of interception warrants. In this respect, reliance was placed upon R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; 64 NSWLR 10 at 56-57 [283].
	
	
	It was argued that the absence of authority for a Federal Magistrate to issue the challenged warrants was clear. However, to the extent that there was said to be any ambiguity, reliance was placed upon Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15; 179 CLR 427 at 436-437 in support of the proposition that any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the Accused.
	
	
	With respect to the declaration made by the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, on 4 July 2001 and the earlier written consent of Federal Magistrate Scarlett dated 5 April 2001 (see [32]-[34] above), it was submitted that these were administrative instruments only which could not have the effect of vesting Federal Magistrate Scarlett with the relevant authority to issue an interception warrant.
	
	
	In essence, it was submitted that the fact that it may have been thought by the Executive in 2001 that Federal Magistrates (who had given consent) were capable of being “eligible Judges” for the purpose of s.6D, did not mean that the relevant power did exist.
	
	
	It was submitted that the challenged warrants were invalid.
	


Submissions for the Commissioner of Police


	
	Mr Temby QC approached the issues in contest by commencing with some general submissions concerning the judicial power of the Commonwealth, and specific submissions concerning the history of the TIA Act including significant amendments.
	
	
	Reference was made to ss.71, 72 and 79 of the Commonwealth Constitution. Provision was made for the judicial power of the Commonwealth to be vested in (relevantly) “such other federal courts as the Parliament creates” (s.71) with provision being made in s.72 for appointment of (relevantly) “Justices … of the other courts created by the Parliament”, with s.79 providing that the “federal jurisdiction of any court may be exercised by such number of judges as the Parliament prescribes”.
	
	
	It was submitted that, according to common usage of language, the words “Justice” and “Judge” are synonymous. It was submitted that it follows that any Justice of a court created by the Commonwealth Parliament is a Judge. The fact that some other title may be given, such as Federal Magistrate, did not matter.
	
	
	The Federal Magistrates Court Act 1999 (Cth) commenced on 27 December 2000. It was submitted that s.8 of that Act made clear that the Federal Magistrates Court was a “federal court” created by that Act, with the Federal Magistrates Court to consist of “justices”: s.8(4). Accordingly, it was submitted that Federal Magistrates were appointed, as required by the Commonwealth Constitution, as Justices of a court created by the Parliament.
	
	
	Mr Temby QC took the Court to passages in Hilton v Wells [1985] HCA 16; 157 CLR 57 and Grollo v Palmer [1995] HCA 26; 184 CLR 348 to assist an understanding of the background to the TIA Act.
	
	
	Mr Temby QC submitted that the terms “Judge” and “eligible Judge” in s.6D(1) TIA Act extended to Federal Magistrates who were Justices of a court created by the Commonwealth Parliament. Against this background, he submitted that the declaration dated 4 July 2001 of Attorney-General Williams, and the pre-existing consent dated 5 April 2001 of Federal Magistrate Scarlett, constituted clear authority for Federal Magistrate Scarlett to issue the challenged warrants.
	
	
	It was submitted that the wording of later provisions, such as s. 6DB TIA Act, inserted in 2006, did not serve to undermine the proper construction of s.6D. It was submitted that the use of what he termed thorough and courteous language in s.6DB did not give rise to some implied narrowing in 2006 of the terms of s.6D.
	
	
	It was submitted that the challenged warrants are valid.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown adopted the submissions of Mr Temby QC on the legal issues arising from the challenge to the warrants.
	


Decision Concerning the Challenge to the Warrants

Federal Magistrates are Justices or Judges of a Court Created by Parliament


	
	An appropriate starting point is the Commonwealth Constitution. The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested (relevantly) “in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates”: s.71. The origin of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) lies in this provision. So much was accepted by senior counsel for the Accused.
	
	
	Section 72 of the Commonwealth Constitution provides for the appointment of (relevantly) “Justices … of the other courts created by the Parliament”. Section 79 of the Constitution provides that the “federal jurisdiction of any court may be exercised by such number of judges as the Parliament prescribes”.
	
	
	Section 8 Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) provided as follows:
	


“8   Creation of Federal Magistrates Court 

(1)    A federal court, to be known as the Federal Magistrates Court, is created by this Act. 

(2)    The Federal Magistrates Court may also be known as: 

(a)    the Federal Magistrates Service; or 

(b)    the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia; 

or both. 

(3)    The Federal Magistrates Court is a court of record and is a court of law and equity. 

(4)    The Federal Magistrates Court consists of the following justices: 

(a)    a Chief Federal Magistrate; 

(b)    such other Federal Magistrates as from time to time hold office in accordance with this Act. 

Note: The Parliament may create federal courts under Chapter III of the Constitution.”


	
	Section 9 of that Act concerns personnel provisions relating to Federal Magistrates. Section 9 states that “Schedule 1 has effect”. Schedule 1 to the Act makes extensive provision with respect to the appointment of Federal Magistrates.
	
	
	The proper characterisation of the judicial status of Federal Magistrates has been considered in a number of cases. These cases assist the resolution of the present application.
	
	
	In Re Bryant; Ex parte Guarino [2001] HCA 5; 178 ALR 57, Hayne J considered a challenge to the appointment of and exercise of certain powers by a Federal Magistrate. In dismissing the application, Hayne J said at 58-59 [7]-[8]:
	


“7.   Section 79 of the Constitution provides: 

‘The federal jurisdiction of any court may be exercised by such number of judges as the Parliament prescribes.’ 

Section 79 is, therefore, concerned with whether federal jurisdiction is to be exercised by a court constituted by one or by more than one judge.

8.   Section 11(1) of the Act provides: 

‘For the purposes of the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Magistrates Court is to be constituted by a single Federal Magistrate.’ 

It is not arguable that this provision offends s 79. Indeed, it is a provision of the very kind for which s 79 is intended to provide. True it is, as Mr Guarino pointed out in oral argument, s 79 uses the word ‘judges’ and does not use the word ‘magistrate’. Nevertheless, it is clear when regard is had to s 71 and the power given to the Parliament to create ‘other federal courts’ that the title given to the judicial officer by Parliament in creating such another federal court is not determinative of the constitutional reach of s 79 and the other provisions in Ch III. The constitutional reach of s 79 extends to the Federal Magistrates appointed to serve in the court created by the Parliament by the Act.”


	
	Hayne J stated at 60 [13]:
	


“Finally, as for the last of the matters mentioned by the applicant in his affidavit, s 72 of the Constitution does, subject to some qualifications which need not now be noticed, permit the Parliament to fix an age as the maximum age for Justices of a court created by the Parliament. There is no reason to consider it arguable that the constitutional expression ‘Justice of a court created by the Parliament’ does not extend to Federal Magistrates. There is, therefore, no reason to consider that the provisions made in s 9 and Sched 1 of the Act about the term of office and conditions for resignation or removal from office of Federal Magistrates are invalid.”


	
	In Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCAFC 51; 247 ALR 739, Branson and Sundberg JJ said at 747 [35]:
	


“The Macquarie Dictionary relevantly defines a ‘judge’ as ‘a public officer whose function is to adjudicate on matters brought before a court for decision’. It is therefore clear that the ordinary meaning of the word “judge” is broad enough to encompass a Magistrate holding office under the Magistrates Act. The Constitution itself reflects this broad meaning when, by s 79, it provides that the “federal jurisdiction of any court may be exercised by such number of judges as the Parliament prescribes”. The word “judges” in this context includes magistrates (Re Bryant; ex parte Guarino (2001) 178 ALR 57 at [8]).”


	
	The decision of Hayne J in Re Bryant; Ex parte Guarino has been applied as well in Simandl v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 450; 167 FCR 501 at 504-505 [8]-[15]. In State of South Australia v Totani [2010] HCA 39; 242 CLR 1; French CJ referred, at 40 [54] (footnote 183), to the decision of Hayne J in Re Bryant; Ex parte Guarino.
	
	
	It is clear that Federal Magistrates appointed under the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) were “Justices” and “Judges”, with these terms having meaning for the purpose of ss.71, 72 and 79 of the Commonwealth Constitution.
	


Construction of Relevant Provisions of the TIA Act


	
	I turn to relevant features of the TIA Act. As originally enacted, the legislation was entitled the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Cth). As will be seen, it became the TIA Act in 2006.
	
	
	In its original form, s.20 Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Cth) empowered a “Judge” to issue a telecommunications warrant. Section 18 of that Act provided:
	


“18.    In this Part, ‘Judge’ means - 

(a)    a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia or of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory;

(b)    a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State in respect of whom an appropriate arrangement in force under section 19 is applicable; or

(c)    a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory who is not a Judge referred to in paragraph (a) and in respect of whom an appropriate arrangement in force under section 19 of this Act is applicable.”


	
	In Hilton v Wells, a majority of the High Court of Australia (Gibbs CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ) held that s.20 was a valid enactment of the Commonwealth Parliament. The majority held that the non-judicial power involved in s.20 was not conferred on the Federal Court, but on the Judges individually as designated persons.
	
	
	The decision in Hilton v Wells attracted controversy, to the point where there was an unsuccessful attempt to reopen the issue in Jones v Commonwealth of Australia (1987) 71 ALR 497.
	
	
	Section 6D was inserted in the legislation by the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act 1987 (Cth). In Grollo v Palmer, McHugh J referred, at 374, to the purpose behind the enactment of s.6D:
	


“Although the Court held that s 20 was valid, the amendments to the Act in 1987 responded to some of the concerns of the minority in Hilton v Wells. The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the amendments made it clear that the legislative purpose in inserting s 6D and creating the process for appointment of ‘eligible Judges’ by the Attorney-General was to:

‘avoid any possible argument that the power given to eligible Judges to issue interception warrants ... is invalid because it amounts to the conferral of a non-judicial power on a court. The matter was considered by the High Court in Hilton v Wells [1985] HCA 16; (1985) 58 ALR 245, where a majority held that there is no necessary constitutional impediment preventing the Parliament from conferring non-judicial power on a particular individual who happened to be a member of a court. Proposed section 6D makes it clear that the power to issue warrants is conferred on individual persons or classes of persons declared by the Minister who happen to be Judges of a court created by the Parliament’.” 


	
	Section 6D was in the following terms:
	


“(1)    In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:

'eligible Judge' means a Judge in relation to whom a consent under subsection (2) and a declaration under subsection (3) are in force;

'Judge' means a person who is a Judge of a court created by the Parliament.

(2)    A Judge may by writing consent to be nominated by the Minister under subsection (3).

(3)    The Minister may by writing declare Judges in relation to whom consents are in force under subsection (2) to be eligible Judges for the purposes of this Act.

(4)    An eligible Judge has, in relation to the performance or exercise of a function or power conferred on an eligible Judge by this Act, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court has in relation to proceedings in the High Court.""


	
	In Grollo v Palmer, a majority of the High Court (Brennan CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ) held that s.6D was a valid law of the Commonwealth. The majority explained (at 359-360) the nature of the power to issue interception warrants.
	
	
	In the course of determining that the power to issue an interception warrant may be appropriately vested in a judicial officer acting administratively and as a designated person, the majority said at 367:
	


“Yet it is precisely because of the intrusive and clandestine nature of interception warrants and the necessity to use them in today's continuing battle against serious crime that some impartial authority, accustomed to the dispassionate assessment of evidence and sensitive to the common law's protection of privacy and property (both real and personal), be authorised to control the official interception of communications. In other words, the professional experience and cast of mind of a Judge is a desirable guarantee that the appropriate balance will be kept between the law enforcement agencies on the one hand and criminal suspects or suspected sources of information about crime on the other. It is an eligible Judge's function of deciding independently of the applicant agency whether an interception warrant should issue that separates the eligible Judge from the executive function of law enforcement. It is the recognition of that independent role that preserves public confidence in the judiciary as an institution.”


	
	In 1997, s.6DA was inserted, enabling the Minister to nominate in writing a person who holds certain specified appointments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (“AAT”) to issue interception warrants.
	
	
	As mentioned earlier, the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) commenced on 27 December 2000. Within a few months, Federal Magistrate Scarlett gave consent on 5 April 2001 to be nominated under s.6D(3) (see [34] above). Thereafter, Attorney-General Williams on 4 July 2001 made a declaration under s.6D(3) declaring Federal Magistrates in relation to whom written consents were in force under s.6D(2), and whose names appeared on an accompanying schedule, to be eligible Judges for the purposes of the then Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Cth) (see [32]-[33] above).
	
	
	I am satisfied that, as at 2001, Federal Magistrates were capable of being “eligible Judges” for the purpose of s.6D. The Federal Magistrates Court had been created by the Commonwealth Parliament pursuant to s.71 of the Constitution. Accordingly, Federal Magistrates were Justices (Judges) of a court created by Parliament. The fact that they were described as Federal Magistrates, and not Judges, does not undermine this conclusion.
	
	
	The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act 2006 (Cth) changed the name of the Act to the TIA Act. The 2006 Act also introduced the concept of stored communication warrants to be issued under s.116 TIA Act. The term “stored communication” is defined in s.5 TIA Act in the following way:
	


“stored communication means a communication that:

(a)   is not passing over a telecommunications system; and

(b)   is held on equipment that is operated by, and is in the possession of, a carrier; and

(c)   cannot be accessed on that equipment, by a person who is not a party to the communication, without the assistance of an employee of the carrier.”


	
	Accordingly, from 2006, the TIA Act provided for interception warrants (Chapter 2) and stored communication warrants (Chapter 3). A stored communication warrant could be issued under s.116 by an “issuing authority”.
	
	
	Section 6DB was inserted in 2006 to provide for issuing authorities. The section states:
	


“6DB    Issuing authorities

(1)   The Minister may, by writing, appoint as an issuing authority:

(a)   a person who is:

(i)    a judge of a court created by the Parliament; or

(ii)    a Federal Magistrate; or

(iii)    a magistrate;

and in relation to whom a consent under subsection (2) is in force; or

(b)   a person who:

(i)    holds an appointment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as Deputy President, full-time senior member, part-time senior member or member; and

(ii)    is enrolled as a legal practitioner of a federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or a Territory; and

(iii)    has been enrolled for at least 5 years.

(2)   A person who is:

(a)   a judge of a court created by the Parliament; or

(b)   a Federal Magistrate; or

(c)   a magistrate;

may, by writing, consent to be appointed by the Minister under subsection (1).

(3)   A person's appointment ceases to have effect if:

(a)   the person ceases to be a person whom the Minister could appoint under this section; or

(b)   the Minister, by writing, revokes the appointment.

(4)   An issuing authority has, in relation to the performance or exercise of a function or power conferred on an issuing authority by this Act, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court has in relation to proceedings in the High Court.”


	
	On 12 May 2006, Federal Magistrate Scarlett gave his consent to being declared an “issuing authority” for the purpose of s.6DB (see [36] above). On 22 June 2006, Attorney-General Ruddock issued a declaration for the purpose of s.6DB with respect to issuing authorities (See [35] above).
	
	
	Accordingly, from 22 June 2006, Federal Magistrate Scarlett was authorised to issue stored communication warrants.
	


Are Federal Magistrates “Eligible Judges” Under s.6D?


	
	The essence of the argument for the Accused is that the 2006 amendments, including express reference to Federal Magistrates in s.6DB, support a conclusion that Federal Magistrates were not included as eligible Judges for the purpose of s.6D. A textual comparison between ss.6D and 6DB is invited to support this conclusion.
	
	
	Mr Jordan SC serves to fortify this submissions by reference to provisions in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Legislation Amendment Act 2012 (Cth) and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Act 2013 (Cth) (see [46]-[48] above).
	
	
	I do not accept the submission for the Accused.
	
	
	It is correct to observe that the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments) Act 2013 (Cth) makes amendments to the TIA Act (Items 512-514 in Schedule) only with respect to s.6DB TIA Act. That may be explained upon the basis that the 2013 Act was directed to express references in other legislation to Federal Magistrates. I do not consider that the 2013 legislative provisions fortify an argument that Federal Magistrates were incapable (or no longer capable) of being “eligible Judges” for the purpose of s.6D.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused sought to rely upon s.16C Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) which stated:
	


“16C    References to Stipendiary Magistrate and Magistrate

(1)   Where, in an Act, reference is made to a Stipendiary Magistrate, the reference shall be read as including a reference to any Magistrate in respect of whose office an annual salary is payable.

(2)   Where, in an Act passed after the date of commencement of this section, reference is made to a Magistrate, the reference shall be read as a reference to:

(a)   a Chief, Police, Stipendiary, Resident or Special Magistrate; or

(b)   any other Magistrate in respect of whose office an annual salary is payable.

(3)   A reference in an Act to a Magistrate does not include a reference to a Federal Magistrate.”


	
	Section 16C came into force in July 2003 and was repealed in April 2013. I do not consider that this provision provides any assistance concerning the proper construction of s.6D TIA Act and the question whether Federal Magistrates were capable of being “eligible Judges” for the purposes of that provision.
	
	
	I have mentioned that submissions were made by reference to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). In my view, care must be exercised in considering an argument advanced by reference to provisions contained in entirely different legislation. I do not think that the terms of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) or the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) assist the resolution of the present question. The task of the Court is to construe the relevant provisions of the TIA Act.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the statutory scheme, as it existed in 2001, accommodated Federal Magistrates being “eligible Judges” for the purpose of s.6D. For the reasons set out above, Federal Magistrates were Justices (Judges) of a court created by the Commonwealth Parliament to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. There is nothing in the power to issue interception warrants itself which demanded that it be exercised only by a Judge of a superior court. This may be illustrated by the fact that, in 1997, nominated AAT members were included by the Commonwealth Parliament as persons having power to issue interception warrants: s.6DA TIA Act.
	
	
	The skills to be brought to bear in the exercise of the warrant issuing function, as described by the majority in Grollo v Palmer at 367 (see [86] above), are possessed likewise by judicial officers serving as Federal Magistrates.
	
	
	The fact that the Commonwealth Parliament has chosen, in 2006, to make express reference to Federal Magistrates in the context of creating a power to issue stored communication warrants, does not, in my view, undermine the conclusion that Federal Magistrates fell within s.6D. The Commonwealth Parliament used more elaborate and detailed language, in an omnibus provision, to describe categories of persons in s.6DB. The use of this mechanism should not operate to, in some way, confine the construction and operation of the pre-existing provisions in s.6D. No amendment was made to s.6D in 2006. It would be wrong to conclude that some implied or inferred alteration was made to s.6D as a result of the 2006 amendments, which did not touch s.6D at all.
	
	
	I have kept in mind the approach to statutory construction in Project Blue Sky at 381-383 [69]-[71] and 384 [78]. I do not consider that there is any ambiguity in the wording of s. 6D that needed to be clarified by reference to later legislation. The earlier legislation (s. 6D) and later legislation (s. 6DB) did not deal with the same topic: R v Sieders; R v Somsri [2008] NSWCCA 187; 72 NSWLR 417 at 431 – 436 [118]-[135].
	
	
	To the extent that the submissions for the Accused contend for a form of implied or inferred repeal or amendment of s. 6D following the introduction of s. 6DB, I have kept in mind the statement of Gaudron J in Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21; 172 CLR 1 at 17:
	


“It is a basic rule of construction that, in the absence of express words, an earlier statutory provision is not repealed, altered or derogated from by a later provision unless an intention to that effect is necessarily implied. There must be very strong grounds to support that implication, for there is a general presumption that the legislature intended that both provisions should operate and that, to the extent that they would otherwise overlap, one should be read as subject to the other: see Butler v Attorney-General (Vict.) (62), per Fullagar J, and per Windeyer J (63).”


	
	There are not very strong grounds to support an implication that the Commonwealth Parliament, in 2006, intended to alter the construction and meaning of s. 6D, whilst leaving that section untouched. For reasons already expressed, I do not consider that the argument of the Accused is assisted by any other provision of statutes to which reference was made.
	
	
	It is, of course, a matter of statutory construction as to whether Federal Magistrates fall relevantly within s.6D. However, it is, at least, noteworthy that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia was acting in 2001 in a manner which accepted that Federal Magistrates were capable of being appointed as eligible Judges for the purpose of s.6D.
	
	
	The construction urged on behalf of the Accused would, in my view, give rise to an unintended outcome. I do not accept this construction. I am satisfied that the proper construction of the legislation permitted Federal Magistrates, such as Federal Magistrate Scarlett, to be appointed as eligible Judges under s.6D.
	
	
	In my view, this is the clear conclusion which ought be reached having undertaken the necessary process of construction.
	


Conclusion and Orders


	
	The Accused have failed to demonstrate that the challenged interception warrants issued by Federal Magistrate Scarlett on 7 August 2012 are invalid.
	
	
	The Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the Accused on 2 June 2015 is dismissed.

		13 November 2015",2015-07-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767114,R v Obeid [2015] NSWSC 897,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: By Notice of Motion filed on 19 May 2015, the Applicant, Edward Moses Obeid, makes application under s.132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to be tried by a Judge alone.
	
	
	The Crown does not agree to the Applicant being tried by a Judge alone. It is necessary for the Court to determine whether an order under s.132 should be made in the circumstances of the case.
	


The Charge Against the Applicant


	
	The Applicant has been charged with the common law offence of wilful misconduct in public office. On 8 May 2015, the Applicant was arraigned upon an indictment in the following terms:
	


“Between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007 in Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Edward Moses Obeid, then holding public office as a Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, did in the course of and connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by encouraging Stephen Paul Dunn, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, Maritime Property Division of the Maritime Authority of New South Wales, to cause the said Maritime Authority to deal favourably with Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Limited in respect of the said company’s tenancies of property at Circular Quay.”


	
	Upon arraignment, the Applicant pleaded not guilty to this charge. His trial is fixed to commence at the Supreme Court in Sydney on 12 October 2015.
	


The Present Application


	
	This application is made well before the trial date and with the identity of the trial Judge being unknown to the parties. The rationale underlying the determination of a s.132 application in this way was adverted to by me in R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357 at [8]-[11]:
	


“8   Although the s.132 application is proceeding before me, I will not be the trial Judge. 

9   The bringing of the application in this way, well in advance of the trial, accords with an apparent statutory purpose that an application for a Judge-alone trial should be made (at least ordinarily) without knowing the identity of the trial Judge.

10   In the course of the second reading speech for the Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2010, which introduced s.132A, the then Attorney General, Mr Hatzistergos, said (Hansard, Legislative Council, 24 November 2010):

‘The new section 132A sets out procedural matters regarding trial by judge orders, including that applications are to be made no less than 28 days before the trial date, except by leave of the court. This is designed to minimise the risk of a party applying for a judge-alone trial on the basis of knowing the identity of the trial judge.’

11   It has been observed that earlier versions of ss.132-132A had been drafted to avoid the appearance that the accused person was making an election in the light of the knowledge of the identity of the trial Judge: R v Perry (1993) 29 NSWLR 589 at 594; R v Coles (1993) 31 NSWLR 550 at 552-553; R v Simmons; R v Moore (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 259 at [20]-[29].”

Hearing of the Application


	
	The hearing of this application proceeded on 26 June 2015.
	
	
	On 22 May 2015, I had made an order prohibiting publication of the fact that the Applicant has made an application for trial by Judge alone.
	
	
	At the commencement of the hearing on 26 June 2015, I confirmed that the non-publication order remained in force with respect to the fact that the application had been made and anything said at the hearing of the application. That order will remain in force until any application is made to the trial Judge to lift the order after the trial of the Applicant is completed.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC, for the Applicant, read the following affidavits at the hearing of this application:
	



	
	affidavit of Timothy Joseph Breene sworn 19 May 2015;
	
	
	affidavit of Timothy Joseph Breene sworn 25 May 2015;
	
	
	affidavit of Timothy Joseph Breene sworn 25 June 2015;
	
	
	affidavit of Robert Oliwer Szuszkiewicz sworn 19 May 2015.
	



	
	Folders of documents referred to in the affidavits were admitted separately as Exhibits TJB1, TJB3 and ROS1. Admitted as Exhibit TJB2 was a copy of a book by Kate McClymont and Linton Besser entitled “He Who Must Be Obeid”.
	
	
	The Crown read affidavits of Jessica Chan sworn 29 May 2015 and 26 June 2015.
	
	
	No deponent was required for cross-examination and no oral evidence was adduced at the hearing.
	
	
	Helpful written submissions had been provided by the parties in advance of the hearing and counsel spoke to these submissions.
	


Relevant Statutory Provisions


	
	Section 131 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides as follows:
	


“131 Trial by jury in criminal proceedings

Criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court are to be tried by a jury, except as otherwise provided by this Part.”


	
	Section 132 provides:
	


“132    Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1)    An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a trial by judge order).

(2)    The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.

(3)    If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.

(4)    If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5)    Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6)    The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7)    The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that:

(a)    there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and

(b)    the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.”


	
	As will be seen, s.132(4) and (5) are the critical provisions on this application. Section 132(7) does not arise in this case.
	
	
	Section 132A is in the following terms:
	


“132A    Applications for trial by judge alone in criminal proceedings

(1)    An application for an order under section 132 that an accused person be tried by a Judge alone must be made not less than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial in the Supreme Court or District Court, except with the leave of the court.

(2)    An application must not be made in a joint trial unless:

(a)    all other accused person apply to be tried by a Judge alone, and

(b)    each application is made in respect of all offences with which the accused persons in the trial are charged that are being proceeded with in the trial.

(3)    An accused person or a prosecutor who applies for an order under section 132 may, at any time before the date fixed for the accused person’s trial, subsequently apply for a trial by a jury.

(4)    Rules of court may be made with respect to applications under section 132 or this section.”

The Crown Case Against the Applicant


	
	Wilful misconduct in public office is a common law offence in relation to which no maximum penalty is fixed by law: Blackstock v R [2013] NSWCCA 172 at [8].
	
	
	The Crown Case Statement outlines the case against the Applicant in the following way:
	


“Background

1.   Edward Moses Obeid held public office as a Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales throughout the period 2002 to 2008 inclusive.

2.   Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Ltd (‘CQR’) was incorporated on 21 August 2002 and from that date John Joseph Paul Abood (‘John Abood’) was its sole shareholder, director and secretary.

3.   John Abood was, during times relevant to the charge (between August 2002 and December 2007), a brother-in-law of Edward Moses Obeid.

4.   At all material times from 21 August 2002, CQR held its assets on the terms of a unit trust, namely the Circular Quay Unit Trust. The Circular Quay Unit Trust was held by two unit holders: 10 ‘B Class’ units were held by J & A Abood Investments, and 90 ‘Ordinary Class’ units were held by SS Nominees (No. 1) Pty Ltd.

5.   SS Nominees (No. 1) Pty Ltd in turn held the 90 ‘Ordinary Class’ units as trustee of the Obeid Family Trust No. 2. The Obeid Family Trust No. 2 was a discretionary trust settled by Deed dated 14 May 2002, the listed beneficiaries of whom were listed as Edward Moses Obeid, his wife and their five sons (‘the Obeid family’). The 90 ‘Ordinary Class’ units held by SS Nominees (No, 1) Pty Limited gave the beneficial ownership of the capital in the Circular Quay Unit Trust to the Obeid family, which included the businesses and assignments of the leases in shops by CQR.

6.   In late 2002 CQR purchased the leases over two shop premises at Circular Quay Sydney, namely shops W4.1 and W5.1 on Wharves 4 and 5 respectively, pursuant to an assignment of the leases from their respective former tenants. Funds were transferred into the account of CQR prior to the purchase of the leases, from Locaway Pty Limited, a company in which Obeid Corporation Pty Ltd held a 50% shareholding.

7.   Whilst John Abood managed the businesses operating from W4.1 and W5.1 on behalf of CQS, he did not assume either proprietorial or management responsibility in respect of the businesses or the leases and did not take a profit share, and was remunerated only by wage.

8.   The leased shop premises were owned by the Marine Ministerial Holding Corporation (‘MMHC’). The leases were managed by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (‘SHFA’). The responsibility for letting or re-letting the premises and determining the terms upon which they would be leased lay with the Waterways Authority, which was later known as the Maritime Authority of NSW (‘Maritime’). Maritime was, within the relevant period, within the portfolio of the New South Wales Minister of Ports.

9.   The leases over shops W4.1 and W5.1 had initially been granted to the former tenants in December 1999 and June 2000 after a limited EOI process favoring incumbent tenants. The leases both were to expire on 31 August 2005, on the understanding that at the expiration of the leases a public expression of interest (‘EOI’) would be held to realize a commercial market rent rate.

10.   From August 2003, Mr Abood commenced to make representations to Maritime to the effect that upon expiry of the leases of the two shops on 31 August 2005, the proprietor, MMHC, should negotiate with CQR to enter into new leases of 5 years with an option of a further 5 years, rather than advertising publicly for EOIs in the leases.

11.   Maritime's response to the representations, communicated by Mr Zenon Michniewicz (General Manager, Maritime Property Division), was that upon expiry of the leases Maritime would advertise for expressions of interest with a view to granting a new lease pursuant to an open, competitive process.

12.   From about early 2005 to about September 2007 CQR was also in dispute with Maritime concerning the amount of rent to be paid by CQR during any holding over of the leases beyond the 31 August 2005 date upon which the leases were set to expire. An automatic 10% increase in rent during any hold over period was provided for by clause 3.5 of the memorandum of leases in respect of both shop premises.

13.   From about October 2004, and continuing to 2008, CQR together with other tenants of Circular Quay premises engaged Paul Scanlan as a negotiator and mediator to put, in part, their case to Maritime for direct negotiation with the leaseholders towards new leases from the expiry of their current terms, Obeid interests paid Paul Scanlan's fees.

14.   From early 2005 the Property Division of Maritime made preparations to advertise for EOI for new leases of all of the Circular Quay shops, including shops W4.1 & W5.1, from the expiry of the current leases on 31 August 2005.

15.   The EOI process was initially delayed, and then stalled, as Maritime considered various proposals to rationalise leasing policy within the Circular Quay precinct and for Maritime generally between 2005-2007. The lessees at Circular Quay, including CQR, were initially given a 6 month extension of their leases from 1 September 2005 to 28 February 2006, and then transitioned into monthly holdovers thereafter.

Ministers with responsibility for the subject properties

16.   At times relevant to the charge, three people successively held the position of Minister responsible for the Maritime Authority:


	
		
			
			Michael Costa
			
			
			2 April 2003 -10 August 2005
			
		
		
			
			Eric Roozendaal
			
			
			10 August 2005 -17 February 2006
			
		
		
			
			Joseph Tripodi
			
			
			17 February 2006 - 17 November 2009
			
		
	


17.    During this period Edward Moses Obeid used his position as a Member of the Legislative Council to access Mr. Tripodi to make general representations in favour of the position taken by the CQR. Such representations, had they been adopted, would have altered Maritime policy in a way favourable to Edward Moses Obeid, and his family.

Sequence 1: Misuse of public office

18.   Stephen Dunn was known personally to Edward Moses Obeid from about 1999:

a.   in a professional capacity, in that they had worked together from 1999 to 2003 when Edward Moses Obeid was Minister for Fisheries and Stephen Dunn was Director-General of Fisheries; and

b.   in a social capacity, in that after 2003 during times when they had no official or other business dealings they met and made contact by phone from time to time to discuss matters of common interest.

19.   From about 1999 Stephen Dunn regarded Edward Moses Obeid as his friend and mentor.

20.   Stephen Dunn was appointed Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Maritime on 15 August 2007 and General Manager Maritime Property Division on 21 August 2007.

21.   On 17 August 2007, two days after Stephen Dunn's appointment to Maritime, Edward Moses Obeid contacted him by telephone. During the conversation that followed. Stephen Dunn's recent appointment to Maritime was discussed, as was the complaint by Circular Quay leaseholders that they were being poorly treated by Maritime. Edward Moses Obeid asked Stephen Dunn to meet with the tenant's banister, Paul Scanlan, as the ‘stake holders representative’ in order to hear, and act upon, their grievances.

22.   As a result of this request Stephen Dunn and Paul Scanlan spoke on 20 and 21 August 2008. They arranged to meet in person at Paul Scanlan's office on 28 August 2007. Stephen Dunn approached Patrick Low. General Manager Policy of Maritime, and asked him to accompany him to the meeting.

23.   On 27 August 2007 Edward Moses Obeid spoke with Stephen Dunn by telephone for eight minutes from 7.04pm, in the course of which conversation:

a.   both parties referred to the meeting between Stephen Dunn, Patrick Low and Paul Scanlan scheduled for the next day; and

b.   Edward Moses Obeid urged the interests of the lessees upon Stephen Dunn.

24.   On 28 August 2007, Stephen Dunn and Patrick Low met with Paul Scanlan for one hour at Mr Scanlan's office at 155 King Street, Sydney during which Paul Scanlan requested:

a.   a review by Maritime of the automatic increase of 10% which was being applied to the tenants of shops at Circular Quay (including CQR) during the holding over period;

b.   consideration of allowing sitting tenants (including CQR) a right of last refusal in respect of the issue of new leases; and

c.   that Maritime adopt a policy of direct negotiation with sitting tenants followed by competitive tender process only if negotiation should not conclude satisfactorily.

25.   On 28 August 2007, after the said meeting Stephen Dunn requested by email that Patrick Low and Simon Lawton (a Maritime Property Division officer) provide advice including a draft response to Paul Scanlan on the issue of automatic 10% rent increases during holding over by the Circular Quay tenants. Later that evening Stephen Dunn telephoned Edward Moses Obeid and reported on the meeting he had with Paul Scanlan.

26.   On 3 September 2007, Stephen Dunn received from Simon Lawton an email prepared by a Maritime Commercial Property officer, Geoffrey Monkhouse answering in thirteen points the three matters which had been raised on 28 August 2007 by Paul Scanlan at his meeting with Stephen Dunn and Patrick Low. The email maintained Maritime's long held position that the premises should be the subject of an open tender process.

27.   On the evening of 3 September 2007 Stephen Dunn called Edward Moses Obeid and they spoke for nine minutes concerning progress towards Maritime addressing the matters set out at (a) to (c) of subparagraph 24 above, the matters raised in Geoffrey Monkhouse's email and concerning Stephen Dunn's intention to inform Circular Quay tenants that Maritime would not seek further increases of rent under the then current holding over period.

28.   It is the Crown Case that Edward Moses Obeid had informed Stephen Dunn at an early stage of the Obeid family's interest in leases at Circular Quay, and lobbied overtly and partially for an outcome beneficial to his private interests, thereby misconducting himself in public office. Stephen Dunn, with this knowledge, took a personal interest in the outcome of the matter, and reported diligently back to Edward Moses Obeid as to the progress that was being made.

29.   Irrespective of whether Stephen Dunn understood that Edward Obeid had a financial interest in two of the subject properties, in speaking to Stephen Dunn in the terms and on the occasions particularised in paragraphs 21, 23 and 27 above Edward Moses Obeid misused his public office as a Member of the Legislative Council to encourage Stephen Dunn to alter Maritime's policy towards tenants of properties at Circular Quay and to alter the terms upon which Maritime would deal with and transact with those tenants, favourably to the tenants and in particular favourably to the company in which Edward Moses Obeid and his family had a financial interest, CQR.

30.   On 4 September 2007 Stephen Dunn wrote to Paul Scanlan and informed him:

a.   Maritime's leasing policy as it affected the Circular Quay tenants was under review; and

b.   Maritime would ‘not seek any further increases [of rent] under the current arrangement’.

31.   On 4 September 2007 Stephen Dunn discussed Maritime's draft Commercial Leasing Policy with Patrick Low and caused Clause 4.5 of it to be altered to the effect that whereas version 9 of the draft (which was current from 7 August 2007) provided that upon expiry of retail leases renewal ‘would be offered by a competitive process’, the policy as amended by Stephen Dunn (version 10.1 of 4 September 2007) provided that retail leases ‘will be offered via direct negotiation in the first instance’ and that if such negotiations should fail to achieve a satisfactory outcome Maritime ‘will generally conduct a competitive process’.

32.   During September 2007 Stephen Dunn caused a Commercial Leasing Policy with the revised Clause 4.5 to be submitted to the Minister for Ports, Mr Tripodi, for the purpose of the Minister in turn submitting it to Cabinet for approval and adoption. Such approval and adoption occurred on 26 November 2007.”


	
	The Crown alleges that the Applicant, in speaking to Stephen Dunn in the terms and on the occasions referred to in paragraphs [21]-[23] and [27] of the Crown Case Statement, misused his public office as a member of the Legislative Council to encourage Mr Dunn to alter the policy of the Maritime Authority of New South Wales towards tenants of properties at Circular Quay, and to alter the terms upon which that Authority would deal with and transact with those tenants.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Applicant encouraged alterations that were favourable to the Circular Quay tenants and, in particular, favourable to the company in which the Applicant and his family had a financial interest, being Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Limited.
	


Elements of the Offence of Wilful Misconduct in Public Office


	
	Submissions for the Applicant and the Crown touched upon the elements of the common law offence of wilful misconduct in public office. It is appropriate to refer to these elements to allow some understanding of what it is, as a matter of law, that the Crown will be required to establish at the trial of the Applicant.
	
	
	The elements of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office are governed by the common law. Both the Applicant and the Crown referred to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Quach [2010] VSCA 106; 27 VR 310, where Redlich JA (Ashley JA and Hansen AJA agreeing) identified the elements of the offence in the following way at 323 [46]:
	


“So amended, the elements of the offence are:

(1)    a public official; 

(2)    in the course of or connected to his public office; 

(3)    wilfully misconduct himself; by act or omission, for example, by wilfully neglecting or failing to perform his duty; 

(4)    without reasonable excuse or justification; and 

(5)    where such misconduct is serious and meriting criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.”


	
	Of course, it is necessary to keep in mind, as Redlich JA observed in R v Quach at 320[37], that “the words used in the various cases are not to be read as if they are a statute”.
	
	
	I will return to this topic when considering submissions made by reference to likely issues in the trial.
	


Some General Principles Concerning an Application for Trial by Judge Alone


	
	In R v McNeil, I outlined a number of principles relevant to an application for trial by Judge alone at [27]-[39]:
	


“27   It has been said that, despite the terms of s.131, there is no presumption that a criminal trial should proceed with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an applicant under s.132 to displace such a presumption: R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; 217 A Crim R 1 at 25 [96], 29-30 [118]; R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [42]; R v Villalon [2013] NSWSC 1516 at [20].

28   That does not mean, however, that the choice between trial by jury and trial by Judge alone commences with a blank canvas. The Courts have recognised the important role of juries, drawn from the community, in the administration of criminal justice in this State. 

29   In R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258, Spigelman CJ (Simpson and Price JJ agreeing) said at 262 [24]:

‘The central significance of the jury in the administration of criminal justice in Australia is such that the courts should be, on any view, exceptionally reluctant to insist that the system be bypassed, even when seeking to implement the principle of a fair trial. For serious crimes a fair trial in our system of criminal justice is a trial by jury, subject to statutory exception. The community has a right to participate in the administration of criminal justice, and public confidence in that system turns to a significant degree upon that participation. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that a fair trial is not only a trial fair for the accused, it is also a trial fair to the community represented by the prosecution.’

30   Although this statement of Spigelman CJ was made in the context of a case where s.132 in its earlier form was under consideration (where the Crown could veto a Judge-alone application by an accused person), the sentiments there expressed remain helpful.

31   Observations made by Gleeson CJ in Swain v Waverley Municipal Council [2005] HCA 4; 220 CLR 517, in the context of a civil case, have been cited regularly in decisions under s.132. The Chief Justice said at 521 [7]:

‘… decision-making by the collective verdict of a group of citizens, rather than by the reasoned judgment of a professional judge, is a time-honoured and important part of our justice system. It also has the important collateral advantages of involving the public in the administration of justice, and of keeping the law in touch with community standards.’

32   Considerations of the type referred to in these statements from R v Jamal and Swain v Waverley Municipal Council constitute an important factor in the exercise of discretion under s.132(4).

33   Although a s.132 applicant does not carry a burden of proof, he or she does bear an evidentiary burden: R v Stanley at [42].

34   Section 132(4) identifies the test to be applied on an application such as this. The Court may make an order for trial by Judge alone ‘if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so’. That formulation confers a wide discretion on the Judge determining the application: R v Stanley at [23].

35   Section 132(5) is not an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which an order may be refused. Rather, it provides illustrations of circumstances in which refusal may occur. The legislature has provided some specific examples to be considered in this respect. Section 132(5) acknowledges that, when considering where the interests of justice lie, it will be relevant that where the trial involves an issue which may be informed by community standards or expectations, the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of lay people: R v Belghar at 25 [96]; R v Villalon at [20]. 

36   Submissions were made for the Applicant that the absence of words such as ‘intention’ and ‘credibility’ from s.132(5) was noteworthy and indicated a legislative intention to omit factors of that type as examples of ‘objective community standards’. 

37   I will refer a little later to a number of decisions where ‘intention’ has been considered in this context. For the moment, I observe that it would, in my view, be erroneous to read s.132(5) in a manner inconsistent with its terms. There may be a myriad of issues which arise in a criminal trial which may fall for consideration on a s.132 application. Section 132(5) should be construed as containing a number of illustrations which the legislature considered were worthy of mention. However, the test to be applied is the interests of justice test posed in s.132(4), with that test to be considered in the context of the particular case. 

38   In forming a view as to what the interests of justice require, a balancing of various interests is required, including the interests of the parties and also larger questions of legal principle, the public interest and policy considerations: Landsman v R [2014] NSWCCA 328 at [69]. The important role of juries in the administration of criminal justice (mentioned at [30]-[33]) may be seen as touching issues of policy and the public interest, which arise for consideration in determining what the interests of justice require. 

39   In R v Stanley, Barr AJ (Macfarlan JA and Campbell J agreeing) said at [42]-[43]:

‘42   … The fact that the applicant has decided on legal advice to relinquish any benefit of trial by jury is something the Court should take into account, but that and any apprehension that he will not receive a fair trial at the hands of a jury must be weighed. A mere stated apprehension without supporting evidence will not be enough. As Chesterman JA said in R v Fardon at [81], an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone for the asking. See generally the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar at [96] - [97]. See also the judgment of Bellew J in R v Sean Lee King [2013] NSWSC 448 at [40] - [46]. 

43   In weighing the concerns of the applicant the Court must have regard to any means available to allay them. The Court should also bear in mind that the interests of the accused are not necessarily the interests of justice. The community receives important collateral benefits from trial by jury in the involvement of the public in the administration of justice and in keeping the law in touch with community standards: Gleeson CJ in Swain v Waverley Municipal Council [2005] HCA 4, (2005) 220 CLR 517 at [7]’.”


	
	I approach the present application with these considerations in mind.
	


Issues on the Application


	
	Mr Stratton SC submitted that the substantial adverse media publicity concerning the Accused was a major factor, in the balancing exercise, pointing to the appropriateness of trial by judge alone.
	
	
	He submitted that other features of the case, including the issues to be determined at the trial, did not provide significant support for trial by jury.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC submitted that the interests of justice called for trial by judge alone in this case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the media publicity could be addressed by appropriate pretrial steps and at the trial itself. It was submitted that several likely issues in the trial are appropriately determined by a jury.
	
	
	I turn to consider the application.
	


The Media Publicity Issue


	
	The principal issue advanced by the Applicant on the present application concerns adverse media publicity with respect to him over a number of years.
	


Overview of Submissions


	
	Mr Stratton SC submitted that there has been a very high degree of extremely prejudicial pretrial publicity in this case. He submitted that there has been continuing adverse publicity over a very long period, to the effect that the Applicant is not merely guilty of the present offence, but also that he is a corrupt person generally.
	
	
	The publicity relied upon by the Applicant included the following:
	



	
	numerous articles attached to the affidavit of Mr Breene describing the Applicant as either “corrupt” or “criminal”;
	
	
	numerous posters observed on telegraph poles in March 2015 which juxtaposed a photograph of the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, and a photograph of the Applicant accompanied by the words “Teach Them Both A Lesson”;
	
	
	statements by a former Premier of New South Wales, the Hon Nathan Rees, that if he was not the Premier at the end of the day, any challenger would be a puppet of Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi;
	
	
	findings by two Commissioners of the Independent Commission Against Corruption that the Applicant is corrupt, with both Commissioners being former Justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales; and
	
	
	extremely strong and entrenched opinions of members of the public expressed on social media.
	



	
	In oral submissions (T27-29, 26 June 2015), Mr Stratton SC drew attention to a number of newspaper articles including the following:
	



	
	the front page of “The Daily Telegraph” on 13 November 2012 with a photograph of the Applicant above a headline “Rotten to the Core?”;
	
	
	the front cover of “The Daily Telegraph” on 1 August 2013 with a photograph of the Applicant above a headline “Corrupt”;
	
	
	the front cover of “The Sydney Morning Herald” on 1 August 2013 with a photograph of the Applicant below a heading “Labor’s Shame”;
	
	
	an article in “The Sydney Morning Herald” on 1 August 2013 (page 4) with a caricature of the Applicant (as a pig eating from a trough of money) under a heading “The Shame File”;
	
	
	an article in “The Sydney Morning Herald” Weekend Edition for 3-4 August 2013 (the News Review Section) with a photograph of the Applicant accompanied by the words “The Godfather”;
	
	
	the front cover of “The Sydney Morning Herald” on 6 June 2014 with a photograph of the Applicant beside a heading “ICAC Findings - Obeid Corrupt (Again)” - this being an article concerning a finding of corrupt conduct with respect to the subject matter of this prosecution.
	



	
	Senior counsel for the Applicant drew attention, as well, to an article in “The Sydney Morning Herald” on 16 June 2015 concerning what was said to be a suspicious fire at certain Bankstown premises said to be associated with the Applicant. It was submitted that this article illustrated an ongoing level of publicity concerning the Applicant and his family.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC submitted that the book “He Who Must Be Obeid” remains available for sale, with a chapter of the book relating to the subject matter of this prosecution.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC submitted that care is required in relying upon what was said in R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258. He submitted firstly, that all of the cases cited by the Chief Justice were cases where the remedy sought in the face of adverse pretrial publicity was a permanent stay of the proceedings, a much more extreme remedy than is sought by the Applicant in the present case. Secondly, he observed that at a later time the convictions were quashed on appeal: Jamal v R [2012] NSWCCA 198. A retrial was ordered on one count which proceeded by way of a Judge-alone trial at which the Accused was acquitted: R v Jamal [2013] NSWDC 20.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC submitted that the level of adverse publicity concerning the Applicant was such that a judge alone trial ought be directed to ensure a fair trial: Arthurs v Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 at [87]; R v Simmons and Moore (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 259 at [87]-[88].
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that the Applicant had received a not insignificant level of publicity concerning the ICAC investigations, hearings and findings and, to a lesser degree, the current criminal charge. The Crown accepted that the right of an accused person to a fair trial necessarily formed part of the broader interests of justice referred to in s.132(4) of the Act.
	
	
	By reference to the affidavit of Ms Chan sworn 29 May 2015, the Crown submitted that:
	



	
	of the 1,800 newspaper articles forming Exhibit TJB1, 485 of them were both published with a metropolitan Sydney distribution, and had the Applicant and the ICAC as the primary subject of the article or referred to the Applicant in an inflammatory manner;
	
	
	of the 1,085 unique articles (articles that were not duplicates of other articles) published in a newspaper with a Sydney distribution, the peak period for published articles was reached during 2013, reducing slightly in 2014, with a marked drop off, relatively, in the first five months of 2015;
	
	
	of the 485 articles published with a metropolitan Sydney distribution that had the Applicant and the ICAC as the primary or secondary subject of the article, the peak of publications occurred in 2013, lessened in 2014 and significantly reduced, relatively, in the first five months of 2015;
	
	
	of the 2,004 news radio broadcasts which made reference to the Applicant (in Exhibit TJB1):
	



	
	1,098 concerned broadcasts within the Sydney metropolitan area;
	
	
	of these 1,098 broadcasts, the peak occurred in 2013 (580), lessened in 2014 (436) and significantly reduced, relatively, in the first five months of 2015 (43);
	



	
	Internet searches on Google using the search term “Eddie Obeid” indicated that the search term peaked during 2013 and decreased significantly in relative popularity from January 2015.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that there is a pattern of publicity concerning the Applicant peaking in 2013, lessening in 2014 and significantly dropping further up to mid-2015. The Crown submitted that this pattern of decreasing publicity was further demonstrated by Ms Chan’s affidavit of 26 June 2015.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the evidence that the book “He Who Must Be Obeid”, published in August 2014, was not available for sale from August until early December 2014.
	
	
	With respect to the Facebook and Twitter material contained in Exhibit TJB1, the Crown submitted that there was no evidence as to the reach of this material. The Crown pointed to the observation of Harrison J in R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729; 230 A Crim R 74 and in R v McNeil at [72] that musings of “faceless people” on Twitter and Facebook appear irrational and, in some instances, could be described as puerile.
	
	
	The Crown noted that the courts are not unfamiliar with criminal trial matters receiving high levels of media interest, both in quantity and in its potentially prejudicial nature. Reference was made to R v K [2013] NSWCCA 406; 59 NSWLR 431 at [80]-[82]; Skaf v R [2008] NSWCCA 303 at [46] and R v McNeil at [64]-[77].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, in the circumstances of the diminishing nature of publicity over time (as appears to be the current position), the “fade factor” plays a part with reference being made to Montgomery v HM Advocate [2003] 1 AC 641 at 673 (cited in R v McNeil at [67]).
	
	
	The Crown referred to the report of Chesterman, Chan and Hampton, “Managing Prejudicial Publicity - An Empirical Study of Criminal Jury Trials in New South Wales” (February 2001), noting the statement therein that, in order to be influenced by prejudicial publicity, a (potential) juror must first encounter information, remember it and then apply it when reaching a verdict (page 148).
	
	
	The Crown pointed to s.68C Jury Act 1977, and the jury selection and empanelment process, as being important factors to take into account in an assessment of the impact of adverse media publicity concerning the Applicant, with reliance being placed upon R v McNeil at [68]-[80].
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that an area of concern, in the circumstances of this case, is the risk of heightened publicity prior to empanelment of a jury and whether the empanelled jury might engage in Internet searches during the course of the trial.
	
	
	In this respect, the Crown submitted that the non-publication order already in place with respect to this application would be of assistance (see [8] above). The Crown submitted that further orders restricting publication, of the type utilised in R v McNeil, may be considered in this case. It was submitted that such orders may serve to limit, as fully as possible, media publicity becoming a trigger to electronic searching by members of the community who may become members of the jury panel. The Crown submitted that such orders may be to the following effect:
	



	
	there be no publication of the fact that the Applicant has made an application for trial by Judge alone;
	
	
	there be no publication of the listing of the Applicant’s trial;
	
	
	orders (a) and (b) are to remain in force until such time as different orders are made by the trial Judge;
	
	
	there be no publication of this judgment, or the evidence and submissions made on the application for Judge-alone trial, until such further order of the Court as may be made after completion of the trial.
	



	
	In submissions in reply, Mr Stratton SC agreed with the making of orders as set out in the previous paragraph, although not conceding that they would solve the problem of existing adverse pretrial publicity.
	


Decision Concerning Media Publicity


	
	Some examples of media publicity concerning the Applicant have been set out above (at [36]). It is the case that a steady flow of adverse media publicity has surrounded the Applicant for some years.
	
	
	This case is different to that in R v McNeil, where there was an outburst of highly prejudicial publicity in the aftermath of events at Kings Cross which caused the death of Daniel Christie. The adverse publicity concerning Mr McNeil extended over a period of time but, as the judgment in R v McNeil makes clear, it subsided.
	
	
	It may be observed that the strategy to restrict further publicity in R v McNeil was effective up to the time when his trial commenced. However, as the judgment of RA Hulme J in R v McNeil (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 757 makes clear, for reasons that are difficult to understand, some media outlets chose to publish damaging photographs of Mr McNeil once the trial was underway. His Honour refused to discharge the jury.
	
	
	It is noteworthy that the jury acquitted Mr McNeil of murder and convicted him of manslaughter. The outcome of that trial constitutes a recent practical example of the fact that, despite a very substantial volume of adverse publicity (including publicity which took place even when the trial was underway), the jury considered the case on its merits and returned a verdict which had been sought by senior counsel representing him. Mr McNeil received a fair trial according to law.
	
	
	With respect to Mr Stratton SC’s submission concerning R v Jamal (see [39] above), I observe that the particular value of the statements of Spigelman CJ was his Honour’s emphasis upon the importance of community participation in the administration of criminal justice by way of jury trial, with public confidence turning to a significant degree upon that participation: R v Jamal at 262 [24]. That remains a most important feature on the present application under s.132.
	
	
	In the following paragraphs, I set out part of my judgment in R v McNeil (at [64]-[69]) which has application to this case as well.
	
	
	Adverse and sensational media publicity occurs from time to time in the context of cases which have achieved some notoriety. Spigelman CJ touched upon some of these in R v Jamal at 261 [16]:
	


“16    This Court has had occasion to assess adverse pre-trial publicity in a number of cases, being publicity of a character, of a duration and of an intensity which was at least equal, in many cases, to the publicity in the present case. Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases: Anita Cobby, Ivan Milat, Phillip Bell, the Childers Backpacker Hostel fire, Lucy Dudko, William D’Arcy, Bruce Burrell. (See Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94; R v Milat (Court of Criminal Appeal, 26 February 1998, unreported); R v Bell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 October 1998, unreported); Long v R [2002] QSC 54; (2002) 128 A Crim R 11; affirmed on appeal [2003] QCA 77; (2003) 138 A Crim R 103; R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R 371; R v D’Arcy [2003] QCA 124; (2003) 140 A Crim R 303; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185.)”


	
	The Chief Justice continued in R v Jamal, emphasising that the Courts have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. The Chief Justice said at 261-262 [17]-[21]:
	


“17    I have had occasion to summarise the relevant case law in the following manner, applicable to the present case, in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344:

‘[103]    There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them. In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.’

18    There are now numerous judicial statements as to the validity of such an approach.

19    Going back, for example, as Gleeson CJ said in R v VPH (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 March 1994, unreported) at 7: 

   The jury will be given appropriate directions to confine their attention to the evidence that is put before them. Our entire system of the administration of criminal justice depends upon the assumption that jurors understand and comply with directions of that character.’ 

20    Furthermore, as McHugh JA said in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425:

‘[31] … Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.’

21    The perspective that jurors properly perform their task, are true to their oaths and comply with a trial judge’s directions has repeatedly been applied in appellate courts over recent years. (See R v Milat; R v Bell; Long v R; R v Richards [1999] NSWCCA 114; (1999) 107 A Crim R 318; R v Dudko; R v D’Arcy; R v Burrell supra.)”


	
	The lapse of time between media publicity and the trial itself is a significant factor. In Montgomery v HM Advocate, Lord Hope of Craighead said at 673:
	


“Recent research conducted for the New Zealand Law Commission suggests that the impact of pre-trial publicity and of prejudicial media coverage during the trial, even in high profile cases, is minimal: Young, Cameron & Tinsley, Juries in Criminal Trials: part Two, vol 1, ch 9, para 287 (New Zealand Law Commission preliminary paper no 37, November 1999). The lapse of time since the last exposure may increasingly be regarded, with each month that passes, in itself as some kind of a safeguard. Nevertheless the risk that the widespread, prolonged and prejudicial publicity that occurred in this case will have a residual effect on the minds of at least some members of the jury cannot be regarded as negligible. The principal safeguards of the objective impartiality of the tribunal lie in the trial process itself and the conduct of the trial by the trial judge. On the one hand there is the discipline to which the jury will be subjected of listening to and thinking about the evidence. The actions of seeing and hearing the witnesses may be expected to have a far greater impact on their minds than such residual recollections as may exist about reports about the case in the media. This impact can be expected to be reinforced on the other hand by such warnings and directions as the trial judge may think it appropriate to give them as the trial proceeds, in particular when he delivers his charge before they retire to consider their verdicts.”


	
	In Skaf v R [2008], the Court of Criminal Appeal (McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden and Howie JJ) referred to the new dimension flowing from the internet in the area of media publicity. Their Honours said at [27]-[28]:
	


“‘27    The problem of publicity given to an alleged offence and the offender has been considered by the courts on many occasions. Sometimes the publicity has caused a court to defer a trial for a period. The assumption which the law makes is that the public’s memory of publicity will fade with time and accordingly after sufficient time, jurors will have no difficulty in confining their deliberations to the evidence. It is of course inevitable that there will be cases where, either because of the extent of the publicity, or, because of the peculiar or sensational nature of the facts, even if the public memory has subsided, when the evidence is tendered at a trial recollections of previous publicity will return. The internet has given a new dimension to these problems. Newspaper articles which provide an account of various events including allegations of criminal activity or a report of the evidence and verdict in criminal trials can now be retrieved, effectively forever. The law must accommodate these issues whilst ensuring a process which is fair both to the accused and the prosecution.

28    Apart from occasions when a trial is delayed to distance it from publicity, trial judges always tell jurors to confine their consideration to the evidence in the proceedings. If a trial has previously attracted or is likely to attract publicity, judges are careful to remind jurors that they are to ignore any publicity. The contemporary view is that it is not necessary for the jury to be sequestered with exposure to the media thereby eliminated. We accept that jurors will be faithful to the directions given by the trial judge and, if they happen upon a media discussion of the events, will be able to discriminate between the evidence and media reporting of the events.”


	
	Reference should be made to s.68C Jury Act 1977, which provides:
	


“68C    Inquiries by juror about trial matters prohibited

(1)    A juror for the trial of any criminal proceedings must not make an inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.

Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.

(2)    This section applies in respect of a juror from the time the juror is sworn in as a juror and until the juror, or the jury of which the juror is a member, is discharged by the court having conduct of the proceedings.

(3)    This section does not prohibit a juror:

(a)    from making an inquiry of the court, or of another member of the jury, in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror, or

(b)    from making an inquiry authorised by the court.

(4)    Anything done by a juror in contravention of a direction given to the jury by the judge in the criminal proceedings is not a proper exercise by the juror of his or her functions as a juror.

(5)    For the purpose of this section, making an inquiry includes the following:

(a)    asking a question of any person,

(b)    conducting any research, for example, by searching an electronic database for information (such as by using the Internet),

(c)    viewing or inspecting any place or object,

(d)    conducting an experiment,

(e)    causing someone else to make an inquiry.”


	
	In Skaf v R, their Honours returned to the internet, and the role of s.68C Jury Act 1977, at [46]:
	


“As indicated above the internet is an ongoing problem for the criminal justice system. The law has developed some strategies intended to deal with the situation. Model directions have been formulated following the decisions in R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406; (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 and R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; (2004) 60 NSWLR 86 and s 68C Jury Act 1977 came into operation on 15 December 2004 prior to this trial. In her opening remarks to the jury the judge gave these directions. In his submissions to the trial judge on the stay application, counsel for Mohammed Skaf conceded ‘The concern is not publicity or what is is [sic] available on the Internet today because your Honour will give directions in relation to that. It is the publicity which is already out there and whether a direction at the start of the trial can remove that from the psyche of the jury as of today.”


	
	I accept the analysis undertaken by the Crown that there has been a falling off in the publicity concerning the Applicant. It peaked in 2013, commenced to drop off in 2014 with a further peak at the time of the ICAC report concerning him, but with a steady drop off in 2015. In these circumstances, the reduction in publicity is significant and the “fade factor” relied upon in R v McNeil has some application.
	
	
	I have borne in mind, as well, the report of Chesterman, Chan and Hampton concerning the management of prejudicial publicity. I bear in mind that that report was published in 2001, and that the nature and volume of electronic media reporting has expanded significantly since then. However, the findings in that report provide support for the importance of the passage of time in an assessment of the potential role of prejudicial publicity.
	
	
	In R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450, Kirby ACJ said at 453-454:
	


“Courts will assume that jurors, properly instructed, will accept and conform to the directions of the trial judge to decide the case solely on the evidence placed before them in court: see Demirok (1977) 137 CLR 20 at 22. There is an increasing body of judicial opinion, lately expressed, to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the court room, differentiate between gossip, rumour, news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the court in the trial for which they are empanelled.”


	
	The capacity of jurors to differentiate between “gossip, rumour, news and opinion” heard before the case, and evidence heard in the court of trial, is an important feature on an application such as this. The extract from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Jamal (at [60] above) supports the capacity of jurors to undertake their duties in a fair and balanced way, informed only by the evidence adduced at the trial.
	
	
	In Priest v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 12, I had regard to this statement by Kirby ACJ in R v Yuill, together with the report of Chesterman, Chan and Hampton, in reaching a conclusion that a jury should not be dispensed with in civil proceedings where there had been a substantial body of publicity favourable to the plaintiff, but adverse to persons who would be important witnesses for the defendant at trial.
	
	
	A further aspect of that case, which has some relevance to the present application, is that the plaintiff had been a co-author of a book which had been published and which made substantial criticisms of persons and events which were the subject matter of that civil litigation. I was satisfied in that case (at [114]) that this factor was manageable by proper directions from the trial Judge.
	
	
	I adopt a similar approach to the published book concerning the Applicant in this case. In reaching this view, I have taken into account that the book was written by journalists and contains significant content adverse to the Applicant. However, there is no evidence of its sale numbers. In effect, it forms just one part of a body of information available in the public arena which refers unfavourably to the Applicant.
	
	
	I have taken into account the posters observed in Sydney streets in March 2015 (see [35](b) above). They are close to the category of material in social media, which should be approached as “musings” of people, and which should not be given any real weight on an application such as this: R v McNeil at [72].
	
	
	I have kept in mind the most important role which members of the community play in the administration of criminal justice by way of jury service. It is the experience of trial judges that jurors display, in the words of Chesterman, Chan and Hampton (page 5), “good sense and sturdy individualism”. Jurors are not “exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice”: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at [103].
	
	
	I am satisfied that some steps may be taken in this case to reduce the impact of publicity, at the very least by maintenance of the non-publication order concerning this application. These steps should be considered, in conjunction with the strong directions which will undoubtedly be given by the trial Judge in advance of empanelment of a jury, and after empanelment together with the operation of s.68C Jury Act 1977.
	
	
	I am satisfied that these measures will serve to assist a fair trial of the Applicant.
	
	
	I do not consider that the adverse media and other publicity requires, in the interests of justice, an order for trial by Judge alone in this case.
	


Other Features of the Case Bearing Upon the Present Application


	
	I turn to consider other factors bearing upon this application
	
	
	In foreshadowing likely issues at the trial, Mr Stratton SC submitted that it was not anticipated that there would be very much at issue about what the Applicant did or said. Rather, it is anticipated that the issues in the case will very much be what the Applicant’s duties were as a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, and whether or not his activities were in breach of those duties.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC submitted that, in order to make out its case, the Crown must establish that Mr Dunn himself was guilty of wilful misconduct in causing the Maritime Authority of New South Wales to deal favourable with Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Limited in respect of that company’s tenancies of properties at Circular Quay, and that the Applicant was aware that such conduct was unlawful. It was submitted that, if this argument was accepted, then those matters would also be issues at the trial.
	
	
	With respect to the fifth element identified in R v Quach, Mr Stratton SC conceded that an assessment whether misconduct (if found) was serious and meriting criminal punishment was an issue which involved the application of community standards. He submitted, however, that other areas of the case would be the real issues at trial.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the defence characterisation of likely trial issues was unduly simple. The Crown indicated that there were likely to be credibility issues in the trial concerning Crown witnesses as well as the Applicant if he gave evidence.
	
	
	The Crown contended that there are features of this offence which require consideration of objective community standards. The Crown submitted that issues informed by objective community standards arising from the elements of this offence, in the context of the present case, are as follows:
	



	
	whether the Applicant wilfully misconducted himself in his conduct with Mr Dunn between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007 (did he have an improper (dishonest, corrupt or malicious) motive); and
	
	
	whether the misconduct was sufficiently serious and meriting criminal punishment, taking into account the following:
	



	
	the responsibilities of the office and office holder;
	
	
	the importance of the public objects that they serve; and
	
	
	the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the principal factual issues in this case will involve questions regarded as classic jury issues.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC, on the other hand, submitted that this is not a case calling for the application of community standards. He submitted that the major issue will be whether or not the Applicant, in lobbying for a particular policy, was in breach of his duties as a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales.
	
	
	It will be for the trier of fact at the trial to determine the issue as to whether the Applicant’s conduct constituted wilful misconduct. It will be for the Crown to prove that the Applicant deliberately did something which is wrong, knowing it was wrong or with reckless indifference as to whether it was wrong or not: Lloyd v McMahon [1987] AC 625 at 697. This will require consideration as to whether the Applicant had a motive, purpose or intent that was contrary to the duties of his office at the time of the relevant conduct: R v Quach at [83].
	
	
	The Crown contends, and I accept for present purposes, that in the overall context of the Crown case and the events and correspondence taking place during August and September 2007, the trier of fact will need to determine if the Applicant had conducted himself in a way he knew to be wrongful in terms of his public office. If the Crown establishes that the Applicant spoke with Mr Dunn on the occasions referred to above, the question for the trier of fact will be whether, in the circumstances of all the evidence, he wilfully misconducted himself. In the circumstances of this case, that is a matter requiring the application of objective community standards.
	
	
	The fifth element in R v Quach requires a determination by the tribunal of fact as to whether misconduct (if found) is serious and meriting criminal punishment, having regard to other factors referred to in the description of that element. I am satisfied that this aspect involves community standards so that this issue is very much a jury question. Other areas of the criminal law involve analogous assessments. In manslaughter by criminal negligence, an aspect to be considered by a jury (if other elements are proved) is whether the doing of the act merited criminal punishment. Where a partial defence of substantial impairment is raised to a charge of murder, it is necessary for the tribunal of fact to consider (if other aspects are established) whether “the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter”: s.23A(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. This is a task for the tribunal of fact, which must approach the task in a broad commonsense way, involving a value judgment by a jury representing the community. It is a quintessential jury issue: Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229; 227 A Crim R 217 at 224 [33]-[35].
	
	
	It is difficult at this point to make any meaningful and reliable prediction as to the likely trial issues. The precise formulation of the elements of the offence, in the context of this case, will be a matter for the trial Judge. At this stage, however, I am satisfied that there is scope for consideration of objective community standards in determination of issues in the trial. The Crown outline of the way in which objective community standards may arise (see [82] above) is reasonably open as a view to be formed, at this distance from the trial, of some of the trial issues.
	
	
	I have referred earlier to submissions which were made concerning the issues in the trial. There are unresolved aspects in this regard, which can only be determined closer to or in the course of the trial itself by the trial Judge.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the trial will involve factual issues that require the application of objective community standards and the determination as to whether intention is established.
	
	
	With respect to the role of intention, I remain of the view expressed in R v McNeil at [90]-[93]:
	


“90   The starting point on this issue is strong obiter dicta of Heydon J in AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at 472-473 [95]. In the course of providing other examples of factual issues requiring the application of ‘objective community standards’ in s.118(6) Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (WA). Heydon J referred to the question ‘whether an accused person had a particular intention’. Gummow and Hayne JJ at 451-452 [38] agreed generally with the reasons of Heydon J. 

91   The Court of Criminal Appeal, and single Judges, have considered the role of intention in s.132(5). Mr Smith SC relied upon passages in R v Belghar at 24-26 [90]-[100] and in the decisions of Harrison J in R v Abrahams at 96-97 [71]-[77] and of Hamill J in R v Simmons; R v Moore (No. 4) at [61]-[66].

92   The Crown referred to passages in R v Stanley at [56]-[61], R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58]-[59] and of Bellew J in R v King at 415-416 [48]-[53].

93   In my view, the intention issue in this case may be characterised as one involving application of objective community standards: AK v Western Australia at 473 [95]; R v Stanley at [55]-[59]; R v King at 415-416 [48]-[53]; R v Dean at [58].”


	
	These are significant issues involving intention which appear likely to arise at this trial.
	
	
	It seems to me that issues of credibility are likely to arise in this case. Once again, I remain of the view expressed in R v McNeil at [102]-[104]:
	


“102   Where the credibility of witnesses arises as an issue in the trial, in my view this factor may operate in favour of a jury trial. This is so whether an assessment of credibility involves application of objective community standards or not. Such a trial will involve 12 members of the public (as opposed to one Judge) bringing their experience to bear in determining if the witnesses are giving credible and reliable evidence. 

103   Like Latham J in R v Dean at [59], I would call in aid the statement of Lord Devlin in Trial by Jury (1966), page 140, cited by Heydon J in AK v Western Australia at 472 [94]:

‘Secondly, Lord Devlin also saw juries as being superior to judges in assessing credibility [78]: 

‘[T]he jury is the best instrument for deciding upon the credibility or reliability of a witness and so for determining the primary facts. Whether a person is telling the truth, when it has to be judged, as so often it has, simply from the demeanour of the witness and his manner of telling it, is a matter about which it is easy for a single mind to be fallible. The impression that a witness makes depends upon reception as well as transmission and may be affected by the idiosyncrasies of the receiving mind; the impression made upon a mind of twelve is more reliable. Moreover, the judge, who naturally by his training regards so much as simple that to the ordinary man may be difficult, may fail to make enough allowance for the behaviour of the stupid. The jury hear the witness as one who is as ignorant as they are of lawyers' ways of thought; that is the great advantage to a man of judgment by his peers’.’

104   Insofar as it would seem that there are issues as to the credibility on the part of witnesses to be called in the Applicant’s trial, in my view this factor may be taken into account in support of retaining the s.131 procedure of trial by jury.”


	
	In my view, the likely issues in the trial include significant matters which are appropriate for determination by a jury.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have had regard to all factors bearing upon the exercise of discretion under s.132(4) as identified in this judgment.
	
	
	I have had regard to the adverse media and other publicity concerning the Applicant (including the book and posters referred to earlier), the steps which the Court may take in advance of the trial to mitigate the effects of publicity and other aspects of the case, including issues of intention, credibility and the application of objective community standards, which bear upon the s.132 application.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I do not consider that it is in the interests of justice for the Applicant to be tried by Judge alone.
	
	
	The Applicant’s Notice of Motion filed 19 May 2015 should be dismissed.
	
	
	As foreshadowed earlier in this judgment, I am satisfied for the purpose of s.8(1)(a) Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 that some orders are necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. The existing non-publication order should remain in place until such time as a different order or orders are made by the trial Judge.
	
	
	I should refer to further material furnished to the Court since the hearing of this application.
	
	
	In a further submission dated 3 July 2015, which was accompanied by a further affidavit of Jessica Chan sworn that day, the Crown pointed to further action which had been taken concerning media publicity:
	



	
	the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (“ODPP”) has requested, on 2 July 2015, that references to the Applicant in connection to findings of corruption by the ICAC be removed from the online websites of Fairfax Media and News Limited;
	
	
	the ODPP has requested the co-operation of the ABC, SBS, Channel 9, Channel 7, Channel 10, Foxtel, Sky News, 2GB and 2UE to refrain from publishing references to findings of corruption by the ICAC concerning the Applicant prior to trial;
	
	
	the ICAC has informed the ODPP that, on 1 September 2015, it will remove from its public website publications (including reports, transcripts, exhibits, witness lists and public notices) concerning the ICAC investigations and findings entitled Cyrus, Meeka and Cabot (each of which involved the Applicant) until such time as the trial has concluded.
	



	
	The Crown referred to the Court’s capacity to make orders, if necessary, in accordance with Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Limited v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125; 83 NSWLR 52 at 78 [98], 70 [105].
	
	
	The Crown proposed the making of additional orders which were supported by the Applicant (see [51]-[52] above). I will invite submissions on the question whether an order should be made prohibiting publication of the listing of the Applicant’s trial and the utility of such an order.

		30 June 2016",2015-07-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767117,Carr v R [2015] NSWCCA 186,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 15 October 2012, the applicant, Bradley Keith Carr, entered a plea of guilty to three charges in the Burwood Local Court (with two further charges being taken into account on sentence). He went to trial on 10 further charges, being found guilty with respect to eight and not guilty with respect to two of the charges. The trial judge, Garling ADCJ, sentenced the applicant on 29 November 2013 to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 9 years and 4 months. The aggregate sentence related to the charges to which he had pleaded and those for which he was convicted following the jury trial.
	
	
	On 6 February 2015 the applicant sought to appeal with respect to each conviction on three grounds, namely:
	


(1)   The trial judge erred by not discharging a juror (the foreperson) under s 53A(1)(c) of the Jury Act 1977.

(2)   The trial judge erred by not discharging the jury under s 53C of the Jury Act 1977.

(3)   The trial judge erred by limiting the examination of the foreperson and the jury to whether inquires had been made outside of the jury room, by way of accessing the internet and social media.


	
	The applicant was put on trial with two co-accused (Laurence Glover and Nathan Stuart) who also have applications for leave to appeal from their convictions. In the course of Mr Carr’s application, each sought to amend his notice of appeal to include the grounds identified by Mr Carr. Neither had previously sought to do that. Counsel explained that they did not seek to put further submissions in support of the applications to amend, but merely to obtain the benefit of any success which Mr Carr might have on his application: that is, if the jury should have been discharged, the convictions of all those who were accused and convicted together should be set aside. The Court determined that if Mr Carr were successful, then they would be entitled to make the amendments sought; if not, leave to amend would be refused.
	
	
	For reasons which will appear below, Mr Carr required leave to appeal because none of the grounds raised a question of law only. [1]  Further, ground 2 was not an independent ground, but was consequential upon ground 1. That is, relevantly for present purposes, the power relied on to discharge the jury was only engaged where the court had first discharged a juror in the course of a trial. [2]  Even in that event, the obligation to discharge the jury is not absolute, but depends upon the judge forming an opinion that to continue the trial with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. Because, for the reasons given below, ground 1 should be dismissed, the consequential issues as to how s 53C might apply in this Court do not arise.
	
	
	Ground 1 invoked s 53A of the Jury Act, which provides:
	


53A   Mandatory discharge of individual juror

(1)   The court or coroner must discharge a juror if, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest:

(a)   it is found that the juror was mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, whether because the juror was excluded from jury service or was otherwise not returned and selected in accordance with this Act, or

(b)   the juror has become excluded from jury service, or

(c)   the juror has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial or coronial inquest.

(2)   In this section:

misconduct, in relation to a trial or coronial inquest, means:

(a)   conduct that constitutes an offence against this Act, or

Note. For example, under section 68C it is an offence for a juror to make certain inquiries except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.

(b)   any other conduct that, in the opinion of the court or coroner, gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the trial or inquest.


	
	There is no suggestion that any juror was mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, nor that any had become “excluded from jury service”, for the purposes of pars (a) and (b) of subs (1). Rather, it was said that the foreperson had engaged in misconduct within par (c), as misconduct is defined in the subs (2). The relevant misconduct was said to be a breach of s 68C, which provides as follows:
	


68C   Inquiries by juror about trial matters prohibited

(1)   A juror for the trial of any criminal proceedings must not make an inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.

Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.

(2)   This section applies in respect of a juror from the time the juror is sworn in as a juror and until the juror, or the jury of which the juror is a member, is discharged by the court having conduct of the proceedings.

(3)   This section does not prohibit a juror:

(a)   from making an inquiry of the court, or of another member of the jury, in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror, or

(b)   from making an inquiry authorised by the court.

(4)   Anything done by a juror in contravention of a direction given to the jury by the judge in the criminal proceedings is not a proper exercise by the juror of his or her functions as a juror.

(5)   For the purpose of this section, making an inquiry includes the following:

(a)   asking a question of any person,

(b)   conducting any research, for example, by searching an electronic database for information (such as by using the Internet),

(c)   viewing or inspecting any place or object,

(d)   conducting an experiment,

(e)   causing someone else to make an inquiry.


	
	On the morning of 20 June 2013, well into the trial, the judge noted in the presence of counsel, but not of the jury, that when the jury room had been cleaned on the previous evening, copies of four brief newspaper accounts of events at the trial had been found, three of which referred to the evidence of Mr Justin Hemmes, who had given evidence on 13 June 2013, and one to the opening statement of the prosecutor. Counsel were asked to indicate what course, if any, should be taken.
	
	
	It was not submitted by counsel that reading newspaper accounts of the trial constituted misconduct on the part of any juror. However, someone had gone a step further and cut out the four items in the press and brought them into the jury room. It was difficult to make much of those two additional steps, particularly in circumstances where the trial judge, while giving detailed instructions as to what was and was not appropriate conduct (at the opening and during the course of the trial) had told the jury that they were not prohibited from reading newspapers.
	
	
	With the exception of counsel for Mr Carr, the concerns of the judge, the prosecutor and defence counsel were limited to the possibility that the action of cutting out newspaper articles and bringing them into the jury room might indicate that one or more jurors had engaged in inappropriate inquiries, against which they had been directly and rigorously warned. Subject to one additional matter, it was quite unclear from the discussion recorded in the transcript that there was any firm basis for thinking that inquiries had gone further and included, for example, searches on the internet.
	
	
	The additional matter was that one of the articles referred to Mr Carr as having been charged with a specific offence for which he was not charged and had never been charged. So far as a juror was concerned, that would have been a simple (and understandable) error on the part of the journalist: nevertheless, there was some concern expressed by counsel for Mr Carr that the jury might speculate that there was more to it and that he had been charged at some stage, but that had not been disclosed to them. However, that issue was addressed directly and forcefully in directions, in terms accepted by counsel at the trial. It is not the subject of a separate ground of appeal.
	
	
	The judge took two specific steps by way of inquiry. First, he called the foreperson, had him sworn, and noting the fact that the newspaper clippings had been found in the jury room, asked a number of questions: [3] 
	


“Q. … I need to ask you … whether you are aware of any member of the jury having made enquiries outside the jury room including the use of the internet or similar social media in relation to this trial?

A. Not at this point in time. There is no evidence or nothing has happened that anyone has gone any further than what they’ve heard in this room.

Q. So you are not aware of any such enquiries?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Thank you. Are you aware of or do you know who the juror was who brought these articles into the jury room, just yes or no will do?

A. Yes.

Q. All right, now I am going to ask you to go back but I am going to ask you to ask that juror to come with the officer because I need to ask that juror something?

A. You don’t have to worry, it was me.

Q. Okay. I take it from your earlier answers then that you have not made any enquiries outside the jury room of that nature I just put to you?

A. That’s correct.

Q. So neither you nor anyone to your knowledge?

A. That’s correct.”


	
	The second step taken by the judge was to have the jury return to the courtroom, at which stage he raised with the whole jury the fact that the copies of the newspaper articles had been found in the jury room and posed to all of them a question as to whether any of them had or were aware of anyone having made inquiries outside the jury room “including the use of the internet or similar social media in relation to this trial.” [4]  He invited any person who had undertaken or was aware of such events having happened to send him a note.
	
	
	On being informed by the court officer that no one wished to pass a note to the judge, he then turned to deal with an application by counsel for Mr Carr that he discharge the jury. That application was made before the interrogation of the foreperson and jury members.
	
	
	The basis for the application was the concern noted above that if one juror had cut out clippings from newspapers about the trial, it might indicate that that juror, or others, had also made inquiries on the internet, which could have revealed prejudicial information in relation to his client. At no stage did counsel ask that the foreperson be discharged. It followed that the basis for the discharge application was not reliance upon s 53A(1)(c) in combination with s 53C.
	
	
	Having noted the background set out above, and concluded that there was no misconduct on the part of the foreperson in reading the articles and bringing them into the jury room, he addressed the question whether or not the jury should be discharged by reference to the objective test identified in Webb v The Queen. [5]  That test is stated in the following terms: “whether an irregular incident involving a juror warrants or warranted the discharge of the juror or, in some cases the jury, [depends on] whether the incident is such that, notwithstanding the proposed or actual warning of the trial judge, it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension or suspicion on the part of a fair-minded and informed member of the public that the juror or jury has not discharged or will not discharge its task impartially.”
	
	
	The precise formulation of the test will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. The conduct in Webb involved a member of the jury in a murder trial giving a bunch of flowers to the mother of the deceased’s fiancé. In the circumstances revealed in Regina v Pearson [6]  a lawyer involved in the case had attempted to hand an envelope to a juror, in the presence of another juror. The facts of this case are different from each of those matters. On the facts of the present case, the question was whether the conduct of the foreperson in bringing the clippings into the jury room revealed a willingness to make inquiries as to matters involving the case but arising outside the courtroom, in contravention of the judge’s specific and oft repeated warnings not to take such steps.
	
	
	The objective nature of the test was not in issue, because the conduct in question did not give rise to the relevant concern: rather, it raised a further question, as to whether an inference should be drawn that other steps had been taken. In the event that steps (such as searching the internet) had occurred, there was no doubt in the judge’s mind that prejudicial material could be revealed. However, as he further noted, unless the conduct in question gave rise to the relevant inference, one was left with the risk of prejudice which was ever present. He concluded: [7] 
	


“Since raising this matter with the foreperson and the members of the jury, I am confident that they have not accessed material outside of the jury room and I propose to reinforce that with them and to do so on a regular basis. I have therefore concluded that the trial should proceed with this jury.”


	
	The submissions in this Court took a rather different direction from those before the trial judge. Counsel submitted that the “collation and apparent dissemination to other jurors of extracts from newspapers” constituted misconduct within the non-exhaustive definition of “making an inquiry” in s 68C(5). However, whatever rhetorical benefit may be obtained by describing the presence of four clippings in the jury room as “collation and dissemination”, that language was not appropriate to the circumstances revealed in the transcript. It is unsurprising that the matter was not presented to the trial judge in that way.
	
	
	Nor should the statutory language be given a meaning which would encompass conduct involved in reading newspaper reports of the trial and bringing a newspaper (or a clipping from the paper) into the jury room. Something more would be required. Of course, there is a risk that a journalist may have made a mistake, which is a good reason for a juror not to make reference to a press clipping. On the other hand, unless the article revealed extraneous information, that is information not the subject of evidence in the trial, reading the article would not constitute making an inquiry in the sense in which that phrase is used in s 68C. That is because the focus of the prohibition is upon obtaining, or attempting to obtain, extraneous information about the accused or some other matter relevant to the trial. [8] 
	
	
	In the alternative, the applicant submitted that bringing the newspaper clippings into the jury room constituted “misconduct” within s 53A(2), being conduct which “gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice”. However, for the reasons set out above, neither reading the newspaper reports, nor bringing the clippings into the jury room had that effect, in the opinion of the trial judge. Nor did any counsel at trial treat the conduct as having such an effect. It is not apparent from any material before this Court that the judge ought to have formed such an opinion.
	
	
	As noted above, a realistic concern as to the risk of a miscarriage of justice could only arise from the inference that one or more of the jurors had taken a further step, namely to search the internet. The foreperson was asked on oath whether he had done that and denied it. He readily admitted, however, that he was the person who brought the newspaper clippings to the court. That inquiry having been made, and the judge being satisfied that he had obtained a truthful answer (and the transcript gives no hint to the contrary), the basis for the necessary inference was missing. The risk was, as the judge accepted, ever present. If it materialized, there was no doubt that a substantial miscarriage could and probably would occur. Nevertheless, the applicant’s claim falls at the first hurdle, that of establishing relevant misconduct.
	
	
	Ground 3 suggests that the judge erred in restricting the questioning of the juror to the matters noted above. However, no further inquiries were requested at trial; nor suggested in this Court. The ground takes the case no further.
	
	
	Because the issues sought to be raised by the grounds of appeal involve questions of fact and inference as well as law, the applicant requires leave to appeal. [9]  The issue of possible jury misconduct is, if arguable, a matter going to the foundation of a lawful trial. Although the way the matter was presented to this Court differed from the issues raised before the trial judge, it is nevertheless appropriate to grant leave to appeal. The appeal must, however, be dismissed.
	
	
	MCCALLUM J: I agree with Basten J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I also agree.
	
	
	BASTEN JA: Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed. The applications to amend by the other applicants (the co-accused Glover and Stuart) are also dismissed.

2767118,R v Cannon [2015] NSWDC 125,"SENTENCE


	
	Mr Cannon pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence on 6 August 2014 from Wagga Wagga Local Court.
	
	
	The date of the offence is 7 November 1986.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 61D(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), being sexual assault (category 3) sexual intercourse without consent, the victim being aged less than 16 years. The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence is imprisonment for 10 years. Mr Cannon was arrested on 26 February 2014.
	
	
	The Court Attendance Notice is as follows:
	


“Between 4.00am and 4.30am on 8/11/1986 at Wagga Wagga did have sexual intercourse with AGW without her consent and knowing that AGW had not consented to the sexual intercourse.”


	
	It is also part of the Court Attendance Notice that it is a sexual assault (category 3) - person under 16 years of age.
	
	
	I convict him of this offence.
	
	
	This is a very complex sentencing exercise, as Mr Cannon stands to be sentenced applying sentencing principles and the relevant legislation as it was in 1986, some 29 years ago: R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368; 130 A Crim R 481, MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213; 234 A Crim R 576.
	
	
	Further, he is already serving a very lengthy sentence imposed many years ago, which is structured in a particular way.
	
	
	The current maximum penalty for a like current offence is imprisonment for 20 years, with a standard non-parole period prescribed of imprisonment for 10 years. That was certainly not the situation in 1986, as already noted. The maximum penalty has doubled.
	
	
	The relevant legislation is the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW), which commenced on 27 February 1984, as amended by the Probation and Parole (Remissions) Amendment Act 1986 (NSW), which commenced on 25 May 1986. This Act inserted s 21A, which is headed “Disentitlement to remissions - non parole period”. The Probation and Parole (Serious Offences) Amendment Act 1987 (NSW) does not apply as it did not commence until 1 January 1988. Subsection (4) of s 20A provides:
	


“A reference in this section to a serious offence does not include a reference to an offence committed before the commencement of this section.”


	
	In any event, this particular offence is not one found in Sch 5, which lists what are serious offences.
	


PLEA OF GUILTY


	
	The Crown conceded a reduction of 25 percent for utilitarian considerations only should be given. The defence made the same submission.
	
	
	In AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32, Howie J said at [28]:
	


“The Judge indicated that he was giving a discount of 25 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea. The fact that the overall sentence imposed is four years suggests that, without that discount, the overall sentence would have been five years and four months. Of course one curious result arising from the approach of dealing with the applicant according to sentencing practices that existed in 1982 is that he would not have under that practice received a discount of 25 percent for his pleas.”


	
	Mr King, counsel for the prisoner, submitted an allowance was given and not quantified prior to R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104. As noted though, he submitted a 25 percent discount should be specified.
	
	
	In MPB, Garling J (with whom R A Hulme J agreed) said at [99]:
	


“In respect of each offence, the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25 percent to reflect the applicant’s early pleas of guilty. He was well entitled to do this.”


	
	Given the joint concession and what is found in MPB, I intend to give the prisoner an identifiable benefit of 25 percent for utilitarian considerations only.
	
	
	The present s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applies to this sentencing exercise. This is because although the section commenced on 1 January 2003, it applies to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed. The exception to that is not applicable to this case. Equally, s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies to this sentencing. This is because of the provisions of cl 45(1) of Pt 7 of Sch 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which provides as follows:
	


“Except as provided by subclause (2), the amendments made to this Act by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 do not apply to offences committed before the commencement of the amendments.”


	
	Subclause (2) states:
	


“Sections 3A and 21A of this Act, as inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, apply to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed, unless:

(a)   a court has convicted the person being sentenced of the offence, or

(b)   a court has accepted a plea of guilty to the offence and the plea has not been withdrawn,

before the commencement of the section concerned.”

See also MPB at [161].


	
	Section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:
	


“the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)”.


	
	The prisoner gave lengthy sworn evidence and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Despite his account that he cannot remember the offence, I accept he has taken responsibility by pleading guilty and said he was sorry for his offending behaviour and acknowledged the damage occasioned to the victim (transcript 12 March 2015, pp 36 and 45).
	
	
	There is reference to this also in the pre-sentence report of 12 September 2014.
	
	
	The relevant standard is on the balance of probabilities and I am so satisfied.
	


FACTS


	
	The factual circumstances of the offence are found in an agreed facts document. This is as follows:
	


“On 7 November 1986, around 3.50am, AGW (the complainant), born xx 1971, was walking home on Edward Street, towards Tarcutta Street.

Near the bushes at Bolton Park, the complainant saw a man walk from the bushes towards her. The complainant kept walking. Kenneth Cannon (the accused) approached the complainant and put his arm around her. The complainant kept walking and said, ‘Don’t do that’, while she shrugged the accused’s arm off her. The accused hung onto the complainant and said, ‘Don’t make a sound unless you want to get cut.’ The complainant and accused had stopped walking. The accused held a knife in his right hand towards the complainant’s throat.

The accused pushed the complainant towards a tree, approximately twenty to thirty metres from Edward Street. The accused pushed the complainant to the ground. The accused lay on top of the complainant and held the knife near her left ear. The complainant was too scared to scream.

The accused pulled the complainant’s shoes off, taking with them her socks. The accused lifted himself off the complainant and held her down by her chest. The accused undid the zipper on the complainant’s jeans and pulled them off. The accused pulled his jeans down and lay on top of the complainant. The accused put a hand under the complainant’s top and pushed her bra over her breasts. The accused put his hands on either side of the complainant’s head and inserted his penis into her vagina and moved his penis in and out, causing pain to the complainant. The accused ejaculated in the complainant’s vagina, got off her and pulled his pants up. The accused threw the knife in front of him and it stabbed into the ground. The accused threw the complainant’s clothes at her and she got dressed. The accused helped the complainant put a shoe on and she asked if she could go home.

The accused grabbed the complainant’s jacket and pulled her towards him and said, ‘I don’t care if you report this or not, it’s just one of those things.’ The accused picked up the knife and put it up his sleeve.

The complainant walked towards Tarcutta Street and watched the accused walk towards Baylis Street, along Edwards Street. When the accused was out of sight, the complainant ran home and immediately complained to her friend and then her mother. The complainant reported the matter to Wagga Police.

The complainant was taken to Wagga Base Hospital for a medical examination. A sexual assault kit was completed and forwarded to the Division of Forensic Medicine, in addition to clothing worn by the complainant. Semen was detected on the vaginal smears, jeans and underwear.

Whilst an inmate at Goulburn Correctional Centre, the accused was DNA tested and his DNA placed on the DNA database.

In November 2008, a Scene Link was received matching the accused’s DNA to the semen in the complainant’s underwear.

On 26 February 2014, the accused was arrested in relation to the offence. The accused participated in an electronically recorded interview and forensic procedure.

The accused was charged.

Analysis of the accused’s forensic sample confirmed the presence of the accused’s semen on the complainant’s underwear.”

OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING


	
	This is a very serious example of behaviour which is made criminal under the relevant section.
	
	
	The offence involved the threatened and actual use of a weapon, in this case a knife. The offence involved the threatened use of violence.
	
	
	The knife was held “towards the complainant’s throat”, and at a later point, “near her left ear”. The prisoner threatened to use it, threatening to cut her if she made a sound. He said, “Don’t make a sound unless you want to get cut.”
	
	
	I accept the defence submission the complainant, being aged 15 years and some five months, was at the high end of the age range.
	
	
	The complainant was pushed to the ground. He ejaculated in the complainant’s vagina, with the potential consequences such involves in respect of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.
	
	
	She was walking alone at night, or in the very early hours of the morning. She had every right to be doing this and to be free from such an horrendous assault upon her.
	
	
	The victim experienced pain during the intercourse.
	
	
	This must have been a terrifying experience for the victim - alone in the dark, pushed to the ground by an adult male with a knife.
	
	
	I do not elevate her vulnerability to a feature of aggravation as submitted by the Crown. I accept the defence submission. The Crown’s submission focuses on the perceived vulnerability of the victim rather than a class of victims, which is the focus of s 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: Betts v R [2015] NSWCCA 39 at [29]-[30] (R S Hulme J).
	
	
	I reject the Crown submission the offence was part of a planned criminal activity pursuant to s 21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: RL v R [2015] NSWCCA 106 at [36]-[37]. The offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There was though some planning. The prisoner had a knife and was in the bushes at about 3.50 in the morning.
	
	
	The prisoner had a significant problem with alcohol at and around the time of the subject offence. He maintains he has no recollection of the offence. What is clear though from the agreed facts is he well knew what he was doing when he was doing it. His actions and what he said disclose purposeful behaviour and knowledge of his behaviour. As the Crown submitted, “he was in control of his actions at the time of the commission of the offence.”
	
	
	In all the circumstances, the objective seriousness is towards the upper end of the high range.
	


SUBJECTIVE FEATURES


	
	The prisoner was born on 14 February 1960. He is now aged 55. At the time of the offence, he was aged 26 years and some nine months.
	
	
	He had a very difficult young life. His parents were violent alcoholics. He was a person who abused alcohol.
	
	
	He has a criminal record but the offences are not as serious as the present offence.
	
	
	He was committed to juvenile institutions in 1975, 1976 and again in 1977. The first committal, when he was aged 15, was for an offence of indecent assault on a female.
	
	
	He was charged with driving with the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol, drive while disqualified and drive speed dangerous some 15 days after the present offence, 22 November 1986.
	
	
	He was sentenced at Wagga Wagga Local Court on 5 January 1987.
	
	
	He had further offences of drive while disqualified in 1987 and 1988.
	
	
	He committed the offence of murder on 19 April 1987, the victim being a young woman.
	
	
	On 11 May 1990, he committed sexual offences against MQ, another young woman, aged 16 years. The offences involved the use of a knife. The prisoner made admissions about this and pleaded guilty.
	
	
	He pleaded not guilty to the murder but was found guilty by a jury. He maintains his innocence. He says he cannot remember the actual offending on 11 May 1990.
	
	
	All offences were committed in Wagga Wagga.
	
	
	Before proceeding to consider relevant law and the sentences imposed upon the prisoner, it should be said the present offence is first in point of time. His record as of that date was not one which in my view would have disentitled him to leniency. As against that, he continued to reoffend in a most serious way and has demonstrated a continued disobedience to the law. This in my view considerably moderates the leniency he would otherwise have been entitled to.
	
	
	The present offending was certainly not an aberration or foreign to the prisoner’s character: R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [50] ff.
	
	
	I have given consideration to the psychiatric reports which were tendered, together with the facts sheet, in relation to MQ. These reports however are now very old, dated between 1987 to 1991.
	
	
	His custody has been served on protection and his progress within the gaol system has been delayed because of the present offending coming to light so late.
	
	
	The proceedings on sentence have also been protracted for a number of reasons.
	
	
	He has been assaulted at least six times during his time in custody. The last time was six or seven years ago and involved head injuries from which the offender says he has not fully recovered (transcript, 12 March 2015, p 25).
	
	
	The defence has put forward very carefully considered written submissions in relation to the prisoner’s prospects for rehabilitation and contends the Court should find the prisoner has good prospects for rehabilitation. The Crown makes a contrary submission. He has done in custody what has been available to him. Unfortunately though, through no fault of his own, he has had little, if any, treatment for his sexual deviance.
	
	
	I am of the view he has at this time just fair prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Crown points out he still denies the murder, despite having served the sentence in full. Further, five months after this offence, he committed the murder of an 18 year old girl. Three years after the murder, he committed a nearly identical sexual assault offence. He raped another teenage girl, aged 16, at knifepoint.
	
	
	His prospects for rehabilitation cannot be considered and assessed only in reference to the present offending.
	
	
	I make no finding as to the likelihood or not as to his reoffending. However, his offending was gravely serious and concern must be had for his future behaviour, even despite the very long passage of time and his advancing age.
	


SPECIFIC AND GENERAL DETERRENCE


	
	In my view, there must still be an element of specific deterrence in this sentencing exercise. Further, there must be some weight given to the protection of the community, despite the long passage of time.
	
	
	General deterrence must clearly be an important feature of this sentencing exercise.
	


SENTENCES THE PRISONER HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO OR IS STILL SUBJECT TO AND SOME LEGAL PRINCIPLES


	
	The prisoner has been in continuous custody since 23 May 1990. Accordingly, as of today, he has served some 25 years and about one and a half months.
	
	
	The total period of his offending is from 7 November 1986 to 11 May 1990, a period of some three and a half years. It was committed against three separate victims. At the moment, he is eligible for consideration for release to parole on 28 June 2016. The total effective non-parole period is 26 years, one month, six days. The total effective total term is 30 years, one month, six days. The maximum possible period he will be on parole is four years.
	
	
	The percentage of the non-parole period to the head sentence is 86.7 percent.
	
	
	It should be observed this was after intervention in the prisoner’s favour by the Court of Criminal Appeal by judgment dated 30 August 1993.
	
	
	The prisoner was sentenced by his Honour Mr Justice Studdert on 29 August 1991. This was after the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), which commenced on 25 September 1989. Accordingly, the terminology was minimum term and additional term. His Honour imposed a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term of five years. Three quarters or 75 percent of 21 years is 15 years, nine months. The pre-sentence custody of some 14 months, from 11 July 1990 (date of murder charge) to 29 August 1991 (date of sentence) was taken into account. The prisoner had though in fact been in continuous custody since 23 May 1990 for the offences committed on 11 May 1990 against MQ.
	
	
	Accordingly, the total custodial period was some 17 years, three months and six days, and the total sentence was 22 years, three months and six days, the ratio of non-parole period to total term being close to 77.5 percent. Three quarters or 75 percent of 22 years and three months is about 16 years and eight months. So even at this point, if one looks at the total effective custodial component, the non-parole period was in excess of 75 percent of the head sentence.
	
	
	On 29 November 1991, again after the commencement of the Sentencing Act, his Honour Judge Shadbolt sentenced the prisoner for the May 1990 offences against MQ. His Honour imposed a minimum term of seven years with an additional term of two years and four months, accumulated on the end of the existing non-parole period. His Honour then imposed a further cumulative minimum term of four years and six months and an additional term of 18 months. Accordingly, the total effective sentence was 11 and a half years minimum term with an additional term of 18 months, a 13 year period. If the effective minimum term was to be 75 percent, then it would have been nine years and nine months.
	
	
	The effect of this was a total effective minimum custodial component of 28 years and some nine months, six days and a total term of 30 years and three months, six days - a period of supervision of only 18 months and a ratio of some 95 percent between the minimum term and the additional term.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal intervened, as already noted, and reduced the second minimum term to one year and 10 months and the additional term to four years. This gave an allowance for the two months pre-sentence custody which had been overlooked by his Honour Judge Shadbolt. Accordingly, the total sentence was 12 years and 10 months, with a minimum term of eight years and 10 months. Three quarters of twelve years and ten months is nine years, seven and a half months, so this was an allowance for special circumstances in relation to that sentence, or more accurately, those two sentences.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal - the then Chief Justice Gleeson giving the leading judgment, Cripps JA and Grove J agreeing - said the sentence for the murder was appropriate. His Honour, the then Chief Justice, said:
	


“Considered alone, or even in the light of the previous sentence imposed by Studdert J, the total terms of sentence of thirteen years in respect of these two sexual assaults, even allowing for the pleas of guilty, are not manifestly excessive. However, there is a difficulty about the ultimate practical result flowing from the sentences imposed by Shadbolt DCJ, having regard to the relationship between the total minimum term and the additional term. Allowing for all the pre-sentence custody, the ultimate result is that the appellant will have an effective minimum term, including such pre-sentence custody, of twenty eight years and ten months, and an additional term of eighteen months. Whilst in the extreme circumstances of this case I would have no quarrel with the total overall term, the relationship between minimum term and additional term is striking. In my view it allows insufficient flexibility to permit the executive government to take appropriate steps to prepare the applicant for his ultimate release to the community when that comes due. It is well settled that the effect of the imposition of cumulative sentences can itself constitute special circumstances within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 (R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114). The present case provides a rather extreme example of that proposition. (See also Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 64 ALJR 309).”


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal did not give specific reasons for imposing an effective minimum term well in excess of 75 percent of the total head sentence: R v Wakefield [2010] NSWCCA 12 at [26]. The judgment though makes it clear the seriousness of the offending - ""the extreme circumstances of this case” - required the imposition of the effective sentence and minimum term imposed.
	
	
	Accordingly, the total effective custodial component at the moment is from 23 May 1990 to 28 June 2016 - 26 years, one month, six days.
	
	
	It has been necessary to state in such detail the sentencing history as it is against this background and the existing effective sentence and minimum term that the sentence for the present offence has to be imposed.
	
	
	Some relevant law has already been referred to.
	
	
	At the time of this offence, remissions applied to both the head sentence and the non-parole period. This was the case from 27 February 1984. Prior to that time, remissions were only applied to the head sentence. This was the regime under the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW).
	
	
	All remissions were abolished with the introduction of the Sentencing Act. This Act commenced on 25 September 1989.
	
	
	There was no concept of special circumstances or any statutory ratio as the law was at 7 November 1986. Special circumstances was only legislated for in the 1989 Act.
	
	
	In 1982, when the Parole of Prisoners Act was in operation, the non-parole period was fixed at somewhere between a third and a half of the term of the sentence. This was because of the reduction of the head sentence by the application of remissions. Reference was made to this in CPW v R [2009] NSWCCA 105; 195 A Crim R 149.
	
	
	In R v Moffitt (1990) 49 A Crim R 20 at 38, Badgery-Parker J noted that prior to the Sentencing Act, non-parole periods were “often as short as 50 percent of the head sentence or even less.”
	
	
	The case law indicates the existence of a different sentencing practice can be regarded as amounting to special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in sentencing an offender for old offences: CPW at [69], MPB at [31] (Basten JA), AJB at [37].
	
	
	The Crown conceded this would be a basis for a finding of special circumstances to justify a departure from the statutory ratio between non-parole period and head sentence: Crown submissions, 22 April 2015, Exhibit D.
	
	
	Further, MPB at [34] and [150]-[151] is authority for the proposition that s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies to this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The repealed s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is the relevant legislation in respect of this sentencing as it applies in relation to the determination of sentences for offences committed before 1 February 2003. This again is because of cl 45(1) of Pt 7 of Sch 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act noted earlier.
	


VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT


	
	The Crown contends the emotional harm occasioned to the victim should be elevated to a feature of aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In my view, without diminishing in any way the seriousness of the harm, the very significant impact is of a kind to be expected in such a case: RL at [52]. Accordingly, I do not accept the Crown submission.
	
	
	One of the purposes of sentencing noted in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act, subpara (g), is to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
	
	
	I take into account the victim impact statement in this way.
	


DELAY


	
	In relation to this matter, there has no doubt been delay.
	
	
	In November 2008, the prisoner’s DNA was linked to semen located in the underwear of the victim. It was not until some five years and three months later, on 26 February 2014, the prisoner was charged with the present offence.
	
	
	The Crown in the written submissions (undated but subsequent to the submissions of 23 April 2015) explains the delay. Some of the delay is not acceptable.
	
	
	I have considered both the Crown and the defence submissions concerning this.
	
	
	I give some weight to the delay and the positive steps the prisoner has taken towards his rehabilitation. I have already stated though my view as to his prospects for rehabilitation.
	


DEFENCE AND CROWN SUBMISSIONS


	
	I have reviewed all of the submissions and the evidence. This includes:
	



	
	Crown written submissions on sentence dated 22 April 2015 (Exhibit D);
	
	
	Crown updated written submissions on sentence, undated (Exhibit E);
	
	
	Defence written submissions on sentence, dated 23 April 2015 (Exhibit 4);
	
	
	Defence final reply to additional Crown submissions, dated 29 May 2015 (Exhibit 8);

	Exhibits A, B, C and F tendered in the Crown case;
	
	
	Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 tendered in the defence case.
	



	
	I have referred to a deal of the submissions already. It will not be possible to refer to all of them. I have though considered all of the material.
	
	
	With respect to the Crown, I do not take into account in any way the submission made in relation to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW). In my view, this would be completely wrong.
	
	
	The defence contended in the oral submissions (transcript 28 April 2015, p 17, lines 7-12):
	


“Finally your Honour, the ultimate submission is because of the way the sentences are structured and for the reasons that I have already submitted there should be a degree of concurrency in this final sentence and your Honour should strive to achieve as close to the statutory ratio as possible. That will ultimately result in a further non-parole period which is measured in months, not years.”


	
	The Crown contends effectively the sentence should be one which standing alone is the appropriate sentence, placing reliance on the 2006 Act which may or may not be utilised or even if utilised the Court may not agree to its application in this case.
	
	
	To adopt the defence view would be to not give sufficient weight to the principles which must be applied and the requirement for some separate and real punishment for this very serious offending.
	
	
	To adopt the Crown view would be to effectively ignore the principle of totality, the requirement for the application of sentencing principles as they were in 1986, and take into account an eventuality which may or may not happen. As already noted, in my view this would be quite wrong.
	


TOTALITY


	
	The principle of totality is a very significant feature of this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The principle in Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 cannot be overlooked. Since that decision, as early as it was in 1974, it has been clear that a non-parole period represents the minimum period of imprisonment required to be served by an offender, having regard to all of the purposes of justice: LJS v R [2015] NSWCCA 47 at [17].
	
	
	Further, as Button J pointed out in Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50 at [143], the Court’s approach to questions of accumulation and concurrence was “more lax” prior to the High Court decision in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610; 72 ALJR 1416; 103 A Crim R 372; 156 ALR 684, LJS at [18].
	
	
	Partial accumulation and accumulation can be a special circumstance: R v Close (1992) 65 A Crim R 55; 31 NSWLR 743, R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 126 A Crim R 525; 53 NSWLR 704, R v Swan [2005] NSWCCA 252 at [3] (Grove J, Howie J agreeing), MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37 at [68], LJS at [24], Ewen v R [2015] NSWCCA 117 at [227].
	
	
	In my view, this is the position in this case. The sentence I intend to impose will be partially accumulated but there will only be a modest partial accumulation.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make a finding of special circumstances on the two bases noted in these Remarks.
	
	
	Only one case concerning sentences imposed for s 61D offences was referred to by defence counsel: SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94.
	
	
	No statistics were tendered and that is understandable, given the date of the offence.
	
	
	The Court in every case must bear in mind the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence, the particular facts and circumstances - both objective and subjective - of the case, and the requirement for both general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	The principle of totality must be given consideration to and in relation to that principle, the matter of concurrence and accumulation.
	
	
	The effective extension of the non-parole period in this case, and the degree of concurrence and accumulation, is the one which in my view, after giving very earnest consideration to the matter, is appropriate, giving weight to all of the matters noted in these Remarks.
	


SENTENCE


	
	The sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction for utilitarian considerations of 25 percent is 9 years and 4 months. That reduced by 25 percent is 7 years.
	
	
	The total term of imprisonment is 7 years, commencing on 29 December 2015 and expiring on 28 December 2022.
	
	
	The non-parole period I impose is one of 3 years, commencing on 29 December 2015 and expiring on 28 December 2018.
	
	
	I am aware the ratio of the total effective non-parole period to the total effective head sentence is now 87.7 percent. I am further aware this is an increase of one percent on the previous ratio.
	
	
	The special circumstances are those noted in my remarks on sentence.
	
	
	You will be eligible for consideration for release to parole on 28 December 2018.
	
	
	The total effective sentence is now 32 years, 7 months, 6 days. The total effective non-parole period is 28 years, 7 months, 6 days.
	
	
	A period on parole of four years is still available, subject to the prisoner being released on parole at the end of his non-parole period.
	
	
	I recommend in the strongest terms the prisoner receive any treatment or be given the opportunity to undertake any treatment programs for his sexual deviance as soon as possible.

2767122,R v Samu Matagia Telemete [2015] NSWSC 909,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	In the early hours of 2 September 2012, Mr Telemete and his friend Mr Autagavaia were involved in a fight with Mr Darren Neville, who died as a result. Mr Neville’s friends, Mr Steven Mead and Mr Allan Pettit were also involved and suffered some injuries. Mr Telemete was charged with the murder of Mr Neville, causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Mead and actual bodily harm to Mr Pettit. Mr Autagavaia was charged with the same offences, but the prosecution accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter in lieu of the murder charge; he also pleaded guilty to the other charges. Mr Telemete pleaded not guilty to all three.
	
	
	On 20 February 2015 the jury acquitted Mr Telemete of murder, convicting him instead of manslaughter and acquitted him of the other two charges. It is agreed that the proper approach to the conviction is that he was guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. A subsidiary question is whether the blows suffered by Mr Neville to his head and neck, which were the most serious injuries, were inflicted by Mr Telemete or Mr Autagavaia. If inflicted by the latter, then the jury’s verdict must have followed from a conclusion that he and Mr Telemete were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise one of the elements of which was to inflict injuries which an ordinary person would have appreciated would have been serious, those injuries ultimately causing Mr Neville’s death. A complicating feature is that there was conflicting expert evidence as to the mechanism of death. I will deal with this aspect in due course.
	


Background


	
	Mr Telemete was one of a group of Samoan people who had gathered together to celebrate a Samoan function at a school in Macquarie Fields. This was a social function with people bringing their food and drink. Mr Autagavaia also attended. The function ended at about midnight. Near the high school is a hotel where Mr Neville, Mr Mead and Mr Pettit were together drinking and smoking some marijuana. (For convenience, I will refer occasionally to these men as “the Australians”. Mr Telemete and Mr Autagavia are also Australians, though of Samoan origin, but to distinguish them, I will occasionally use the term “the Samoans”.) They were in their late thirties and early forties. They left the hotel around the same time as the people who had been at the function left the school hall. As they walked past the hall an extremely drunk young man named Mossi Aigaga tried to provoke the men into a fight but they ignored him. Mossi was acting on his own and his behaviour was regarded with embarrassment by the Samoan people in the vicinity. Mr Telemete tried to calm him down. The group which included Mr Telemete were walking more or less in the same direction as the Australians on the other side of the road. Mossi tried unsuccessfully to provoke Mr Telemete into a fight and there were exchanges between him and the Australians.
	
	
	At one point, when the Australians were on one side of the road and the Samoans on the other, they exchanged posturing words. There is no real dispute that, after this, Mr Telemete, soon followed by Mr Autagavaia, crossed the road and a fight took place which, one way or another, involved all five men. One of the difficulties in this case is that their intoxication made Mr Mead and Mr Pettit somewhat unreliable witnesses. Before dealing with their accounts and that of an eye witness, Ms Turner, it is useful to deal with what the police found when they arrived shortly after the fight ended and then with the autopsy findings. This provides an objective context in which to deal with this evidence.
	


At the scene


	
	At about 2:00am, following a call over the police radio, Constables Martin and Crossingham saw Mr Neville and Mr Mead lying up against a wooden fence on the western side of Eucalyptus Drive. Mr Mead was sitting up with his back leaning against the wooden fence, his head was bowed with his chin touching his chest and his arms by his side. Constable Crossingham took hold of his left shoulder, shook him and asked what happened but he did not respond. He was still conscious and he felt a faint pulse. Mr Neville also had his back up against the fence with his head facing down to the left as far as it could go, behind Mr Mead’s shoulder, with his torso behind Mr Mead’s back. It seemed to the officers that he had previously been sitting next to Mr Mead but had slumped down behind him. Constable Crossingham found that Mr Mead had a weak pulse. Mr Neville was unconscious and not breathing, with no pulse detectable (though this might have been difficult to do because of his somewhat fatty neck). He pulled Mr Neville by the legs so that he was lying flat on the ground and Constable Martin began performing CPR, essentially rhythmically pressing down on his chest firmly on the sternum area to try to keep the heart beating. After about 10 minutes or so this was continued by an ambulance officer who had arrived in the meantime. Whilst he was performing CPR, Constable Martin noticed Mr Mead sitting up more, move around and groan but he did not say anything. An ambulance officer also attended to Mr Mead. The only objects of significance found at the scene by police were some pieces of timber lattice on the ground which plainly had broken from the fence. It is worth noting that this timber was light and, even if Mr Neville was struck with it (of which there were no matching injuries), it was most unlikely to cause any significant injury. Mr Telemete’s T-shirt was found at the scene as well as a Mr Autagavaia’s cap.
	
	
	At the time the paramedics arrived, Mr Mead was still sitting against the fence, his arms were crossed and he was rocking backwards and forwards. As mentioned, one of the paramedics took over CPR from the police officer. She had previously performed this procedure over fifty times. It is necessary to use moderate to heavy pressure – “enough pressure to actually crack the ribs to actually stimulate the heart while pressing on it” adding “it moves the bones so that you can actually get to the heart because the heart is encapsulated by the ribs”. Asked how frequently ribs were fractured by this procedure, she answered, “If you are doing CPR correctly you will break ribs”. As it happened, there was never any sign of life. Despite continuing CPR at the time of handover at the hospital, Mr Neville did not recover consciousness and very shortly after was certified as dead.
	


Post mortem


	
	The starting point for considering the nature of the assaults on Mr Neville, must be the results of the post-mortem examination, since they provide an objective basis for assessing the extent of the violence. The autopsy was conducted by Dr Istvan Szentmariay, a forensic pathologist employed by the Department of Forensic Medicine. Dealing first with the head and neck, there were four closely associated relatively small lacerations to the back of the right ear with associated bruising, caused by blunt force. (A laceration is not, as the term is generally understood, a curt of some kind, but the splitting of the skin.) These may have resulted from one blow. The upper nose was bruised. There was soft tissue bleeding underneath the skin (not seen externally) but outside of the scalp on both sides. There had been bleeding immediately underneath the skin with an associated extensive bruise of the right strap muscle, deep in the muscle layers of the neck, measuring up to twelve centimetres. On the underside of the skin over the left cheek there was an eight by three centimetre bruise between the jaw bone and the skin and a small bruise on the upper lip. The thyroid cartilage was normal but the hyoid bone had been recently fractured showing a small amount of bleeding. This bone is deep down in the neck so considerable force is necessary to, as it were, reach the bone to fracture it. As with the deep bruising in the neck, which was in the same area, this also was on the right side. These injuries to the neck occurred in a relatively confined area from the top of the ear roughly to the middle level of the neck. Such injuries could have been caused by stomping or kicking but jumping was unlikely as the greater forces would have caused more injuries. A punch is remotely possible. It is not possible to say how many blows were likely to have caused these injuries except that there was more than one. Pointing to the fact that there were injuries on both sides of the head, Dr Szentmariay thought it likely that the deceased’s head was hit on one side, whether with a foot or otherwise, and the injury to the other side was caused, for example, by the head hitting the ground.
	
	
	Moving to the trunk, Dr Szentmariay also saw a number of recent rib fractures. On the right, these involved the back of the first two ribs and the sides of the third, fourth and fifth ribs with another fracture to the front of the fifth rib. The first, second and fourth ribs on the left were also fractured. Except for the fractures to the first and second ribs on the right, the other fractures may have been caused by forceful attempts to resuscitate the deceased.
	
	
	There was also bruising to the back of the right upper arm and to the left lower leg and thigh and the right knee. There was mild (inconsequential) swelling but no significant injury to the brain. Significantly, there were no fractures to the facial bones or teeth, no fracture to the skull or injury to the spine or any fractures to any of the deceased’s arms or legs. Routine toxicology showed a blood alcohol level of 0.177 grams per 100mL of blood.
	
	
	Dr Szentmariay’s opinion was that death resulted from multiple blunt force injuries. Though no specific mechanism could be identified, death was caused by obstruction either of the airways or the blood supply to the brain resulting from the application of substantial force to the neck. He did not think that there was evidence justifying the conclusion that asphyxiation or inability to breathe caused Mr Neville’s death. In summary, Dr Szentmariay’s view was that, there being no other injuries of any significance except the neck injuries, where there are structures relating to blood supply to the brain and availability of air, it is reasonable to infer that the injury to the neck directly or indirectly caused death. He agreed that one application of force could explain the deep injury that resulted in the fracture of the hyoid bone. Dr Szentmariay thought that snoring noises (mentioned by Mr Telemete) were inconsequential.
	
	
	The defence called Dr Hilton, also a highly qualified forensic pathologist but, I think it fair to say, with a great deal more experience than Dr Szentmariay, having worked as a forensic pathologist for over forty years. It was not disputed that Dr Szentmariay’s report and the photographs taken at the autopsy were sufficient to enable Dr Hilton to form his own opinion about the significance of the post mortem results and the diagnostic deductions that could be made from the physical manifestations. Dr Hilton was of the opinion that the physical injuries, whether considered individually or together, were not of sufficient severity to have caused death. He pointed, however, to several other factors: some congestion or tiny haemorrhages in the brain, the characteristics and distribution of which did not indicate that they were caused by any direct force to the head; and the body mass of the deceased which would pre-dispose him to dying from an obstructive problem in his upper airway if he were unconscious (for whatever reason). Dr Hilton thought that the likely cause of death was positional asphyxia precipitated by unconsciousness which, in turn, was contributed to by concussion, alcohol intoxication, his bodily habitus (ie, characteristics) and the position of his head when police arrived. In respect of the explanation given by Dr Szentmariay, in Dr Hilton’s opinion, although death was caused by the prevention of the delivery of oxygenated blood to the brain, there was no demonstration of any constriction of the neck structures resulting from injuries which might impinge (with a slight reservation which he dismissed) upon the blood supply to the brain. Hence, the most likely pathway or the most likely terminal factor leading to death was positional asphyxia.
	
	
	Dr Hilton dismissed (as did Dr Szentmariay) the likelihood of the injuries being caused by someone jumping on the deceased’s head. He thought that the deep bruising in the neck and the fracture of the hyoid bone resulted from two applications of force, with the lacerations to the ear demonstrating at least a third. Although it may be that the injury behind the ears was caused by someone stamping on that area, the injury to the hyoid bone, because of its depth and position, was much more likely to have been caused by a kick or perhaps a punch because of the penetration necessary. The fact that there was no laceration over the jaw or jawbone would also suggest a kick rather than a stomp. The fractures to the back of first two ribs on the right resulted from an additional application of force. Dr Hilton thought, overall, dealing with the injuries to the head, neck and those ribs, four blows of one kind or another would adequately explain them. Dr Szentmariay’s response to Dr Hilton’s view about the likely cause of death was that he found it difficult to imagine a bodily position that could cause asphyxia, bearing in mind the anatomy of the relevant structures. When this evidence was put to Dr Hilton, he said that it had been known to kill a number of people in police cells; it was rare in a healthy adult who was compos mentis but, when the person was drunk and unconscious, it is a real risk. He added that he had been involved in many deaths in custody, some of them in exactly similar circumstances.
	
	
	It was submitted by the prosecutor that I should infer from the verdict that the jury rejected the opinion of Dr Hilton. I do not agree. Acceptance of that evidence would not have required acquittal unless the jury thought it reasonably possible that an ordinary person might not have realized that leaving Mr Neville in a state of compromised unconsciousness carried with it a substantial risk of serious injury. In my view it is likely, and certainly open, that the jury rejected this possibility, especially given the difficulties of attempting to resolve the difference of opinion between the pathologists. It would have been entirely reasonable for the jury to approach the question by testing whether, if Dr Hilton was correct about the cause of death, the chain of causation might have been broken. If not, then it was not necessary to determine which opinion about the cause of death was correct.
	
	
	My task, however, is a rather different one, which requires the objective circumstances of Mr Neville’s death to be determined if I am able to do so. I have formed the view that Dr Hilton’s evidence about the cause of death should be accepted. The injuries demonstrated at autopsy were, it is agreed by the pathologists, not sufficient to cause death and involved no vital organs or significant (in terms of lethality) damage to other structures; in sum, they amounted to lacerations, deep bruising, broken hyoid bone and broken ribs at the top of the neck. Essentially, Dr Szentmariay’s conclusion worked back from the fact of death to the identified injuries so that, once positional asphyxiation was excluded, it followed that those injuries (individually insufficient) operated together by a mechanism which could not be identified to cause death. Dr Hilton’s opinion essentially ascribed the cause of death to the mechanical consequences of Mr Neville’s partially upright position when he was unconscious or insufficiently conscious to move, together, as I understood him, with his difficulty in seeing how the injuries could have led to death. At the same time, Mr Neville’s compromised consciousness resulted from the violence inflicted in the head region so that, although the pathologists differ as to the mechanism of death, they agree about the significance of those injuries. It should be interpolated at this stage that, in the result, the different posited mechanisms do not seem to me to substantially affect the gravity of the offending.
	
	
	As to the extent of violence, the rib fractures to the upper ribs plainly required considerable force (most likely kicking), as did the neck injury. The other fractures may well have resulted from the CPR procedure; certainly I could not conclude that they were caused either by Mr Telemete or Mr Autagavaia. The other injuries were consistent in my view with the use of no more than moderate force.
	


Ms Turner 


	
	A key witness in the prosecution case was Ms Turner, who resided in a house from the kitchen window of which she saw part of the fight. Between her house and the crime scene is a small yard, a relatively narrow road, a small park and then Eucalyptus Drive, on the far side of which the fight took place. The distance was not measured but a view was conducted which provided a good understanding of the distance and the nature of possible impediments to a clear view. It was something over 100m. The park contained a number of trees and shrubs which, to some extent, would have limited her view, although they were significantly smaller at the time of the incident than they would have been at the view. For whatever reason (I think the slope of the ground), Ms Turner could not see the ground on either side of Eucalyptus Drive.
	
	
	Ms Turner said she heard yelling and saw three men standing in Eucalyptus Drive. She said that she saw one man push the man in the centre down and kick him once and then saw the other man on her left kick him as well. The man who pushed the victim over kicked once, whilst the other kicked the man on the ground with (she thought) great ferocity at least seven times. She never saw the man who fell get up; nor did she see anyone sitting up against the fence. It transpired that she (because her vision was obscured) could not actually see the man on the ground and had inferred, from where she saw him fall that he was being kicked, she said she “imagined it was in the head area”. She said both men were wearing hoodies first up but then down. In her first statement to police, taken shortly after the events, she gave a rather different account. She told the police in substance she saw two men standing, one of whom pushed the other over and then kicked him, and then she noticed a third male wearing a hooded jacket run over and kick the man on the ground. (In her evidence she said that her reference to running over was wrong but she didn’t notice it when she signed her statement. She said she had noticed a number of other mistakes in the statement.) She thought that the man was being kicked in the head area but, of course, this was an assumption. Although she saw kicks she did not see any stomping. She heard (what she thought were) palings being ripped off the fence but did not say that she had seen what had happened to them. After the kicks she saw the two attackers leave the area and, further up the road, meet four other males. She was certain only two men were involved in the attack. She said that she moved from her kitchen window to her back veranda from time to time but it is not clear when this happened. She believed that the assault occurred on the park side of Eucalyptus Drive because there was a light there but it might have led her to mistake the position because the light was in fact on the opposite side of the road, where the fight took place.
	
	
	It is notorious that eye witness accounts in circumstances like this are often confused and one must be careful not to construct artificial coherence. I would, moreover, be inclined to regard a witness’ first statement made shortly after to be more reliable than later accounts.
	
	
	It seems to me that Ms Turner had not seen Mr Telemete cross the road or the beginning of the fight. Nor had she seen Mr Telemete without his T-shirt. Since the interaction which led to Mr Telemete losing his T-shirt most likely occurred before Mr Neville was on the ground being attacked it seems likely that it was Mr Autagavaia and not Mr Telemete who Ms Turner saw repeatedly kicking because her attention was focussed on that event and the man involved was wearing a hoodie (so that she might not have noticed the other man whose upper body was bare). The sequence of events described in her statement is somewhat difficult to understand. The Australians numbered three and the Samoans two, which reflects the numbers she mentioned. Both the Samoans said that Mr Telemete went over first and Mr Autagavia followed. I gathered from Mr Pettit’s evidence, though this was not clear, that he was on the other side of the road when his friends were attacked and ran over to help. Perhaps it was he who had been seen running across the road by Ms Turner, although he clearly had not attacked either Mr Neville or Mr Mead.
	


Other witnesses


	
	Mr Pettit said he had met Mr Mead and Mr Neville at the tavern and left with them, though he did not have a clear recollection of doing so. He had been drinking and smoked some marijuana but wasn’t “overly intoxicated”. After Mossi had approached them, he left the other two, crossing the road to the other side, “just doing my own thing you know”. The first thing he noticed was the two men on the ground “getting jumped on” by more than three Islanders. One of them was “jumping in the air as hard as he could and then landing on his head”. This happened at least three times and he ran over to help and was then hit “everywhere”, including in the head. He could not recall whether he was attacked by one or more persons. He backed away but, seeing his friend still being jumped on, he ran back towards them and was then hit to the ground. At this point he was not able to see what was happening to the other men. He was being “stomped on”, got up and ran off, being chased, he thought. In cross-examination he said that two men were jumping on his friends and there were at least five others present, as I understand his evidence, of whom three attacked him. In the statement made to police, he only talked about going over to assist his friends once. He said he had some bleeding from his ear but when he went to a doctor the following day he did not worry about it. The doctor prescribed Valium. Mr Pettit said he was bi-polar and was affected mentally rather badly shortly after the incident and conceded that his condition may have affected the reliability of his recollection, although his evidence was completely accurate.
	
	
	Mr Pettit’s evidence cannot, in my view, be relied on except in broad outline. Although I would accept that he believed his account to be accurate, it was inconsistent in a number of respects with that of Ms Turner, though I think it plain that she did not see the entire episode. Nor is the medical evidence consistent with Mr Pettit’s recollection of the violence.
	
	
	It is necessary also to mention, though briefly, the evidence of Mr Mead. He recalled going to the tavern, meeting Mr Neville and Mr Pettit there and drinking with them. He was “fairly well” intoxicated. He was “pretty sure” that neither he nor Mr Neville punched an Islander male at the start. He recalled “a big fella with a white shirt on” punching Mr Neville in the head and Mr Neville dropping to the ground as a result. (Given that Mr Autagavaia was significantly bigger than Mr Telemete, this suggests that he was the first to strike Mr Neville or, at least, the one whose punch dropped him to the ground.) Mr Mead said that Mr Neville was then “kicked by a few people … pretty viciously” and “wasn’t moving”. They were about four or five metres apart at that point, Mr Mead yelled out, “Hey he’s had enough, enough” and then he was hit in the right ear from behind by “something solid, not like a fist” and fell to the ground. He said that it was at this time that Mr Pettit ran across the road and he was also hit, got up and ran off. Mr Mead said that he could not himself get up at that point. He was then hit on the hand with an object which he could not identify and then, “getting put up against copper logs”, a reference to the treated logs around the park area across the road. It was then, he said, he lost consciousness and woke up in hospital a couple of days later. He said that he read about the incident in local papers, although he was certain that Mr Neville was “kicked viciously”. In his first statement Mr Mead stated he recalled being hit from behind but he said nothing about any hitting or kicking involving Mr Neville. He agreed that, at that time, he had no memory of it. At a later time he heard media reports about the incident. When being asked by Mr Steele, counsel for Mr Telemete, about his first statement to agree that he recalled nothing further at that time he said –
	


A: Can I answer that question, you wanted to establish what my memory was at different points of time?

Q: Yes ---

A: This all seems very surreal, this is like a nightmare. It is hard for me to distinguish fact from feelings. Feelings are not fact, I understand that, but you want me to be one hundred per cent sure on things when I was intoxicated, prescription medication, illegal drugs, how can I be a hundred per cent sure at any point of time with this stuff, without the incident of Darren being hit and kicked like an animal. I am a hundred per cent sure on that, even though my memory is clouded and I had the injury. I’d never seen anyone – it still traumatises me the way this man was kicked. I don’t know how anyone could do that, but it was done. Do with it what youse will.


	
	The ambulance notes record that Mr Mead was not capable of talking to the ambulance officers. He was admitted to hospital on the night of the fight but could not remember what had happened. He was certainly injured in the fight and suffered some bleeding to his brain, which was quickly resolved without medical intervention and had no long term physical consequences. At the time of the first statement he was still suffering from his injuries and headaches and was also on some medication, mood stabilisers and an anti-depressant. (He had long standing issues for which these medications were prescribed.) However, he had been prescribed morphine for pain. He made a second statement to police on 5 February 2015 when he believed he had recalled other things. Mr Mead’s evidence reflects a deal of reconstruction and confabulation, with the consequence that I am unable to distinguish, in relation to important facts, which parts are reliable. This conclusion is reinforced by my own impression of Mr Mead as a witness.
	
	
	So far as the Crown case was concerned, the last eye-witness was Mr Autagavaia, who, as I have already mentioned, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Neville, causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Mead and assaulting Mr Pettit causing actual bodily harm. He was sentenced on 22 July 2014 to a term (discounted by 25 per cent for the plea) of 7 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. His plea proceeded on the agreed basis, in substance, that Mr Telemete was the primary offender who inflicted the most serious violence.
	
	
	Mr Autagavia plainly did not wish to give evidence. He denied any recollection of any interaction with the three victims. The approach of the prosecutor was to take him to what he had said during his interview with police and part of his evidence in his sentence proceedings. This did not help him to recall what had happened, although he said he had told the police the truth. Of course, in what he said to police and to the sentencing judge, he had an interest in downplaying his own involvement and exaggerating that of Mr Telemete. Most of his denials of recollection were lies. I did not regard him as a reliable or truthful witness and do not propose to analyse his evidence in detail. In substance, he said he crossed the road when he saw Mr Telemete was fighting with two men. The third (obviously, Mr Pettit) was sitting across the road. He saw Mr Telemete start punching one of the two men and he and the other with whom Mr Telemete was fighting fell backwards into the fence but he could not recall whether they were still on their feet or had fallen to the ground. He said he was not hitting hard. He said that some of the lattice work on top of the fence had fallen out of the fence and Mr Telemete hit one or other of the men, he thought both, on the ground with a piece of wood, holding it with two hands above his head and then bringing it down on them. He told the police that one or both of the men on the ground made snoring noises. Mr Autagavaia said that he fell down at one point because he got hit but got up and started to fight the third man. He said he thought Mr Telemete came over and helped him but he did not know whether he hit the man. During his sentence proceedings Mr Autagavaia had agreed with the Crown Prosecutor that Mr Telemete stomped on Mr Neville’s chest. At the trial he said that he did not remember whether he saw this.
	
	
	On those matters in which Mr Autagavaia is in significant dispute with Mr Telemete, in particular as to whether Mr Telemete struck one or other of the victims with a piece of lattice and stomped on Mr Neville’s chest, I prefer the latter’s evidence. Certainly, Mr Autagavaia’s assertions about these matters cannot be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.
	


Other evidence


	
	Evidence was also called from a number of other Samoans who had been at the function and, when it was finished went to the home of Mr Autagavaia’s wife, Malia Nickel, where they gathered in the garage which was set up with games and sound equipment and gave evidence of what they heard Mr Autagavia and Mr Telemete say when they returned after the fight. There are a number of difficulties with accepting this evidence at face value: the witnesses’ recollections were first recorded in statements made to police some months after the event and after there had been a deal of media publicity about the incident; all except one had been drinking, self assessment of the effects of which are notoriously unreliable; and what was said does not seem to have been directed to the particular witness but was part of an overheard conversation. The one sober witness was a sixteen year old who had not gone to the function, and met the others when they returned to the garage. He had not been drinking. He recalled Mr Telemete speaking on the telephone about “how he had just come in from a fight and he had hit someone with a piece of wood”. He agreed that after the events there was a fair bit of talk in the local community about Samoan men being involved in the fight and also many reports broadcast in the media but he denied seeing the reports or hearing people talking about what had happened. His statement was made on 9 January 2013. I am not satisfied that this evidence or that of the other witnesses along the same lines is sufficiently reliable to act on. Furthermore, even if Mr Telemete said what has been attributed to him, it is not possible to know whether he was speaking of Mr Mead or Mr Neville.
	
	
	The prosecution also relied on intercepted telephone conversations involving Mr Telemete. During the conversations he said, amongst other things, that the deceased was killed by the use of hands, at another point saying, “He fell down and stomped over him” (from the context, I think a reference to Mr Autagavaia). He also said “there were plenty of us on the road, but we were the only ones who punched him on the other road”. During a conversation with Mr Autagavaia about attending on the police, Mr Telemete said, “Don’t think that I am trying to run away. No brother, I will never run away, leaving you alone, because I know it was me who was wrong that night”. However, in a conversation with another person, speaking of Mr Autagavaia, Mr Telemete said, “He is protecting his own back, he knows, he knows, if he was to tell the whole story, he’s coming down with me because he was the one that started it and he was involved in it … but he wants to put all the blame on me”.
	


Mr Telemete


	
	Mr Telemete gave evidence, speaking English without any assistance of an interpreter. He was at the function, which finished sometime after midnight. He had been drinking most of the evening but he described himself as “affected but … still in control”. He and about six others who had left the function with him were going back to Mr Autagavaia’s house for some more socialising. As they moved off, Mossi attempted to provoke a fight but Mr Telemete ignored him and also tried to provoke the Australians who were walking on the other side of the road. Mr Telemete said that he yelled out to him to leave them alone and “piss off”. However, Mossi continued to run backwards and forwards and act aggressively. Mr Telemete attempted to get him to stop but he ran away. There were exchanges with the Australians, with each side respectively yelling “Claymore” and “Mac Fields” (references to the suburbs where apparently they lived). Mossi had left the road but, Mr Telemete said, one of the Australians shouted out to him, “What do you want dickhead?” Mr Telemete said that he yelled out, “I’m just looking for my mate”. One of the men yelled, “You’re in Mac Fields, this is not Claymore”, Mr Telemete said, “What about Mac Fields?” This exchange continued (as I understand it) for a short time when one of the men, shouted out, “Come on then, come over here”. He said that he responded, “Piss off, stop, piss off”. But they kept yelling, “Come on, come on”. Mr Telemete said that he then crossed the road to try to settle things down. He said one of the men (I take it Mr Pettit) had run across the road (that is away from the other two) but it looked as though he was coming back behind him. His evidence continued –
	


Q: …The other two guys, one had his back against the fence and one was on my left hand side. I've gone over there, ""Mate, I don't want any trouble, I'm just looking for my mate so just go home. I got no dramas against you guys”. Next thing I know the bloke that's on my left hand side has hit me from the side. And when he hit me the guy that's in front of me with his back to the fence I've grabbed on to him to try and stay up but I ended up falling to the ground anyway and I dragged him to the ground with me. I quickly tried to get to my feet and the bloke that hit me first has come in and tried to kick me. I've caught his leg and I pushed him back and started wrestling with the bloke that was on the ground with me. He was trying to hold me to the ground. I wrestled him off me. I got back to my feet and the bloke that hit me first he's rushing at me with punches and just throwing punches at me so I just started swinging.

Q. So when you say you started swinging, who have you started swinging at? --- A. The bloke, the bloke that's coming at me. I just started swinging haymakers.

Q. When you say haymakers, what do you mean by that? --- A. Just (indicated) like a freestyle swimmer would do in the swimming pool.

Q. Overhead sort of punches, is that right? --- A. Yeah.

Q. When you went over to these men, did you go over there because you wanted a fight? --- A. No, no.


	
	Mr Telemete did not know who punched him. He was swinging the haymakers to the person who was standing up, who had originally punched him. The other person was still on the ground and every time he tried to get up, Mr Telemete said he pushed him back to the ground with his hand. He continued –
	


A. The bloke kept coming at me. He's grabbed the back of my shirt. He started hooking me and kneeing me at the same time. I've punched him to the fence to try and pin him up against the fence to limit all his punches. Next thing the bloke's grabbed my shirt and he's pulled it over my head and just started going to town on me. While my shirt's over the head, my head, I've then reached up to the lattice to try and stop him from throwing all these punches at me. He's pushed me off and the lattice broke away.

…

Q. What did you do with the lattice? --- A. I just threw it to the ground straightaway and just started swinging again.

Q. Had you been pushed back at this stage? --- A. What was that?

Q. When he pushed you off had you been pushed back at that stage? --- A. Yeah, yeah.

Q. Did you hit any of the men with the lattice at any stage? --- A. No, no.

Q. When you started swinging again what happened? --- A. The bloke that was on the ground was coming at me. He's up by that time. He starts coming at me with fist punches, just started throwing punches at me. I've just had, like, how would you say it, hunched over and just started swinging haymakers, head down. One of my punches must have connected because one of the blokes dropped and I have turned to the guy that I had pinned against the fence, I've tackled him to the ground. And I tackled him to the ground, got back to my feet and kicked him twice in the legs [to deter the bloke from getting up and chasing me]. And when I turned, I turned around and seen Terry running over. Terry's run over and kicked the bloke I've just tackled. And, yeah, starting kicking him.

He said that, when Terry started kicking the man, he was just hunched over trying to get his breath. He did not know how many times Terry kicked the man but was in the upper body region on the right side. He was asked what he did when he saw Terry kicking –

Q. You say you saw Terry doing some kicks. What happened then?

A. I have just walked – started walking away trying to catch my breath. Next thing I know I turned around again and Terry's fighting some – the bloke that's gone across the road. I've started yelling out to him to let – ""That's enough, let's go home"". They kept going. Kept yelling out, ""That's enough, let's go home"". He wouldn't listen. I just started walking off. Then Terry finally come over asked me if I was all right.

He denied hitting the “third person” (ie, Mr Pettit). Mr Telemete said the left side of his face was sore and he had “a couple of bumps on the forehead”. One or both of them were making snoring noises. Mr Telemete did not think at that time they were seriously hurt. He thought they would get up and walk home. He did not really think they had been knocked out but this was not something he thought about. He said he was “just out of breath, just too tired”. He then walked away with Mr Autagavaia, going to the house of his mother-in-law.


	
	In cross examination Mr Telemete said that he crossed the road because the men were “carrying on, calling me over”. He said that he went to try and calm things down and denied emphatically that he wished to confront them –
	


Confront them for what? What do I get out of it? I got no dramas against them. What did I do? They’ve done nothing to me.

He denied being in an annoyed frame of mind or that he had started the fight. He said that he did not see Mr Autagavaia kicking any person other than the one on the ground. He thought that Mr Neville was the one who he tackled to the ground. He denied hitting Mr Mead with the wood or kicking him and did not see Mr Autagavaia doing anything to him. He had no explanation as to how he got injured. He did not know how many of the roundhouse blows connected, he said he just had his head down swinging.

Objective circumstances


	
	The starting point must be the findings implicit in the verdicts of the jury acquitting Mr Telemete of Mr Neville’s murder and convicting instead of his manslaughter. It follows that Mr Telemete must be sentenced on the basis that he did not intend to kill Mr Neville or to cause him grievous bodily harm. The verdict should be understood as concluding that Mr Neville’s death resulted from unlawful acts which an ordinary sober person in Mr Telemete’s position would have realized risked inflicting serious injury. Since the significant blows (in respect of the cause of death) were those inflicted when Mr Neville was on the ground and hence not a threat, no question of self-defence can arise and what had earlier transpired did not need to be decided. Nor did it matter who of Mr Telemete and Mr Autagavaia inflicted those blows, providing the jury was satisfied (as it plainly was) either that Mr Telemete himself inflicted them or was complicit in Mr Autagavaia’s striking Mr Neville in a way that a reasonable person would realize would expose Mr Neville to the risk of serious injury of some kind. Nevertheless, these facts are part of the objective circumstances of the offence and thus relevant to the question of sentence. It follows that the Court must decide them, bearing in mind that findings adverse to an offender cannot be made unless they are proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It was submitted by the prosecutor that I should find that Mr Telemete had inflicted most of the injuries to Mr Neville, pointing to the apparent acceptance by him in his conversation with Mr Autagavaia that he accepted primary responsibility for what had occurred. I do not think that this inference can fairly be drawn from what Mr Telemete said. It is no more, to my mind, than an acceptance that, as between himself and Mr Autagavaia, he was the first to cross the road and Mr Autagavaia only became involved because Mr Telemete had done so.
	
	
	It will be obvious from the evidence summarised above that the eye witness accounts of the physical confrontation involving the Samoans and the Australians do not present a coherent picture. The only independent witness is Ms Turner, but it seems she saw neither the beginning nor the end of the fight, nor did she see Mr Mead or Mr Pettit. Furthermore, her view of the scene was incomplete and from a significant distance. The evidence of Mr Mead and Mr Pettit, though I think it was honest enough, cannot be accepted at face value. Both were very intoxicated, both made assertions that were demonstrably mistaken and otherwise rather exaggerated. Indeed, it is doubtful that Mr Mead has anything more than a vague general memory of what happened. None of this is surprising: it is widely understood that witnesses in these circumstances can only rarely give reliable and comprehensive accounts, even where they are observers as distinct from participants. I have already explained why Mr Autagavaia’s evidence is unpersuasive and why only limited weight can be given to the evidence of what Mr Telemete and Mr Autagavaia said when they returned to the house, especially as to potentially important issues.
	
	
	Mr Telemete’s evidence was to the effect that he was attacked first by (as I understand it) Mr Mead, that he responded by punching him and the violent confrontation then developed as he described. So far as the offence involving Mr Mead (as distinct from that involving Mr Neville) is concerned, it is clear that the issue of self-defence was raised. The jury’s verdict acquitting Mr Telemete of intentionally causing Mr Mead grievous bodily harm does not mean that the jury accepted that he might have acted in self-defence. Their verdict may be entirely explained by the medical evidence, which justified the conclusion that, although Mr Mead was injured in a potentially very serious way, in the result it did not amount to grievous bodily harm. It was therefore not necessary to decide the issue of self-defence. However, who started the violence is relevant to the question of sentence and thus needs to be considered in the context of sentencing Mr Telemete for the manslaughter of Mr Neville: it is part of the series of events that ended in Mr Neville’s death. It is sufficient for me to say that I do not accept beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Mead’s recollection about this issue is reliable. In my view, it is reasonably possible that Mr Telemete’s account about his fight with the person I take to be Mr Mead is true, giving as much weight as I am able to the evidence of Mr Mead to the opposite effect.
	
	
	As I have mentioned, I am persuaded by the evidence of Dr Hilton that Mr Neville’s death was caused by positional asphyxiation when, at the time unconscious or, perhaps, semi-conscious, he was sat up against the fence by Mr Mead attempting to make him more comfortable. His dangerous state of consciousness resulted from the violence inflicted on him by Mr Telemete or Mr Autagavaia.
	
	
	The prosecutor has submitted that the Court would find that Mr Telemete hit Mr Neville with lattice taken from the fence after he had knocked him out, using the wood to further attack him when he was unconscious and submits that this amounts to an aggravating feature of gratuitous violence (vide s 21A (f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). First, the evidence does not support the submission that Mr Telemete knocked Mr Neville unconscious. Secondly, apart from the fact that pieces of the broken lattice were found on the ground at the scene, the only evidence that it was used to strike anyone comes from Mr Autagavaia (who was not a truthful witness) and the conversations in the garage which, as mentioned, are ambiguous. There were no injuries to Mr Neville indicating any significant blow with a hard object, let alone a piece of timber and its use is not supported by the evidence of Ms Turner.
	
	
	At the end of the day, it is not possible to be sure about how the violence actually started or who struck the first blow. Although Mr Telemete approached the two Australians (Mr Pettit being on the other side of the road at the time, as I understand it), which is capable of being seen as an aggressive act, it cannot be concluded beyond reasonable doubt that he was not attempting to placate them, especially since he was outnumbered, Mr Autagavaia not being there at that time. I accept Mr Telemete’s evidence, in substance, that there was something of a melee involving him, Mr Mead and Mr Neville and, later, Mr Autagavaia. When Mr Neville was brought to the ground by Mr Telemete, significant violence was inflicted on him when he was helpless. Given Ms Turner’s description of events, and my view of Mr Telemete and Mr Autagavaia as witnesses, I think it to be probable that Mr Autagavaia was the one Ms Turner saw kicking Mr Neville many times and also caused the lacerations (possibly caused by stomping, although it must be born in mind that these injuries were not serious and the force, accordingly, quite limited). The deep bruising to the neck and the fracture of the hyoid bone, as well as the fractures of the upper back ribs, were caused by his kicks and were inflicted with considerable force. It follows from the jury’s verdict that Mr Telemete was present during these assaults. He admitted kicking Mr Neville’s legs (of which there was evidence demonstrated at autopsy). It will be recalled that Ms Turner saw one of the assailants (whom I take to be Mr Telemete) kick once. In light of the considerations affecting Ms Turner’s evidence which have been mentioned, I am unable to be satisfied that this was a kick to Mr Neville’s head; it may be that this was when Mr Telemete kicked Mr Neville’s leg. Whilst I accept as reasonably possible Mr Telemete’s evidence about his own assaults on Mr Neville, it is implicit in the jury’s verdict (as well as being my own opinion) that he was aware of Mr Autagavaia’s continuing forceful assaults to Mr Neville’s upper body.
	
	
	The jury concluded that the Samoans had tacitly agreed to the continued infliction of violence which an ordinary sober person would have appreciated could cause serious injury of some kind, that happened in this case to have been the state of compromised consciousness resulting ultimately in Mr Neville’s death. The crucial point, therefore, is that Mr Telemete was criminally responsible, in the way I have described, for Mr Neville’s compromised consciousness which ultimately led to his death. The jury did not accept, nor do I, that the ordinary sober person in Mr Telemete’s position might have been unaware that Mr Autagavaia’s assaults carried the risk of inflicting serious injury. However, the jury did not have to decide whether Mr Telemete actually realized this and I am doubtful that he did. In my view, it is probable that he acted as he did without thought of serious consequences, lashing out with Mr Auagavaia in the melee and continuing the attack even after Mr Mead and Mr Neville were incapacitated. It is likely that, when he left the scene, he did not believe that Mr Neville was seriously injured, although I think he gave it little or no thought.
	


Subjective features


	
	Mr Telemete gave evidence, which I accept was truthful during the sentence proceedings, in particular of his remorse for having caused Mr Neville’s death. He is almost 31 years of age, was born in Samoa and came to Australia with his family when he was 18 years of age. He is the youngest of twelve children. At the time of the offence he was living with his parents and a sister. His father has suffered a stroke and, paralysed down one side, has been in a wheelchair or bed bound. Mr Telemete helped with such tasks as lifting him out of bed, bathing and feeding him. His earnings have been essential to enable the provision of adequate care and he feels very much the hardship that his incarceration will entail. He has always been in employment, initially in process or factory work and then driving heavy machinery in the construction industry and has supported his family. The pastor of the church in which he has been involved since his youth has written a testimonial which speaks highly of him and confirms his remorse. The employer for who he worked for some eight years as a plant operator also speaks highly of him. Aside from one trivial offence, Mr Telemete has no criminal record. It is not disputed that, except for the present offence, he is a man of good character. Whilst in prison on remand he has applied to undertake the SMART course, dealing with better decision making and a Drug and Alcohol course.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Telemete should be sentenced on the basis that this offence is an aberration and inconsistent with his otherwise good character. I am satisfied that he is genuinely remorseful and that his prospects of rehabilitation are good.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	A victim impact statement made by Mr Neville’s mother, Marie Neville was read to the Court. It is a moving statement of the deep grief caused not only to her but also Mr Neville’s father and the other members of his family. He is terribly missed, leaving an absence which is a source of constant pain. The law does not, cannot, distinguish between the values of lives unlawfully taken; the harmful impact of Mr Neville’s death is an aspect of the harm done to the community by the loss of one of its number. I have considered this matter in accordance with the decision in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. The Court extends to Mr Neville’s family its condolences on their loss, accepting that nothing it can do will place a counterweight on the other side of the scales of their grief and pain.
	


Mr Autagavaia’s sentence


	
	I have mentioned the basis upon which Mr Autagavaia was sentenced. Because Mr Autagavaia was a co-offender with Mr Telemete in the manslaughter of Mr Neville, the law requires me to have regard to the sentence imposed on him in determining the sentence I impose on Mr Telemete but I am nevertheless required to come to my own view of the facts. As it happens, since Mr Telemete’s conviction followed a trial but Mr Autagavaia’s did not, I have had the considerable advantage over the latter’s sentencing judge of having heard considerably more evidence than was adduced before his Honour. I have mentioned that the matter proceeded before him on the basis that Mr Telemete commenced the violence and had inflicted the injuries that caused death and, this being undisputed, his Honour did not need to consider whether this was, in fact, the case and sentenced Mr Autagavia on that basis. His Honour also concluded that Mr Neville was struck with timber (though he seems not to have been aware that it was only lattice). For the reasons already expressed, I am unable to accept any of these findings for the purpose of sentencing Mr Telemete. This is by no means to be critical of the judge who sentenced Mr Autagavaia: my conclusions simply reflect the substantially differing evidence before the Court in each case. Mr Autagavaia’s subjective factors (which it is not necessary to detail) are not significantly dissimilar to those of Mr Telemete.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on Mr Autagaia is, nevertheless, still relevant since in the result the objective and subjective features of his case as found by the sentencing judge (so far as the manslaughter of Mr Neville is concerned) do not materially differ from those applying to that of Mr Telemete.
	


Conclusion


	
	The appropriate starting point is a term of 10 years imprisonment. Mr Telemete had indicated in the Local Court that he was prepared to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter but this plea was rejected by the Crown, which put him to trial on the charge of murder, of which Mr Telemete was acquitted. As conceded by the prosecutor, the appropriate discount should be applied to his sentence in accordance with R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, here 25 per cent. The question is then whether the usual ratio stipulated in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for calculation of the non-parole period should be varied by virtue of special circumstances. This is the first time Mr Telemete has been in prison; the period of incarceration must be relatively lengthy; and he will need extensive supervisory support when he is released to ensure that the steps towards rehabilitation that he will have undertaken in prison are effective in the outside world. In my view, these factors constitute special circumstances justifying a longer period on parole than would otherwise be the case.
	
	
	The sentence must commence on the date he was taken into custody, namely 17 January 2013.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to an overall term of 7 years and 6 months, comprising a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 17 January 2013 and expiring on 16 July 2017 and a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 17 July 2017 and expiring on 16 July 2020. The earliest date upon which the offender may be released on parole is 16 July 2017.

2767125,McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: Following two trials in the District Court, in 2009 and 2011 respectively, the applicant was convicted of 42 offences of assault and indecent assault on a number of young persons. The trial judge (Finnane DCJ) imposed an overall aggregate term of imprisonment for 32 years, with a non-parole period of 20 years.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal his convictions on grounds which are not limited to questions of law and therefore require leave. [1]  The grounds did not specify to which convictions they related and it may, accordingly, be assumed that they sought to challenge all the convictions as demonstrating a miscarriage of justice at each trial. The applicant also sought leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence imposed on him.
	


(1)   Background circumstances


	
	The first trial (conducted in June – July 2009) involved a single victim, Sascha Chandler, who has consented to the disclosure of his name. [2]  There was during the trial, but no longer is, a non-publication order in force with respect to the name of the school at which he was a student, namely Barker College in Sydney. The offences occurred whilst he was a member of the school’s cadet unit, between April 1991 and January 1992. In April 1991 the complainant was about to turn 16 years of age.
	
	
	The other offending involved three complainants and offences which mainly occurred in or near Inverell and which may have commenced in late 1977 but occurred primarily in the period from mid-1979 to early 1983. It was reported later and became the subject of the second trial, which occurred in April and May 2011.
	
	
	The statutory prohibition on the disclosure of the identities of the complainants has not been lifted. Although each is now an adult, the prohibition continues because each was under 18 years of age when the offending occurred. The first three charges, which involved events between November 1977 and November 1980, involved a victim who will be referred to as “V1”. A further four charges, which occurred between May 1979 and May 1980, involved a second victim who will be referred to as “V2”. The remainder (12 charges) involved a third victim, “V3”, and occurred between January 1981 and March 1983, in a variety of different locations, mostly in northern New South Wales.
	


(2)   Conviction appeal – 2009 trial

(a)   Background to Chandler offences


	
	The applicant met Mr Chandler when the latter was a student in the Barker College cadet unit. The cadet unit was run by teachers at the school with assistance from volunteers. In 1990 the applicant was working for a business known as Sydney CB Radios. He was invited to attend the annual cadet camp in April 1990 to instruct the students in the use of radios. In October 1990 the complainant joined a specialist platoon with a focus on signalling and first aid. At around that time they met and the applicant developed a practice of driving the complainant home after school. On occasion, he would ask the complainant to take his penis out and to lie with head on the applicant’s lap. He told the complainant that he was making him learn to trust him. During cadet training the applicant would frequently single the complainant out for particular tasks, but would also ridicule him in front of other cadets.
	
	
	At a cadet camp in April 1991, the applicant administered a suppository to the complainant, over the latter’s objections (conduct which constituted count 1 on the indictment). At the same camp, he gave the complainant a Vitamin C injection in his buttock.
	
	
	In early 1991, the applicant offered the complainant paid work on weekends in his radio business, which he accepted. At about that time, the complainant and two friends broke into club rooms at a playing field in Wahroonga. Shortly after the break-in, the applicant received a request to install a security system at the club. The complainant confessed his involvement in the offence to the applicant, resulting in “a hiding” with a leather strap, administered at the applicant’s house at Towlers Bay (count 2). Thereafter the applicant sexually assaulted the complainant, showing him a pornographic video, engaging in mutual masturbation and other touching of the genitals (counts 3-5). At this stage, the complainant was a month shy of his 16th birthday.
	
	
	Shortly after he turned 16, the applicant engaged in anal intercourse with the complainant and other forms of aggravated indecent assault (counts 6-8). The incidents took place during a cadet camp at Pittwater, the applicant taking the complainant to his house at Towlers Bay. The following night, further similar sexual activity occurred at Towlers Bay (counts 9-11 and 18). The conduct was repeated on the third night (counts 12-14) and on the fourth night (counts 15-17).
	
	
	Shortly after those incidents, a friend of the complainant, CC, asked him about the applicant’s behaviour at the camp. The complainant reported this to the applicant who chastised him. He then arranged for both the complainant and CC to come to his house at Towlers Bay, on the following weekend. He gave them both a hiding, CC being taken into the house while the complainant stayed outside. The complainant said he heard about ten cracking noises. The complainant was then taken in and beaten about ten times with a paddle (count 19).
	
	
	In late 1991 the complainant, wishing to put an end to the applicant’s conduct, rang the applicant and told him that he would tell his parents, the school and the Police. The applicant was furious, collected the complainant after school and drove to Mooney Mooney, where the applicant did not beat him, but forced him to masturbate (count 20).
	
	
	In late 1991 various related indecent assaults occurred, with the complainant being required to masturbate the applicant (counts 21, 22 and 23).
	
	
	There was a cadet camp on the Australia Day weekend in January 1992 near Woy Woy. The applicant required the complainant to sleep with him in joined sleeping bags, with the applicant masturbating both of them (count 24).
	
	
	The various indecent assaults were aggravated offences, the applicant being in a position of authority over the complainant. [3]  As to three of the offences which occurred in late 1991, the jury convicted only of indecent assault, on the basis that the element of aggravation was absent. Otherwise, the applicant was convicted on all charges.
	


(b)   grounds of appeal


	
	The primary witness for the prosecution, and generally the only witness with respect to individual offences, was the complainant, Sascha Chandler. However, the prosecution also sought to rely upon supporting evidence from two other witnesses, involved in uncharged offences of a similar kind. These were other former students at the school and in the cadet unit, one being the complainant’s brother, Dion Chandler, the other being a fellow student, CC. More will be said about the detail of their evidence shortly.
	
	
	In each case, the evidence was held to be admissible as either tendency or coincidence evidence, pursuant to s 97 or s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Each of grounds 1 and 2 alleged that the trial judge failed to give proper consideration to “the issue of concoction” in determining whether the evidence had “significant probative value” for the purposes of the respective sections. Ground 1 related to the evidence of Dion Chandler; ground 2 to the evidence of CC: they were otherwise in identical terms.
	
	
	Grounds 3 and 4 related specifically to the evidence of CC. Ground 3 alleged that the trial judge had failed to consider “at all” whether his evidence had significant probative value for the purposes of s 97(1)(b) and s 98(1)(b) of the Evidence Act. Ground 4 complained that the trial judge had failed to consider whether the probative value of the evidence “substantially outweighed” any prejudicial effect, for the purposes of s 101(2) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Ground 5 alleged that the trial judge had erroneously admitted the evidence of Dion Chandler as to beatings he had received from the applicant as “context evidence”, the judge having previously ruled the evidence to be inadmissible.
	
	
	Ground 6 involved two challenges to the directions to the jury. First, it was said that the trial judge failed to distinguish between tendency evidence and coincidence evidence. Secondly, it was alleged that the judge failed to direct the jury as to the permitted use of such evidence. This ground related to the evidence of both Dion Chandler and CC.
	
	
	Ground 7, at least as articulated in submissions, alleged that the applicant had been denied a fair trial because of the form of a direction as to how the jury might use any assessment of the credibility or reliability of the complainant with respect to one offence in considering other offences.
	


(c)   evidence of other offending


	
	CC was in the same year as the complainant at Barker College and was in the same special platoon in the cadet unit. CC gave evidence of the occasion in November 1991 when both he and the complainant were at the applicant’s Towlers Bay house. He gave evidence of having been beaten with a belt, having then been sent out of the house to sit on the wharf and told to tell the complainant, who was on the wharf, to go inside. His evidence was consistent with that of the complainant, including with respect to the manner in which they arrived (by boat) and the complainant’s account that the applicant had told them to jump into the water and hold onto a rope while he drove the boat around the bay.
	
	
	Given the grounds of challenge in the notice of appeal with respect to his evidence, it is necessary to refer to the cross-examination of CC. He agreed that he had made two statements, one to the complainant’s solicitor in November 2005, which had been revised in March 2006, and one to the Police on 5 March 2007. He was asked whether he had discussed with the complainant what he should put in either statement before making it, which, as to any detail, he denied. [4] 
	
	
	CC also gave evidence of a camp at West Head which took place after the beating. His description was anodyne, although he agreed that the complainant was one of the students at the camp and that he did not recall seeing him on the two nights they were in the bush. (These were nights when the complainant said the applicant took him back to his house for the night.)
	
	
	CC was cross-examined about his evidence as to the camp at West Head, which had not been referred to in either of his statements. He agreed that he had only remembered the camp when asked questions in the witness box.
	
	
	With respect to the possibility of concoction, counsel put to CC both that he had spoken with the complainant and that he had read his statement prior to making his own statement. He was taken to a passage in his first statement concerning the beating where he said that “the welts and bruising that I sustained lasted for the next month and a half.” [5]  The following further passages were then put to him:
	


“Q.   Do you remember saying something along these lines in your statement ‘during this encounter I switched off completely and allowed myself to drift off into a happier place’.

A.   Yeah, I remember saying it.

Q.   So you remember saying that?

A.   Yep.

Q.   What I’m going to suggest to you that you said was ‘I let my mind wander to another place because I just could not stand facing up to what I was going through’?

A.   That’s correct.

Q.   What I’d suggest to you I read to you prior to that about ‘Switching off completely and allowing myself to drift into a happier place’ was something that Sascha Chandler said in his statement of 14 April 2005. Would that be right?

A.   I don’t know.”


	
	The purpose behind this questioning was to challenge his denial of reading the complainant’s statement before preparing his own. The two descriptions of switching off during the beating, although not identical, were similar and CC accepted that he had made both statements, when they were put to him. He nevertheless denied knowing that one of them came from the complainant’s statement. No doubt the evidence raised a possibility of contamination, although arguably not one carrying much weight, but that was a step short of concoction.
	
	
	Dion Chandler gave evidence that the first cadet camp he was involved in occurred in June/July 1991, starting at the applicant’s house at Towlers Bay and ending at West Head. (That placed the event some months before, rather than after, the incident of the beatings at Towlers Bay.) Dion was 1½ years younger than his brother. He said that the applicant and his brother left the camp to go back to the applicant’s house on the first and second nights of the camp. He claimed that he could tell that his brother “was very close to” the applicant.
	
	
	Dion Chandler also worked for the applicant installing car phones on Saturdays. He said that work began in 1993. On one occasion, he recognised a customer as a teacher at the school and struck up a conversation. The applicant, who was present, told him to “shut up”. He was told to get back in the applicant’s van. He was allowed to return to help with the work after the customer went into her house. When they got back into the car, the applicant was angry and told him that he was “going to get a hiding”. He was given an alternative to take off his pants and sit next to the applicant with his pants down around his ankles, while the applicant drove. He chose that option. [6]  The applicant insisted that he not cover his genitals with his hands. He wanted the boy to say that he trusted the applicant. [7] 
	
	
	The prosecutor returned to 1991, confirming that when Dion Chandler joined the cadet unit, he was in C company. The questioning continued: [8] 
	


“Q.   Do you remember any specific time shortly after you joined C company that you went to the bunker with the accused?

A.   Yes. After cadets, when my brother was done there he’d often meet Andy after cadets down at the bunker, which was almost like the headquarters of the specialist platoon, next to number 3 oval at the school. There was one time we went down there and he had given me an injection.

Q.   Could you describe that?

A.   Yeah. I mean this was a trust exercise. I know he’d done this to my brother before, my brother he had actually told me he had received an injection, and we went down to the bunker. Somehow we got into a situation where Andy had taken out his medical kit which he had down there. He asked me if I’d ever had an injection in my buttocks before, which I hadn’t, and then he said, ‘Well, do you trust me to give you an injection in your buttocks? It won’t hurt. There’s nothing wrong with it’, and then so again of course yes, I trust him.

Q.   Why did you say that?

A.   Again out of fear. I just wanted to show him that I trusted him. You know he was at that stage a bit, he was a friend, well, he was an elder sort of authority figure in my life so I did, I said ‘absolutely I trust you’ and then, so in order to prove it, I know he had, he was taking out a needle, there was no syringe, there was nothing attached to it, he just took a needle out of the sterilisation thing from his medical kit. He asked me to take down my pants again, my brother was in the room during the whole thing, and he asked me to bend over his knee, and then he just sort of pinched my buttocks, pushed it in, sat it there and said , ‘See, that didn’t hurt at all, did it?’.

…

Q.   Did he say anything after he’d finished administering that syringe to you?

A.   He told me how it didn’t hurt again, ‘thank you for trusting me, you can pull your pants back up.’

Q.   Did he say anything else?

A.   He told me that he loved me, which was just a, I mean that was a common thing, whenever he administered punishment or anything like that to me it would always be hugging afterwards, ‘thank you for trusting me’, ‘I’m doing this for your own good’.” [9] 


	
	Following that evidence, counsel for the accused made an application for the discharge of the jury on the basis that a prior ruling had excluded evidence from Dion Chandler as to previous beatings and maltreatment. The application, to which further reference will be made below, was rejected. Counsel then proceeded with the cross-examination of Dion Chandler. He elicited that the witness had made a statement at his brother’s request in February 2006 and later statements to the Police on 14 December 2006, 13 August 2008 and on 15 June 2009. The last statement, made during the trial, followed a conversation with his brother, who was then being cross-examined. The last statement was the first occasion on which he had referred to the two events set out above. It was expressly put to the witness that he had concocted both events as a result of discussion with his brother. He denied the suggestion. [10] 
	


(d)   tendency and coincidence evidence


	
	Grounds 1-4 all relate to the admissibility of the evidence of CC and Dion Chandler, under ss 97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act. Ground 5, dealing with “context evidence” is also concerned with the admissibility of the evidence of Dion Chandler. It is convenient to deal with these grounds together; ground 7, concerning a jury direction, will be addressed later.
	


(i)   Legal principles


	
	There was reference at the trial and on appeal to both tendency and coincidence evidence; nevertheless, the original application by the prosecution was based on a notice given under s 97 of the Evidence Act relating to the tendency rule. Although reference was made without objection to coincidence evidence, the evidence referred to above was admitted as indicating a tendency that the applicant had to act in a particular way and to have a particular state of mind. The case for the prosecution was that the evidence demonstrated a tendency of the accused:
	



	
	to assault young males, occasioning them actual bodily harm by beating them on the buttocks either with his hand or an implement;
	
	
	to display a sexual interest in Sascha Chandler during 1990, 1991 and 1992;
	
	
	to display a sexual interest in Sascha Chandler, Dion Chandler and CC during 1990, 1991 and 1992 by beating them on their naked buttocks or watching them in the showers.
	



	
	The qualified prohibition on the admissibility of such evidence is identified in s 97 of the Evidence Act in the following terms:
	


97   The tendency rule

(1)   Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a)   the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b)   the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.


	
	There is a further constraint in the form of a prohibition against the use of such evidence “unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” [11] 
	
	
	For reasons to be explained shortly, the question of “concoction” arose only peripherally in the present case. However, the reliance by the applicant on the possibility of concoction as a basis for rejecting the admissibility of the evidence raises an issue as to the relevant legal principle being invoked. Its relevance arises from the need for the court to be satisfied that the evidence will have “significant probative value”, for the purposes of s 97(1)(b) and, further, that the probative value will be sufficient to substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect, for the purposes of s 101(2).
	
	
	In his written submissions, the applicant contended that tendency evidence is “not admissible where the prosecution has failed to exclude the reasonable possibility of concoction and/or contamination.” That proposition was derived from the pre-Evidence Act case of Hoch v The Queen. [12]  In the course of oral submissions, counsel for the applicant conceded that this proposition is not consistent with the language of the Evidence Act. The statutory scheme now in force was explained by Spigelman CJ in R v Ellis. [13] 
	


(ii)   Rulings on admissibility


	
	The trial judge made a preliminary ruling on admissibility on the second day of the trial, 4 June 2009. Aspects of the proposed evidence were excluded and need not be considered further. Evidence of other acts committed by the accused on the complainant were admitted; no challenge arises in relation to that part of the ruling. With respect to Dion Chandler, the trial judge rejected the evidence sought to be led for the following reasons: [14] 
	


“I do not permit any evidence to be led from Dion Chandler. In my opinion what happened to him, assuming it happened, occurred well after the events the subject of this trial. To admit that evidence into the Court would be to do nothing more than to admit evidence going to the bad character of the accused. In my opinion there could not properly be classified as tendency evidence.

…

To admit the material relating to Mr Dion Chandler is to admit material not relating directly to the complainant, but to someone else that would tend to show, or would show that the accused committed a crime against another person at a subsequent time.”


	
	It is not necessary to refer to the material under consideration in this passage: although the applicant claimed that the evidence later led by the prosecution had been excluded, it is clear that what was excluded was evidence of subsequent offending and not evidence of events contemporaneous with the charges involving the complainant.
	
	
	The judge ruled that evidence of CC about “a particular beating on a particular day” would be admitted. It was admitted as tendency evidence “because it occurred on the same day as a similar beating was administered to the complainant, and it occurred in or about the same place.” [15]  The judge reserved his position with respect to certain other aspects of CC’s statement which he said did not appear to him “to go to establishing anything terribly much, such things as the accused shouting at him and belittling him and belittling other people.” [16] 
	
	
	Finally, the trial judge made reference to a submission by the prosecution that evidence of “uncharged acts” could be given as “context evidence.” Although it is not entirely clear what material was being considered, this passage was referred to in relation to ground 5 and may conveniently be set out in full: [17] 
	


“I have said that I will admit that evidence as going to tendency. I do not propose to admit it as going to context. When all the evidence is given about all these acts, that in itself sets a context, there is no need to complicate the matter further by telling the jury they can look at some of those matters only if they establish a context. I think it would create enormous confusion and difficulty so I do not propose to admit it on that basis.”


	
	As will be seen, it is the first sentence of that passage which is significant: it is apparent that the judge was referring to evidence which was to be admitted and not the evidence which had been excluded.
	


(iii)   Assessment of probative value – concoction


	
	The role that a possibility of concoction or contamination may play in the application of s 97 requires careful consideration. The first question requires the assessment of whether the proposed evidence has significant probative value. That assessment may depend on whether the evidence is accepted by the jury or not. If it is rejected in its entirety, it will have no probative value. On the other hand, if it is accepted in its entirety, it will still be necessary to assess its probative value. That exercise is separate from the assessment of its possible prejudicial effect.
	
	
	Two questions arise in this context: first, are questions of reliability and credibility relevant in assessing probative value? Some assessment must be made both for the purposes of ss 97 and 98 and for the separate exercise required under s 101. The latter section has a similar function (though the language differs) to s 137, which requires the Court to refuse to admit prosecution evidence “if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” The proper approach to assessing probative value for the purposes of s 137 was discussed in R v XY. [18]  In that case the Court, following R v Shamouil, [19]  held that the function of the judge in applying s 137 was to assess the capacity of the evidence to support a particular finding, but it is not its credibility and reliability, those being matters to be left to the jury if the evidence be admitted. [20]  That approach depended in part on the definition of “probative value” in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as meaning “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect that assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”. [21]  Spigelman CJ in Shamouil noted that “[t]he focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude.” [22]  Further, the words “rationally affect” were apt to refer to “capability rather than weight”. [23] 
	
	
	In the discussion which followed in XY, I considered the extent to which reliability and credibility could be involved in the exercise to be undertaken by the judge under s 137. In particular, that discussion noted that the term “credibility” can be used to refer to plausibility, objectively considered. On the other hand, it may refer to an assessment of the truthfulness of the witness. [24]  The term “reliability” can have similar nuances of meaning.
	
	
	In adopting the reasoning in Shamouil and XY, it is appropriate to acknowledge that the exercise to be undertaken pursuant to s 97 differs in one respect from that likely to arise under s 137. It was noted in XY [25]  that the question of exclusion under s 137 was likely to arise in isolation from the full circumstances of the prosecution case. By contrast, both s 97 and s 98 require the judge to assess the probative value of the proffered evidence “either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced” by the prosecution. Acknowledging the difference in statutory language, the practical differences will often be less marked. That is partly because the exercise required by s 137 will not be carried out in total ignorance of the other evidence to be called in the prosecution case. Similarly, as demonstrated by the conduct of the present case, a decision to admit evidence under ss 97, 98 and 101 is most likely to be made before the full detail of the prosecution evidence has been revealed. The primary reason for the additional language in ss 97 and 98 is that, like the general law principle relating to “similar fact evidence”, tendency and coincidence evidence cannot have probative value except in a context where, for example, both the conduct of the accused and the relevant tendency to act have been identified with some particularity.
	
	
	The concept of “concoction” suggests a deliberate fabrication of the evidence. By contrast, the term “contamination” may involve an unconscious process of suggestion being adopted.
	
	
	Whilst, in determining probative value as a question of capability to affect the assessment of a fact in issue, the court is not required to disregard inherent implausibility, on the other hand, contestable questions of credibility and reliability are not for the trial judge, but for the jury. Accordingly, the suggestion that the possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in determining whether particular evidence has significant probative value should not be accepted.
	
	
	It should be acknowledged that this conclusion is inconsistent with the approach identified in the leading Australian text, Cross on Evidence. [26]  However, that reasoning appears to have relied upon cases which predated R v Ellis in 2003. [27]  Further, the view accepted here appears to be consistent with the explanation of R v XY accepted by the author of Cross as the applicable law in this State. [28] 
	
	
	In the present case, both Dion Chandler and CC were cross-examined in an attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of their evidence. The cross-examination was tentative, in the sense that while the possibility of conversations between the complainant and the witness were suggested, the possible content of those conversations was not explored, the topic being identified at a high level of generality. In any event, these challenges took place after the evidence had been admitted and not before. If a possibility of concoction at a level sufficient to affect the capacity of the evidence to bear significant probative value were to be identified, it would probably have been necessary to carry out a reasonably searching cross-examination on the voir dire, before admissibility was ruled on. That did not happen. Thus, the reason why the trial judge did not consider the possibility of concoction in making his rulings, was that it was neither relied upon by counsel for the accused at trial, nor was it inherently necessary for the judge to consider such matters in assessing significant probative value.
	
	
	Given the manner in which the evidence unfolded, the absence of reference to the possibility of concoction in the assessment of admissibility was unsurprising. On any view, it revealed no error on the part of the trial judge.
	


(iv)   Tendency – evidence of CC


	
	The probative value of the tendency evidence adduced from the two witnesses differed significantly and requires separate consideration. The evidence of CC in relation to the beating at Towlers Bay was detailed, virtually contemporaneous with the evidence of the beating of the complainant, provided detail which rendered it highly plausible and, in effect, complemented the evidence of the complainant who had been sitting outside the house on the wharf while CC was inside receiving a beating. It is beyond doubt that the evidence of CC, if believed, had significant probative value. It inevitably gave significant support to the evidence of the complainant with respect to that particular count.
	
	
	So far as potential prejudice was concerned, it revealed the commission by the applicant of an uncharged offence. However, the sexual connotations were muted and the offence itself was not of such a kind as to engender strong feelings of, for example, disgust. The prejudicial effect being somewhat muted, and there being little likelihood that the jury would misapply the evidence in considering the charged misconduct, the judge was entitled to be satisfied that the probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect.
	
	
	It is clear from the passage set out at [39] above that the trial judge made an assessment of the probative value of the evidence sought to be called from CC. Although he did not expressly adopt language consistent with s 101 of the Evidence Act, he did, in respect of other evidence dealt with in the same reasons, state that he would be “unable to conclude that the probative value would substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect.” That evidence was excluded. Further, as counsel for the Director noted, at a number of points the judge indicated that he would give “more detailed reasons later”. Having delivered those reasons, the trial judge stated his understanding that he had dealt with the matters he had been asked to rule on. [29]  The prosecutor agreed and noted that, in respect of the part of the ruling rejecting certain evidence, he did not require any further reasons. The trial judge responded: [30] 
	


“That will save me some effort. But I will give the reasons obviously for the other material in a fuller way. I only indicate at this stage that I have had regard to ss 97, 101, 135 and 137 and I think it’s 192. I will explain more fully at a later point the way in which I have reasoned. I thank both counsel for their submissions.”


	
	In fact no further reasons were given, but neither were further reasons sought.
	
	
	There is a further difficulty with the challenge based on a failure to assess prejudice. The question of prejudice was specifically raised in the course of submissions, primarily in relation to earlier offences, some of which had been rejected by a jury. In that respect counsel had submitted: [31] 
	


“At the end of the day we would say that if you apply ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act, the prejudice, bearing in mind the passage of time and the other matters I have raised, far outweigh probative value, and in my submission it makes it impossible for Mr McIntosh to get a fair trial.”


	
	Further, in the course of submissions and prior to the ruling noted above, the judge asked counsel for the accused, “[a]re you in any way prejudiced because he says now there is coincidence as well as tendency?” [32]  Counsel responded:
	


“In relation to the other two boys, your Honour, probably not. But I would probably be asking – and I thought I might as well flag, if your Honour were minded to make such a direction, if you were minded to allow in the evidence of Chandler Junior and [CC] I would probably be minded depending on how the evidence falls to ask your Honour for a direction in relation to the possibility of concoction.”


	
	With respect to Dion Chandler, there was an issue raised as to the date of the offence against him, being subsequent to the offending against the complainant, [33]  which was the ground upon which the trial judge was minded initially to reject Dion Chandler’s evidence. No such issue arose with respect to the evidence of CC.
	
	
	For these reasons, grounds 2, 3 and 4, relating to the admissibility of the evidence of CC must be rejected.
	


(v)   Tendency – evidence of Dion Chandler


	
	Grounds 1 and 5 related to the admission of the evidence of Dion Chandler: ground 1 was based on the premise that it was admitted as tendency evidence; ground 5 assumed it was admitted as “context evidence”.
	
	
	To the extent that ground 1 was based on the failure to consider the issue of “concoction”, that matter should be rejected for the reasons given above. The submissions with respect to ground 5 were chronologically confusing. As discussed above, Dion Chandler was cross-examined to establish two propositions (which the witness unequivocally accepted), namely that the first time he had related each of the complaints of assault was in his statement of 15 June 2009; that is, in the statement which was given during the course of the trial and which post-dated by some 10 days or more the earlier ruling in which the evidence then proposed to be led from him had been rejected. The basis upon which Dion Chandler was eventually called, on 16 June 2009, was not entirely clear. On the previous afternoon, in the absence of the jury, counsel for the accused had raised the possibility that there would be “some application tomorrow morning”, brought by the prosecutor. Counsel apparently knew that there might be new evidence from Dion Chandler, “which none of us has ever heard about and which could be interesting to say the very least.” [34] 
	
	
	On the morning of 16 June, the further statement was tendered on a voir dire and was subject to discussion, but no evidence was called on the voir dire. Objection was taken by counsel for the accused on the basis that one episode probably took place in 1994, about a year after the last offending against the complainant. Counsel also relied upon the circumstances of the alleged assaults as being “entirely different” from the circumstances described by the complainant.
	
	
	The judge was conscious that he needed to look at s 100 (dealing with the absence of a notice) as well as ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act. [35]  The judge expressed the view that it was really coincidence evidence; the prosecutor accepted that possibility and said that he relied upon both ss 97 and 98. [36]  There was further discussion about the degree of similarity and the degree of prejudice in respect of the proposed evidence of a “post 1993 event”, as well as a 1991 event. [37] 
	
	
	In holding that Dion Chandler could give the evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution, the trial judge, in a judgment delivered on 16 June 2009, expressly dealt with the question whether the evidence would have significant probative value, for the purposes of ss 97 and 98. It was admitted both as tendency evidence and coincidence evidence. Before dealing with the challenge to this ruling, it is necessary to note the timing and the basis of an application for the discharge of the jury, which came immediately after Dion Chandler had given his evidence in chief. That application did not focus on the two incidents which the judge had ruled were admissible, but on incidental references to previous beatings by the accused. [38]  The basis of the application was identified with more precision the following day, counsel identifying the following objectionable passages in the evidence: [39] 
	


“Q.   What did he say to you?

A. He said to me that I was going to get a hiding. That was when he actually sent [me] into the car in the first place. When he got back into the car he gave me the option of either coping that hiding, which is what he used to refer to them as.

…

Q.   Why did you tell him that?

A.   Because I was fearful if I didn’t, if I showed that I didn’t trust him I would get a hiding as I often did.

…

Q.   Did he say anything else?

A.   He told me that he loved me which was just a, I mean, that was a common thing. Whenever he administered punishment or anything like that to me it would always be hugging afterwards ‘thank you for trusting me’.”


	
	The objection was to the addition of gratuitous reference to regular punishment and responses on other occasions. Counsel noted that he could not cross-examine on the material without opening up the further evidence which had properly been rejected at the outset of the trial. The prosecutor submitted that the reference to beatings on other occasions was contextual evidence which tended to show that there was an ongoing relationship between the accused and Dion Chandler which involved beatings, huggings and assurances about him trusting the accused.
	
	
	In rejecting the application to discharge the jury, the trial judge accepted the prosecutor’s submissions. [40]  He noted that the nature of the beatings was not revealed but that the evidence was tendered “to give some understanding of why it is that on the occasion at the house Mr Chandler would accept an alternative to a beating.” Absent such an explanation it would appear that “suddenly something happened out of the blue that had never happened before and he took a course of exposing himself rather than being beaten although he didn’t know what a beating would mean.” The trial judge concluded: [41] 
	


“I will tell the jury that there is evidence of a relationship between them and that that context of that relationship appears to … be that there had been beatings of some kind, followed by huggings and reassurances and statements of trust, and this had occurred earlier and this might help them to understand the context of what occurred on the day concerned, about which he does give factual evidence. But they should not speculate about what those other beatings were or when they occurred. They should not go any further than considering what the evidence is.”


	
	There is no complaint as to the way the evidence was left to the jury. Nor, in terms, is there a challenge to the dismissal of the application to discharge the jury. Nor was ground 5 expressed in a manner which fairly reflected what happened in this regard at the trial. It was not the case that the judge admitted evidence in relation to previous beatings, which he had previously ruled inadmissible. No more was allowed in than the somewhat oblique references which the judge considered necessary to explain the context in which admissible threats and responses occurred. As counsel for the accused recognised, this was quite a different matter from detailed evidence of what occurred on earlier occasions, being the very evidence which he did not wish to adduce (in cross-examination) explaining the oblique references to earlier events.
	
	
	The submissions in support of this ground took a slightly different approach. It was accepted that “relationship evidence” could be given with respect to the accused and the complainant, but, noting that Dion Chandler was not the complainant, it was submitted that the principle did not extend to a relationship between the accused and a witness in relation to evidence not the subject of charges.
	
	
	Accepting that the Court is not to be assisted by authority (none being identified) the matter must be addressed as a question of principle. There are two bases upon which the evidence might properly be admitted. The first is that the existence of a relationship between the witness and the accused was an integral part of the evidence to be admitted as tendency evidence. If the evidence of specific incidents was itself admissible as tendency evidence, those aspects which rendered it plausible, in the sense of being comprehensible, could not properly be excluded. A second approach is to treat the evidence as demonstrating a relationship, as distinct from tendency evidence, an approach accepted by Hodgson JA in R v Leonard. [42]  On that basis, neither s 97 nor s 101 is engaged. If the evidence carries a danger of unfair prejudice, its exclusion will depend on the operation of s 137.
	
	
	The distinction between relationship evidence and tendency evidence may not always be as clear as the passage in Leonard suggests. One difficulty with s 97 is that it is expressed in neutral terms, referring to evidence of “the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had … to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind”. The tendency rule is a rule of exclusion subject to qualifications. However, it is well understood that, understood in context, its function is to exclude evidence which would reflect badly on the accused’s character generally or might lead the jury to reason that a person who has been guilty of misconduct on other occasions may be the kind of person who would commit the offence charged. In some circumstances, such reasoning will be legitimate and hence the evidence will have “probative value”; in other circumstances it will not, and will be an element of “prejudice”.
	
	
	If the concept of “tendency” evidence revealed in s 97(1) is not to be understood in a neutral way, the same is not necessarily true of “relationship” evidence. Indeed, the concept of a relationship will often be assumed to be neutral and for that reason not subject to exclusion under the tendency rule. In other circumstances, which will include the present case, the relationship revealed is, if not abusive, at least capable of being abusive. In that event, the evidence will have the potential to give rise to prejudice in the same way that tendency evidence can have that effect.
	
	
	In some circumstances evidence as to a person’s character or conduct in the past, used to explain why a complainant acted in a particular way, may be said to fall outside the tendency rule because the evidence is admitted, not to prove that the accused had such a tendency, but rather to prove the complainant’s belief as to that fact, which may depend on reputation. [43]  If such evidence is to be excluded because of its potential prejudicial effect, that must occur, again, under s 137. While there is a similarity between that analysis and the present case, namely that the evidence was relied upon to demonstrate the plausibility of the witness’ response to the offender’s demand, there is an important point of distinction. Thus, Dion Chandler, in giving evidence of his state of mind, relied not upon the reputation of the accused, but what the accused had done to him in the past. While what had in fact happened in the past was neither identified nor explained with any specificity, the evidence had the potential to be treated as evidence of past misconduct and should therefore be treated as subject to the tendency rule.
	
	
	In the present case, the better view is to treat the evidence as an inherent part of that which was admitted as tendency evidence. There is no doubt that it had significant probative value, and because of its generality, viewed in the circumstances of the case, the danger of prejudice was relatively slight. Whatever the precise articulation of the challenge, ground 5 should be rejected.
	


(vi)   Jury direction – tendency and coincidence


	
	The challenge to the directions was that the judge did not adequately distinguish between tendency and coincidence evidence. That complaint is fraught with difficulties for the applicant. First, the trial judge gave a number of directions to the jury with respect to tendency evidence during the course of the trial and his summing up. No objection was taken to any of the directions.
	
	
	Secondly, it is clear, both from the way the evidence was addressed and from the fact that the prosecution did not initially seek to rely upon the evidence as demonstrating a degree of improbability that events occurred “coincidently”, that the need to deal with the evidence as “coincidence evidence” was obscure.
	
	
	Thirdly, the written submissions in support of the ground suggested that the way the matter was left to the jury was inconsistent with the factors identified in the notice given under s 97, referred to as the “tendency notice”, and with arguments put in the absence of the jury when questions of admissibility and discharge were raised. Accepting that matters were put differently at different times, that fact does not of itself demonstrate that the directions given to the jury were erroneous.
	
	
	Fourthly, there having been no request for a further direction, the Court invited counsel to formulate the direction which he contended should have been given. The direction proffered was taken from the bench book as a suggested direction with respect to tendency evidence. Additions were made to insert the nature of the tendencies relied upon. There was no reference to the distinction between tendency and coincidence evidence. The proposed direction did not advance the challenge raised in the ground of appeal. It did, however, demonstrate the need for careful attention to the terms of a proposed direction in circumstances where none was sought at trial.
	
	
	Turning to the substance of the summing up, as the final but not the only direction given to the jury, the discussion of tendency and coincidence evidence covered three full pages as transcribed. [44]  It is not necessary to set out the whole of the directions in order to address the complaint that there was a failure to distinguish tendency and coincidence evidence. However, there was discussion of the elements, broadly expressed, demonstrating that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way. There was also an explanation as to why events described in terms of striking similarity might rebut a finding that the similarities were coincidental. It was not correct to say that the judge failed to address the distinction.
	
	
	The failure to seek an appropriate direction is not fatal, although leave is required to raise the matter on appeal. [45]  However, in some cases, of which the present is an example, it is not possible for the appellate court to know whether the failure to seek a further direction was a forensic decision or a culpable omission by trial counsel. This was not a case in which it was said that the risks of prejudice were insufficiently articulated. Rather, the complaint was a failure by the trial judge adequately to explain how tendency and coincidence evidence could properly be used by the jury in its deliberations. However, where the probative value of the evidence was, on one view, powerful, counsel may well have thought that to seek more precise and detailed directions as to how the jury could properly use the evidence would not assist his client.
	
	
	In circumstances where there was no complaint that the directions were positively misleading, and where counsel had some difficulty in formulating in adequate terms the proposed missing direction, this is not a case in which leave should be granted pursuant to r 4.
	


(e)   Conclusions – 2009 trial


	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal against his convictions, limited to grounds 1-5 in the statement of grounds of appeal filed on 29 September 2014;
	
	
	refuse leave to appeal, with respect to grounds 6 and 7;
	
	
	dismiss the appeal.
	


(2)   Conviction appeal   - 2011 trial

(a)   background


	
	In March 2011 the applicant was placed on trial on 18 counts, involving three complainants. Counts 1-3 related to a single complainant (V1) involving two separate events which occurred at or near Inverell. The first event involved a request that V1, then aged 9 years, kiss him at a local roller-skating rink. That event occurred between November 1977 and November 1979. Although the periods overlapped, the second set of events probably occurred later and between November 1978 and August 1981. Each involved an indecent assault at a property near Inverell where the applicant was living, the first in the applicant’s bed, and the second shortly thereafter in the shower.
	
	
	Five further charges (counts 4-7) involved a second young male, V2. The first three charges were related, the conduct again occurring near Inverell, the period being specified as between May 1979 and May 1980. The victim was then 15 or 16 years of age. There were three charges of indecent assault involving masturbation and simulated intercourse and a fourth charge involving the victim lying across the applicant’s knees whilst the applicant smacked his naked backside with his hand.
	
	
	The next eleven charges (counts 8-18) involved V3, another young male victim. There was several separate events involved. The first two charges related to an event between January and August 1981 in Sydney where the applicant whipped the victim’s naked buttocks with an electric jug cord and then had simulated sex with him.
	
	
	The next charge took place in late 1981 or early 1982 on a work-related trip to Armidale and involved anal sex at a motel. The third event involved a similar offence in a parking area at Warialda. The fourth set of events occurred near Inverell between January 1981 and March 1983. The first charge related to a form of punishment, the applicant assaulting the victim with the handle of a feather duster, causing bruising. He then proceeded to have anal sex with him. Sometime later the victim’s mother saw the bruising caused by the assault and, when the applicant learned of the disclosure, he carried out a further assault with the feather duster (count 18).
	
	
	There were then four further events each giving rise to a single count. All were said to have taken place between January 1981 and March 1983; each involved an incident of anal sex, in northern New South Wales. One further matter involved an indecent assault, namely rubbing the victim’s penis, during the course of the accompanying anal intercourse.
	
	
	Each of the three victims grew up in Inverell, where the applicant lived throughout the period of the offending. In each case the applicant knew both the boys and their families. He exploited those relationships to obtain access to the boys, whom he abused in the manner identified in the charges.
	


(b)   procedural background


	
	The manner in which the two sexual assault trials were initially managed is not entirely clear from the material before this Court. However, there were issues raised before either trial as to the admissibility of evidence sought to be tendered both of other charges and of uncharged events. The first pre-trial ruling with specific reference to the second trial gave rise to the primary grounds of appeal in relation to the convictions arising from the second trial. Thus the steps taken with respect to the initial application need to be identified.
	
	
	At some point the Chandler matter, heard in 2009, was separated from the 18 counts concerning the three complainants V1, V2 and V3, which were set down for a joint trial. Following the Chandler trial, the matter came back before the District Court on 1 October 2010. It appears to have been known at that stage that a further trial was to commence on 25 October 2010, although the ex officio indictment with respect to two of the victims appeared not to have been filed. [46]  The matter was stood over until 7 October 2010. On that date it was accepted that the trial fixed for 25 October involved only one complainant, V3, the other matters being pending in the Inverell Local Court. [47]  It was then anticipated that 24 October could be used to deal with pre-trial issues. [48] 
	
	
	On 15 October 2010, a decision having been made to lay ex officio indictments, the Director issued tendency evidence notices with respect to five complainants, being V1, V2 and V3, two other complainants whose evidence was not ultimately led and with respect to the convictions relating to Sascha Chandler’s complaints.
	
	
	On 25 October 2010 the accused appeared before Judge Finnane and was duly charged in accordance with an amended indictment containing 19 counts. One count was later dropped (in relation to V3), but nothing turns on that. The matter proceeded on the basis of an objection to the tendency evidence, that application being treated as conclusive as to the basis on which the trial (or separate trials) would proceed. In short, were the prosecution not permitted to call the evidence of each complainant in respect of the counts involving the others, there would be separate trials: if the evidence of each was permitted as tendency evidence in respect of each other, there would be a joint trial. No witness was called in the course of the application which proceeded on 25 and 26 October. The judge delivered his reasons and rulings on the second day.
	
	
	The substance of the objection to joint trials was identified by counsel for the accused as three-fold, namely:
	



	
	(a)   the substantial differences in the ages of the complainants;
	
	
	(b)   substantial differences in the nature of the charges, and
	
	
	(c)   as a particular of (b), the fact that there were charges of buggery only in relation to V3. [49] 
	



	
	Detailed submissions were made with respect to those issues, based on the Director’s tendency notice together with statements of each witness, sought to be called to demonstrate tendency. On the second day, discussion focused on difficulties attending the proposal to call evidence from one witness whose claims had gone to trial, a jury accepting some, but not the most serious of the charges. There was also reference to the fact that Sascha Chandler had made public statements with respect to the assaults on him. Further, the judge noted the difficulty with sentencing the accused, which had not been done prior to the proposed second trial. There was a further issue with respect to a third witness involved in other complaints.
	
	
	The discussion extended to the known facts that V1 knew V2 and V2 had spoken with V3. The prosecutor said in this regard: [50] 
	


“On the evidence before your Honour there is, the Crown submits, insufficient evidence to engage any issue with concoction. Because there has been no request to call the witnesses to put matters to more [sic] explore this issue.

I wanted to bring that to your Honour’s attention. That’s not to say there’s been any firm resolution of the matter by my learned friend at all. But at this stage it doesn’t seem, on the evidence presently available, that it’s an issue that your Honour needs to be troubled by.”


	
	The judgment given on that day gave careful consideration to the matters relied upon by the prosecutor and counsel for the accused, before ruling that the charged offences against V1, V2 and V3 “were related to one another in such a way as to cause them to go into separate trials would [be] to create complete unreality as well as unduly prolonging proceedings.” [51]  He therefore directed that there would be a single trial. He accepted that Mr Chandler could give evidence as to the assaults on him, a second witness proposed by the Director could not and, with respect to a third witness, he reserved his position, although that witness was not ultimately called.
	
	
	The trial was then fixed to commence on 11 April 2011, which it did. At the outset the trial judge directed that Mr Chandler be known by a pseudonym. Counsel for the accused, who had not appeared at any earlier stage in the proceedings, requested “a Basha inquiry in relation to each of the complainants.”  [52]  In ordinary language, the request for a Basha inquiry meant that counsel for the accused sought an opportunity to question each of the complainants on oath before the trial judge, but in the absence of the jury. [53]  The basis, which was not immediately revealed due to the unwillingness of the trial judge to consider the application, arose from a disclosure of fresh allegations by V3 to the prosecution (and recently disclosed to the accused), together with the fact that the charges relating to V1 and V2 had only been joined following an ex officio indictment, there having been no completed committal hearing.
	
	
	The events of the first day of the trial, 11 April 2011, can be broken into three parts. First, there was the application by counsel for the accused for an opportunity to examine the complainants on the voir dire. That was refused in uncompromising terms, on the basis that any such application should have been made in October 2010.
	
	
	The second stage of the hearing occurred immediately thereafter, when the prosecutor indicated that he wished to call evidence of threats made to V3 that the accused would blow up his family if he went to the police, and as to V3’s belief that he had explosives available to him. The prosecutor also foreshadowed evidence of flight on the part of the accused. Following his arrest and release on bail, the accused was said to have bought a boat in a false name and sailed to Moreton Bay, where he obtained moorings under a false name, paying for expenses in cash. The trial judge indicated concern in relation to the use which might be made of both these matters, concluding that the evidence should be presented first to him on a voir dire in relation to the question of flight, which arose shortly after the laying of charges with respect to V3.
	
	
	In the light of that material, the trial judge changed his mind with respect to the application by counsel for the accused, noting that V3 would have to be called on a voir dire and that he would “want to hear from him about all aspects of the case, including complaint, the way threats worked on him and so on”. [54] 
	
	
	The third stage involved the conduct of a voir dire which then took place, continuing into the following day, in the course of which each of the complainants was called. V1 gave evidence as to how he came to speak to police. In his statement he had said that “a couple of weeks ago” his brother had telephoned him to say that the police were inquiring about the accused and allegations of assault which had “something to do with sex”. [55]  There was reference in the statement to dinners at his mother’s house, at which V2 was present on occasion. He was asked whether, following the telephone call from his brother, he spoke with V2 “or any of the other people about [the accused] and about what happened?” [56]  He said in reply, “no I don’t have contact at all.” He said he had been living in the Newcastle area since 1994.
	
	
	V1 also referred in his statement to the possibility that it had occurred to him that the accused had “given [V3] a flogging”. [57]  However, in response to questions as to whether he had ever spoken to V3 about the incident when he had seen V3 coming out of the accused’s house with red eyes, as if he had been crying, said “no, never”, and when asked whether he had spoken to V3 about what happened to V2 and V1 himself, said “no, never.” [58] 
	
	
	V2 also made a statement. [59]  V2 had been friendly with V3 in the years prior to making the statement in April 2007; he agreed that some three years before he had made his statement he had had a telephone conversation with V3, who had asked him “did he ever belt you?” and “did he ever give you a flogging”, referring to the accused. He also agreed that V3 had told him that the accused had “done sexual things to him as well”, but denied that he had told him “what was involved.” [60]  He agreed that on one occasion he had met V3 and they had discussed things. He accepted that he had spoken of the accused giving him a flogging and “just sexual things happen and they’re not right.” [61]  He later agreed that the conversation extended to “putting on the condoms on and stuff like that and trying to keep an erection and stuff like that, cause I had a girlfriend and he wanted me to you know perform like a stud.” [62] 
	
	
	With respect to V3, counsel for the accused took the opportunity to explore the subject matter of the further conference with the prosecutor, notes from which had been served shortly prior to the hearing. The prosecutor raised an objection to that course, but the trial judge allowed it to continue. [63]  Like the other two complainants, V3 was contacted by police to give a statement. He said that the police first spoke to V3’s sister, who had contacted him. He was asked whether his sister told him something to the effect that the police were investigating the accused “having sexual activity with boys or young men” and replied:  [64] 
	


“No she just said that it was about him so I knew exactly what it would be about.”


	
	V3 agreed that he had spoken on the telephone to V2 as they were good friends, although V2 lived in Newcastle and they did not have much direct contact. [65]  V3 also agreed that he had asked V2 whether he would be interested in giving a statement. The cross-examination continued: [66] 
	


“Q.   Righto, how did you know that [V2] would either want to or be able to do that?

A. Well I knew that [V2] was at my place, I think it was one Christmas and – and he just questioned me about [the accused] and – and we both knew that something had happened and we said at that time, I don’t want – I said to [V2], I said, ‘I don’t want to talk about this, I never want to talk about this’ and so we never ever did.”


	
	V3 accepted that they both prepared lists of persons who might be able to assist the police, but they did not swap lists. He also said that he had no knowledge of the accused being involved in sexually inappropriate behaviour with students at Barker College in Sydney. [67] 
	
	
	Following the voir dire, both counsel made submissions: there was no application for a separate trial and no issue was raised with respect to the admissibility of tendency evidence. Understandably, on the material set out above, there was no suggestion of concoction or even contamination.
	


(c)   ground 1(a) – failure to reconsider pre-trial ruling


	
	The premise underlying this ground was never clearly articulated. The Court was taken in submissions to the detail of the exchanges between counsel for the accused and the trial judge during the first stage of the hearing on 11 April 2011. The submissions then set out the discussion during the second stage, when the judge accepted that there should be a voir dire and that each of the three complainants should be called. Finally, extracts were provided from the transcript, including the critical passages set out above.
	
	
	Despite the fact that the complainants were cross-examined as to their contacts with each other, the trial judge having expressly allowed that course to be taken, the submissions proceeded on an assumption that trial counsel believed that no further application could be made for a separate trial, nor could he reopen the question of whether evidence on one count would be admissible on counts involving other complainants, because the trial judge had already ruled on that issue in October 2010 and had refused to reconsider it in the first stage of the hearing on 11 April 2011. It is, however, an implausible explanation of what happened on 11 April 2011. After being adamantly opposed to reopening pre-trial issues which had been addressed some six months earlier (and for understandable reasons) the judge expressly stated that he had changed his mind at the second stage of the hearing on 11 April, following which the complainants were cross-examined in the manner referred to above. The most plausible explanation for what then happened was not that counsel thought he was precluded from making a further application but, on an entirely reasonable assessment of the evidence which had been adduced, concluded there was no tenable basis for any submission with respect to concoction or contamination, which might lead to a different ruling.
	
	
	Further, the Director submitted, without challenge, that “no questions were asked of the complainants as to [the issue of concoction] throughout the trial proper.” The ground was without substance and should not be the subject of a grant of leave pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	


(d)   grounds re admission of tendency evidence – miscarriage


	
	As to the use of the evidence of V1, V2 and V3 in respect of the counts involving each other, the submission that the evidence of each was inadmissible as tendency evidence was based squarely upon the possibility of concoction. The written submissions for the applicant, which were not relevantly expanded upon at the hearing of the appeal, focused squarely on common law principles without reference to the terms of the Evidence Act which have been explained above in dealing with the appeal from the first trial. However, the challenge must fail on the factual basis already noted, namely that there was no support in the evidence for an allegation of concoction or contamination. Even under the common law principles, speculation without foundation was not a basis for rejecting tendency evidence.
	
	
	The submission with respect to Mr Chandler’s evidence was placed on a different basis, Mr Chandler and his complaints being unknown to the complainants in the second trial, until the trial commenced. Rather, reliance was placed upon the lack of a temporal relationship between the events described by Mr Chandler and those described by the complainants, the assaults on the complainants pre-dating those on Mr Chandler by some seven years. It was submitted that there was no “sequential connection” between the offences; they occurred in “different geographical areas” and the ages of the various victims varied. Furthermore, there was no evidence of “intervening behaviour” which might have linked the conduct at Inverell with the conduct involving Mr Chandler.
	
	
	It may be accepted that these factors (and other factors) may well provide points of distinction which would warrant careful consideration under s 97 of the Evidence Act. Ultimately, a mechanical analysis of the kinds of factors which have led to evidence being excluded in other cases and other circumstances will not demonstrate error in the present case. That which the trial judge needed to focus upon, and did on the only occasion on which he was invited to rule on the matter, was whether or not the evidence on one count could bear significant probative value with respect to the other counts (for the purposes of s 97(1)(b)) and whether that probative value would substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect (for the purposes of s 101(2)).
	
	
	This was not a case in which there was any doubt as to the identity of the alleged assailant, nor was it a case in which there was evidence of any basis for vindictively concocting false charges (other than, no doubt, the sexual abuse itself). Nor did the applicant deny association with the complainants and their families. He simply denied that the assaults and sexual activity occurred with any of the boys.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the evidence of any one of the witnesses, if believed, would have provided very significant support for the evidence of others. The analysis set out by the trial judge in his reasons in October 2010 was persuasive. There was no attempt to identify flaws in the reasoning. Although it is appropriate that there be a grant of leave with respect to these grounds, the challenges must be rejected.
	
	
	It follows that the applicant is entirely unsuccessful in his appeal against the convictions which resulted from the second trial.
	


(3)   Appeal against sentence

(a)   basis   of sentencing


	
	The applicant was not sentenced with respect to the offences against Sascha Chandler until after the trial with respect to the other three complainants. There is no complaint made about that course. After a hearing on sentence which in fact commenced with the tender of some material prior to the second trial, and continued over several days between 27 May 2011 and 19 July 2011, the applicant was sentenced on 22 August 2011. Given the number of convictions, the judge sentenced the applicant to an aggregate period of imprisonment with a single non-parole period. That course was entirely appropriate and there is no complaint about it.
	
	
	There are, however, nine purportedly separate grounds of appeal. They can be grouped in four categories, namely:
	



	
	(a)   the indicative sentences given in respect of “old” offending;
	
	
	(b)   the indication of the specific sentences for individual offences;
	
	
	(c)   the manner in which the aggregate sentence was reached, and
	
	
	(d)   general considerations as to the seriousness of the offending.
	



	
	Even these categories are somewhat artificial, but they will provide a sufficient structure for what follows.
	


(b)   indicative sentences for old offences


	
	A distinction is to be drawn between the offences with respect to Mr Chandler, which occurred between May 1991 and January 1992 and those involving the three complainants in the second trial which occurred between November 1977 and March 1983. With respect to the earlier offences, there were different statutory provisions, with differing maximum penalties. It is not in doubt that the judge was required to deal with the earlier offences in accordance with the statutory regime for sentencing which was in force at the time the offences were committed. Indeed, the same principle applies with respect to the offences in 1991-1993, there having been further changes in the succeeding 20 years. The significance of the distinction between the two groups of offences is that there were significant increases in the maximum penalties for various sexual offences as a result of the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1989 (NSW).
	
	
	The relevant sentencing principles have been discussed in a number of cases including Magnuson v R, [68]  MPB v R [69]  and recently in RL v R. [70]  These decisions were handed down after the judgment on sentence in the present case, but in sentencing, the judge expressly stated, after referring to the periods over which the offending took place, that he had “had regard to sentences imposed by courts in those times for those sorts of offences and I have had regard to decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal about sentencing for offences many years ago.” [71]  He also had the benefit of (and had regard to) sentences imposed by Maxwell J on the applicant in 1988. [72]  On that occasion, which was the first on which the applicant was sentenced for indecent assaults, he received a total sentence of four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. That non-parole, according to its terms, would have expired on 30 June 1990. However, due to the system of remissions then in force, he was released to parole on 5 September 1989. According to information supplied by a solicitor in the Office of Public Prosecutions, the parole period was expressed to terminate on 30 June 1994. It is likely that that was a typographical error (certainly the date two years after the expiration of the nominal head sentence was unexplained) and, given that this was the first period of imprisonment, it is likely that the parole period would have expired around March 1991. It will be necessary to return to this conclusion shortly.
	
	
	It is apparent that the basis of the challenge that the sentencing judge failed “to give proper regard” to the sentencing regime which applied at the time of the offending (ground 3) and failed to take into account “the provisions of the Probation and Parole Act [1983]” (ground 4) was primarily by way of introduction to the separate complaint that the indicative sentences were manifestly excessive (ground 9). It will be necessary to address the last complaint shortly. However, a somewhat different basis upon which the challenge might be put is that the indicative sentences failed to give due weight to the circumstances of the applicant as they would have been known to a sentencing court, dealing with the offences which occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s, at the time the offending occurred. The details will be explained below, but to give lengthy terms of imprisonment with respect to the three offences involving V1, which may have occurred as early as late 1977 and late 1978 respectively, and before any other known offending, appears to have involved sentencing with hindsight. Both at the time of the offending, and now, the applicant would have received leniency in facing his first sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed when he himself was about 20 years of age. (At the time of sentencing he was 53 years of age.) His subsequent offending deprived him of any entitlement to leniency with respect to the later offences, but there would an element of double jeopardy in failing to grant a degree of leniency in sentencing for the earlier offending.
	


(c)   Imposition of aggregate sentence


	
	The power of a court to impose a single sentence (“an aggregate sentence”) for multiple offences [73]  came into effect on 14 March 2011, [74]  long after the completion of the first trial in 2009, though before the second trial. The applicant asserted (ground 1) that the power was not available with respect to the offences for which he had been found guilty in the first trial.
	
	
	The correctness of that submission depends upon the relevant savings and transitional provision with respect to the commencement of s 53A. That provides [75]  that s 53A applies “to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed”, unless the court “has convicted the person being sentenced” before the commencement of the amendment. The critical date is, therefore, the date on which the court convicts the person.
	
	
	Colloquially, a jury verdict of guilty may be described as a conviction. Indeed, “conviction” may also be given such a meaning for legal purposes. [76]  In Griffiths v The Queen [77]  the High Court considered whether an offender who had pleaded guilty before a magistrate and being committed for sentence in the District Court, but then set at large for two years on a recognisance had been convicted or sentenced. The Court held he had been convicted, but had not been sentenced: his submission that he had not been convicted was rejected. The Court was concerned with the definition of “sentence”, as it then stood in s 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act, as including “any order made by the court of trial on conviction with reference to the person convicted …”. [78]  In no very precise terms, it appears that a person was taken to have been “convicted” at the time the verdict of the jury (or a plea) was accepted by the trial judge and steps taken to determine the appropriate sentence. [79]  However, the Criminal Appeal Act has been amended in a subtly significant way: it now defines “Sentence” to mean “any order made by the court of trial on convicting a person of an offence”. [80]  In any event, the meaning of the term in a particular statutory provision must be governed by the relevant statutory context.
	
	
	Almost 40 years after the decision in Griffiths, imprecision as to the operation of a verdict and when a conviction occurs remains. In dealing with the effect of a plea of guilty to an alternative (lesser) offence, Dawson and McHugh JJ in Maxwell v The Queen [81]  stated:
	


“Thus, whilst a plea of guilty is a confession of guilt, it does not of itself amount to a conviction. A conviction does not occur until there is an acceptance of the plea amounting to a determination of guilt by the court. The determination of guilt forms part of the judgment of the court but it can occur otherwise than by the formal entry of the plea upon the record of the court. Of course, the formal entry of the plea upon the record may afford the clearest evidence of a determination of the court, but a determination may otherwise occur when the court acts so as to indicate unequivocally its acceptance of the plea.”


	
	The other members of the majority in Maxwell, Gaudron and Gummow JJ, noted that “the present position in the United Kingdom appears to be that there is no conviction until final adjudication by sentence”. [82] 
	
	
	After referring to the various judgments in Griffiths, Gaudron and Gummow JJ concluded: [83] 
	


“Apart from the order that the appellant be remanded in custody for sentence, there is nothing in the present case to indicate that there had been a determination of guilt. … In these circumstances, the remand for sentence is, in our view, to be treated as provisional in the sense indicated and not as involving a determination of guilt.”


	
	By contrast, there is, in practical terms, no scope for a judge to reject a verdict of guilty in a criminal trial. Barwick CJ in Griffiths referred to the difficulty which would attend the treatment of a verdict as a conviction for the purposes of exercising the powers conferred on the court where guilt was established, including dismissal of the charge, but “without proceeding to conviction”. [84]  Barwick CJ outlined a course by which a trial judge, minded to apply the provisions of s 556A, could direct that the verdict be recorded but no conviction be recorded until further order. [85]  The awkwardness of such a course, where the judge may not have heard submissions or formed any view about the appropriate penalty, if any, is readily apparent. There was some irony in the fact that in the year following Griffiths this Court was able to intervene to set aside a conviction which the trial judge though he had no power, but to record, in order to dismiss the charge under s 556A. [86] 
	
	
	Some further indication as to the intention of the transitional provision in relation to aggregate sentences may be gleaned from other transitional provisions dealing with earlier amendments; in some there is similar language (referring to conviction before the commencement of the amendment), but with a definition of “convicted” as including “make a finding of guilt”. [87]  One such provision introduced s 3A (purposes of sentencing), amended s 21A (aggravated, mitigating and other factors in sentencing) and introduced standard non-parole periods. [88]  The transitional provision (cl 45) stated that the amendments did not apply to offences committed before their commencement except with respect to ss 3A and 21A which did apply with respect to earlier offending, unless the court had earlier convicted a person or accepted a plea of guilty. [89] 
	
	
	The overall scheme is tolerably clear: amendments which could have adverse consequences for an offender are not to apply to offences committed before the amendments took effect. Other amendments apply to sentencing where the person has not been convicted (a conviction includes any finding of guilt) or pleaded guilty. The selective use of the definition of the verb “convict” indicates a more limited meaning of the term “conviction” where it is not given the expanded meaning. This provides an indication that, in relation to aggregate sentencing, the power of the court to impose such a sentence was not excluded merely because there had been a finding of guilt prior to the commencement of the amendment, but only where there had been a conviction. One may add to that consideration the court’s own assessment that the power to impose an aggregate sentence was not intended to increase the period for which a person would be liable to imprisonment, nor in any practical sense has it been seen to have such an effect. Thus, for example, the present complaint that the sentencing judge used a power which was not available to him, even if correct, should not affect the length of the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	Given that the reference in the transitional provision to a person being convicted relates to a power of sentencing, the natural meaning of the expression is the act of the court in convicting. In accordance with common (though not universal) practice, the judge formally convicted the accused immediately prior to sentencing him. That took place on 22 August 2011, after the commencement of s 53A. [90]  Accordingly, the judge had power to impose an aggregate sentence with respect to the offences dealt with in both trials.
	
	
	Although it may be said that there is a significant difference between a plea and a jury verdict, the circumstances of the present case otherwise closely resemble those described in Maxwell by Gaudron and Gummow JJ as set out at [126] above. Following the jury delivering its verdicts, the prosecutor formally tendered a criminal history, but no further steps were taken, the trial judge indicating that he did not propose to sentence until the second trial had been finished. He maintained the current orders for non-publication of names and other material until the completion of that trial. [91]  He remanded the offender in custody to a date to be fixed for sentence, but did not fix a date. [92] 
	
	
	In the course of his judgment on sentence, and immediately before pronouncing sentence, stated “I formally convict the offender of all the offences of which he was found guilty by the juries at the trials before me on 6 July 2009 and 27 May 2011.” [93]  Of course, this language is not determinative: if, by operation of law, conviction had already occurred, the formal pronouncement could not undo what had already happened. Further, the formal pronouncement may have been undertaken either from an abundance of caution or merely to confirm what was understood to have happened by operation of law. Nevertheless, there are legal reasons for giving effect to the circumstances recorded in the transcript following the 2009 jury verdicts and the understanding revealed in the formal pronouncement of orders in 2011.
	
	
	Further, the inclusion of the power to impose an aggregate sentence must be understood against the statutory background at the time of the amendment. For example, by 2010 the statutory provisions for appeal had achieved a level of complexity designed to ensure that almost any decision which could amount to a conviction or sentence was subject to appellate review. For example, the power exercised by this Court in Reinsch had been given express statutory form in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), s 3(3A). Also, the subtle change to the Criminal Appeal Act to include in the definition of “sentence” any order made by the court of trial “on convicting a person of an offence” reflects a more temporally precise understanding of the meaning of “convict”. Significantly, the term “conviction” is defined in the Criminal Appeal Act to include certain findings and verdicts under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), but not to include a verdict of a jury in criminal proceedings. In these circumstances, and in the absence of any prejudice to an offender in adopting such an understanding, this Court should accept that the applicant was not convicted with respect to the verdicts given in the 2009 trial until the time of his sentencing. Accordingly, the power to impose an aggregate sentence was available to the trial judge and is available to this Court.
	
	
	Ground 1 must be rejected.
	


(d)   fixing indicative sentences


	
	A court imposing an aggregate sentence for multiple offences is required to “indicate to the offender, and make a record of” the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence, had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. [94]  The fact that the provision requires that the indication be given “to the offender” reveals a principal purpose of the provision, namely to provide an element of transparency. Although the so- called “indicative sentences” are not sentences actually imposed, and therefore not capable of being the subject of an appeal, a complaint that particular indicative sentences are excessive may provide a basis for concluding that the sentencing process has miscarried.
	
	
	The terms of s 53A have, in this regard, led to a degree of confusion. On occasion judges have treated the requirement to indicate the separate sentences as warranting an indication of both a non-parole period and a balance of term and even, in some cases, the effect of applying the principle of totality, by way of adjustments and specifying the extent to which the sentences indicated would have been concurrent or cumulative. [95] 
	
	
	At least the last element of the exercise would appear to be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of an aggregate sentence. That purpose is to recognise that the process of sentencing for multiple individual offences can appear quite arbitrary in circumstances where the real question to be determined is the appropriate overall period of imprisonment. Further, to the extent that a non-parole period is required, the imposition of an appropriate period in respect of a lengthy accumulation, whilst complying with the terms of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, was apt to give rise to great awkwardness. This matter, also, will be considered further with respect to a specific ground of appeal.
	
	
	There remains a degree of ambiguity as to what is required by way of an indication of separate sentences. Assuming questions of totality need not be addressed, is the judge required to identify the full sentence, a sentence with a non-parole period or, if the latter is not thought appropriate, a fixed term? Where numerous sentences are imposed at one time, it is commonly convenient to impose fixed terms where the relevant parole period would be wholly consumed within the non-parole period of an accumulated sentence for another offence or offences.
	
	
	The trial judge indicated sentences for each offence, without indicating a non-parole period. It may be assumed, however, that in each case the indication was intended to be a full term, as several were the maximum sentence available for the offence. Those indications should not be treated as a fixed term, which, being a period of mandatory custody is properly equated with a non-parole period. Any other understanding of the exercise undertaken would engage the implausible result that the judge was imposing sentences for a full term in excess of the statutory maximum. Nevertheless, it would be preferable (if available) to indicate, by a fixed term, the minimum period of mandatory custody which each offence should have borne.
	
	
	The language of “fixed term” does not appear in the Sentencing Procedure Act: it is used here to refer to the sentence imposed where the court declines to set a non-parole period, pursuant to s 45 of that Act. There may be different reasons for the court to decline to set a non-parole period, but one not uncommon reason (especially prior to the power to impose an aggregate sentence) was to avoid, in a case a multiple sentences with a degree of accumulation, the specification of balances of term in circumstances where other sentences would prevent the offender being released to parole to serve such balances. In those circumstances, the term specified without a non-parole period was generally to be equated with a non-parole period or period of mandatory custody. Because such a power was available, absent an aggregate sentence, it must remain available with respect to so-called indicative sentences to be recorded in imposing the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	It is true that, even when imposing an aggregate sentence, where offences carry a standard non-parole period, the court must indicate the non-parole period it would have set for each such offence had it set a separate sentence of imprisonment for that offence: s 54B(4). As none of the offences subject to the present sentencing exercise involved the standard non-parole periods, it is not necessary to decide how an individual sentence for such an offence should be indicated. That provision does not remove the possibility of specifying a sentence without a balance of term, where that would otherwise be appropriate.
	
	
	In JM v R, [96]  RA Hulme J said with respect to s 53A(2)(b) that “there is no requirement to specify non-parole periods unless the offence is one for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed.” [97]  He returned to this topic in identifying a “number of propositions” emerging from the legislative scheme and the cases. [98]  Proposition 7 repeated the statement that non-parole periods “need not be specified”. One reading of these propositions is that the sentencing judge must indicate the full term of the sentence which would have been imposed, rather than the period of mandatory custody. There is, however, nothing in the statutory scheme which would warrant such a constrained approach: accordingly I would not read such an intention into the language used in JM, which does not seek to state any such express restriction.
	


(e)   manifestly excessive sentence


	
	A number of grounds are properly addressed under this heading. First, it was said that the judge erred in setting a parole period of 12 years (ground 2). Secondly, it was said that the judge erred in his assessment of the seriousness of the offending behaviour (ground 5) and in assessing the impact of the offending behaviour on the victims (ground 6). The complaint that the indicative sentences were manifestly excessive (ground 9) can only be treated as a basis for concluding that the actual sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	There were two other grounds, which did not take matters any further. Ground 7 (which was expressed to be in the alternative to grounds 3-6) alleged that the exercise of discretion “miscarried” in the approach to “the fixing of sentences.” That, as addressed in the written submissions, referred to the manner in which the judge dealt with the old offences and thus to particular indicative sentences. Finally, there was a complaint that the judge failed to have “adequate regard to the principle of totality”. This ground appears to be based upon a misapprehension. If it were intended to submit that the total effective sentence was disproportionate to the offending, it was merely a statement that the aggregate sentence was excessive. That is an unnecessary extension to the established use of the phrase “the principle of totality”. The principle has generally been applied where separate specific sentences are imposed for a series of offences which, when accumulated, give rise to an overall period of imprisonment which appears excessive in all the circumstances. That principle will generally require a reduction of the overall sentence by permitting a higher degree of concurrency than might otherwise be deemed appropriate. Subject to one possible qualification, the principle of totality has no application in respect of an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	A possible qualification to the last proposition may arise where the sentencing judge has arrived at the aggregate sentence by assessing the appropriate indicative sentences for individual offences and then indicated degrees of concurrency or accumulation for each, so as to arrive at an aggregate figure. Although there may be circumstances in which that is an appropriate, or at least a possible approach, it was not the approach adopted in the present case. With a large number of offences, that exercise will tend to undermine the purpose of aggregate sentencing. Accordingly it need not be further considered.
	


(f)   assessment of error


	
	There is no doubt that the judge took (and was entitled to take) an adverse view of the applicant and his offending. He described the criminality as “very serious” and the applicant as a “persistent recalcitrant offender who has no remorse for what he has done.” [99]  If entitled to leniency for some of the earlier offending, there were, nevertheless, a multiplicity of offences for which no leniency could be accorded. Having defended all of the charges (as was his undoubted entitlement) the applicant obtained no discount of the kind commonly provided on a plea.
	
	
	Because the sentences were imposed under the current legislation, it was necessary for the judge to have regard to the terms of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, as he did. In imposing a sentence of 32 years imprisonment, with a non-parole of 20 years, it was necessary to make a finding of “special circumstances” in order to avoid the balance of the term of the sentence not exceeding one-third of the non-parole period, contrary to s 44(2). The finding of special circumstances was based on “the length of the overall sentences [sic] and the non-parole period and the need to give some incentive to the offender to undertake rehabilitation courses designed to stop sexual offending.” [100] 
	
	
	The judge dealt in some detail with the various separate offences for which the applicant had been convicted. There are four issues to be addressed with respect to the manner in which the course of offending was dealt with.
	
	
	First, the judge referred at the outset of his reasons to the 1988 convictions for offences which had occurred in Grafton in 1985 and 1986. Those offences post-dated offences committed mainly in or near Inverell, which were the subject of the second trial. It appears that he denied the applicant any degree of leniency with respect to the earliest offending, because of the later offences for which he had already been convicted and sentenced.
	
	
	Secondly, the judge noted that, having served a non-parole period of less than two years with respect to the Grafton offences, “within a short time of his release” he committed further offences against Sascha Chandler. The judge also noted that those offences were committed between April 1991 and 28 January 1992, when the offender was “on parole for the offences he had committed in Grafton in 1985 and 1986.” [101]  However, for reasons noted above, it is probable that the parole period had expired in March 1991; in any event, there was no evidence to show that it was continuing after that period. It was therefore an error to treat as an aggravating factor the possibility that the offender was on parole at the date of any of the offences against Sascha Chandler, let alone (as appears to be the case) in respect of all those offences.
	
	
	Thirdly, although the judge dealt with the offences against each victim, he did not do so chronologically. That had two consequences. One was that he gave no leniency in indicating individual sentences for the earliest offences. The second factor was that no express account was taken of the age of the offender at the time of the earliest offences.
	
	
	Fourthly, and this matter provides in part support for the view that the concerns expressed above had practical consequences, some of the indicative sentences appear to be excessive. The first offence involved kissing V1 at a roller-skating rink. The offence was said to have occurred between 5 November 1977 and 2 November 1979. There was some variation as to the offender’s date of birth in the various reports in evidence on sentence, but the judge accepted that he was born on 7 December 1957. [102]  However, the judge also stated that he was 21 or 22 years of age when he “first became involved in paedophile crime in Inverell”. [103]  An offence committed as early as 5 November 1977 could have been committed shortly before his 20th birthday. There was no finding that it was committed at some later time. V1 was said to be 9 years old at the time of that event. Taken in isolation, and having regard to the applicant’s age at the time, it was not the kind of indecent assault which would have warranted a sentence of imprisonment. Nevertheless, the judge indicated a separate sentence of imprisonment for one year. On the assumption that sentences of imprisonment would have been imposed for other offences, it may be that some short (perhaps nominal) period might have been imposed because no other sentence would have been appropriate. Nevertheless, the sentence of one year was outside any reasonable range for that offence.
	
	
	The next two offences involving V1 were more serious. They occurred at a time when V1 was between 10 and 13 years and involved simulated intercourse by the offender placing his penis between the boy’s thighs, whilst the boy was in his care. There is no doubt that each involved serious offences of indecent assault and warranted a sentence of imprisonment. They were, however, the first offences of their kind and the imprisonment would have been, if imposed within a reasonable time after the offending, the first offences for which the applicant would have been imprisoned. A good guide to the appropriate range is provided by the similar offences for which he was convicted in 1988 and on each of which he was sentenced to imprisonment for two years by Maxwell J in the Supreme Court. Against this background, the imposition of the maximum available sentence of five years imprisonment, as indicated by the primary judge, was outside the available range. Further, it should have been noted that the two offences having occurred on the same night, there would have been a high degree of concurrency, if not complete concurrency of the two sentences.
	
	
	With respect to the other offences of simulated intercourse at or near Inverell, the judge also indicated a sentence of five years for each offence (bar one for which no indication was given), in each case being the maximum penalty.
	
	
	There were three further offences of common assault, carrying a maximum period of two years imprisonment, for each of which the judge indicated that the maximum sentence would be imposed.
	
	
	For two further indecent assaults, involving masturbation, sentences of three years were imposed (the maximum being five years). For six counts of buggery, which carried a maximum sentence of 14 years, the separate sentences indicated were, in each case, 12 years.
	
	
	What is remarkable about the indicative sentences is that, despite the care taken in the reasons to identify the features of the specific offending in each case, there was no attempt in fixing the separate sentences to identify where across the range of offences which fell within the particular section of the Crimes Act the individual offending fell. That course would have been required by a proper exercise in sentencing. [104]  Indeed, the uniformity of the sentences, together with their proximity to the maximum available sentence suggests that the indications were arbitrary and did not bear a proper relationship to the nature of the offending.
	
	
	There is a similar level of arbitrariness with respect to the indicative sentences for offences against Sascha Chandler. The severity of the early sentences may be partly a reflection of the view that they were committed whilst the applicant was on parole for the Grafton offences. If that had been the case, it would have been a serious aggravating circumstance, which needed to be established as a matter of fact. It was not so established: indeed, it was probably not correct. Those offences should have been dealt with on the basis that the applicant was not then on parole.
	
	
	Much of the offending was undoubtedly serious and formed part of a course of conduct which was abusive, both in the sense of physical abuse and abuse of the offender’s authority over the victim. Nevertheless, touching the victim on the crutch after showing him pornographic videos was not an offence which warranted four years imprisonment (count 3). With respect to the assaults, most were explicitly sexual, involving masturbation or simulated intercourse. With respect to those which were not overtly sexual, but involved “punishment”, the judge was satisfied that they involved sexual gratification of the offender and could properly be described as sadistic and humiliating. [105]  The sentencing judge also properly noted that the Inverell offences involved two victims who were very young at the time and the third a vulnerable teenager. [106]  On the other hand, it should be accepted that the applicant did not hold a position of authority over the boys (as he did with Sascha Chandler) and he himself was then considerably younger, being in his early 20s.
	
	
	The proposed variation of a number of the indicative sentences does not lead to any necessary conclusion as to the length of the aggregate sentence. Nevertheless, without significantly diminishing the judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the offending, a period of 32 years imprisonment is excessive. The judge made a finding of “special circumstances” so as to permit a period of possible parole well in excess of the statutory default ratio of one-third of the period of mandatory custody. The reason given for that course was to give the applicant an incentive to undertake appropriate courses in prison, dealing with sexual offending. It may also have been intended to ensure the applicant had a sword over his head should he be tempted to reoffend after release.
	
	
	While the circumstances which may be designated as “special circumstances” for the purposes of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act are not (and should not be) narrowly defined, the purpose identified in the present case does not self-evidently warrant a variation of the statutory relationship. A possible parole period of 12 years extends well beyond any period within which the applicant is likely to obtain useful assistance from the parole authority. More importantly, the court should not assume that parole will be granted at the end of a non-parole period. There must be a reasonable proportion between the aggregate sentence imposed and the offending. On the assumption that a period of mandatory custody of 20 years was the minimum appropriate to the seriousness of the offending, the aggregate sentence was excessive.
	


(4)   Resentencing


	
	Being satisfied of error affecting the sentencing process it is necessary for this Court to determine for itself what sentence is appropriate and, if the result differs from the sentence imposed by the trial judge to substitute the preferred sentence. [107] 
	
	
	Subject to the qualifications noted above, the sentencing judge provided in his reasons a comprehensive description and assessment of the offending, which may be accepted, but need not be repeated. This Court should accept the assessment of the sentencing judge that the offender has “blighted four lives directly and indirectly the lives of others connected with those four men.” [108]  As the sentencing judge further noted, the favourable view as to his willingness to change accepted by Maxwell J in 1988, did not materialise. The offending in 1991 to 1993 demonstrated that the favourable expectation was misguided. The sentencing judge accepted that there was “a high risk of reoffending”. [109]  The applicant did not give evidence on sentence and did not speak about his offending for those responsible for pre-sentencing reports.
	
	
	Sentencing for offences committed over 30 years ago, or even 20 years ago, is always problematic. However, the applicant was a mature adult during the more recent offending; he had already received a period of imprisonment for similar offences and he exercised control over a young male student by an exercise of domineering personality combined with humiliation, threats and actual violence, for sexual gratification. A lengthy sentence of imprisonment is inevitable.
	
	
	When indicating the sentences for the individual offences, it is convenient to treat each as a fixed term, without specifying a non-parole period, each being intended to reflect a period of mandatory custody. It is neither necessary, nor appropriate, to address questions of accumulation or totality. These are matters to be assessed in the fixing of an aggregate sentence and non-parole period. There is no basis for a finding of special circumstances to permit departure from the statutory ratio of the non-parole period and the balance of term.
	
	
	Different views have been expressed on this Court as to whether, in relation to offences not subject to a standard non-parole period, it is open to the court to decline to specify a non-parole period, but to impose a sentence which constitutes the intended period of mandatory custody. This is sometimes referred to as a “fixed term” and is used where any parole period would be subsumed within further accumulated sentences. Such a course received the unequivocal imprimatur of this Court, constituted by Handley JA, James and Howie JJ in 2004 in Regina v Dunn. [110]  However, in Collier v R [111]  RA Hulme J noted that no case adopting that approach referred to the only possible statutory basis for it, namely s 45 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. He continued: [112] 
	


“Construed literally, the discretion provided in s 6 of the Sentencing Act [1989] was to decline to set both a minimum term and an additional term and, in lieu, set a fixed term. Construed literally, the discretion provided in s 45 of the current legislation is to decline to set a non-parole period. Neither provided, in terms, for discretion to reduce a sentence by not including within it an additional term, or parole period.”


	
	Although words should, where possible, be given their ordinary meanings, the literal construction of statutory provisions is sometimes a poor guide to meaning. It is usually necessary to construe provisions as a whole and having regard to their apparent purpose. [113]  The present exercise is to determine what is meant by “the sentence” that would have been imposed for each offence, in s 53A(2). The term “sentence” is defined to mean “the penalty imposed for an offence”. [114]  There are many provisions relating to the imposition of “a sentence of imprisonment” but the critical provision is s 44, which requires that the court first “set a non-parole period for the sentence” and then set the “balance of the term of the sentence”. It may be inferred that “the sentence” is the combination of the two periods, but because s 45 permits the court to decline to set a non-parole period, that cannot always be the case. The reasons for not setting a non-parole period include “because of any other penalty previously imposed” and “for any other reason that the court considers sufficient”. [115]  There is nothing in this language which denies the court the power to approach the specification of a sentence of imprisonment for accumulated offences in the manner described in Dunn. Accordingly, unless there are compelling reasons for not following Dunn, it is at least the entitlement of this Court to follow it, if not its obligation.
	
	
	Putting aside issues with respect to standard non-parole period offences, (which did not exist when Dunn was decided), there is no authority to the contrary (nor did RA Hulme J suggest in Collier that there was). [116]  The doubts as to the correctness of such a sentence were noted in Convery v R [117]  and in RJB v R; [118]  however, fixed terms have been imposed in numerous cases. There have been a number of cases in which this Court has had to consider whether a fixed term was intended as a reflection of the period of mandatory custody identified by a non-parole period, or whether it was intended to be the full sentence, undivided into non-parole period and balance of term. [119] 
	
	
	However, if all of this is wrong and the indicative sentences are required to be a combination of a non-parole period and a balance of term, even in cases where the standard non-parole period provisions do not apply, then the relevant sentences are those set out in the Schedule below, increased by one-third, in accordance with the norm prescribed by s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.
	
	
	Having regard to (i) the extent of the offending; (ii) the seriousness of the individual offences, and (iii) the real risk of reoffending, a sentence of some severity is required. An aggregate sentence of 24 years imprisonment should be imposed. Absent special circumstances, there should be a non-parole period of 18 years. A schedule indicating the separate sentences which would have been appropriate for the individual offences is attached.
	


(5)   Orders


	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	



	
	With respect to the 2009 convictions -
	



	
	grant the applicant leave to appeal against the convictions for all offences;
	
	
	dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	With respect to the 2011 convictions -
	



	
	grant the applicant leave to appeal limited to ground 2;
	
	
	With respect to ground 2, dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	With respect to the appeal against the aggregate sentence -
	



	
	grant the applicant leave to appeal;
	
	
	set aside the sentence imposed in the District Court on 22 August 2011;
	
	
	in place thereof, impose an aggregate sentence, and
	
	
	sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years, to commence on 28 December 2008. The first date on which the offender is eligible for parole is 27 December 2026.
	



	
	HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA in respect of the conviction appeals, and with his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	As to sentence, I also agree with the aggregate sentence proposed by his Honour and, generally, with his reasons. My only reservation is his Honour’s approach to specifying fixed terms of imprisonment as the indicative sentences. In my view, it is the total term (or head sentence) for each offence which should be indicated, not the minimum period of mandatory custody. Only in this way can it be demonstrated that, in arriving at the aggregate sentence, a sentencing judge has properly assessed the criminality of each offence.
	
	
	I share the view of RA Hulme J, referred to by Basten JA at [166], about the discretion provided by s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to decline to set a non-parole period. Of course, on many occasions sentencing judges set a fixed term which represents the appropriate non-parole period for a particular offence when that sentence is part of a sentencing structure involving cumulative or partly cumulative sentences, an exercise which is obviated by the aggregate sentence procedure. However that may be, the determination of the minimum period of mandatory custody for an offence may be affected by discretionary considerations different from those governing the determination of a head sentence. It is that sentence which reflects the assessment of the criminality of an offence, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, objective and subjective, and it is that assessment which should be reflected in an indicative sentence.
	
	
	For the purpose of the present case, however, I am content to adopt the pragmatic approach suggested by Basten JA at [169].
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with Basten JA.

2767129,R v Hicks (No 2) [2015] NSWDC 384,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: When Peter Hicks first appeared before me, some time ago now, I described certain objective features of his offending and his subjective features as well. For reasons I then gave, I indicated that I was satisfied that a custodial sentence was required, that I considered it was likely to be two years or less, but that I considered in the circumstances that it was appropriate to refer Mr Hicks for assessment as to whether he was suitable to serve that sentence of imprisonment by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	When the matter came back before me, the report indicated his unsuitability. There were two particular aspects which indicated unsuitability, they related firstly to the nature of his accommodation and secondly the suggestion that he had been less than honest during the preparation of the intensive corrections order suitability report.
	
	
	Ordinarily I would have then imposed a full-time custodial sentence, but a submission was made that I should seek further ICO assessment to enable the offender to deal with the issues raised in the initial ICO assessment. I also noted that it did appear that the offender had been more honest with Corrective Services than they suggest he had been. The matter was therefore adjourned to today. The Crown has tendered a further ICO assessment which indicates that the offender is suitable. However it is fair to say that it is not a glowing assessment.
	
	
	If what is in the assessment is correct, it appears that Mr Hicks does not quite understand that the alternative to getting an ICO is getting a full-time custodial sentence. That is something the Crown submits is appropriate despite the assessment for suitability. However, for reasons I gave some time ago, this was an unusual group of offences. In particular this was not a case where the offending would have continued in the absence of police pretending to be a child re-initiating contact with the offender.
	
	
	That is not to suggest that the offending was not serious, it clearly was. The fact that I have determined that a sentence of imprisonment is required is testament to what I think of Mr Hicks’s behaviour, however I am satisfied that what is best for the community is that Mr Hicks be given as much encouragement as possible to deal with the obvious issues that have caused him to offend in the way that he has. This is not done as a favour to Mr Hicks, it is done because I believe it would best promote the safety of the community. Of course, if the concerns expressed in the most recent ICO assessment report result in the offender not complying with the conditions of the ICO which I will shortly impose, then Mr Hicks will end up in gaol anyway. If he does comply then, as I have said, I believe that is the most appropriate way of protecting the community from further offending.
	
	
	On each matter, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two years. I order that he serve that sentence by means of an intensive corrections order as well as the standard conditions applying to all intensive corrections orders there are two additional conditions. One: he is to complete the sex offender treatment program with an accredited psychologist. Secondly, he is to continue to see Phillip Screen psychologist or some other similar psychologist for as often and as for as long as that psychologist suggests is appropriate in order to reduce the likelihood of further offending on Mr Hicks’ part. The sentence will commence 20 July 2015.

		23 March 2016",2015-07-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767131,R v RG [2015] NSWDC 221,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The first half of 2009 there were six serious armed robberies committed by a gang of armed men. Cash in transit armoured trucks were targeted and a large sum of money was stolen. The accused was charged with those robberies and stood trial with a number of other co-accused in 2012. After a lengthy trial he and his co-offenders were found not guilty of all charges. However in the lead up to that trial he committed the offence which I must now sentence him, conspiring to pervert the course of justice. That offence came about this way.
	
	
	In late 2009 a significant drug dealer named Mohammed El Ahmed was arrested. Police found a large quantity of drugs, firearms and even plastic explosives in his possession. Soon after his arrest Mr El Ahmed began co-operating with the police. Part of his co-operation was telling them what he knew about the armed robberies. Over the course of the next few months he made a number of statements implicating Mr G in the armed robberies and indicated his willingness to give evidence against the accused. These statements were served on Mr G who was then in custody bail refused at Goulburn gaol.
	
	
	What followed thereafter was a series of telephone calls made by the accused in which he agreed with three other people that Mohammed El Ahmed would be threatened in an attempt to have him alter the evidence that he was proposing to give or in the alternative to not give evidence at all. These telephone calls were recorded, as are all telephone calls made by prisoners from custody.
	
	
	Mr G, fully conscious that the authorities were at the very least recording his conversations if not monitoring them communicated with three other men in a way which attempted to disguise what he truly wished to say. Despite that there was clear agreement between Mr G and the people to whom he was speaking that the offence of perverting the course of justice would be committed. Thus, although Mr G repeatedly said that Mr El Ahmed was not to be threatened it is clear that is precisely what he intended. His suggestion that Mr El Ahmed should be told that if he did not change his evidence or agree not to give evidence that they would no longer be friends was intended to suggest, and was understood to suggest, that Mr El Ahmed should be threatened and threatened he was.
	
	
	Mr El Ahmed had been given a telephone by his brother in law for use in communicating with Mr G’s associates. Police lawfully intercepted and recorded the telephone calls made to that mobile phone. Subtle threats were made to Mr El Ahmed until a very unsubtle threat was made against his sister. Mr G told Paul Geeves to tell Mr El Ahmed that if he did not do what they wanted then the Assyrians would go and see his sister. The telephone intercepts recorded the conversation between Mr Geeves and Mr El Ahmed when that threat was conveyed. The reaction of Mr El Ahmed, even allowing for the circumstances that he knew the conversation was recorded, spoke eloquently of his understanding of the information which was being conveyed to him.
	
	
	At the armed robbery trial in 2012 the offender gave evidence as to what was meant by a suggestion that the Assyrians would visit Mr El Ahmed’s sister. Unfortunately for him, but fortunately for the course of justice, he was later recorded where he told someone that that was a story which he had “made.” Although he denied it in this trial I am satisfied that what he meant was that it was a story which he had fabricated.
	
	
	Despite all these threats made subtly but repeatedly to Mr El Ahmed, he did give evidence in the 2012 trial in accordance with statements he had made to police. Thus the object of the conspiracy was never achieved but that is not to suggest that the offence of conspiring to pervert the course of justice was anything other than a very serious offence indeed.
	
	
	Of course it is an offence to use improper means to get someone to tell the truth in court or not to lie in court but it is a more serious offence to use improper means in an attempt to get someone to say something in court which is not believed to be true. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the object of the conspiracy was, in two particular areas, to get Mr El Ahmed to say things in court which Mr G believed to be false. This is not in any way to call into question the offender’s acquittal on the armed robbery charges. He is fully entitled to be treated for all purposes as being not guilty of those charges, (a subject I will return to) but that does not mean that everything he said while giving evidence in the 2012 trial should be treated as though it were true. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when Mr El Ahmed was told that he should make a statement to the effect that he gave the offender a BMW key to hold for him he was being asked to say something which the offender believed to be untrue. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when Mr El Ahmed was told that he should accept responsibilities for the robberies Mr G did not believe that Mr El Ahmed had done those robberies. This offence is thus made more serious by it being the intention of Mr G that in those two areas Mr El Ahmed would give evidence which Mr G did not believe to be true.
	
	
	On the other hand there is a matter which points the other way. Let me return to the topic of Mr G’s acquittal. I will treat him, as I understand I must, as a person who was in gaol facing trial for offences and who was not guilty of those offences. This offence would be much more serious of course if Mr G’s intention was to obtain acquittals on charges where he was guilty of those charges.
	
	
	The offender’s brother LG, Paul Geeves and Lance Farrell also stood trial. Mr Farrell was found not guilty but LG and Paul Geeves were found guilty and sentenced by Acting Judge Phegan. In Mr Geeves’s case his Honour imposed a suspended sentence of imprisonment for 18 months. In LG’s case his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of two years three months. The principles of parity of course apply. The offender should not have any justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed on him with the sentence imposed upon his brother and Mr Geeves. Of course I will have regard to the sentences imposed on those two other offenders, but I must also give due recognition to the significant difference between the cases dealt with by Acting Judge Phegan and the case I am dealing with today. There were significant differences, in particular concerning the subjective features of Mr Geeves which his Honour outlined and the objective criminality of LG.
	
	
	Any offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice is a serious one. Civilised society depends on justice being done. If justice is not done then society is harmed. The object of this conspiracy was to undermine the criminal justice system by having Mr El Ahmed say things in evidence which Mr G did not believe to be true in an attempt to secure his acquittal. It is not a mitigating feature that the conspiracy failed. It would have been more serious offending if it had succeeded and it is important to understand that the offence of conspiracy where criminals reach agreements to perform crimes is, other things being equal, more serious than an offender simply determining by himself that he will attempt to commit a crime.
	
	
	Mr G was born in Sydney in 1986. He grew up in Marrickville with his brother L, who I have mentioned, and his mother. His father was from Africa and his mother is of Greek/Irish descent. His father left the family when Mr G was very young and he has only seen him sporadically since then. He has not in fact seen his father since he was 18 years of age.
	
	
	Mr G was interviewed by a psychologist. He described to the psychologist a mainly stable home environment during his formative years. He had a close relationship with his maternal grandparents, particularly his grandfather. One particular blot in the offender’s upbringing concerned the circumstance that when he was quite young, indeed at Year 1 at school he was sexually assaulted by a friend’s stepfather. The abuse continued for a couple of years. It was from that moment that the offender has identified that he gets angry very easily.
	
	
	Whether this was the cause of behavioural difficulties that he had as a child or not is impossible to say. What has happened however is that from a very young age the offender has been getting into trouble. He was in juvenile detention and has spent a great deal of his adult life in custody. He continues to have the support of his mother.
	
	
	In contrast to almost everyone that appears for sentence in these courts he does not have a drug problem, nor an alcohol problem. At one stage he did drink heavily and consumed cannabis but was able to give up both of those with no trouble at all. He was in good physical health whilst in custody.
	
	
	The offender does have a significant criminal history. As I mentioned, it began at a young age and there are a number of serious offences recorded on it. He went to gaol for armed robbery in 2005, for reckless wounding in 2010 and for possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm in 2013. There are also a number of other offences dealt with in the Local Court which have resulted in sentences of imprisonment. However, clearly the most significant matter on his criminal history relates to an offence of shooting at with intent to murder. He was sentenced on that matter quite recently, at the same time as being sentenced for possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm. The overall sentence imposed by Judge Hock means that he is currently serving a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 16 and a half years with a head sentence of 22 years.
	
	
	The difficulties of sentencing someone on a less serious offence while that person is serving a lengthy sentence for a much more serious offence are well known. Judge Hock allowed a period of eligibility for parole of five and a half years. However, any sentence I impose must commence at the very latest at the expiry of the non-parole period set by her Honour and I am not allowed to extend the head sentence which I will impose beyond that which is otherwise appropriate in order to preserve that length of eligibility for parole.
	
	
	The principle of totality applies too. I will give effect to that principle by commencing the sentence I will shortly announce before the expiry of the offender’s existing effective non-parole period.
	
	
	There is another matter which I should refer to which affects the commencement date of the sentence I will shortly announce. It seems that Mr G spent a year in custody where he was bail refused for this offence as well as being bail refused on the armed robbery charges. While acquittal after spending time in custody bail refused does not give someone credit which can be called upon when sentenced for future offending,( at least that is the case in New South Wales,) that is not the situation here. I can see no reason in principle why I should not take into account that one year of pre-sentence custody and in every reason of fairness why I should. So taking into account pre-sentence custody and the principle of totality I will start the sentence 18 months before the expiry of his non-parole period.
	
	
	A matter of some importance in choosing the length of the sentence concerns Mr G’s conditions of custody. At present and for some considerable time his conditions of custody have been more onerous than they would have been if he had been part of the general prison population. He is, for example, in his cell for 23 hours each day. Of course there is no guarantee that that will continue to be the case, especially as Mr G faces a very long time in custody and it seems that Mr G’s custodial situation is at least partly a response to his own conduct. I will take into account that there is a risk that the offender will spend some or all of his sentence in conditions of custody which are harsher than those of the general prison population in deciding the length of the sentence to impose.
	
	
	I sentence Mr G to imprisonment as follows: I impose a non-parole period of three years and a head sentence of four years to commence on 15 May 2028. Thus the non-parole period will expire on 14 May 2031. To make matters clear to Mr G this means that as a result of this offence Mr G’s minimum time in custody has been increased by 18 months.

2767142,R v Alkanaan (No.7) [2015] NSWSC 904,"______________________________________________________________

REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	On 2 February 2013, Falah Alkanaan murdered Hussein Khanafer outside 20 Boldrewood Road, Blackett, New South Wales.
	
	
	He did so by shooting him with a shortened, double-barrelled shotgun from a distance of about 1.5m. The shot passed through Mr Khanafer’s head, severing his brainstem, and causing his immediate death.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan fled the scene and hid for almost a week. Mr Alkanaan was arrested at Sydney Airport on the afternoon of 8 February 2013, and has been in custody ever since. He was charged with Mr Khanafer’s murder.
	
	
	Whilst in custody, Mr Alkanaan procured his then girlfriend, and her mother, to attempt to persuade an eye witness to the shooting, the wife of the deceased, to change her account to the police so that Mr Alkanaan would not be implicated. He was charged with conspiracy to induce a witness to withhold evidence.
	
	
	When initially charged, Mr Alkanaan pleaded not guilty to murder. When arraigned in the Supreme Court on 19 February 2015, he maintained his plea of not guilty to murder. On 13 March 2015, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder.
	
	
	When initially charged with the conspiracy offence, Mr Alkanaan pleaded not guilty. On 16 February 2015, when arraigned with respect to the charge of conspiracy, Mr Alkanaan pleaded guilty.
	
	
	It is now time for Mr Alkanaan to be sentenced for both of his crimes.
	
	
	The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of life imprisonment for the offence of murder. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides for a standard non-parole period of 20 years for that crime. The maximum term of imprisonment, and the standard non-parole period, are guideposts to which a court may have regard in imposing a sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27]. The standard non-parole period is not the starting point for an offence falling in the mid-range of seriousness: Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 at [35].
	
	
	The Crimes Act provides a maximum term of 7 years imprisonment for an offence of inducing a witness to withhold true evidence. The maximum penalty for a conspiracy offence is not fixed by statute.
	


Judicial Task on Sentencing


	
	In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself and the community generally, of the judicial task on sentencing. That is, how a judge, in each individual case, must go about the task of fixing a sentence which accords with the legislation, the principles of the common law and one which is appropriate in the particular factual circumstances of this case.
	
	
	In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Alkanaan by applying well‑identified principles of law to the process of fact-finding: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at [1]-[2].
	
	
	The principles of law are well established and can be conveniently summarised in the following way:
	


“1.   Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rests with the judge, and not with the jury…;

2.   Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings …;

3.   The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making … is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. This may produce the result that, in a particular case, the view of the facts which the judge is obliged to take is different from the view which the judge would have taken if unconstrained by the verdict …;

4.   A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt …;

5.   There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender…. However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender …”.

R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; see also Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1.


	
	It is no part of the sentencing function for me to attempt to discern the basis upon which the jury reached their verdict. But rather, in sentencing Mr Alkanaan, I am obliged to do so, upon findings of fact which I alone make, but with the constraint that those facts must be consistent with the jury’s verdict.
	
	
	I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence.
	


The Statutory Regime


	
	The Parliament of New South Wales has determined the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender. Those purposes are to adequately punish an offender; to prevent crime by the deterrence of others generally, and the offender specifically; to protect the community; to make the offender accountable for their actions and to promote their rehabilitation; to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community; and publically to denounce the conduct of the offender.
	
	
	These purposes obviously overlap and are in tension. Punishment and rehabilitation are not always compatible. None of the purposes can be considered in isolation.
	
	
	The legislation also requires the Court to take into account, to the extent relevant, a number of aggravating and mitigatory factors. The legislation does not necessarily require that the Court increase or reduce a sentence because of these factors.
	


Principles of Sentencing


	
	The courts have developed clear guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge. These common law principles are to be found in decided cases.
	
	
	In summary, the common law principles include:
	



	
	Proportionality - namely that the sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offences: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ;
	
	
	Parity - namely, that any difference between sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence, ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, and to give the appearance that justice has not been done: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617 per Dawson J, Gibbs CJ and Wilson J agreeing;
	
	
	Totality - namely, that when a person stands for sentence for a number of offences, the Court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and determine what the appropriate sentence is for all of the offences: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ;
	
	
	Avoidance of double punishment - namely that a person should not be punished twice for the same conduct: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57 (1998) 194 CLR 610.
	



	
	These principles have continuing relevance because s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act preserves the entire body of judicially developed sentencing principles: Muldrock at [18]. As well, factors established by the common law as affecting sentence, such as whether prison may be particularly burdensome, are also to be taken into account: Muldrock at [19].
	
	
	What the sentencing task requires of a judge is that they have regard to the legislation, here the purposes stated for sentencing, the statutory guideposts of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, and the specific aggravating and mitigating factors. The sentencing Judge must also have regard to the common law principles. Against that legal framework, the sentencing Judge then has to find and consider all of the relevant facts about the offence and the offender. The sentencing Judge then undertakes an instinctive synthesis approach to the sentencing task.
	
	
	Sentencing is not an exercise of mathematical precision leading to a single correct answer. Rather, having determined the appropriate facts which relate to the offence, the proper approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing in this case, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26].
	
	
	I will bear in mind the legislation by which I am bound and the principles which the Courts have determined, when proceeding on this task of sentencing Mr Alkanaan.
	


The Facts


	
	I find the facts of the matter beyond reasonable doubt to be as follows.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan and the deceased, Mr Khanafer, had known each other for about 18 months or so prior to the death of Mr Khanafer.
	
	
	Their relationship arose out of mutual drug dealings. Mr Khanafer would supply drugs to Mr Alkanaan. Mr Alkanaan would sometimes use those drugs, and sometimes sell them. From time to time, he paid money to Mr Khanafer. He did other jobs for Mr Khanafer.
	
	
	Mr Khanafer was obviously addicted to drugs, in particular cocaine and methylamphetamine (Ice). He was injecting these drugs intravenously. The intake of these drugs clearly made Mr Khanafer, at times, unpredictable, violent and abusive.
	
	
	As well, Mr Alkanaan and Mr Khanafer were accustomed to consult with an older man, described by Mr Alkanaan as being well respected, who was clearly the principal source of their drugs. Mr Alkanaan acquired from this person, for the purpose of self-protection whilst working in the milieu of drug distribution, the shortened shotgun which was used in the offence of murder.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan kept that shortened shotgun in a loaded state, concealed in the backseat area of his motor vehicle, a Jeep Cherokee.
	
	
	On 31 January 2013, Mr Khanafer sent to Mr Alkanaan a text message which read “Cuz, call me before things get ugly, we need to talk”. Whilst there was some communication after this point, there was clearly no payment of money.
	
	
	On 2 February 2013, Mr Khanafer sent a further text message to Mr Alkanaan at 9.53am. It read as follows:
	


“Good morning cuz. I need my today $4,500. I have to give it to my brother. I [borrowed] $ of him. So wat time can I pick it up. Thanks cuz.”


	
	This text message did not elicit any direct response from Mr Alkanaan.
	
	
	In this process of finding the relevant facts, it is necessary for me to specifically record that I am quite unable to accept the truth of the evidence given by Mr Alkanaan as to what occurred on this day.
	
	
	I found him to be a thoroughly unpersuasive witness. He made statements in evidence which were patently untrue, particularly about the contents of recorded telephone calls. He must have known when he gave his evidence, that such statements were untrue. He often answered questions by asserting that at the time he did things which clearly inculpated him in the offence, he was “not thinking”. In fact, I am satisfied that Mr Alkanaan gave little, if any, truthful evidence, and I am unable to accept his version of events unless it constitutes an admission against his interests or unless it is independently corroborated.
	
	
	On the morning of 2 February 2013, Mr Khanafer, together with his wife, Kelly Khanafer, and their 18 month old child, was driving from his home to Merrylands. After calling into the Lethbridge Park Pharmacy, and leaving there at about 12.30pm, they drove to Mr Alkanaan’s house, and parked the car outside. Mr Khanafer went into the property to meet with Mr Alkanaan.
	
	
	They were then in each other’s company for about 30 minutes. During this time, they were seen to be conversing together at the front of the house, each speaking on their respective mobile telephones and, on one occasion at least, Mr Khanafer was seen to be speaking on Mr Alkanaan’s telephone.
	
	
	The evidence was that there were no raised voices heard, no apparent argument or other signs of any significant disagreement between them. Mr Alkanaan was seen to re-enter the house on a number of occasions and come back out to the front verandah.
	
	
	However, I am not in any doubt that there was an ongoing dispute between the offender and the deceased over a few thousand dollars. The offender was unwilling to pay the debt, which Mr Khanafer claimed.
	
	
	Shortly after 12.50pm, a silver Ford Falcon being driven by Mr Ben Toleafoa, arrived at the scene. It parked directly out the front of Mr Alkanaan’s house, and behind the car in which Mr Khanafer had arrived, and in which his wife, Kelly Khanafer, was sitting. Mr Toleafoa was, at that time, a very large and physically intimidating man.
	
	
	The timing of the arrival of that car was very shortly after a 23 second telephone call from Mr Alkanaan’s mobile phone to Mr Toleafoa’s mobile phone. Although Mr Alkanaan unconvincingly denied knowing Mr Toleafoa, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Toleafoa and Mr Alkanaan were known to each other, Mr Alkanaan regarded Mr Toleafoa as “his man”, and that it was he, Mr Alkanaan, who summoned Mr Toleafoa to his house. He summoned Mr Toleafoa to provide back up and, if necessary, assistance in the resolution of his ongoing discussions with Mr Khanafer.
	
	
	After the silver Ford Falcon arrived, the deceased, Mr Khanafer, left the front of the house and walked out onto Boldrewood Road, and stood at the driver’s side door of the silver Ford Falcon. He then spoke with Mr Toleafoa. I am not satisfied that there was any anger in that conversation. On the contrary, the evidence is that they were talking as though they were friends and, although Mr Khanafer was using his hands, I am satisfied that that was part of an ordinary, non-confrontational conversation.
	
	
	Whilst Mr Khanafer was standing on the road surface, Mr Alkanaan left the front verandah of his house, and walked to his Jeep Cherokee where he retrieved the shortened shotgun, which was already loaded. He then walked from the driveway where his Jeep Cherokee was parked, onto the road surface, around the front of the Ford Falcon and approached Mr Khanafer.
	
	
	Mr Khanafer commenced to stand up from where he had been leaning on the vehicle talking to Mr Toleafoa when without any warning, or any communication at all, Mr Alkanaan pointed the shotgun at Mr Khanafer’s head and discharged it. Mr Khanafer dropped to the ground. He died instantly.
	
	
	The silver Ford Falcon driven by Mr Toleafoa then reversed so as to be able to drive in a northerly direction along Boldrewood Road without striking the body of the deceased, Mr Khanafer. As it drew level with the body, Mr Alkanaan opened the door and got into the passenger’s side. At about that time he discharged his shotgun a second time.
	
	
	Mr Toleafoa then drove off in a northerly direction along Boldrewood Road at a high speed. He turned right into Manifold Street and then proceeded to Carlisle Street. After about 250 or so metres, Mr Toleafoa stopped the Ford vehicle, and allowed Mr Alkanaan to escape along a network of footpaths in the Bidwell area. As he was doing so, Mr Alkanaan dismantled the shotgun and disposed of it by putting it into a drainage pit along the pathway.
	
	
	Thereafter, Mr Alkanaan fled from the police and took refuge in the North Richmond area, at the home of two friends. He made arrangements to obtain an airline ticket from Sydney to Darwin. He made arrangements for accommodation at a house in Darwin, and set about disguising himself, and carrying false identification.
	
	
	Unbeknownst to Mr Alkanaan, his telephone calls making these arrangements were lawfully intercepted by the police. They were present at Sydney Domestic Airport to arrest him when he attempted to flee NSW. He had adopted a rudimentary disguise.
	
	
	Immediately upon his arrest, Mr Alkanaan gave an entirely false story to the arresting police, and then during a recorded interview later that evening at the St George Police Station, he persisted with a wholly concocted story, claiming that he was not involved at all in the shooting death of Mr Khanafer. This was a deliberate attempt to exculpate himself and to avoid responsibility for his conduct. His conduct in fleeing, and his lies to the police reflected a clear consciousness of his guilt of the offence of murder.
	
	
	After being arrested and charged, Mr Alkanaan was remanded in custody. Whilst at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, his conversations with his girlfriend and her mother were lawfully intercepted and recorded.
	
	
	It became apparent from those conversations that, although he denied any involvement to his girlfriend and her mother (which denial he accepts was entirely false), he procured their assistance to take steps to interfere with Mrs Khanafer and prevent her from providing a truthful account of the circumstances of the murder which would implicate him in any way.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan asked his partner and her mother to speak with an intermediary to get him to visit Mrs Khanafer. Mr Alkanaan wanted the intermediary to “… shut her up straight away”. He wrongly thought Mrs Khanafer was the only witness to the shooting. He made it clear that he wanted Mrs Khanafer to change her account to the police and say that she was not sure that Mr Alkanaan was the person who fired the shotgun.
	
	
	At one stage, during the course of these conversations, Mr Alkanaan told his partner that he was willing to pay $100,000 to the intermediary for him to carry out the task of persuading Mrs Khanafer to change her account of the shooting.
	
	
	During the course of these intercepted telephone calls, Mr Alkanaan also revealed his close relationship with Mr Ben Toleafoa whom he described as “my man”.
	
	
	He also disclosed, in my view, the real truth about why he shot Mr Khanafer. In one of the phone calls to Ms Tamara Nash, a female acquaintance with whom he was on good terms, Mr Alkanaan told Ms Nash, and I accept truthfully, that:
	


“Alkanaan:   … I told everyone, don’t go near my house or otherwise I will blow your fuckin head off …

…

Alkanaan:   One piece of shit didn’t listen. He copped it. Okay.

…

Alkanaan:   That’s the rule. No one comes near my mum’s. Hey.”

”


	
	In short, in the milieu of drug dealing, Mr Alkanaan formed the view that Mr Khanafer had overstepped the mark by visiting him at his house, where his mother and siblings lived, for purposes of debt collection. In those circumstances, Mr Alkanaan decided that the best method of repaying the debt and enforcing his “rule” was to kill Mr Khanafer. He did so deliberately, and, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, with an intention to kill Mr Khanafer.
	
	
	He then set about covering up his crime, by fleeing from the scene, lying to the Police and by engaging in the conduct which amounts to the conspiracy to which he has pleaded guilty. The aim of that conduct was to conceal his involvement in the crime and thereby escape punishment for it.
	


Specific Statutory Considerations


	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identifies a number of matters which the Parliament has provided as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. As well, there are matters in mitigation to which regard must also be had. It is appropriate to commence with the aggravating factors.
	
	
	To the extent that any aggravating factor forms part of or is included in the elements of the offence, I do not have further regard to it. These various aggravating factors principally relate to the offence of murder. I will only consider them in relation to that offence.
	
	
	The use of a weapon, namely, a shortened double-barrelled shotgun, is an aggravating factor to be taken into account. Not all murders involve the use of a weapon, but many do. In this case, this factor has some, not insignificant, weight: s 21A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act.
	
	
	If an offender has a record of previous convictions, particularly if the offender is being sentenced for an offence of serious personal violence, and has a record of a previous conviction for a serious personal violence offence, then that is a matter which is regarded as an aggravating factor: s 21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Here, Mr Alkanaan has a record of previous convictions as an adult stretching back over about 10 years. Many of the convictions are minor in nature and can be disregarded. Some offences led to terms of imprisonment. However, on 25 August 2011 he was convicted of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and also of contravening an Apprehended Violence Order. He was given a sentence by way of a bond to be of good behaviour for each offence. On of the bonds was for a period of 2 years commencing on 25 August 2011. He was on that bond at the time he committed this offence. I will have regard as an aggravating factor to his previous conviction for the offence of assault, but Mr Alkanaan is not to be punished again for this previous offence.
	
	
	Section 21A(2)(e), s 21A(2)(ea) and s 21A(2)(eb) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, each identify aggravating factors, namely that the offence was committed in company, in the presence of a child under 18 years of age and in the home of the victim or any other person. Each of these potentially applies here. Mr Toleafoa was present when the offence was committed, having been summoned to attend. Mr Khanafer’s 18 month old child was present in the motor vehicle in the immediate vicinity of the shooting, and the shooting took place immediately in front of Mr Alkanaan’s home in which his mother and siblings lived. In the particular circumstances of this case, where Mr Toleafoa was not involved in the crime, there is no evidence that Mr Khanafer’s 18 month child was aware of what occurred, and the offence took place on the street outside the front of Mr Alkanaan’s home – I do not think that these matters are properly to be regarded as aggravating factors, of any real weight. They can for practical purposes be put to one side.
	
	
	It is an aggravating factor if an offence is committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Here, the offender was on conditional liberty being the bond which I have described above. I regard this as an aggravating factor of some real significance since it demonstrates that Mr Alkanaan was not deterred from committing this offence by a sentence previously imposed by a court.
	
	
	There are a number of mitigating factors to which I am required to have regard and to which I do. Neither of the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The murder was a reaction to the unwelcome presence of Mr Khanafer at Mr Alkanaan’s house and his demands. Whilst a visit was to be expected, I do not think that there was any degree of planning about what happened. The conspiracy offence was a reaction to being caught by the Police and confronted with the reality of what he had done. Although there was some planning involved, it was not such as to amount to a planned or organised criminal activity. These matters have some, but a limited, mitigatory effect.
	
	
	Another specific mitigating factor, which relates only to the offence of murder, is whether the offender was provoked by the victim: s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mr Alkanaan submits that he was provoked by the presence of the deceased and the demands for money. I do not accept this submission. I am satisfied that there was no provocation in any of the conduct of the deceased. True it is the deceased sought money from Mr Alkanaan, but it was money which the deceased thought was owed to him. I am not satisfied that this constitutes any mitigating factor at all.
	
	
	If the Court is satisfied that an offender is unlikely to re-offend, or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation whether by reason of the offender’s age or otherwise, then these are matters of mitigation: s 21A(3)(g) and (h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Here, senior counsel for Mr Alkanaan made no submission that the Court should find that Mr Alkanaan was unlikely to re‑offend, or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. The evidence does not allow any finding at all about prospects of re-offending or of rehabilitation. There is no mitigation to be found here.
	
	
	If an offender has shown remorse for the offence, then that can be taken into account as a mitigating factor. Here, initially, there was no remorse. On the contrary, Mr Alkanaan’s reaction to being arrested was to lie about his involvement, and to attempt to secure through the perpetration of another crime, his freedom. Mr Alkanaan’s evidence of his regret for his actions, even if accepted, falls far short of providing evidence that he accepted responsibility for, and acknowledged the consequences of, his actions. I do not find that he has shown any remorse.
	
	
	Insofar as Mr Alkanaan has pleaded guilty to the conspiracy offence, that is a matter of mitigation, to which it is convenient now to turn.
	


Plea of Guilty


	
	When these proceedings were initially before the Supreme Court, and Mr Alkanaan was first arraigned, he pleaded not guilty to the conspiracy charge.
	
	
	At a directions hearing in December 2014, his counsel indicated that it was unlikely that the conspiracy charge would be contested. However, a plea of guilty was not entered until Mr Alkanaan was first arraigned on 16 February 2015.
	
	
	Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires the Court to take into account, with respect to the conspiracy charge, the fact that Mr Alkanaan has pleaded guilty and the circumstances in which he indicated that intention. The section also provides that the Court may, but is not obliged to, impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed. The section provides that the lesser penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown case against Mr Alkanaan on the conspiracy charge essentially arose out of the intercepted and recorded conversations of Mr Alkanaan. Those conversations and their meanings were clear. There was no alternative explanation for them. The conversations were also to be tendered as evidence in the trial of the murder charge. The fact that Mr Alkanaan pleaded guilty at the late stage that he did, provided no real benefit to, or facilitation of, the administration of justice. At best, it saved the jury from the task of determining whether he was guilty of the offence or not. To that extent there was a minor benefit to the administration of justice.
	
	
	A small discount is appropriate. That discount in my view ought be no more than 10%.
	


Mr Alkanaan’s Criminality


	
	It is appropriate to make an assessment of the objective criminality involving Mr Alkanaan’s offences. This is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to Mr Alkanaan, and is to be assessed wholly by reference to the nature and circumstances of the offence: Muldrock at [27].
	
	
	In my assessment, the criminality of the murder was very serious. In broad daylight, in a suburban street, in the presence of the deceased’s wife and his 18 month old child, Mr Alkanaan has murdered Mr Khanafer in a violent manner by firing a shortened shotgun at him from a short distance away. There was no apparent reason for so doing other than to assert his own domination over Mr Khanafer. It was a senseless, brutal and wholly unnecessary killing.
	
	
	I am well satisfied that Mr Alkanaan intended to kill Mr Khanafer. No less intention than that could be inferred from the fact that the shotgun was pointed directly at Mr Khanafer’s head and was discharged from a close range of about 1.5m.
	
	
	As best as can be discerned from all of the circumstances, I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that in assessing the objective criminality of Mr Alkanaan’s conduct, he was attempting to “enforce” the rule that he had invented, which was that the business of drug dealing and debt collection ought not be conducted at his house.
	
	
	Although senior counsel for Mr Alkanaan argued that the murder offence fell within the mid-range, I would assess the objective seriousness of this offence and the criminality involved as being above the mid-range of objective seriousness but not reaching the worst case category.
	
	
	The conspiracy offence was a persistent attempt by Mr Alkanaan to secure his freedom. It fell into the mid-range for such offences.
	


Victim Impact Statement


	
	The Court has heard a statement read by Mrs Joanne Khanafer. Clearly this crime has touched the members of Mr Khanafer’s immediate family, and his extended family, and I recognise that it has affected them all deeply.
	
	
	Because of recent legislative amendments, I am entitled, if appropriate, to take into account this victim impact statement in the determination of sentence on the basis that the harmful impact upon Mr Khanafer’s immediate family is an aspect of harm to the community. I consider it appropriate to take that harmful impact into account in this case.
	


Subjective Circumstances of Mr Alkanaan


	
	Mr Alkanaan is now 30 years old. He was 27 when he murdered Mr Khanafer. He was born and raised in Basra in Iraq. He is the eldest of four children.
	
	
	His early childhood in Basra was a time of political turmoil and civil unrest. Basra was the target of significant military action during the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Mr Alkanaan was exposed to the traumatic consequences of the war.
	
	
	Eventually, Mr Alkanaan’s family moved as refugees to Jordan where they awaited approval to come to Australia. During much of his early childhood, Mr Alkanaan had little, if any, contact with his father who, having been conscripted into the armed forces of Iraq, deserted and fled to Saudi Arabia. He had no formal education before coming to Australia.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan came to Australia at the age of about 11½. He attended school until mid-way through Year 9. His father left the family when he was 15 years old. His mother has brought him up since that time.
	
	
	He then worked in a variety of occupations including on mine sites in Western Australia and as a labourer, a truck driver and, ultimately, a traffic control employee with the Roads and Maritime Services. He was unemployed at the time of the offences.
	
	
	He has never been married although he has had a number of long term relationships.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan has a history of continuous illicit drug use since, at least, 2001. He commenced his drug addiction by using cocaine, and moved to consuming Ice. He was accustomed to using up to ½ a gram of Ice per day.
	
	
	A recent test undertaken by Dr Reid, a clinical psychologist, has established that Mr Alkanaan is a man of limited intelligence with a full scale IQ of 75, which places him at the 5th percentile for people of a similar age. Earlier tests found that his IQ was 69. At that range of IQ (69-75), he may be described as falling within the borderline to mildly intellectually disabled category, but as Dr Nielssen said in evidence which I accept, a conclusion of mild intellectual disability involves a broader assessment than just an IQ score.
	
	
	On a review of his life activities, and the things which he was able to do, I am satisfied that Mr Alkanaan knew perfectly well what he was doing when he committed both of these offences, and he knew perfectly well that what he was doing was wrong. I accept Dr Nielssen’s opinion that Mr Alkanaan’s low intelligence is likely to be associated with reduced impulse control, and a reduced ability to consider the likely consequence of his actions. However, I am not satisfied that this low intelligence is the explanation for the offence of murder.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan was able to take care of himself, to live and travel independently. He was able to develop intimate relationships and be a father to a number of children. He was able to work in a variety of, largely unskilled, jobs. Importantly, he was able to carry on an apparently successful drug dealing business. In other words, he could manage such arithmetic and monetary calculations as were necessary to deal in drugs.
	
	
	He was also able to make arrangements to flee NSW after the murder and then, when arrested, to concoct and maintain a false account. He was also able to give evidence in the trial for a lengthy period. He did not seem to have any inability to understand the questions which were asked of him.
	
	
	Even if his formal IQ assessment suggests a mild intellectual disability, I am not satisfied that such disability has any real or significant impact on his life, and any of his ordinary daily activities. It does not significantly affect his functioning. It does not impact in any significant way on an assessment of his moral culpability for these offences. Nor, in my assessment, is it such as to make Mr Alkanaan an inappropriate medium for general deterrence: cf Muldrock at [50]-[55].
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan has a history of some mental health problems. These problems are not relied upon as explaining his offences. Rather, to the extent that they will bother Mr Alkanaan, even if he is medicated, I will have regard to them in the context of the need for specific deterrence and the impact upon his time in custody. I note that he requires ongoing and long-term psychiatric treatment for these mental health problems. However, there is no suggestion that such treatment is not adequately available to him in custody.
	


Sentencing


	
	In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Alkanaan, I commence with the reminder that murder involves a criminal taking of a human life. It is a violation of the sanctity of human life, which is a concept at the heart of a civilised community.
	
	
	A conviction for murder warrants a substantial sentence because the demands of punishment and the deterrence of the broader community against similar conduct are of significant importance. In Mr Alkanaan’s case, because of the fact that the offence was committed whilst he was on a good behaviour bond for a serious personal violence offence, attention must necessarily be paid to specific or personal deterrence. That attention is tempered by his personal history and circumstances.
	
	
	In my view Mr Alkanaan’s easy resort to the use of a loaded shortened shotgun to deal with Mr Khanafer’s claim for money, and his “inappropriate” visit to Mr Alkanaan’s home, is conduct, the lawlessness of which would make any right thinking person shudder with horror. It is conduct which simply cannot be accepted or tolerated in a peaceful democratic society. The use of guns to settle personal differences is conduct which is to be firmly denounced and deterred.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstances as the law permits: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In my view, the usual period of parole will be adequate to assist Mr Alkanaan to reintegrate into the community at the completion of his non-parole period.
	
	
	The offence of conspiracy is one which strikes at the heart of the administration of justice. It is a serious offence. However, it does appear that Mr Alkanaan’s conduct here was driven out of circumstances in which he found himself after being arrested, and was reactive to that situation. Nevertheless, the offence represents another example of Mr Alkanaan turning his face against the law, and engaging in conduct which he sees as being to his advantage.
	


Sentence


	
	I have now discussed all of the facts which are relevant to the decision, including the relevant subjective circumstances of the offender, and it is now necessary to make a value judgment as to what the appropriate sentences are. The murder was a serious offence which falls above the mid-range of objective seriousness. The victim, who was unarmed, was confronted by Mr Alkanaan with his loaded, shortened shotgun. Rational behaviour was completely ignored. There is nothing which adequately justifies the conduct of the offender.
	
	
	I determine that the appropriate overall sentence for the murder to be one of 28 years imprisonment. Of that sentence, I determine that Mr Alkanaan must spend 21 years in jail before being eligible for parole.
	
	
	With respect to the conspiracy charge, I would ordinarily have imposed a term of imprisonment of 2 years. However, having regard to Mr Alkanaan’s plea of guilty, which merits a discount, I would impose a sentence of 1 year and 10 months. I decline to fix a non-parole period.
	
	
	To recognise the separate criminality involved in the two offences, it is appropriate to provide for a modest measure of accumulation of the sentences. Accordingly, the sentences will be accumulated by a period of 9 months.
	


Commencement Date


	
	Mr Alkanaan was taken into custody on 8 February 2013, and his sentences would usually commence on that date. However, for the period between 8 February 2013 and 6 August 2014, Mr Alkanaan has been serving the non‑parole period of a term of imprisonment imposed for a conviction in the District Court for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. That offence has no direct relationship to the offences being considered here.
	
	
	It will be appropriate for the sentences for these offences to commence on a date after Mr Alkanaan’s arrest so as to take account of this sentence. The appropriate date for the commencement of the first of these two sentences will be 9 months after being taken into custody, that is, 8 November 2013.
	


Offence of Serious Personal Violence


	
	I am required to warn Mr Alkanaan, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of murder of which he has been convicted, and for which he is about to be formally sentenced. At some future point in time an application may be made that, notwithstanding the completion of his sentence, he nevertheless ought be detained in ongoing custody, or else ought be the subject of an extended supervision order impacting upon his liberty.
	


Sentence


	
	Mr Alkanaan, for the offence of conspiracy, I sentence you to:
	



	
	A fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year and 10 months commencing on 8 November 2013 and expiring on 7 September 2015.
	



	
	Mr Alkanaan, on the charge of murder I sentence you to:
	



	
	(2)   A non-parole period of 21 years commencing on 8 August 2014 and concluding on 7 August 2035.
	
	
	(3)   A balance of term of 7 years commencing on 8 August 2035 and concluding 7 August 2042.
	



	
	You will not be eligible to be released before the expiry of your non-parole period.

2767146,R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Johnson J. I agree, for the reasons articulated by his Honour, that the Crown appeals should be allowed, that the Crown has discharged its burden of persuading the Court that the residual discretion not to intervene should not be exercised, and that this Court should intervene to resentence the respondent. I also agree with the orders proposed by his Honour.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown appeals under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the Respondent, Paul Herman de Leeuw, with respect to a number of child pornography offences.
	


The Offences and Sentences


	
	Following pleas of guilty, the Respondent was sentenced by Graham ADCJ in the Sydney District Court on 27 February 2015 for the following offences (set out in chronological order):
	



	
	Sequence 11 - between 11 August 2005 and 23 August 2005, using a carriage service to access child pornography contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth), an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	Sequence 2 - between 16 January 2006 and 14 April 2010, using a carriage service to access child pornography contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth), an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	Sequence 12 - between 15 April 2010 and 21 January 2013, using a carriage service to access child pornography contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth), an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	Sequence 1 - on 2 August 2013, possessing child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment.
	



	
	The Respondent asked the sentencing Judge to take into account, in passing sentence for Sequence 1 (the s.91H(2) offence), two further offences:
	



	
	On 2 August 2013, possession of child abuse material (located on a specified USB), contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	On 2 August 2013, possession of child abuse material (located on 117 CDs), contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	



	
	The sentencing Judge imposed the following sentences:
	



	
	Sequence 11 - the first s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offence - imprisonment for 15 months commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 June 2016;
	
	
	Sequence 2 - the second s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offence - imprisonment for one year and nine months commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 December 2016;
	
	
	Sequence 12 - the third s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offence - imprisonment for two years commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 March 2017;
	
	
	Sequence 1 - taking into account the two offences on the Form 1, for the s.91H(2) offence - imprisonment for two years commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 March 2017.
	



	
	The total effective sentence comprised a term of imprisonment for two years, which his Honour directed to be served by way of an intensive correction order (“ICO”) commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 March 2017.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered before the District Court. That statement revealed the following.
	
	
	On 2 August 2013, agents of the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) executed a search warrant at the Respondent’s home premises at Wyoming.
	
	
	A preliminary review of computers and other electronic devices, DVDs and CDs located at the premises revealed a substantial amount of material identified by AFP agents as child pornography material as defined in s.473.1 Criminal Code (Cth). A number of items were taken from the premises during the execution of the search warrant.
	
	
	The Respondent was questioned in relation to the material located, but he declined to comment.
	


The CETS Scale


	
	The contents of the seized items were analysed. Each image, video and/or document was classified into categories in accordance with the Australian National Victim Image Library (“ANVIL”) schema, also known as the Child Exploitation Tracking System (“CETS”) scale. The CETS scale contains six categories, which refer to the activity depicted in the child pornography material in the following way:
	



	
	Category 1 - nudity or sexually suggestive posing with no sexual activity;
	
	
	Category 2 - non-penetrative sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child;
	
	
	Category 3 - non-penetrative sexual activity between adult(s) and child(ren);
	
	
	Category 4 - penetrative sexual activity between children or adult(s) and child(ren);
	
	
	Category 5 - sadism, humiliation or bestiality; and
	
	
	Category 6 - animated or virtual depictions of children engaged in sexual poses or activity.
	



	
	ANVIL is a database of child pornography material which has been previously identified by officers from Australian law enforcement agencies. The child pornography material on the database is already classified into the above categories, together with their unique hash values. These hash values can be utilised for the analysis of electronic files. This database is continuously updated as new child pornography material is identified and classified.
	


Sequence 1 - Possess Child Abuse Material Contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)


	
	By virtue of the definition of “child abuse material” in s.91FB Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), material that has been identified by AFP agents as “child pornography material” for the purpose of s.474.19 Criminal Code (Cth) is, by extension, identified as “child abuse material”, with the CETS scale being utilised to categorise this material.
	
	
	Forensic analysis of three computer hardware devices seized by AFP agents on 2 August 2013 (two USB keys and a computer tower) revealed that the Respondent was in possession of 32,656 images, videos and documents classified as child abuse material at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	In addition, he was also found to be in possession of a DVD entitled “Barnens O The Children’s Island” which features Category 4 child abuse material. The Australian Film Classification Board had classified this DVD as “Refused Classification” (“RC”), thereby banning it. RC material cannot be sold, hired, advertised or legally imported into Australia. It contains content that is very high in impact and falls outside generally accepted community standards.
	
	
	The material which was the subject of the s.91H(2) count is summarised in the following table:

The Form 1 Offences


	
	In addition to the child abuse material which was the subject of the s.91H(2) offence, a USB key containing 226 images and videos containing child abuse material was also located at the Respondent’s premises, along with 117 CDs which contained an unknown amount of child abuse material. These items gave rise to the two s.91H(2) offences which were taken into account on a Form 1 on sentence for the State offence.
	


Sequences 11, 2 and 12 - Three Offences of Using a Carriage Service to Access Child Pornography Contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth)


	
	During the subsequent forensic analysis of the computer hardware located at the Respondent’s home, it was revealed that between 11 August 2005 and 23 August 2005, and again over a seven-year period between 16 January 2006 and 23 January 2013, the Respondent had used the Internet to access child pornography images, videos and documents by downloading the material from the GetBot file download service.
	
	
	GetBot is a file download manager for Windows operating systems. It allows the user to selectively download files, web pages and even entire websites from the Internet. GetBot is free to download and use, however there is an option for the user to pay a fee to access added features and functionalities.
	


Sequence 11


	
	Some 97 temporary Internet files were downloaded from websites accessed between 11 August 2005 and 23 August 2005. These 97 images were classified as child pornography material, with 64 images falling within Category 1, 28 images within Category 3 and five images within Category 4.
	
	
	This group of 97 images, which related to the first s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offence, did not form part of the material which was the subject of the s.91H(2) offence or the two associated Form 1 matters.
	


Sequence 2


	
	Between 16 January 2006 and 14 April 2010, a total of 31 images and videos, classified as child pornography material, located on a separate hard drive and computer tower, were downloaded using GetBot and saved in folders and subfolders.

It should be note that this time period extends beyond the period caught by the offence in Sequence 2.

	It should be noted that there is a significant overlap between the State and Commonwealth offences. All of the 24,211 items contained in the tables (at [23], [25], [27] and [29] above) are included in the schedule summarising the s.91H(2) offences (at [16] above).
	
	
	A further 39 images, classified as child pornography material, were located on a hard drive, but these images did not have any associated created date. They did not form part of any of the s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offences or of the s. 91H(2) offence.
	
	
	A sample of the child pornography material, with examples of images falling within each category on the CETS scale, was tendered in the sentencing proceedings with the folder being viewed by the sentencing Judge. The same folder was provided to this Court at the hearing of the appeal. Further reference will be made to this folder later in the judgment.
	


The Respondent’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The Respondent was born in 1951, and was aged between 54 and 61 at the time of the offences. He was 62 years old at the time of sentence.
	
	
	The Respondent has no prior criminal history.
	
	
	Before the sentencing court were a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 1 July 2014, a presentence report dated 21 August 2014 prepared by Elizabeth Leafe, Community Corrections Officer, together with an ICO assessment report dated 18 February 2015 prepared by Hanna Franks, Community Corrections Officer.
	
	
	Also tendered were a short report of Michael Corbett-Jones, psychologist, dated 4 June 2014, together with reports of Christine Oliver, counsellor, dated 11 September 2013 and 30 May 2014 and reports from Doug Sotheren, counsellor, dated 16 November 2013 and 5 June 2014. Also tendered was a report dated 11 June 2014 from Vera Grassecker, Gestalt psychotherapist and counsellor.
	
	
	The Respondent gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	The Respondent left school at the age of 18 years, having completed the Higher School Certificate. He went on to complete an engineering degree, taking first class honours some years later. The Respondent has maintained full-time employment throughout his adult life, with his longest period of employment being with a large telecommunications company.
	
	
	At the time he was sentenced, the Respondent was a self-funded retiree living alone in his own home on the Central Coast.
	
	
	The Respondent married in 1982. His marriage ended in 2001 and there are two children of the marriage with whom he continues to have contact. The Respondent’s parents are deceased and he has limited contact with his two siblings.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen considered that the Respondent had begun to experience depression following the breakdown of his marriage in 2001. Following an attempted suicide with an overdose of over-the-counter medications in 2003, the Respondent was hospitalised and he saw mental health workers after he was discharged. Dr Nielssen noted that the Respondent continued to have symptoms of depression.
	
	
	The Respondent informed Dr Nielssen that he had a long-standing attraction to prepubescent males, although he had never considered actual contact with a child and his interest was auto-erotic. Dr Nielssen diagnosed paraphilia (homosexual paedophilia).
	
	
	The Respondent informed Dr Nielssen that he had collected images of boys since his youth and later found an abundance of material available on the Internet. He found he could download great quantities of the material with file-sharing applications. The Respondent informed Dr Nielssen that he had destroyed entire collections only to start again.
	
	
	The Respondent had been receiving treatment from a number of persons, including a psychologist during the period July 2008 to November 2012 (Mr Corbett-Jones), a counsellor since July 2008 (Ms Oliver), another counsellor since March 2009 (Mr Sotheren) and a psychotherapist for the four years prior to sentence (Ms Grassecker).
	
	
	Although the Respondent had been receiving counselling for a number of years, he had not disclosed to any counsellor his use of child pornography until after his arrest. The Respondent said in evidence that he feared that if he informed his counsellors, he would be rejected.
	
	
	The Respondent believed that he had been the victim of ritual and sexual abuse in childhood. Dr Nielssen suggested that the Respondent’s memory of abuse might have been induced by suggestion during psychotherapy.
	
	
	The Respondent told Dr Nielssen that he had known what he was doing was wrong, but did not really consider its seriousness. The presentence report noted that the Respondent had acknowledged the seriousness of his conduct, but failed to understand the impact of possessing child abuse material. The ICO assessment report noted that the Respondent’s attitude had changed and he displayed some insight into the impact of the offences.
	
	
	An actuarial risk assessment indicated that the Respondent was a low/medium risk of reoffending. The presentence report and ICO assessment report indicated that consultation with a Department of Corrective Services psychologist suggested that the Respondent fell into the low-risk category of reoffending. Dr Nielssen expressed a similar opinion.
	
	
	The ICO assessment report noted that the Respondent had taken preventative steps to address future offending. Both the departmental psychologist and Dr Nielssen considered that the Respondent would benefit from counselling and further intervention.
	


Course of Proceedings in the District Court


	
	Before moving to the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to refer to aspects of the proceedings before the District Court, including the sentencing Judge’s remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The Respondent pleaded guilty to the offences in the Local Court on 11 February 2014 and the matters were committed to the District Court for sentence.
	
	
	The sentencing hearing commenced before Graham ADCJ on 30 October 2014. Documentary material was tendered, with the matter being adjourned part-heard before his Honour to 12 December 2014.
	
	
	When the matter resumed on 12 December 2014, the Respondent gave evidence. Thereafter, written and oral submissions were made by the Crown and for the Respondent on the question of sentence.
	
	
	At all times, the Crown submitted that a full-time custodial sentence was the only appropriate sentencing disposition in this case.
	
	
	After hearing submissions, the sentencing Judge enquired of counsel whether an ICO could or should be considered. After further submissions, his Honour delivered a short judgment, culminating in a referral of the Respondent for an assessment as to suitability for an ICO. After setting out the terms of the charges, his Honour said (AB27):
	


“At the outset it has to be acknowledged that the nature of the offences and the maximum penalties available for those offences and, indeed, the increase in the Commonwealth penalty in 2010 reflect the seriousness with which parliament, the community and the courts, view offences of this type involving child pornography material. The result is that the courts have laid down principles for sentencing in relation to such offences which require the imposition of immediate sentences of custody in the absence of exceptional circumstances.

In the present case there were in excess of 30,000 images involved and the offences took place over an extended period of time. While it is true that many of them involved images which would be classified at the bottom end of the scale as category 1- perhaps the overwhelming majority of them fell into that category- there were, nonetheless, a significant number of images in the higher categories, representing, by and large, the relatively more serious nature of the images in those higher categories.”


	
	After noting submissions which had been made, his Honour said (AB28):
	


“After adjourning to consider appropriate sentences in this matter, I considered whether (at least from a technical or statutory point of view) these were offences in respect of which intensive correction orders could be made. I have reached the conclusion that, whether by way of concurrency or aggregation through accumulation of sentences in this case, the various factors relevant to sentencing would produce a sentence in the order of two years imprisonment or less.”


	
	After recounting further considerations bearing upon the question whether an ICO assessment should be made, the sentencing Judge said (AB31):
	


“Without indicating at this stage whether a successful assessment would necessarily be acted upon, the Court would certainly be significantly at an advantage in having such an assessment available to it. Accordingly, on each of the four charges, the offender is convicted. I declare that the Court intends to impose sentences of imprisonment which would not exceed two years and I request an intensive corrections order assessment.”


	
	The proceedings were adjourned to 27 February 2015 for the purpose of an ICO assessment being undertaken.
	
	
	When the proceedings resumed on 27 February 2015, the ICO assessment report was tendered and further submissions were made. The Crown maintained the submission that the circumstances of the case called for a custodial sentence by way of full-time imprisonment as the only appropriate penalty.
	
	
	At the conclusion of submissions, the sentencing Judge proceeded to deliver remarks on sentence.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the history of proceedings to that point and outlined the charges and the facts of the offences. His Honour observed that the three Commonwealth offences covered a period between 2006 and 2013, but that this was effectively “a continuing episode” explained by separate penalties applying to different periods (ROS4, 27 February 2015).
	
	
	After referring to other features of the case, including the Respondent’s subjective circumstances, his Honour said (ROS8):
	


“The question that arises is whether the circumstances here, not only those that have been canvassed in these and previous remarks, but also those which appear in the submissions and in the evidence before the Court, justify the Court in considering that the circumstances of this case are sufficiently exceptional to impose an order less than fulltime custody. In considering that issue, it is clear in my view that the only relevant option which could be considered would be the option of an Intensive Corrections Order, anything less, such as a suspended sentence, being inadequate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences and the need for both general and specific deterrence.”


	
	The sentencing Judge referred to aspects of an ICO and then returned to the present case (ROS10-11):
	


“This is not an easy case in which to determine whether the circumstances do fall into that category of exceptional circumstances. Ultimately, however, it seems to me that the measure of rehabilitation and the prior recognition by the offender of his need for assistance and counselling do put the case into that category of exceptional circumstances. He was a person who, for many years, had experienced these urges and acted upon them by committing offences, but he did not wait until the police came to arrest him before commencing to take action to try and change his life.

It is, of course, regrettable that he was not as open with his counsellor and supporters as he should have been, but nonetheless it is clear that he had taken appropriate and firm, though perhaps incomplete, steps to start addressing his problem. Once he  was arrested, that attempt stepped up to a more complete engagement with the counsellor and his supporters.

The question of exceptional circumstances also needs to be balanced in relation to the objective seriousness of the offences. The duration of the offending and the number of images here certainly would cause a Court to be very careful indeed before concluding that the circumstances were sufficiently exceptional. Even allowing for the vast number of category one images, the sheer number of images in the more serious categories is, of course, a matter of significant concern and does suggest a relatively higher level of objective criminality than might sometimes be the case. Nonetheless, giving proper weight to that consideration and its concomitant need for general and special deterrence and denunciation, I am persuaded that the Court is, in these circumstances, in a position to impose sentences which would fall within the two year limit for consideration of Intensive Corrections Orders and that, in respect of each of those sentences, it would be appropriate to permit the sentences to be served in that fashion. I now propose to impose those sentences.”


	
	His Honour then imposed the individual sentences referred to above (at [5]) and directed that all sentences were to be served concurrently and by way of an ICO.
	
	
	After passing the sentences and making orders, the sentencing Judge referred to issues of accumulation and totality (ROS12):
	


“I should also acknowledge the submission made by the Crown as to the need for some partial accumulation which is set out in the Crown’s written submissions. Clearly some measure of accumulation would ordinarily be appropriate, though it is also significant to note that there is a considerable overlap between the offences so that any measure of accumulation would be relatively modest.

In any event, the principle of totality would appropriately lead the Court here to make an order with the outer limits of two years which are reflected in two of the sentences and with lesser sentences in respect of two of the other charges. In the Court’s view, an order for concurrency is the appropriate order to be made, particularly having regard to the principle of totality.”

The Grounds of Appeal


	
	By Notice of Appeal filed 27 March 2015, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions contended that the sentences for the Commonwealth offences were manifestly inadequate, in particular, but not only, because the learned sentencing Judge:
	



	
	failed to give due regard to totality in sentencing in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610;
	
	
	failed to accumulate to any degree any of the sentences reflective of separate offending and/or to impose any separate penalty for the Commonwealth offences;
	
	
	failed to have appropriate regard to general and specific deterrence;
	
	
	erred in the approach to the rehabilitation prospects of the Respondent.
	



	
	By Notice filed 1 April 2015, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) appealed against the sentence imposed for the offence under s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) upon the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann, counsel for the Respondent, conceded that the sentencing Judge had erred in failing properly to determine sentences for the individual offences before considering questions of accumulation and concurrency, so as properly to derive the overall term before considering how it was to be served.
	
	
	However, counsel for the Respondent resisted the appeals on other bases and submitted that this Court should, in any event, dismiss the Crown appeal in the exercise of the residual discretion.
	


Sentencing for Commonwealth and State Child Pornography Offences


	
	This Court has recently made general observations concerning the sentencing of offenders for Commonwealth and New South Wales child pornography offences: R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174 at [51]-[81]. Topics covered in that judgment included:
	



	
	the different vices addressed in the Commonwealth access offence under s.474.19 Criminal Code (Cth) and State possession offences, such as s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): R v Porte at [55]-[56], [157];
	
	
	the increased maximum penalties for these offences enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament (in 2010) and the New South Wales Parliament (in 2008): R v Porte at [57]-[58];
	
	
	general sentencing principles concerning child pornography offences which have emerged from decisions of intermediate appellate courts throughout Australia, where emphasis has been placed upon the paramount importance of general deterrence and denunciation, and the limited weight to be given to prior good character, together with the need to consider the objective gravity of the particular offences and to keep in mind that these are not victimless crimes: R v Porte at [59]-[72];
	
	
	the fact that prior good character and positive personal antecedents, and a reduced or absent need for personal deterrence, are relatively commonplace amongst offenders in possession of child pornography and that significant weight is to be given to general deterrence and correspondingly less weight to matters personal to the offender: R v Porte at [126];
	
	
	the fact that a common feature on sentence for this class of offence is the tender of material concerning steps taken with respect to counselling and treatment in aid of rehabilitation - whilst this aspect is important, undue focus should not be placed upon it at the expense of other legitimate and important sentencing considerations including denunciation and general deterrence: R v Porte at [71]-[72];
	
	
	the use to be made, in an assessment of objective gravity, of the CETS scale, relevant statutory definitions and an examination by a sentencing court of sample images: R v Porte at [73]-[81], ]113]-[122];
	
	
	the importance of attention being given to issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality when sentencing for Commonwealth and State child pornography offences: R v Porte at [96], [98]-[100], [157];
	
	
	the importance of ensuring reasonable proportionality between the objective circumstances of the offences and the sentences actually imposed, with the offender’s subjective circumstances not being allowed to overshadow the objective gravity of the crimes: R v Porte at [128];
	
	
	the need for care in avoiding the inappropriate use of an ICO for serious child pornography offences where the appropriate form of punishment should involve immediate incarceration: R v Porte at [129]-[130].
	



	
	In submissions made for the purpose of the present appeal, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Bromwich SC, who appeared with Ms Breckweg for the Appellants, identified a number of sentencing principles relating to child pornography offences, which appear in the next paragraph of this judgment. Mr Gartelmann did not dispute the accuracy of these principles. These principles are consistent with statements of this Court in R v Porte.
	
	
	Appellate courts throughout Australia have consistently stated that the following propositions apply to sentencing for child pornography offences:
	



	
	Unless exceptional circumstances exist, a sentence involving an immediate term of imprisonment is ordinarily warranted: R v Jongsma [2004] VSCA 218; 150 A Crim R 386 at 395 [14]; Hill v Western Australia [2009] WASCA 4 at [28]; R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [48]; R v Sykes [2009] QCA 267 at [24]; DPP v Groube [2010] VSCA 150 at [24]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro [2010] VSCA 60; 26 VR 477 at 483-4 [21]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Guest [2014] VSCA 29 at [23]-[24]; DPP v Smith [2010] VSCA 215 at [23], [26]-[29].
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offending is ordinarily determined by reference to the following factors:
	



	
	the nature and content of the material, in particular the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity depicted;
	
	
	the number of items or images possessed;
	
	
	whether the material is for the purpose of sale or further distribution;
	
	
	whether the offender will profit from the offence;
	
	
	in the case of possession or access of child pornography for personal use, the number of children depicted and thereby victimised;
	
	
	the length of time for which the pornographic material was possessed: R v Jongsma at 400 [28]; R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at 49 [99]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21]; DPP (Cth) v Guest at [25].
	



	
	General deterrence is the primary sentencing consideration for offending involving child pornography: Assheton v R [2002] WASCA 209; 132 A Crim R 237 at 246-247 [35]-[36]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21]; Edwards v The Queen [2013] VSCA 188 at [22]; DPP (Cth) v Guest at [25]; Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R [2014] VSCA 37 at [40]; DPP (Cth) v Zarb [2014] VSCA 347 at [34].
	
	
	Less or limited weight is given to an offender’s prior good character: R v Gent at 44 [65]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21]; Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181 at [37].
	
	
	Offending involving child pornography occurs on an international level and is becoming increasingly prevalent with the advent of the Internet as a means of allowing people to access and obtain child pornography: R v Jones [1999] WASCA 24; 108 A Crim R 50 at 51 [2]; Assheton v R at 246-247 [35]-[36].
	
	
	Offending involving child pornography is difficult to detect given the anonymity provided by the Internet: Mouscas v R at [31]; R v Booth at [29].
	
	
	The possession of child pornography material creates a market for the continued corruption and exploitation of children: R v Coffey [2003] VSCA 155; 6 VR 543 at 552 [30]; R v Cook; Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2004] QCA 469 at [21]; R v Jongsma at 395 [14]; Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R at [40].
	
	
	There is a paramount public interest objective in promoting the protection of children as the possession of child pornography is not a victimless crime - children are sexually abused in order to supply the market: R v Jones at 52 [9]; DPP (Cth) v D’Alessandro at 484 [23].
	
	
	The fact that an offender does not pay to access a child pornography website or was not involved in the distribution or sale of child pornography does not mitigate the offending: R v Coffey at 552 [30].
	



	
	In determining these appeals, the various propositions emerging from R v Porte, together with the above statement of principles, will be applied.
	


Approaching the Grounds of Appeal


	
	Each of the Commonwealth and State appeals advance a single ground of appeal - that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	It is appropriate to consider the particulars of the Commonwealth’s ground of appeal, before turning directly to consider the claim of manifest inadequacy.
	


First Particular - Failure to Give Sufficient Weight to the Nature and Circumstances of the Offending

Crown Submissions


	
	Whilst noting that the sentencing Judge had adverted to the relevant maximum penalties and the seriousness with which child pornography offences are considered, and had acknowledged that immediate sentences of imprisonment are to be imposed in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the Crown submitted that the sentences actually imposed failed adequately to reflect the seriousness and circumstances of the offending.
	
	
	The Crown pointed in particular to the following features of the Respondent’s offences:
	



	
	he possessed a total 32,656 items of child pornography material, including images and videos;
	
	
	the degree of depravity of a large volume of the material in the Respondent’s possession was extremely high:
	



	
	over 3,400 items, including 599 videos, were in Categories 4 and 5 on the CETS scale;
	
	
	more than half of all videos possessed were classified as Category 4 or 5;
	
	
	in terms of the three Commonwealth offences, the Respondent accessed over 24,000 still images, videos and documents, of which over 1,700 were classified in the worst levels of Categories 4 and 5,
	



	
	the images and videos featured many different victims of predominantly prepubescent or adolescent age;
	
	
	the Respondent’s conduct was not isolated but occurred over a very lengthy period covering over seven years - the lengthy period of the offending obviated any argument that the Respondent did not receive any gratification from the conduct;
	
	
	the offending involved two distinct forms of offending and several instances of separate offending;
	
	
	despite being the lowest classification level, Category 1 material cannot be said to be surreptitious or innocuous encompassing as it does a wide range of activity: Heathcote (A Pseudonym) v R at [24]-[25]; DPP (Cth) v Zarb at [30].
	


The Respondent’s Submissions


	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that the sentencing Judge had noted properly that sentences of full-time imprisonment were generally required for offences relating to child pornography other than in exceptional circumstances. He submitted that the sentencing Judge assessed the objective circumstances of the Respondent’s offences and had concluded that custodial sentences would ordinarily be required.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the sentencing Judge had found that the Respondent’s circumstances were exceptional. It was submitted that the determination of a primary Judge to impose an exceptional sentence should be respected where the circumstances of the case are properly found to be exceptional: R v DH; R v AH [2014] NSWCCA 326 at [1], [104].
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that it was reasonably open, in the circumstances of this case, to make a finding of exceptional circumstances. He submitted that, in considering whether the case was exceptional, his Honour had referred to the Respondent’s age and lack of previous convictions, his recognition that he needed assistance and counselling although he did not disclose the real problem prior to his arrest, his full engagement with his counsellors since his arrest and his progress with rehabilitation during the substantial period on bail.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann pointed to the sentencing Judge’s statement that the Respondent’s rehabilitation was ongoing, and that an ICO would allow him to continue to rehabilitate in the community and retain the benefit of his support group. The reasons for imposing an ICO included that the Respondent’s progress in rehabilitation could be encouraged to continue in the community where he would maintain access to those treating and supporting him.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that the finding that the Respondent’s case was exceptional may have been open in the circumstances of the case, even if the overall term had been determined properly at first instance to be two years or less.
	


Determination


	
	The sentencing Judge did not refer at any length or in any detail to the nature of the child pornography material in this case. The particular nature and content of material is important in considering the gravity of each case: R v Porte at [73]-[81].
	
	
	The s.91H(2) offence involved a very substantial number of items, exceeding 32,000.
	
	
	The classification of material under the CETS scale is informative, but should not be misunderstood. In R v Porte, this Court said at [77]:
	


“The classification of material in accordance with the CETS scale assists the process of assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence. Although Categories 1 to 5 on the CETS scale involve escalating gravity of the conduct depicted in the images, it should not be assumed that Category 1 material is mild in content. Despite being the lowest classification level, Category 1 material itself is capable of possessing significant gravity. In Zarb, Neave and Kyrou JJA observed at [30], after viewing images:

‘Although level 1 covers images which are not as depraved and abusive as the images allocated to higher levels, some of the images we viewed involved dreadful examples of the abuse of the child victims, who were arranged in sexualised poses displaying their genitalia. The images at the higher end of the CETS Scale depicted horrifying degradation and exploitation of young children’.”


	
	I have examined the sample images provided to this Court, being the folder handed to the sentencing Judge at first instance. Examination of the sample images assists a sentencing court, and this Court on appeal, to form an impression of the material and its degree of depravity: Smit v State of Western Australia [2011] WASCA 124 at [17]; R v Porte at [76], [114].
	
	
	A short description of some of the sample images will serve to inform the sentencing process in this case.
	
	
	The Category 1 images include photographs of naked prepubescent boys in sexualised poses (aged about four to 10 years).
	
	
	The Category 2 images include prepubescent boys engaged in solo or mutual masturbation.
	
	
	The Category 3 images include sexual activity between young boys and adult males, including masturbation.
	
	
	The Category 4 images depict penile and digital penetration by adult males of young prepubescent boys, together with fellatio by young boys upon adult men.
	
	
	The Category 5 images include naked young boys or girls in various states of bondage, and a photograph of a male urinating upon a child.
	
	
	It is not necessary to refer further to the Category 6 images, which depict animated or virtual images of children engaged in sexual poses or activities.
	
	
	Perusal of the sample images serves to confirm the objective gravity of these offences.
	
	
	The Commonwealth offences involved the downloading of material from the Internet over a seven-year period. Accordingly, the Respondent’s use of a carriage service to access child pornography material cannot be regarded as an isolated event, or an activity undertaken over a short period of time. The Commonwealth offences reveal an entrenched and protracted pattern of offending.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge’s approach to accumulation, concurrency and totality will be the subject of later consideration. It is sufficient to observe, at this point, that the objectively seriously offences committed by the Respondent were not realistically to be accommodated within a total head sentence of two years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	The importance of denunciation and general deterrence in this area of offending has been emphasised repeatedly by intermediate appellate courts (see [70]-[72] above). Prior good character, as existed here, was to be given less weight in the sentencing process. The fact that the Respondent had taken active steps towards his rehabilitation, since he was arrested and charged, is not an uncommon feature in cases of this type. The fact that the Respondent had sought out counselling prior to his arrest and charging was unusual. However, the Respondent did not inform his counsellors of his possession and use of child pornography material. Further, such counselling as he undertook did not serve to deter him from continuing to commit these offences up to the time of his arrest and charging in August 2013.
	
	
	Further reference will be made later in this judgment to the intrinsic leniency involved in the use of an ICO, and its inappropriateness in a case possessing the objective gravity of this case.
	
	
	It is sufficient to observe that the sentencing Judge’s remarks and, in particular, the sentences actually imposed (including the use of an ICO), demonstrated a clear failure to have proper regard to the nature and circumstances of the offending that had occurred in this case.
	


Second Particular - Failure to Give Due Regard to Totality in Sentencing in Accordance with Pearce v The Queen

Third Particular - Failure to Accumulate to any Degree any of the Sentences Reflective of Separate Offending and/or to Impose any Separate Penalty for the Commonwealth Offences

Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed in this case did not reflect the totality of the offending before the Court. It was submitted that both the length of the terms of imprisonment fixed for each offence, and the method by which the terms of imprisonment were to be served, were manifestly inadequate given the general principles applicable to sentencing for child pornography offences and the nature and circumstances of the offending in this case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, in proceeding to structure a sentence in the manner in which his Honour did, the sentencing Judge sentenced according to a desired outcome, rather than by imposing sentences which were appropriate for each of the offences and then imposing a degree of accumulation between the offences to reflect the different forms of criminality and instances of offending.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this failure resulted in the imposition of individual sentences that did not give due regard to the principle of totality in sentencing.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge erred by making no orders giving rise to accumulation as between each charge and/or by failing to impose a separate penalty for the Commonwealth offending.
	
	
	It was submitted that the failure to order any accumulation did not address the existence of separate instances of access offending and, importantly, failed to reflect the distinct nature of the access and possession offences, involving as they did separate acts of serious criminality. It was submitted that these offences are separate and distinct, and that it is entirely appropriate to impose some level of accumulation as between sentences: James v R [2009] NSWCCA 62.
	
	
	The Crown submitted further that the sentencing Judge made it clear in his remarks on sentence that, by electing to impose complete concurrency as between sentences, he would be able to achieve a sentence which did not exceed the maximum two-year term of imprisonment required to impose an ICO.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed in respect of the Commonwealth offences necessarily represented a degree of leniency because they were “rolled up” charges, each involving numerous incidents of access that were each capable of constituting separate offences. Accordingly, it was submitted that the criminality involved in each access charge was greater than with a charge involving only one episode of criminal conduct: R v Richard [2011] NSWSC 866 at [65](f). For that reason alone, the Crown submitted that a degree of accumulation was required as between the sentences.
	


The Respondent’s Submissions


	
	Mr Gartelmann acknowledged that the approach of the sentencing Judge that “whether by way of concurrency or aggregation through accumulation” the overall sentence would be “in the order of two years or less” (see [56] above) gives rise to an inference that his Honour failed properly to determine sentences for the individual offences in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen, and instead had regard only to the overall term (Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at [26]).
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann acknowledged further that, despite the sentencing Judge stating that whilst “some measure of accumulation would ordinarily be appropriate”, it would be “relatively modest” as there was “considerable overlap” between the offences, his Honour then proceeded to impose wholly concurrent sentences.
	
	
	Counsel conceded that this approach tended to confirm that his Honour failed properly to determine sentences for the individual offences, and then the question of accumulation and/or concurrency, so as to derive the overall term before deciding how it was to be served. Mr Gartelmann conceded that such an approach was inconsistent with principle: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 346; R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [25]-[29].
	
	
	It was conceded that the possession and access offences involved discrete criminality and that a degree of partial accumulation of the sentences for these offences would generally be warranted to reflect the totality of that criminality: James v R at [16].
	
	
	However, Mr Gartelmann submitted that the Crown argument that accumulation of the sentences for the access offences was required because they were “rolled up” charges, comprising numerous separate instances and greater criminality than one episode of offending, ought not be accepted. He submitted that any degree of leniency in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion regarding the charge was irrelevant to the determination of sentence. Mr Gartelmann submitted that an appropriate sentence was to be determined for each offence having regard to the entirety of the criminality it comprised, before considering issues of accumulation and concurrency: Pearce v The Queen at [45].
	


Determination


	
	Counsel for the Respondent has conceded, appropriately, that the sentencing Judge did not apply relevant principles concerning concurrency, accumulation and totality in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen.
	
	
	The inference ought to be drawn in this case that the sentencing Judge had determined to proceed by way of an ICO and selected sentences that would achieve that outcome. A court proceeding by way of an ICO must not set a non-parole period for the sentence: s.7(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The sentencing Judge imposed entirely concurrent sentences with two of the sentences occupying the full two-year period, being the jurisdictional limit for use of an ICO.
	
	
	When sentencing for a Commonwealth s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offence and a s.91H(2) offence, it is necessary to keep in mind the different vices to which these provisions are directed: R v Porte at [55]-[56], [157]. I am satisfied that the sentencing Judge erred in principle in his approach to this issue.
	
	
	The Crown has established, as well, that some level of accumulation should have applied in this case. I am satisfied, at the least, that such a level of accumulation would have taken any sentences to be imposed above the jurisdictional limit for the use of an ICO.
	
	
	The use of “rolled up” charges is very common with offences of this type. The sheer number of items, often seen in cases such as this, renders it both practical and sensible to proceed in this way. The sentence or sentences to be imposed for particular offences will reflect the number of images caught by the charge or the length of the period over which accessing has occurred. The larger the number of images, the more serious the offence will be. This is especially so where the number of images is to be measured (as in this case) in the tens-of-thousands. In this way, the charges include more than one episode of criminal conduct which will magnify the objective gravity of the offence: R v Richard at [65](f). Depending upon the circumstances of the case, this may have a bearing, as well, on the issues of accumulation and concurrency.
	
	
	It is not necessary to proceed beyond this point in considering these particulars of the Crown’s ground of appeal. It is sufficient to note that the Crown has demonstrated error on the part of the sentencing Judge in the manner complained of.
	


Fourth Particular - Failure to Have Appropriate Regard to General and Specific Deterrence

Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the imposition of an ICO did not sufficiently meet the needs of general deterrence for this offending. Whilst the sentencing Judge had referred to the need for general deterrence and denunciation in sentencing for these offences, he had determined that an ICO was more appropriate than a sentence involving full-time custody.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge did not articulate in what way an ICO would serve the purpose of general deterrence. Further, he permitted the circumstances personal to the Respondent, in particular his progress in, and need for rehabilitation, to swamp the primacy of general deterrence as a sentencing principle.
	
	
	In addition, it was submitted that the Respondent’s rehabilitation was not so exceptional as to place him in a different category to others with rehabilitative needs sentenced for the same offending.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, given the sentences imposed and the lack of a separate sentence for any of the Commonwealth offences and the failure to order accumulation, the practical effect was that there was no substantial general deterrent effect at all for the offending.
	


The Respondent’s Submissions


	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that the sentencing Judge had noted the need for general and specific deterrence and denunciation, and had noted that the use of an ICO involved a considerable degree of leniency, but nonetheless imposed strict obligations and retained a punitive effect.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225; 82 NSWLR 60 at 84 [107], [109] in support of these propositions.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that, in the event that the overall term had been properly determined to fall at two years or less and that it was open to the sentencing Judge to find that the case was exceptional, the imposition of an ICO may have adequately fulfilled the purposes of punishment, including that of general deterrence.
	


Determination


	
	Reference was made in R v Porte at [59]-[60] (and at [70]-[72] above) to the substantial body of authority which has emphasised that general deterrence and denunciation are paramount considerations on sentencing for child pornography offences. Although the sentencing Judge referred to these factors, the gravamen of the Crown submission is that the sentences actually imposed did not, in truth, give effect to these matters.
	
	
	The offender in R v Porte was in possession of some 34,000 images, and was to be sentenced for one access offence under s.474.19(1)(a)(i) and one count of possession under s.91H(2). The sentencing Judge proceeded by way of entirely concurrent sentences of 18 months’ imprisonment to be served by way of an ICO. In the course of allowing the Crown appeal and resentencing the offender, the Court referred to the sentencing Judge’s use of an ICO at [129]-[132]:
	


“129   This Court has emphasised the significant degree of leniency involved in the use of an ICO as a sentence. Although statements made in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225; 82 NSWLR 60 at 85-87 [112]-[123] (in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and myself) point to the breadth to the concept of rehabilitation, and the capacity of an ICO to operate as a form of punishment, it is necessary not to lose sight of the need for an appropriate level of punishment, in the form of immediate incarceration, in cases of serious child pornography offences such as this. 

130   The decision in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin should not be utilised to pass an entirely inappropriate sentence, which sees an offender such as the Respondent with his magnitude of offending, being dealt with by way of an ICO.

131   To proceed by way of an ICO in this case meant that concepts of general deterrence and denunciation ‘slip through almost without trace’: D’Alessandro at 484 [24].

132   Entirely concurrent sentences of 18 months’ imprisonment for the s.91H(2) and s.474.19 offences disclose error which is magnified by the order that the terms be served by way of ICO. Having regard to the quantity and nature of the images and videos accessed and possessed by the Respondent in this case, the sentences imposed are unjustifiably lenient.”


	
	Similar considerations apply with respect to the use of an ICO in the present case. The imposition of the sentences selected in the present case demonstrated a failure to give effect to the significant need for general deterrence and denunciation on sentence.
	


Fifth Particular - Error in the Approach to the Rehabilitation Prospects of the Respondent

Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge gave undue weight to the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation, and allowed his future rehabilitative needs to eclipse the paramount importance of general deterrence.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the sentencing Judge’s statement that the Respondent had sought therapy and counselling well before he was arrested, and had acknowledged his addiction to child pornography material after his arrest, thereby enabling that treatment to proceed in a more focused and informed basis.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this finding was at odds with the fact that the Respondent was assessed as having a low/medium risk of reoffending. Reference was made to the general conclusions of Dr Nielssen, who opined that whilst the Respondent was at a low risk of reoffending based, inter alia, on the general statistics relating to recidivism amongst child pornography offenders, he was sexually aroused by images of prepubescent boys, had previously destroyed collections of his material, only to start collecting again, and his previous long-term counselling had no effect on his offending behaviour as he continued to offend during the pre-arrest counselling period.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was difficult to conclude, against this background, that the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation could be classified as good, or that specific deterrence carried little or no weight.
	


The Respondent’s Submissions


	
	Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the question of the weight to be given to a particular sentencing consideration, such as prospects of rehabilitation, lies within the discretion of the primary Judge, with the circumstances in which appellate intervention will be justified being narrowly confined: Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 120 at [40]. Mr Gartelmann submitted that, generally, a contention of error in the adequacy of the weight given to a sentencing consideration can only be tested by an examination of the sentence itself: Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220 at [30].
	
	
	Counsel submitted that there is a public interest in not interfering in a process of demonstrated rehabilitation, and that error had not been demonstrated in this respect. In response to the Crown submission concerning the Respondent’s risk of reoffending, Mr Gartelmann pointed to the assessments of low-medium risk, with their being no inconsistency between the evidence and the sentencing Judge’s findings concerning the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Determination


	
	The Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation constituted a significant factor on sentence. However, it was important to have regard to this factor in a way that did not result in a lack of reasonable proportionality in the sentences imposed.
	
	
	A number of the issues arising under this heading were addressed by this Court in R v Porte, in particular at [126]-[128]:
	


“126   The Respondent had a number of factors operating in his favour on the subjective side of the case, including his health. His prior good character was to be afforded limited weight: R v Gent at 40-44 [48]-[69]; D’Alessandro at 483-484 [21] cited at [60] above. Prior good character is not unusual in this area of offending. Positive personal antecedents and a reduced or absent need for personal deterrence are relatively commonplace amongst offenders in possession of child pornography: Hill v State of Western Australia [2009] WASCA 4 at [28]. Significant weight is to be given to general deterrence and correspondingly less weight to matters personal to the offender: Hill v State of Western Australia at [28].

127   The Court must bear in mind the maximum penalties for these respective offences, being imprisonment for 10 years for the State offence and 15 years for the Commonwealth offence. In addition, the repeated statements of Courts throughout Australia with respect to the paramount importance of general deterrence and denunciation must loom large on sentence for these offences (see [60]-[72] above).

128   Steps taken by the Respondent to progress his rehabilitation are important on sentence. However, the sentences actually imposed must be reasonably proportionate to the crimes which the Respondent committed: R v Booth at [47] (cited at [71] above). It is important that the subjective circumstances of an offender not overshadow the objective gravity of the crimes for which sentence is to be passed: R v Dodd at 354.”


	
	I am satisfied that the sentencing Judge approached the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation in this case in an erroneous way, with the consequence that the Respondent’s subjective circumstances were allowed to overshadow the substantial objective gravity of this crimes.
	


Has the Crown Established Manifest Inadequacy in this Case?


	
	The submissions of the parties have been considered under a number of headings concerning the particulars of the Crown’s single ground of appeal - that the sentences in this case were manifestly inadequate. It is appropriate now to turn to that topic.
	
	
	It is not necessary to rehearse the submissions made under the various headings considered so far. The Court may move to consideration of the adequacy of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	The s.91H(2) offence involved possession of a very large number of images which had been stored on various devices at the Respondent’s home. Although it is not possible, on the material before this Court, to quantify with any precision the number of children involved, it can be said that many young boys are depicted in the sample images alone. It may be inferred that the number of children depicted in the Respondent’s substantial holdings of child pornography material far exceed the number in the sample images.
	
	
	The fact that a large number of the images and videos fell within Category 1 on the CETS scale is of limited assistance to the Respondent.
	
	
	Reference was made earlier to the comments of Neave and Kyrou JJA in DPP (Cth) v Zarb (see [85] above). A similar observation may be made concerning the material possessed by the Respondent, with this process being further informed by an examination of the sample images (see [86]-[94] above).
	
	
	The s.474.19(1)(a)(i) offences involved the Respondent accessing material over a period of years. It involved a course of conduct. Although the Respondent used a carriage service to access child pornography material which he then downloaded for possession and subsequent use, it would be wrong to approach sentencing in this case upon the basis that entirely concurrent sentences were appropriate as between the three Commonwealth offences and the State offence. The Commonwealth and State offences overlap, but they are not identical. The first s.474.19(i)(a)(i) offence (in 2005) does not overlap at all with the State offence (see [20]-[21] above.
	
	
	The Respondent gained access to the material through a carriage service. However, he undertook systematic saving of material to various hard drives. It should also be observed that the Respondent deleted previous holdings of child pornography material. It is clear that his accessing of child pornography material between 2005 and 2013 involved far more material than that ultimately found in his possession in August 2013. The different vices to which the offences are directed remain significant: R v Porte at [55]-[56].
	
	
	Application of correct principles with respect to concurrency and accumulation required some measure of accumulation, subject to the application of the totality principle: James v R at [16]; R v Fulop [2009] VSCA 296; 236 FLR 376 at 378-379 [10]-[12].
	
	
	It should be kept in mind that these are not victimless crimes: R v Porte at [68], [70]. Not only are the children involved exploited and degraded by the events depicted in the images. As they grow older, their shame and distress is likely to continue with the knowledge that the material may remain in circulation: R v Porte at [69].
	
	
	I am satisfied that the sentences imposed upon the Respondent, both as to length and the use of an ICO, were manifestly inadequate. The sentencing orders in this case were unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 [25]. I have reached this conclusion having considered all matters relevant to the fixing of sentence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 539 [60]. The only sentences which were reasonably open in the circumstances of this case were full-time sentences of imprisonment.
	
	
	This conclusion is fortified by reference to other sentencing decisions cited in R v Porte at [152]-[153], together with the decision in R v Porte itself.
	


Should the Discretion to Resentence the Respondent be Exercised?


	
	The Crown has established error. It remains incumbent on the Crown to demonstrate that the discretion to resentence the Respondent should be exercised: CMB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 9; 89 ALJR 407 at 415 [33].
	


Evidence and Submissions


	
	Mr Gartelmann read a number of affidavits to be taken into account on the exercise of the residual discretion and resentencing. These were:
	



	
	an affidavit of the Respondent sworn 26 May 2015;
	
	
	an affidavit of the Respondent’s solicitor, David Patrick Zammit, sworn 27 May 2015;
	
	
	an affidavit of Anne Love sworn 26 May 2015.
	



	
	In his affidavit, the Respondent said that he had continued to see his counsellors, Mr Sotheren, Ms Oliver and Ms Grassecker and he was also seeing a psychologist, Mary West, on a monthly basis. Ms West is a psychologist who specialises in treatment of child pornography issues and she has been assisting the Respondent in this respect.
	
	
	The Respondent said that he had been complying with the terms of his ICO. He performs community service knitting dog blankets for 7.5 hours each week or 32 hours each month.
	
	
	The Respondent stated that, when served with the notice of the Crown appeal, he went into a panic and became emotional. He has experienced lack of sleep, recurring nightmares and suicidal thoughts with shortness of breath and other features.
	
	
	The Respondent stated that, since sentencing, he has continued to attend the Erina Community Baptist Church, to which he has been going since 2004. He has a close relationship with Ms Love whom he had met at church in 1997. Ms Love provides support to the Respondent.
	
	
	The Respondent said that he had experienced flashbacks to bullying which he experienced at school, since the Crown appeal had been on foot. He experiences fear at the prospect of going to prison because of his school memories .
	
	
	The Respondent states that he has been “clean” with respect to child pornography since he was sentenced, and has developed coping mechanisms in this regard.
	
	
	The affidavit of Mr Zammit attaches a further report of Ms Oliver dated 12 May 2015, which confirms his ongoing counselling and other aspects referred to in the Respondent’s affidavit. Ms Oliver states that the interruption of the Respondent’s process of counselling may have the effect of inhibiting his progress. A further report of Mr Sotheren dated 19 May 2015 states that the Respondent has begun a well-constructed program of rehabilitation which should be allowed to continue.
	
	
	Mr Zammit’s affidavit annexes a further report of Dr Nielssen dated 17 May 2015. This report was prepared following a telephone interview conducted by Dr Nielssen with the Respondent that day. The Respondent recounted to Dr Nielssen the fears he has with respect to the prospect of imprisonment. Following his telephone consultation with the Respondent, Dr Nielssen stated that the Respondent had an anxiety disorder manifesting in typical panic attacks and catastrophic thinking. He observed that the Respondent seemed to have taken constructive steps towards rehabilitation.
	
	
	In her affidavit, Ms Love stated that she had known the Respondent since 1997, and had developed a close relationship with him since 2001. She recounted signs of stress and anxiety in the Respondent which she had observed since the Crown appeal had been on foot. Ms Love indicated an intention to provide ongoing support and assistance to the Respondent.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann submitted that acute distress and anxiety, suffered by the Respondent as a consequence of the Crown appeal, was relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. He submitted that evidence in the sentencing proceedings confirmed the Respondent’s history of symptoms of depression and anxiety, and that the additional evidence adduced at the hearing of the appeal pointed to the Respondent’s symptoms being exacerbated as a consequence of the appeal.
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann referred to decisions of this Court where discretionary dismissal of a Crown appeal has been considered appropriate where the Respondent has been encouraged to pursue rehabilitation in the community, and having regard to the likely effects of resentencing upon an offender’s rehabilitation: R v Cahill [2015] NSWCCA 53 at [130]-[131]. It was submitted that the Respondent was making continuing progress with his rehabilitation in the community and that the Court should dismiss the Crown appeal.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court should proceed to resentence in this case. There had been no conduct by the Crown contributing to error at first instance, the appeals had been filed expeditiously and the Crown case on appeal did not depart from the case advanced at the sentencing hearing: R v Harris [2015] NSWCCA 81 at [65]-[66].
	
	
	Whilst acknowledging the anxiety affecting the Respondent following the lodging of the Crown appeal, it was submitted that apprehension concerning the prospect of imprisonment was not an uncommon feature of the Crown appeal.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, in all the circumstances of the case, this Court should intervene to resentence the Respondent.
	


Determination


	
	The Crown appeals in this case were filed promptly, with the Respondent being so informed without delay. There is no feature of the conduct of the proceedings in the District Court which operates against the Crown on this issue. At all times, the Crown submitted that a sentence of full-time imprisonment was the only appropriate sentencing option in this case.
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind that clear error has been established in this case through the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences, utilising an ICO which was not reasonably open in the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	The principal factors urged on behalf of the Respondent relate to his subjective circumstances and rehabilitative steps, together with his fears of imprisonment.
	
	
	The Respondent’s offences were of considerable objective gravity. They involved ongoing offending over a significant period of time. Although the Respondent realised he had problems in this area and obtained assistance from counsellors, he withheld information concerning his offending from those counsellors. At the same time, he persisted with his offending.
	
	
	Both the Commonwealth and New South Wales Parliaments have made clear the gravity of child pornography offences, and the expectation that substantial penalties will be imposed in cases of serious offending: R v Porte at [57]-[58]. Courts throughout Australia have emphasised the need for substantial penalties with general deterrence and denunciation being paramount considerations with this class of offending: R v Porte  at [59]-[72]. These aspects should be kept in mind, as well, in considering the exercise of the residual discretion in this case.
	
	
	It is a regrettable, but not uncommon, circumstance that an offender who is at risk of full-time imprisonment as a result of a Crown appeal, experiences significant anxiety at the prospects of imprisonment. The evidence indicates that the Respondent has particular concerns in this respect arising from his own personal background. I keep in mind that Dr Nielssen has diagnosed recently an anxiety disorder in this respect.
	
	
	If the Court moves to resentence the Respondent, these features will be taken into account on resentencing. It is important, however, that the Court approaches this issue upon the basis that it is the responsibility of correctional authorities to house, securely and safely, persons taken into custody. A statutory object contained in s.2A(1)(a) Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) is “ to ensure that those offenders who are required to be held in custody are removed from the general community and placed in a safe, secure and humane environment”.
	
	
	It is the responsibility of the correctional authorities to house offenders in a safe and secure environment, with further protection to be afforded in appropriate cases.
	
	
	The judgment on this Crown appeal will serve to identify principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2]. The judgment will also serve to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice by the intervention of this Court in the case of a manifestly inadequate sentence: Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 306; R v Stoupe [2015] NSWCCA 175 at [115]-[116].
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Court should move to resentence the Respondent in all the circumstances of this case. The sentences imposed at first instance constitute a “substantial wrong” in accordance with House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 506. This Court should intervene to resentence the Respondent.
	


Resentencing the Respondent


	
	Already contained in this judgment is a sufficient narrative of the objective gravity of the Respondent’s offences and his subjective circumstances, including the additional evidence tendered and relied upon in this Court.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the present case, I am satisfied that a greater sentence should be imposed for the s.91H(2) offence which involved possession of a very substantial amount of child abuse material.
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind the fact that there are three offences under s.474.19(1)(a)(i), with the offences up to 2010 carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment, and the later offence bearing the increased maximum penalty of 15 years.
	
	
	I am persuaded that the sentences to be imposed for the three Commonwealth offences should be entirely concurrent. They reflect a course of conduct over a period of years.
	
	
	As mentioned earlier, the Commonwealth and State offences involved different vices. This aspect bears, in particular, upon the issue of accumulation and concurrency as between the Commonwealth offences and the State offence. Further, the first Commonwealth offence (the 2005 offence) does not overlap at all with the State offence.
	
	
	I am satisfied that a measure of accumulation should apply as between the State offence and the Commonwealth offences, with a period of six months to operate in this respect.
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court to adopt the different sentencing regimes applicable under Commonwealth and New South Wales law. Further, where sentences are being imposed for Commonwealth and State offences, it is necessary for the Court to comply with s.19(3) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	In calculating sentences, a 25% discount should be applied for the Respondent’s early plea of guilty to the State offence with a similar allowance being applied to acknowledge his facilitating the course of justice concerning the Commonwealth offences.
	
	
	In determining these sentences, I have taken into account all of the Respondent’s subjective circumstances as mentioned earlier in this judgment. But for these subjective factors, the sentences to be imposed upon the Respondent would have been greater.
	
	
	For the s.91H(2) offence, and taking into account the two offences on the Form 1, a sentence of imprisonment for two years and six months should be fixed. A finding of special circumstances should be made resulting from the level of accumulation to be applied and the Respondent’s health issues and the prospect that imprisonment will be difficult for him. A non-parole period of 15 months should be set.
	
	
	With respect to the Commonwealth offences, the following sentences should apply:
	



	
	for Sequence 11 (the 2005 offence), imprisonment for 15 months;
	
	
	for Sequence 2 (the 2006-2010 offence), imprisonment for 18 months;
	
	
	for Sequence 12 (the 2010-2013 offence), imprisonment for 21 months.
	



	
	As the effective non-parole period to be imposed will attach to the State offence, it is not appropriate to make a recognisance release order with respect to those sentences: s.19AB(3) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	The total effective sentence will comprise a head sentence of three years, with an effective minimum term of one year and nine months. Both periods should date from 6 March 2015, being the date upon which the Respondent commenced to serve the ICO. This approach has been adopted by this Court on successful Crown appeals where an ICO was ordered at first instance: R v Hinchliffe [2013] NSWCCA 327 at 304; R v Porte at [159].
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Crown appeals allowed;
	
	
	Sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court on 27 February 2015 are set aside;
	
	
	In their place,
	



	
	for the offence of accessing child pornography material contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) Criminal Code (Cth) (Sequence 11), the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 15 months commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 June 2016,
	
	
	for the offence of accessing child pornography material contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) (Sequence 2), the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 months commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 September 2016,
	
	
	for the offence of accessing child pornography material contrary to s.474.19(1)(a)(i) (Sequence 12), the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 21 months commencing on 6 March 2015 and expiring on 5 December 2016,
	
	
	for the offence of possession of child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Sequence 1), and taking into account the two offences on the Form 1, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 6 September 2015 and expiring on 5 December 2016, with a balance of term of 15 months commencing on 6 December 2016 and expiring on 5 March 2018.
	



	
	in accordance with s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the Respondent should be released to parole on 5 December 2016.
	



	
	GARLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J, and with his reasons.

2767147,R v Alkanaan [2015] NSWSC 911,"___________________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	Mr Falah Alkanaan has been indicted upon a charge that on 2 February 2013, he did murder Hussain Khanafer at Blackett in New South Wales. To that charge, he pleaded not guilty.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty to another charge which is not directly relevant to the present issue.
	
	
	His co-accused, Mr Ben Toleafoa, has been indicted on a charge of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mr Khanafer. He has pleaded not guilty to that charge. Mr Toleafoa has taken no part in the submissions and argument to which this judgment relates.
	
	
	Mr Alkanaan was indicted at the commencement of his trial on 16 February 2015. Before the jury was empanelled, his counsel made an application pursuant to ss 189 and 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 for an advance ruling on a preliminary question, namely whether the interview conducted on 8 February 2013 at the St George Police Station by Detective Sergeant James McLoughlin and Detective Sergeant Steven Peroni with Mr Alkanaan (“the ERISP”), is admissible in the trial of Mr Alkanaan.
	
	
	There were two bases upon which it was sought to argue that the ERISP was inadmissible. The first basis is that the contents of the ERISP constitute an admission for the purpose of s 84 of the Evidence Act and that such admission or admissions were influenced by threats or conduct of a kind which contravened s 84 of that Act and, accordingly, the ERISP is not admissible. Mr Alkanaan argued that having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made during the course of his ERISP, it would be unfair to use the evidence against him. In this respect he relied upon the provisions of s 90 of the Evidence Act. To like effect, he also relied upon the provisions of s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The second basis upon which counsel for Mr Alkanaan mounted a challenge to the admissibility of the ERISP was directed to whether a detention warrant to extend the time for detention of Mr Alkanaan, issued at 10.40pm on 8 February 2013, was valid. If the warrant was not valid, then it was submitted that the second part of the ERISP ought to be excluded.
	


Voir Dire


	
	In order to determine whether the ERISP was admissible, evidence of Detective Sergeant McLoughlin and the accused, Mr Alkanaan, was taken on the voir dire. It was necessary and convenient to conduct the voir dire in two separate parts.
	
	
	On 16 February 2015, after the completion of the evidence of the first witness, Detective Sergeant McLoughlin, I heard argument about the validity of the extension of the detention warrant. At the conclusion of the argument, I informed the parties that I would not exclude the ERISP, or any part of it, on the basis that the detention warrant was not valid. I indicated that I would deliver my reasons in due course.
	
	
	On 26 February 2015, the hearing of the voir dire resumed. At that time, it was apparent that one police witness, Detective Sergeant Peroni, was medically unfit to give evidence. Accordingly, the Crown closed its case on the voir dire. The accused, Mr Alkanaan, then gave evidence. Submissions were then taken on the remaining issues.
	
	
	On 27 February 2015, I informed the parties that, for reasons which would be delivered, I was satisfied that the admissions made by the accused, Mr Alkanaan, in the ERISP were not influenced by conduct proscribed by s 84 of the Evidence Act. I also informed the parties that I was not persuaded that any other submission of the accused, Mr Alkanaan, ought be upheld so as to preclude the tender of the ERISP.
	
	
	What now follow are my reasons for those rulings.
	


Validity of Detention Warrant


	
	It is necessary to set out some facts which were entirely uncontroversial.
	
	
	The murder with which Mr Alkanaan was charged occurred on 2 February 2013. Mr Alkanaan was arrested at 4.10pm on 8 February 2013, some six days later, at Sydney Domestic Airport, in the process of, whilst disguised and carrying false identification material, boarding a flight to Darwin. Having been arrested, Mr Alkanaan was searched and a number of items removed from him. He was then transported to the St George Police Station at Kogarah.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant McLoughlin and Detective Sergeant Peroni, the principal investigators of the crime, arrived at the St George Police Station at about 5.25pm. Having had an initial conversation with Mr Alkanaan, they took him to an interview facility within the Police Station and at about 7.38pm commenced the ERISP.
	
	
	At 8.33pm the ERISP records Detective Sergeant McLoughlin informing Mr Alkanaan that the interview was being stopped “…for the purposes of applying for an extension warrant”. The interview was resumed at 8.44pm.
	
	
	At 9.37pm Detective Sergeant McLoughlin again suspended the interview saying to Mr Alkanaan:
	


“We’re going to suspend this interview for the purpose of applying for an extension warrant, as I explained to you before. So we’ll do that now.”


	
	The interview resumed at 10.50pm. At that time, Detective Sergeant McLoughlin told Mr Alkanaan this:
	


“Falah, as you are aware, we applied for an extension warrant to an authorised justice and he’s granted a further two hours investigation time.”

Mr Alkanaan indicated that he was aware of that process.


	
	The interview continued until 11.45pm when the questioning by the investigators ceased, and an independent police officer, Sergeant Hodder, was asked to enter the room and make enquiries of Mr Alkanaan as to the process of interview. Ultimately, the independent officer concluded the interview at about 12.05am.
	
	
	It is apparent that Detective Sergeant McLoughlin made an application for a detention warrant on the evening of 8 February 2013. The evidence suggests that he faxed a copy of a written application to the authorised officer. The authorised officer spoke with Detective Sergeant McLoughlin over the telephone. After that, the authorised officer spoke to Mr Alkanaan over the telephone. There is no evidence before me as to the contents of either of these conversations.
	
	
	At 10.40pm, the authorised officer issued a detention warrant that extended the maximum investigation period beyond four hours by an additional two hour period.
	
	
	It will be necessary to refer to the terms of the detention warrant shortly.
	


Relevant Legislation


	
	The legislation relevant to the issue of the detention warrant is the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (“LEPRA”). Part 9 of LEPRA deals with investigations and questioning.
	
	
	The objects of the Part are set out in s 109. They are to provide for the period of time that a person who is under arrest may be lawfully detained by a police officer to enable an investigation of the person’s involvement in the commission of a crime, and to allow for that detention to continue without the necessity to bring the person before a Magistrate without delay. As well the objects provide for the rights of the person so detained.
	
	
	Section 115 of LEPRA provides that the maximum investigation period is four hours unless extended by a detention warrant.
	
	
	The principal sections which deal with detention warrants are to be found in ss 118-120 of LEPRA. They are as follows:
	


“118    Detention warrant to extend investigation period

(1)   A police officer may, before the end of the investigation period, apply to an authorised officer for a warrant to extend the maximum investigation period beyond 4 hours.

(2)    The person to whom an application for a detention warrant relates, or the person’s legal representative, may make representations to the authorised officer about the application.

(3)    The authorised officer may issue a warrant that extends the maximum investigation period by up to 8 hours.

(4)    The maximum investigation period cannot be extended more than once.

(5)    An authorised officer must not issue a warrant to extend the maximum investigation period unless satisfied that:

(a) the investigation is being conducted diligently and without delay, and

(b) a further period of detention of the person to whom the application relates is reasonably necessary to complete the investigation, and

(c) there is no reasonable alternative means of completing the investigation otherwise than by the continued detention of the person, and

(d) circumstances exist in the matter that make it impracticable for the investigation to be completed within the 4-hour period.

(6)    As soon as reasonably practicable after a detention warrant is issued, the custody manager for the person to whom the warrant relates:

(a) must give the person a copy of the warrant, and

(b) must orally inform the person of the nature of the warrant and its effect.

119    Detention warrants

(1)    An application for a detention warrant may be made by the applicant in person or by telephone.

(2)    In any criminal proceedings, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove on the balance of probabilities that the warrant was issued.

(3)    In the case of an application made for a detention warrant by telephone, the applicant for the warrant must, within one day after the day on which the warrant is issued, give or transmit to the authorised officer concerned an affidavit setting out the information on which the application was based that was given to the authorised officer when the application was made.

120    Information in application for detention warrant

(1)    An authorised officer must not issue a detention warrant unless the application for the warrant includes the following information:

(a) the nature of any offence under investigation,

(b) the general nature of the evidence on which the person to whom the application relates was arrested,

(c) what investigation has taken place and what further investigation is proposed,

(d) the reasons for believing that the continued detention of the person is reasonably necessary to complete the investigation,

(e) the extent to which the person is co-operating in the investigation,

(f) if a previous application for the same, or substantially the same, warrant was refused, details of the previous application and of the refusal and any additional information required,

(g) any other information required by the regulations.

(2)    The applicant must provide (either orally or in writing) such further information as the authorised officer requires concerning the grounds on which the detention warrant is being sought.

(3)    Nothing in this section requires an applicant for a detention warrant to disclose the identity of a person from whom information was obtained if the applicant is satisfied that to do so might jeopardise the safety of any person.”


	
	Section 132, which is the final section in Part 9 of LEPRA, enables regulations to be made, but dealing with guidelines to be observed by police officers exercising functions under Part 9 and the keeping of various records relating to detained persons. Section 132 makes no specific reference to the provisions of ss 118-120.
	
	
	Section 238 of LEPRA is the section dealing, generally, with a regulation‑making power. It is in the following form:
	


“238    Regulations

(1)    The Governor may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, for or with respect to any matter that by this Act is required or permitted to be prescribed or that is necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.”


	
	A regulation has been made under LEPRA. Clause 4.3 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 (“the Regulation”) provides that an application for a detention warrant issued under Part 9 of LEPRA is to be made in the form of Part 1 of Form 8 of the prescribed forms.
	
	
	Clause 5(h) of the Regulation provides that a record is to be made by or on behalf of an eligible issuing officer in relation to an application for a detention warrant in accordance with Part 2 of Form 8 of the prescribed forms. Clause 6(1)(e) of the Regulation provides that for the purposes of s 66 of LEPRA, the form for a detention warrant issued under Part 9 of LEPRA is Form 13.
	
	
	It is necessary to refer to s 66 of LEPRA which falls within Part 5, Div 4 of the Act. Section 66 of LEPRA applies to detention warrants issued under Part 9 of LEPRA by virtue of s 59(4) of LEPRA. Regrettably, neither counsel for Mr Alkanaan nor counsel for the Crown drew attention to this provision.
	
	
	Section 66 is in the following form:
	


“66    Form of warrant

(1)    A warrant is to be in the form prescribed by the regulations.

(2)    ...”


	
	The detention warrant that was issued, it is accepted, was in accordance with Form 13 as prescribed by cl 6(1)(e) of the Regulation.
	
	
	It contained the following words of substance:
	


“On 8 February 2013, I, Rory Evans, an authorised officer empowered to issue detention warrants under Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, granted this warrant to extend the maximum investigation period in relation to Falah ALKANAAN of 20 Boldrewood Road, Blackett (detained person) beyond the 4 hours by TWO HOURS ONLY (excluding times that are not to be taken into account under s 117 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act, 2002 from 10.40pm on 8 February 2013.”

Argument as to Invalidity


	
	Counsel for Mr Alkanaan without reference to the relevant statutory provisions, argued that the warrant on its face was defective because, having regard to the provisions of s 118(5)(a)-(d) of LEPRA, the jurisdictional basis upon which the warrant was issued should have been reflected upon the face of the warrant.
	
	
	Counsel argued that s 118(5) of LEPRA sets out the minimum requirements which must be met before the authorised officer can issue a warrant. Accordingly, so the argument proceeded, for a valid warrant to exist, the authorised officer’s satisfaction of each of the matters set out in that sub‑section must be stated on the face of the warrant.
	
	
	Without reference to s 66 of LEPRA, counsel for Mr Alkanaan argued that to the extent that the Regulation provided a form of warrant, and the warrant in fact issued complied with that Regulation, the Regulation was ultra vires because it did not reflect the requirements of the statute.
	
	
	In support of the application, counsel relied upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Tran Nominees Pty Ltd v Scheffler (1986) 42 SASR 361.
	
	
	In that case, Jacobs J, at first instance, held that the warrant on its face failed to disclose compliance with the requirements of the requisite legislation, namely s 52(5) of the Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA), and so determined that the warrant was thereby invalid.
	
	
	Jacobs J said at p.370
	


“Where, however, as in the present case, the statute is silent as to the form of the warrant, what is to appear on the face of the warrant should be determined by reference to the statute itself, and the nature of the warrant. What is necessary in the case of a warrant under a particular statute may not be sufficient in the case of a warrant which confers different powers, or is issued under the authority of a different statute; but the person who is required to submit to the warrant is entitled to know – and therefore the warrant should show on its face – the statutory authority under which it has been issued, and if the issuing officer chooses to recite compliance with the statutory requirements of it issue – even though that may not be a strict requirement of the statute … a recital which can only be construed as non‑compliance must in my opinion invalidate the warrant.”


	
	A more recent, and more relevant, decision is that of the High Court of Australia in Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49; (1997) 192 CLR 69.
	
	
	The issue for consideration by the High Court was whether two warrants issued by judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria pursuant to the Listening Devices Act 1969 (Vic) were valid, in circumstances where the form of warrant referred only to one of the two jurisdictional matters of which a judge had to be satisfied.
	
	
	Toohey J, one of the justices in the majority, concluded that notwithstanding that the subject warrants had been issued by a Supreme Court judge, the act of the judge issuing the warrant was an administrative, and not judicial, act. His Honour then went on to say:
	


“It follows … that there is no bar to collateral review by a trial judge of the validity of a warrant on its face. However, it is not open to the judge to adjudicate on the sufficiency of a warrant whether the issuing authority was in fact satisfied as to any statutory requirements. The first of these propositions must be read subject to what follows later in these reasons as to whether the Act requires that a warrant disclose jurisdiction on its face.”


	
	His Honour turned to the question of whether a warrant must disclose jurisdiction on its face. At p.82, his Honour said:
	


“There are two aspects to the question posed in the heading:

Does the Act provide a code of the matters which a warrant must state on its face?

If the Act does not exclude matters which are required at common law, what are those matters?”


	
	His Honour went on to note that the Act in question did not expressly require that the basis of jurisdiction be disclosed on the face of the warrant. His Honour held that the legislation set out comprehensively all the matters to be stated in a warrant, and there was otherwise no statutory requirement to disclose jurisdiction on the face of the warrant. His Honour held that the omission of one precondition to jurisdiction could not of itself invalidate the warrant.
	
	
	McHugh J at p.108, although inclined to the view that a collateral attack on a warrant may be on a ground broader than a defect appearing on the face of the warrant, expressed the view that the correct principle to be applied was that enunciated by Lord Diplock in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster Ltd [1980] AC 952 at 1008, where his Lordship held that what had to be disclosed upon the face of a search warrant depended upon the true construction of the statute authorising the warrant.
	
	
	After referring to the decision in Tran Nominees, McHugh J said at p.110:
	


“On the other hand, where the statute prescribes the form of warrant, a warrant in this form will be valid even when it does not recite all the jurisdictional conditions: re BX Development Inc and The Queen (1976) 70 DLR (3d) 366 at 372. Similarly, where the legislation specifies what the warrant must contain, nothing more can be required. Thus in Karina Fisheries Pty Ltd v Mitson (1990) 26 FCR 473 at 488, the Full Court of the Federal Court held that the provisions contained in s 71(7) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) exhaustively describe what the warrant must contain.

Against the background of the common law tradition of invalidating warrants, a legislature’s statement as to what a warrant must contain should be regarded as exhaustive. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. No doubt in interpreting legislation the expressio unius est exclusio alterius rule is one to be applied with caution … But given the history of the common law on this subject matter, it seems safe to proceed on the assumption that, when a legislature specifies what must appear in a warrant, it intends its statement to be exhaustive of the matters that the warrant must disclose.”


	
	Gummow J, who was also in the majority, identified a number of relevant principles. He said (at p.118):
	


“Lord Wilberforce pointed out in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster Ltd … that any inquiry into the form of search warrants at common law is of limited assistance where the form of the warrants in question is prescribed by statute. The matter is one of statutory interpretation …, giving proper weight to the precept that a legislative intention to interfere with fundamental rights by the commission of what otherwise would be tortious or criminal acts ‘must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language’.”


	
	His Honour then turned to consider the terms of the enabling statute and said (at p.128):
	


“The matters listed in s 4A(3) and (4) constitute a comprehensive list of the matters that must appear on the face of the warrant for it to be a ‘warrant granted under s 4A’ within the terms of s 4(3) of the Act. The comments of Lord Wilberforce in Rossminster … made in the context of a challenge to search warrants issued under the Taxes Management Act 1970 (UK) are apt: ‘It would be wise to add to [the warrant] a statement of satisfaction on the part of the judicial authority as to the matters on which he must be satisfied that this is not a requirement and its absence does not go to validity.”


	
	At p.130, his Honour doubted the continuing relevance of the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Tran Nominees saying:
	


“However, there is a more significant reason why those decisions do not provide assistance in this appeal. In 1990, after the decisions in Tillett and Tran Nominees, this Court held in Love v Attorney-General (NSW) … that the issue of warrants under legislation such as the act involves an exercise of power which is essentially administrative in nature. Once that is understood, 19th century decisions which proceed on the basis that the issue of warrants is a judicial act, are of limited relevance. The earlier decisions in Tillett and Tran Nominees and the later decision of O’Loughlin J in Karina Fisheries … did not proceed upon a full appreciation of the administrative nature of the activity in question. Distinctions between inferior and superior courts, and presumptions of regularity in relation to the acts of superior courts, but not those of inferior courts, do not assist a case such as the present.

The more appropriate principle is that the validity of an administrative act or decision and the legality of steps take pursuant to it, are presumed valid until the act or decision is set aside in appropriate proceedings …”

Discernment


	
	The warrant in question is clearly issued as an administrative act by an authorised officer. Accordingly, it is presumed to be regular unless the contrary is shown, and it is set aside.
	
	
	In determining this challenge, it is necessary to examine the statute. LEPRA provides specifically in s 66 that the form of the warrant will be as set out in the Regulation. The Regulation provided for the form of the warrant. The warrant complied with the form prescribed by the Regulation. There is thus a code by which LEPRA fully provides for the requisite contents of a warrant.
	
	
	There is therefore no basis for attacking the validity of the warrant issued here for an absence, on its face, of a statement of its jurisdictional basis.
	
	
	It is unsurprising that the Regulation does not require a statement of the jurisdictional basis on the face of the warrant, because the scheme of the records to be kept with respect to the issuing of the warrant provides that all of the matters which are necessary with respect to the appropriate jurisdictional satisfaction are to be stated and preserved in another document. No doubt, if there was a challenge of substance to the administrative act, as McHugh J suggests, that document would be relevant. No such challenge was made here.
	
	
	Even if LEPRA did not create a code which governed the application and the terms of the warrant, I would not be satisfied upon examination of the statute, that it requires a statement of the jurisdictional basis to be made on the face of the warrant. There is nothing in the terms of the statute requiring the warrant to contain such a statement. It is true that the authorised officer must be satisfied of certain matters before issuing the warrant, but as Gummow J noted in Ousley, having regard to the presumption of regularity, the older authorities (including the only one relied upon by the applicant) are of limited assistance in statements with respect to whether jurisdictional facts are required to be stated on the record. There is simply no basis in the interpretation of the statute to require a statement on the face of the warrant of the jurisdictional basis for its issue.
	
	
	Finally, having regard to the fact that the warrant complied with the Regulation, even if I was persuaded that the jurisdictional facts ought be stated on the warrant, and I am not, I would not have been disposed to exercise my discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act to exclude the material.
	
	
	At best, the omission is an unintentional omission of a technical requirement which does not go to the real substance of the nature of what the warrant permitted, namely the extension by two hours of the period of detention.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, this basis for an attack on the validity of the warrant must be dismissed.
	


Voluntariness of ERISP


	
	Counsel for the accused, Mr Alkanaan, alleged that Detective Sergeant McLoughlin confronted the accused and, through a verbal threat to charge his partner with a crime, coerced him into making the interview during which the accused made admissions which formed part of the Crown case against him. Such admissions as were made were recorded on the ERISP.
	
	
	The admissions were said to be constituted by a series of lies told by the accused in relation to the offence of murder, and the circumstances surrounding that offence and his conduct.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused relied upon some or all of the provisions of ss 84, 85, 90 and 138(2) of the Evidence Act as the basis of his challenge to the admissibility of the ERISP.
	
	
	Whilst in some cases, a challenge of this kind to the admissibility of an admission can be confined to the particular admission itself, in this case, because of the more generalised nature of the admissions and the impossibility of separating them out from the balance of the interview, the challenge was made to the entirety of the contents of the ERISP.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Alkanaan accepted that he needed to persuade the Court that, as a matter of fact, the verbal threat upon which he relied was made, as an essential part of the success of his submissions. In submission, counsel for Mr Alkanaan was asked to identify the particular statements made by the police upon which he relied. He did so. He then added:
	


“Now, I have to accept, if your Honour was to not accept those statements were ever made by police, I cannot succeed at all.”


	
	As will become apparent from what follows, I do not accept that the statements identified and relied upon were made by Detective Sergeant McLoughlin. Accordingly, the factual basis relied upon to exclude the ERISP has not been established, and the Crown has persuaded me that the admissions in the ERISP are admissible in the trial.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant McLoughlin gave evidence on the voir dire. In his evidence-in-chief he denied putting any pressure upon Mr Alkanaan to give the answers that he did, namely, those answers in which he denied any involvement in the shooting.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he was asked whether he used words to this effect “Falah, we’ve got you cold”. He denied using those words. He was then asked this question:
	


“Did you say to him you were going to sink him if he didn’t make an interview, and you’d also charge his wife?”

He denied saying any such thing.


	
	It was put to him that this conversation occurred at the St George Police Station at Kogarah, and after he had introduced himself, and Detective Sergeant Peroni, to the accused. It was put that the words were spoken to the accused soon after the accused was asked if he wanted to make a telephone call. Detective Sergeant McLoughlin denied this.
	
	
	For entirely proper reasons, Detective Sergeant Peroni was unable to give evidence. No adverse inference can be drawn against the Crown because of his absence.
	
	
	The accused was called to give evidence on the voir dire on the issue of what was said between the investigating police, Detective Sergeant McLoughlin Detective Sergeant Peroni and himself.
	
	
	His evidence was as follows:
	


“Q   … can you tell us as best you are able to remember, what happened when he came onto the scene.

A   He came on, he said a few things and then he told me I have to make an interview. I said ‘No, I’m not doing no interview. I want to talk no-one. I want to speak to a lawyer’ or something ‘or Legal aid’.

…

Q   I’ll take you to the point when Sergeant McLoughlin came onto the scene. Tell us again what happened when introduced himself to you? What happened after that?

A   All he told me ‘You have to make interview’, I told [him] ‘No, I didn’t do nothing – I don’t have to do nothing’.

Q   ‘You don’t have to do nothing’, is that what you said?

A   Yes.

Q   To Sergeant McLoughlin?

A   Yes.

…

Q   What other words did he say to you and what did you say to him?

A   I told him ‘I need to make a phone call to a lawyer or to Legal Aid first’.

…

Q   What other words were said by Sergeant McLoughlin, and what did he say to you and what did you say to him?

A   After that he said ‘No you have to do interview’. I told him ‘I wish to speak to no-one at the moment’. Then he said ‘I’m going to arrest your missus’ for the same thing I done.

Q   What other words like that did he say to you?

A   ‘I’ve got you cold’.

Q   ‘I’ve got you cold’?

A   Yeh, ‘I’m going to sink you if you don’t’.

Q   ‘If you don’t do’ what?

A   ‘I’m going to sink you’ like ‘If you don’t, like do the interview’.

Q   Did he say any other words of that kind to you before the interview commenced?

A   Yes he did.

Q   What did he say as best you remember?

A   ‘We got you cold. If you don’t make an interview, I’m going to arrest your missus’.

Q   Why did you make the interview after he said those words?

A   So I can help my missus. I was too scared for her.

Q   You agree that in due course you did in fact make an interview?

A   Yes I did.”


	
	In cross-examination, the accused said that he could not remember the custody officer reading out to him his rights, well before the interview, and showing him a document headed “Caution and Summary of Part 9” (“the Caution”).
	
	
	The accused gave quite inconsistent answers on this issue. Initially, he told the Crown prosecutor that after he arrived at the police station, a police officer had read out his rights to him but the police officer did not show him, or give him, any document. Within a few further questions, he denied that anybody at the police station had read his rights out to him and said that the only time that he had heard his rights was when he was arrested at the airport. The arrest occurred before he was taken to the St George Police Station.
	
	
	And then finally, in further cross-examination, the accused said he could not remember whether his rights were read out to him. After giving this answer, the accused again denied that the custody officer had ever told him about his rights, and that the custody officer had not done so at any time before the ERISP commenced.
	
	
	The accused also gave evidence that there was a break during the course of the interview. During the break he was approached by Detective Sergeant McLoughlin and informed that it was necessary for an extension of time for his detention to be obtained so that the interview could be continued. Mr Alkanaan agreed that he was told by Detective Sergeant McLoughlin that he needed to talk to the “judge” about extending the interview. The accused also agreed that he was also told that the “judge” would talk to him about extending the interview. He was then asked this question, and he gave this answer:
	


“Q   You were happy for the interview to be extended weren’t you?

A   Yeh, that’s after what he said to me before the interview so I had to do it.”


	
	I am satisfied that the authorised officer spoke with the accused by telephone about extending the interview, and the accused did not oppose the extension sought by the authorised officer. I am also satisfied that the accused did not mention to the eligible justice any concern which he had about being coerced into participating in the ERISP against his will. I am satisfied of this because the accused himself didn’t suggest that he did, no submission was made that he did, and had such a complaint been made, it would not have been open to the authorised officer to issue the detention warrant.
	
	
	The accused agreed that he did not at any time during the ERISP raise any objection to it being conducted because he felt compelled to undertake it. He agreed that he did not make any reference during the ERISP to the remarks allegedly made by Detective Sergeant McLoughlin. The accused agreed that he did not raise those remarks with anybody at any time prior to the end of the interview at which point Sergeant Hodder, an independent officer, entered the interview room and attempted to ask the accused the standard questions asked at the end of such interviews.
	
	
	The exchange between the accused and Sergeant Hodder at the end of the interview was, relevantly, to the following effect:
	


“Q1205   Have you made this record of interview of your own free will?

A   Not at all.

Q1206   OK.

A   No.

Q1207   Now you just said you didn’t make this record of interview of your own free will.

A   Yes.

Q1208   Do you understand that question?

A   Yes.

Q1209   … So what I’m asking you there is did you come into this room with the police officers and speak to them because you wanted to speak to them?

A   Yeah.

Q1210   Yes, or no?

A   (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

Q1211   You did?

A   Hey? No, I didn’t.

Q1212   OK. Do you understand what I mean by your own free will?

A   - (stutter) – if someone ask you, you can say yes or no.

Q1213   Yes.

A   Yeah.

Q1214   Did --

A   I said No but they said, Oh, no, no, no, it’s the only thing…

Q1215   Did the officers ask you if you wished to participate in an interview?

A   Yeah.

Q1216   Did they, they did?

A   Yeah.

Q1217   OK, then.

A   And, an, and, and then I said no.

Q1218   OK. Did the officers ---

A   …speak to –(inaudible)- one of my family or a lawyer.

Q1219   Just one second. Yeah. Did the officers inform you that you were not obliged to say or do anything unless you wished to, but anything you did say would be recorded on this electronic device?

A   Yeah … but at same time, they forced me.

Q1220   They forced you?

A   Yes, yes, sir.

Q1221   How did they force you?

A   … you go in, or … ---

Q1222   Sorry?

A   … they’re asking me the questions that, that, I don’t know, if they can’t remember yesterday, or today … --

Q1223   That they can’t remember yesterday or today?

A   Yeah. Ask ‘em. Rewind the CD.

Q1224   All right. What I’m more concerned with is the conduct of the interview. I’m not concerned with the contents of the interview. OK? I don’t need to know what questions they’ve asked you. I don’t need to know ---

A   … you ask me question, I gave you answer.

Q1225   OK.

A   That’s fine.

Q1226   Has any threat been held out to you to give the answers provided in this interview?

A   Yeah. Them two.

Q1227   Has any promise been held out to you to give the answers provided in this interview?

A   (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

Q1228   Do you understand that question?

A   Yeah. No.

Q1229   Have they promised you anything in return for your answering questions.

A   No.

Q1230   No. Has any offer of advantage been held out to you to give the answers provided in this record of interview?

A   It’s the same question, isn’t it?

Q1231   It’s similar, but they have offered you any advantage? Have they offered you that you would gain anything by participating in the interview?

A   Yeah.

Q1232   What did they offer you?

A   Hey?

Q1233   What advantage have they offered you? You just said yes. What advantage ---

A.   Protection and that.

Q1234   Sorry?

A   Protection and that.

Q1235   Protection?

A   Yeah.

Q1236   In terms of?

A   … like … they, they will put me somewhere safe.

Q1237   OK. That’s ---

A   OK. And they just walk away, like ---

Q1238   Well, they’ve only walked, they’ve only walked out of the room, so I can ask you these questions without them being here.

A   Yeah. Yeah, I’m not talking to ‘em. That’s it.

Q1239   OK. That’s fine.

A   Yeah, and they told me nothing happens to, to my missus and now my missus got arrested.

…

Q1247   You said, you said to me that there’d been a threat made to you to give the answer that you gave in this interview.

A   Yeah.

Q1248   I’m asking you, what was that threat?

A   … that if I didn’t do it –(stutter)- they’re going to … it’s going to be worser than there is.

Q1249   Yeah. What was the threat? You said there was a threat made.

A   Yeah. Yeah. … if I don’t do the, there interview … that’s why, I said it before, I don’t want to do it. To you.

Q1250   To me?

A   Yeah, and, an … ---

Q1251   At no stage … --

A   -- … cigarette, and that. … just before … ---

Q1252   The cigarette?

A   --- just prior, the cigarette, I, I told ‘em, I don’t want to do it. Cancel it.

Q1253   Cancel the?

A   … the interview, and that.

Q1254   The interview?

A   Yeah.

Q1255   OK. So when the officers said to you they were going to continue the interview, what was your response?

A   … I didn’t want … that’s why, I thought … it’s going to be exactly like the beginning.

Q1256   OK. All right. You’ve lost me a little bit. I want to try and ---

A   … They promised me something and they ---

Q1257   What did they promise you?

A   Hey?

Q1258   What have they promised you?

A   They, they, to be safe … and, and don’t touch, to, to my missus … they charge … to my missus, and I … at the moment.”


	
	At that stage in the interview, Sergeant Hodder left the room and the interview was suspended. He returned to the interview room and attempted to elicit accurately and with specifics what the accused, Mr Alkanaan, was saying about what had been said to him. That task, engaged in patiently by Sergeant Hodder, was largely unsuccessful. When he first asked the accused, Mr Alkanaan, to provide him with specifics, Mr Alkanaan by telling Sergeant Hodder to “forget it”.
	
	
	The following exchange took place, amongst others which were less successful:
	


“Q1311   What I’m saying to you is you’ve said that you were threatened to make, to participate in this interview.

A   Yeh.

Q1312   What I need you to do is explain to me how you were threatened.

A   OK. Ask them, they’re the one …

Q1313   No. You’re, I’m concerned with you, you’re saying you were threatened.

A   Yeh.

Q1314   I need you to explain to me how you were threatened.

A   Can I say it in front of them.

Q1315   No. I just want you to say it to me.

A   … Why not? … Right, I say it in front of them.”


	
	Sergeant Hodder went on to explain that the purpose of his being present in the interview room with the accused without the interviewing police officers was to enable the accused to speak freely with him about anything that was said or done which he thought constituted a threat.
	
	
	The following exchange then took place:
	


“Q1319   What story?

A   Do I need to explain it again?

Q1320   I want you to explain the threat.

A.   Come on mate. Can I go back to my cell?

Q1321   Can you go back to your cell?

A   Yeh.

Q1322   You’re interested in explaining -

A   Yeh. I am. Yeh.

Q1323   OK. Well, if you’re interested in explaining things to me.

A   OK … tomorrow I’ve got to be in court anyway, am I?

…”


	
	It then became apparent that Mr Alkanaan did not wish to speak further with Sergeant Hodder. However, the interview continued, and the following exchange took place:
	


“Q1337   Yeah. But do you wish to speak to me further about those threats?

A   … you told me –(stutter)—they will tell you a question –(stutter)—you told me the answer. That’s it. You, you didn’t tell me to explain it.

Q1338   Well, I’m asking you ---

A   Don’t worry, sir.

Q1339   I’m asking you --

A   Yeah.

Q1340   You’ve said that you were threatened.

A   Yeah.

Q1341   I’m asking you to explain that threat to me.

A   Yeah.

Q1342   I want you to tell me what threats were made.

A   --(stutter)—I don’t talk.

Q1343   Sorry?

A   If I don’t have the interview. I’m going to cop it …

Q1344   What did they say to you?

A   … that if I’m not going to make the interview --

Q1345   Yeah.

A   -- I’m going to cop it.

Q1346   Cop what?

A   Hey?

Q1347   Cop what?

A   … the charges …”


	
	Thereafter the accused, Mr Alkanaan, agreed he had been offered the opportunity to contact a lawyer. He was then asked to tell Sergeant Hodder what promises were made to him. His response to that was “Can I go back to my cell”.
	
	
	A number of things can be observed about this exchange between the accused and Sergeant Hodder. The first is that nowhere does the accused articulate the words and their sequence or coherence upon which he now relies as the basis for his allegation of threat or coercion by Detective Sergeant McLoughlin. The second is that to the extent that he does say anything about such a threat, the words he does use bear little similarity or similar effective meaning to the threat of which he gave evidence to the Court. The third is that the time at which the threat is said to have occurred, i.e. when having a cigarette, which was during a break in the interview, is quite different from that now claimed.
	
	
	A number of contemporaneous documents were tendered during the voir dire. A printed version of the Caution was tendered. On the second page, it had been completed by Sergeant Quinn at 1700 hours on 8 February 2013. The signature of Sergeant Quinn attested to the following:
	


“Acknowledgement

Custody Manager – at 5pm on the 8.2.13 I informed the detained person of the information contained on the front of this form entitled ‘Caution and Summary of Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002’ by reading it to him/her and by giving him/her a copy of this form.”


	
	Sergeant Quinn also noted that Mr Alkanaan (the detained person) had refused to sign an acknowledgement accepting that a copy of the document had been given to him, and that he understood the information that he had been given.
	
	
	That document included the following:
	


“3.   While in police custody, you do not have to say or do anything, but anything you say or do may be used in evidence. Do you understand that?

…

6.   I will help you speak to a lawyer of your choice if you want legal advice, or if you want to ask the lawyer to come here. I will let you do this without being overheard, if I can. If your lawyer comes here, I will allow you to speak to the lawyer in private. Your lawyer may be present during any investigative procedure you participate in, such as an interview or identification parade and give you advice.

…”


	
	The Custody Management Record, which is a document upon which entries are made from time to time for the purpose of noting what occurred with the accused whilst in custody, records that at 16.56 on 8 February 2013, Sergeant Quinn read the Caution to the accused and gave him a copy of it. I accept the accuracy of both the writing on the Caution by Sergeant Quinn, and also the entry in the Custody Management Record. The difference in the recorded time of 16.56 as against 5pm does not cause me to doubt the accuracy of the documents. I am unable to accept Mr Alkanaan’s evidence that he did not have his rights read to him and that he did not receive a copy of the Caution.
	
	
	Similar warnings or cautions to that effect were contained in the opening questions of the ERISP. As well, in the ERISP at Q50, Mr Alkanaan acknowledged that at the time of his arrest at Sydney Airport, the detective who arrested him had given him a caution to the effect that he was not obliged to say or do anything, as anything he said or did would be recorded and might be used in evidence in court. The arresting detective asked him if he understood that, and he acknowledged that he did.
	
	
	A transcript of the ERISP, and the DVD of it, were tendered, and I have carefully watched the DVD. I have the clear impression from watching the DVD that the accused, Mr Alkanaan, freely answered the questions which he was asked, up until a time after 11pm. Around Q940 and following on the ERISP, the accused apparently starts to get annoyed with the questions which he is being asked. In the answer to Q940, he starts to contest the legitimacy of the question with the questioner and starts to suggest that the questioner is setting out to confuse him.
	
	
	The ERISP continues with the interviewing police describing what various witnesses, some named and some not named, had seen and inviting the accused to make a comment with respect to the various versions of the witnesses. During the course of this process, the accused sometimes answers argumentatively, and sometimes poses rhetorical questions.
	
	
	It seems clear on the DVD that as the questioner persists in putting various additional versions, the accused becomes more and more annoyed. A dispute erupts as to whether a question has been asked or something said previously. At Q1079 the accused accuses Detective Sergeant Peroni of confusing him. At Q1094 the accused suggests that the police must be getting a bonus for arresting someone, but they had arrested him incorrectly.
	
	
	By Q1114, it seems that the accused is confronted with the contents of one or more recorded telephone calls in which he was involved. He asks to hear them. He is informed that they are not able to be played but the contents are then described to him. By Q1131, the accused suggests to the interviewing police that they are apparently putting to him material which cannot be correct. By about Q1160 and following, it appears that the accused, Mr Alkanaan, is challenging the police to prove that he is guilty in circumstances where he is asserting his continued innocence. The interview seems then to descend into an argument. The accused, Mr Alkanaan, seems to persist in asking questions of the interviewing police and, at that stage, a decision is made by the interviewing police to terminate the interview and Sergeant Hodder is summoned to the room.
	
	
	Whilst Sergeant Hodder was being summoned, and after the accused was warned that the tapes were still running, the accused said this:
	


“I know. It’s OK. You want to play with my head, that’s why youse two fucking let me get a fucking lawyer or legal aid. It’s going to be a cigarette to shut me up. No way. Why us? Why a person who wants to do shit like that? I wouldn’t do it in front of my fucking mum.”


	
	When Sergeant Hodder enters the room and the accused is informed that he is going to ask some questions about the conduct of the interview, for the first time the accused says this:
	


“All wrong. OK. Youse didn’t let me get a fucking lawyer. OK? Yeh, yeh, yeh he shut me up with a cigarette. OK.”


	
	From this review of the evidence, I have reached the conclusion that I do not accept the evidence of Mr Alkanaan given in this Court on the voir dire, that he was forced by threats made by Detective Sergeant McLoughlin to undertake the ERISP. I do accept the evidence of Detective Sergeant McLoughlin that he made no such threats.
	
	
	There are a number of reasons for this. First, Mr Alkanaan was a thoroughly unimpressive witness. He appeared to me to struggle to give direct answers in cross-examination to straight forward questions in circumstances where he had no difficulty in giving a clear answer to his own counsel as to what the threat was, when giving evidence in chief. His evidence in cross-examination to me was evasive and unconvincing. On the other hand, the evidence of Detective Sergeant McLoughlin was not to be doubted by anything to do with his demeanour or the manner of his answers to questions.
	
	
	Secondly, as the material which has been reviewed demonstrates, the accused was informed on at least two occasions prior to entering the interview room for the ERISP that he was no obliged to say or do anything whilst in custody. He was told that on the first occasion at the airport by the police who arrested him, and I am satisfied that he was told that by the custody manager when he first arrived at the St George Police Station. I am also satisfied that he was given a copy of the Caution shortly after his arrival at the Police Station. I am well satisfied that the accused knew that at all times whilst he was in custody, he did not have to say anything to police or engage in an interview with them. The receipt of that information stands against the probability that he was coerced into giving the interview.
	
	
	Thirdly, I am satisfied that had the threat been made to him, as he now asserts, he had the opportunity to raise that with the authorised officer engaged in the task of considering whether to authorise an extension of the time for his detention by granting a detention warrant. He did not do so. I am satisfied that had he been threatened as he now says, he would have informed the authorised officer of it.
	
	
	Fourthly, I am satisfied that Mr Alkanaan only commenced to make complaints when the ERISP continued to a point where he must have realised that the police had a significant number of accounts which inculpated him in the offence, and in particular, that they had recorded telephone conversations of him speaking to others about the events in question. The police declined to play the recorded telephone conversations to Mr Alkanaan. At that point, it appears that he declined, in effect, to further participate in the interview, and commenced to complain about the conduct of the police.
	
	
	Finally, when invited by Sergeant Hodder, an independent officer, to articulate the basis of his complaints about what had been said to him by Detective Sergeant McLoughlin, the accused did not articulate the words which he now claims were said to him. He commenced to articulate something to a different effect, and when given more than one opportunity, did not articulate what he now says was in fact what occurred.
	
	
	It is the combination of each of these things, but particularly his evidence in Court, which I am unable to accept, which leads me to the firm conclusion that, as a matter of fact, the threat relied upon to justify the ERISP being excluded from evidence did not occur.
	
	
	Thus, there is no factual basis for the exclusion of the ERISP. It is unnecessary to examine the variety of legal bases relied upon, because the essential facts have not been proved.
	
	
	For that reason, there is no basis to conclude that the contents of the ERISP, which are relied upon by the Crown as being admissions against interest, were not voluntary, or that in any way it would be unfair to the accused to admit the ERISP. Accordingly, the ERISP is admissible.
	


Conclusion


	
	Neither of the bases argued by counsel for Mr Alkanaan has succeeded. Accordingly, the ERISP will not be excluded from being tendered by the Crown at the trial.
	
	
	In my view the ERISP is admissible.

		10 July 2015",2015-07-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767161,Huynh v R [2015] NSWCCA 179,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Campbell J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Campbell J.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J:   In the Local Court the applicant pleaded guilty to committing a home invasion type offence in circumstances of aggravation, that is to say, whilst in company with another, contrary to the provisions of s 113(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). On 16th September 2014 he was sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Colefax SC DCJ. Two other offences relating to same incident were taken into account on a Form 1. They were two contraventions of s 58 Crimes Act: one of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, and the other of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty. The principal offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The learned primary judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 3 years and 8 months commencing on 2nd September 2013, when the applicant had been taken into custody, and expiring on 1st May 2017, with an additional term of 1 year and 2 months commencing 2nd May 2017 and expiring on 1st July 2018.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence on two grounds being:
	


Ground 1: his Honour erred in treating the offence as being aggravated due to the complainant suffering “substantial psychological fear”, but in the absence of any evidence to support such a finding; and

Ground 2: in assessing the objective gravity of the offence, his Honour erred in taking into account a purported acquiescence by the applicant in violence being inflicted upon the victim by the co-accused, on the basis that the applicant, himself, possessed a weapon, but in circumstances where there was no evidence the applicant had possessed a weapon.

The nature of the offending


	
	The facts of the offending were the subject of an agreed statement of facts at the proceedings on sentence which, the learned primary judge summarised in his reasons. My summary is derived from his Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	The offending occurred on 2nd September 2013. The victim, Mr Quach, was at home watching television in a family room at the rear of his premises. The only light in the premises was the glow from the television. At about 5 pm, the applicant and his co-offender, who has not been identified, were seen jumping a side fence to gain access to the property’s backyard. A neighbour who saw this called “000” immediately. The security screen-door to the house was unlocked and the wooden back door was open. When Mr Quach heard noise coming from the backyard, he got up to close the back door. As he stood up, he saw the offenders opening, and entering, through the security door. The offenders were unknown to him.
	
	
	The learned primary judge found, in my view, with respect, correctly, that as the offenders entered the premises they must have seen Mr Quach. From this they would have known the house was occupied. Upon entry the applicant commenced to ransack the bedrooms looking for valuable property. The co-offender dealt with Mr Quach by pinning him back to the sofa and holding a knife to his neck. Mr Quach remonstrated with him, and struggled, but the co-offender threatened, more than once, to kill him. Mr Quach attempted to yell for help and the co-offender applied pressure to his throat and smothered his cries with a pillow. Nonetheless, Mr Quach’s cries for help were heard by a neighbour and a second “000” call was made.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence denying that he knew this was going on. Specifically, he denied hearing Mr Quach crying for help (AB p 90.5 – 92.5). He also denied knowing his co-offender was armed with a knife (AB p 122.50 – 123.10). This evidence was rejected by the primary judge.
	
	
	Police responding to the emergency calls disturbed the offenders who took flight down the hallway towards the front door, but it was deadlocked.
	
	
	As his Honour observed, the co-offender “with some presence of mind” pretended to be Mr Quach’s son deflecting attention from himself to the applicant. This “ruse” was effective, not once, but twice. And the co-offender managed to evade the grasp of police twice, making good his escape.
	
	
	Meanwhile, the first police on the scene attempted to arrest the applicant. Initially, he co-operated, but once kneeling on the ground he struggled with the officer who was attempting to get him to put his hands behind his back for handcuffing. He was able to stand up and push the officer in the chest. The police officer unsuccessfully attempted “a leg sweep and arm-bar” to subdue the applicant and bring him to the floor. The result was that both lost their footing. The applicant was able to violently pull away from the officer’s grasp, causing him to fall and slide into a large ceramic statue injuring his leg. These events were the offending on the Form 1.
	
	
	A second officer was able to wrestle the applicant to the ground and restrain him.
	


The applicant’s subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant was born on 2nd August 1985. He was aged 28 at the date of the offence and 29 when he was sentenced. He will soon be 30.
	
	
	He had a difficult and unhappy upbringing as a result of his parents’ separation when he was 5 years of age. He is the second of their four children. His mother formed a new relationship when the applicant was about 8 and he did not settle with his stepfather. At the age of 12 he commenced living with his father and stepmother, but resented his father’s strictness. He was expelled from school and ran away from his father’s home, living on the streets for a short period and then at a friend’s house. A week after he ran away, his father was murdered. He heard of this from his mother. Understandably he was “shocked”.
	
	
	He did not return to school and from about the age of 13 he started abusing cannabis and then heroin to which he became addicted. Later in life he completed the equivalent of Year 10 in custody.
	
	
	As the learned trial judge observed, untreated chronic depression, as diagnosed by Dr Stephen Allnutt in his report of 18th August 2014, dating from around the time of his father’s death, and long-term heroin addiction underpin the applicant’s “deplorable criminal history” (AB p 18).
	
	
	His criminal record commences when he was 14 with a robbery offence followed with a charge of possessing a prohibited drug. Probation orders of 18 months duration were made in respect of each of those matters. At the same time, a control order of three months duration was imposed on him for a later offence of supplying a prohibited drug. This was the first in a series of control orders for various offences including crimes of physical violence, robbery in company and kidnapping. He was involved in that last mentioned offence when he was not yet 16.
	
	
	As an adult, he has been imprisoned for the offence of accessory after the fact to a crime of armed robbery and for the offence of robbery in company. For the robbery offence he received a term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months. His parole expired on 26th March 2012.
	
	
	There are also a number of driving, and drug-possession offences.
	
	
	He has struggled with his addiction, although at times, he has been able to maintain abstinence for significant periods. This background is such that he has rarely held down a job. He worked at one stage in his aunt’s business and at another in a fast food outlet. He has a daughter from a relationship he formed whilst he was still a teenager. At the time of his arrest he had formed a new relationship with a university student. She is hopeful that upon his release the applicant will be able to steer his life in the right direction.
	
	
	He was well supported in court by family and friends. Eight testimonials were received into evidence.
	
	
	As I have said, the applicant pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.
	


The reasons of the primary judge


	
	It is appropriate to focus upon the matters in issue on the appeal. Of them, his Honour said the following ( AB p 14 – 15):
	


…..[ the applicant] said on his oath that he did not hear Mr [Quach] screaming. It may be accepted, given the way the agreed facts were drafted, that [the applicant] was unaware of the presence of any knife on or about the person of [of the co-offender]; and it may be accepted that there was no agreement before they entered the premises that [the applicant] would ransack the premises whilst [the co-offender] dealt with the homeowner ….. But it cannot have been unknown to this offender, whilst he was ransacking Mr [Quach's] house, that some form of violence was being inflicted upon the homeowner. I reject utterly the evidence of this offender that he did not hear Mr [Quach] screaming. I do so because it is quite clear that a neighbour outside the house was able to hear that man's screams for help. Moreover, … the police were swiftly at the premises and came into the house announcing their office. This offender, on his own evidence, said that he was able to hear the police announce their office. It is utterly unbelievable that he could hear the police announce their office and yet not hear the screams of the man who was the lawful occupier of the premises. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the applicant] knew that some violence was being inflicted upon Mr [Quach] and took no step to pull his co-offender off.

So, whilst there may not have been specific knowledge of the existence of a knife, whilst there may not have been an agreement to effect violence upon the householder before he entered the premises, [the applicant] acquiesced in the infliction of violence on the householder.

It is also relevant to record the following passages (AB p 17):

When the police conducted a more detailed search of the premises, they found a set of gloves and a baseball hat in the bedroom. The bedroom had been ransacked. In his evidence [the applicant] said that the gloves and the baseball hat were not his and I find that, together with his evidence about not hearing the homeowner screaming, to be a deliberate lie. There is no evidence at all that [the co-offender] had gone into that room. The only person of the offenders who had gone into that room was [the applicant]. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the gloves and the baseball hat were his.

[The applicant] has been in custody since 2 September 2013. In terms of objective seriousness, I have come to the view that whilst this matter is not at mid-range, it is certainly not at the bottom of the range as was submitted by counsel for the offender. The acquiescence by [the applicant] (being himself in possession of a weapon, ie the baseball bat) in the violence inflicted upon the homeowner means it is slightly below a mid-range offence for an offence of this kind in terms of objective seriousness. [Emphasis added.]

And:

There is no victim impact statement. All that is said is that Mr [Quach] suffered from soreness to the neck. It is regrettable that (yet again) no comprehensive victim impact statement has been obtained from this victim of a serious home invasion crime. Whilst the physical injury to Mr [Quach] may be described in a perfunctory way in the agreed facts, it would no doubt be the case that Mr [Quach] suffered substantial psychological fear as a consequence of this home invasion in his own home. [Emphasis added.]


	
	His Honour found that the offence was committed to fund the applicant’s drug habit which was then costing him $300 to $400 per week, in excess of what he received by way of social security payments.
	
	
	Since his arrest in 2013, in custody, he has received punishment once for possessing a drug and again for failing a prescribed urine test. His Honour found that the applicant had lied in his evidence (see [9] above) and he was not persuaded that the applicant’s expressions of remorse were genuine. The learned primary judge accepted that the applicant “does have prospects of rehabilitation” (AB p 21), but he was not persuaded that a finding of special circumstances was warranted. He considered rehabilitation was more likely to occur in custody, and, given his record, whilst subject to his addiction he was “a threat to community safety”. His Honour placed weight upon the considerations of specific and general deterrence.
	


The Appeal

Ground 1


	
	Mr Lange, who appeared with Ms J Ghabrial for the applicant, argued that the finding of substantial psychological fear engaged s 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which permits a court to take into account as an aggravating factor the circumstance that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial. It was said there was no evidence to support such a finding and reference was made to R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412 at [26] where Hidden J said a finding of substantial emotional harm required evidence that a victim had suffered “an emotional response significantly more deleterious than that which any ordinary person would have when subjected” to the offending.
	
	
	Mr P Ingram SC, for the Crown, argued that the finding of substantial emotional fear made by the learned primary judge was not a finding of emotional harm that was substantial for the purpose of s 21A(1)(g). His Honour did not treat the matter as an aggravating circumstance. All his Honour was really saying, was, in the circumstances agreed, anyone in the position of Mr Quach would have been very afraid and in making such a finding, his Honour was doing no more than drawing permissibly on the general experience of life. From that it was open to conclude that Mr Quach would have been very afraid, or, to put it another way, suffered substantial emotional fear. 
	


Decision


	
	The Crown’s submissions on this point should be accepted. Emotional harm in the context of s 21A(1)(g), qualified by the adjective substantial may be taken to be a reference to an appreciable psychological injury whether permanent or not. It refers to something more than the transient, or temporary, shock or fright that anyone would suffer who felt his or her safety was in peril, but which passes within a relatively short time leaving no lasting ill-effects. His Honour was entitled to make a finding of substantial emotional fear of a transient type leaving no lasting ill-effects from what was agreed about the nature of the offending, informed by the common understanding of life shared by all adults.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 2


	
	Mr Lange argued that the finding that the applicant had armed himself with a baseball bat was a clear error of fact attracting the principles discussed in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. There was no such evidence.
	
	
	The Crown, of course, accepts that there is no evidence of the applicant having a baseball bat, but that this was no more than a slip. The error was not material or dispositive. It was made in the course of the learned primary judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, but his Honour’s conclusion that this offence was slightly below mid-range, was well justified by the other facts found, especially the finding, which did not depend upon this matter, that the applicant had acquiesced in the violence to which Mr Quach was subjected (see AB p 14-5, and [24] above).
	


Decision


	
	I am satisfied that the finding that the applicant was in possession of a weapon was a misapprehension of a material fact engaging the principles established by House v King. I acknowledge the force of the Crown’s submissions that the finding of acquiescence in violence was otherwise very soundly based by reference to the passage I first set out at [24] above. However it cannot be gainsaid that possession of a weapon would be highly material to the question of the objective seriousness of the offending. Given that the error was made by his Honour at a critical point in his evaluation of that matter, it is not possible to conclude that it did not have some bearing upon the decision his Honour actually made.
	
	
	Making every allowance, for the care and clarity with which his Honour’s ex tempore decision was made and expressed, the applicant has made good Ground 2.
	


Is another sentence warranted in law?


	
	As I have found material error, it is necessary for this court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion in order to answer the statutory test posed by s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW): Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601. I think it appropriate to approach the matter by reference to the otherwise unimpeachable findings made by the learned primary judge. These findings were not challenged. As I have concluded that the approach taken to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending was informed by error, assessing that matter on the basis of the other findings made by his Honour including the degree of planning involved, and the acquiescence of the applicant in the infliction of actual violence on the victim, lead me to conclude that the objective seriousness of this offending is somewhat below the mid-range.
	
	
	Moreover, as the Crown submits, the applicant’s subjective case is not very compelling: the offence was committed to fund his drug habit; his criminal history is against leniency; and he is not remorseful.
	
	
	On the other hand, the learned primary judge found that the applicant had prospects of rehabilitation. In the past he has shown an ability to abstain from drug use for extended periods. From the evidence received on the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, it is apparent that the applicant is making good use of his time in custody and he has successfully completed the required safety induction training for the issue of a General Construction Induction Card through the completion of applicable TAFE courses. The expressions of support from family and friends were quite impressive in nature. If the applicant can continue to avail himself of the opportunity in custody to undertake further training and rehabilitation, his prospects of rehabilitation will be somewhat better than the primary judge assessed.
	
	
	In a pre-sentence report received in evidence at first instance the risk of re-offending was rated as “medium/high”. This doubtless relates to the symbiotic relationship between his drug habit and his offending. Continued support from his family and full participation in the programs available to him in custody may improve this poor prognosis.
	
	
	Mr Lange tendered statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales for penalties imposed in the higher courts for this offence of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence under s 113(2). It is, of course, important to bear in mind that the statistics show a range of sentences actually imposed in the past, not the correctness of that range, nor its applicability to a given case: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [59]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54] – [55]. In the present case, it is difficult to derive particular assistance from them given the other offending on the Form 1 to be taken into account. Dealing with those matters on the Form 1 gives the applicant the opportunity to leave custody with a clean slate. However, it is a feature of the Form 1 procedure that a heavier sentence than may have been called for otherwise is justified in respect of the principal offence.
	
	
	In crimes of this type, as well as general and specific deterrence, the sentence imposed needs to incorporate the important factors of condemnation and denunciation.
	
	
	Bearing all of these relevant facts, matters and circumstances in mind, it goes without saying that no other sentence than a term of imprisonment would be justified. Allowing a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s early plea of guilty, I am of the view that the term of imprisonment should be one of 4 years. Like the primary judge, I am not satisfied that the evidence justifies a finding of special circumstances, so that the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term may not be disturbed. Accordingly, I fix a period of 3 years as the non-parole period justice requires the applicant to spend in full time custody before becoming eligible for consideration for release on parole.
	
	
	My orders are:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence passed in the District Court on 16th September 2014 and instead sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 2nd September 2013 and expiring on 1st September 2016, with an additional term of one year commencing on 2nd September 2016 and expiring on 1st September 2017. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 1st September 2016.

2767180,Aldred v Stelcad Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 201,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Emmett JA.
	
	
	EMMETT JA: This appeal is concerned principally with the question of whether the owner of a factory should be held liable for damages suffered by a worker injured in the factory in the course of his employment by the tenant of the factory. The respondent, Stelcad Pty Ltd (Stelcad), owned premises situated at Ingleburn (the Premises). Amerind Pty Ltd (Amerind) was the tenant of the Premises under a lease granted to it by Stelcad on 7 August 2006 (the Lease). The appellant, Mr David Aldred, was injured in the Premises in the course of his employment by Amerind.
	
	
	Mr Aldred sued Stelcad in the District Court of New South Wales, claiming damages on the basis that Stelcad owed him a duty of care, that Stelcad breached that duty and that, as a consequence, he suffered the injury in question. A judge of the District Court (the primary judge) entered a verdict for Stelcad and ordered Mr Aldred to pay Stelcad’s costs of the proceedings. Mr Aldred has now appealed to this Court from the orders of the District Court.
	
	
	As will appear below, the terms of the tenancy between Stelcad and Amerind may have some bearing on whether Stelcad owed a duty to Mr Aldred and the content of that duty. It is therefore desirable to say something about the terms of the Lease before examining the circumstances of Mr Aldred’s injury.
	


The Lease


	
	By the Lease, Stelcad demised the Premises to Amerind for a term of five years commencing on 1 March 2006 and terminating on 28 February 2011. The Premises consisted of the whole of the land known as 5-9 Lancaster Street, Ingleburn, together with all improvements on that land, other than the part of the improvements known as the “Pool Shop”. The Premises included all driveways, internal parking areas, paths and walkways and all of the grounds and gardens up to the boundaries of the land. The building that formed part of the improvements consisted of approximately 10,000 square metres of factory space.
	
	
	The Lease contained a number of provisions that would be regarded as typical for a lease of commercial premises such as the Premises. In particular, it contained a covenant by Amerind to pay rent, with a provision for adjustment of the rent. Amerind was also obliged to pay outgoings in respect of the Premises.
	
	
	Clause 6 of the Lease dealt with the use of the Premises by Amerind. By cl 6.1, Amerind was prohibited, relevantly, from using the Premises otherwise than for the purpose of manufacturing, office administration, sales support and warehousing. By cl 6.5(c), Amerind agreed not to do, or permit to be done, on the Premises anything that, in the reasonable opinion of Stelcad, may become a cause of damage to Stelcad. By cl 6.5(g), Amerind agreed not to do, or permit to be done, anything by which the Premises or any part of the Premises may be damaged or strained or its walls or floors may be caused to sag.
	
	
	Clause 7 of the Lease dealt with maintenance repairs, alterations and additions. By cl 7.1, Amerind agreed to keep the Premises in good repair and, at the expiration or sooner determination of the term of the Lease, to yield up the Premises to Stelcad in good repair. However, under cl 7.2, the obligations of Amerind under cl 7.1 were not to include responsibility for “fair wear and tear”.
	
	
	Two paragraphs of cl 7.4 are relevant:
	


7.4 The Tenant must at the Tenant’s expense:

[…]

(b) immediately make good any damage to any part of the Premises or any part of the Premises caused by the Tenant or by persons under its control;

[…]

(l) keep and maintain all driveways, internal parking areas, paths and walkways in good working condition and repair having regard to their condition at the Commencing Date and fair wear and tear for which the Tenant is not liable.

Further, under cl 7.6:

7.6 The Tenant must immediately give notice to the Landlord of:

(a) any damage to and of any accident or defects in the Premises or in any of the services or other facilities provided by the Landlord in the Premises; and

(b) any circumstance likely to occasion any damage or injury occurring within the Premises.


	
	Clause 17.2 provided that Stelcad was to have “the right (but not the obligation)” to enter upon the Premises with all necessary materials and equipment at all reasonable times. Clause 17.2 also provided that Stelcad was to have “the right (but not the obligation)”, on reasonable notice, to enter and view the state of repair of the Premises, to carry out repairs or other works to the Premises and to execute any work required to remedy a defect that it was Amerind’s duty to repair.
	


Circumstances of Mr Aldred’s Injury


	
	On the Premises, Amerind carried on the business of selling timber veneer products. From August 2006, Amerind employed Mr Aldred as a forklift driver. His duties included preparing orders for delivery, delivering orders and then preparing other orders for delivery.
	
	
	The flooring of the factory part of the Premises was concrete. Mr Aldred described it as “just normal concrete flooring” and said that it “had wear and tear in it”. He said that, while he worked in the Premises in the period up to October 2009, he noticed that the floor was deteriorating. He said that holes started “popping up just through wear and tear” on the joins where the concrete slabs met together. He said that there were “quite a few” holes, about 10 or 15, and that they were located “all over the place”. Mr Aldred could not say when he first saw the floor deteriorating or which area was the first to deteriorate. He said that he reported the deterioration in the floor to his superior at Amerind, but that nothing, to his knowledge, was done to fix the problem.
	
	
	On 20 October 2009, Mr Aldred was at work in the Premises doing “day-to-day stuff”, as he said. He was on a forklift and there was a piece of timber, known as a “glut”, on top of a pack of board on the tines of the forklift. He stopped the forklift to remove the glut so that he could put the pack of board away properly. He stepped down from the forklift with his left foot, which went into a hole in the concrete flooring. He rolled his ankle and fell over onto his back. He suffered injury as a consequence.
	
	
	Mr Aldred said that he took care when alighting from a forklift near an area that had deteriorated. However, he said, on the day in question, his view from the forklift was obstructed. Nonetheless, he agreed in cross-examination that the area where he rolled his ankle was precisely where he put his foot as he stepped off the forklift. He conceded that the hole in the concrete was not obstructed by the forklift, but he said that he was concentrating on putting the stock away. He agreed that he had parked the forklift immediately adjacent to an area that had deteriorated. The following exchange then occurred:
	


Q. You then, it would appear, stepped off the forklift without looking down to where you’re stepping –

A. Yes.


	
	Mr Aldred said that, at the time of his accident, he reported the incident to Mr Robert Belshaw, Amerind’s production manager. Mr Belshaw said that Mr Aldred reported to him that he had twisted his ankle when “stepping off the forklift through a crack in the concrete”. Mr Belshaw completed an incident report form recording that the incident occurred as follows:
	


Stepped off forklift, foot went into crack in concrete, heard crack and fell over, did not see it.

Mr Belshaw went and looked at the place where the accident occurred. He observed that a piece of concrete was missing and that a crack was evident next to the forklift off which Mr Aldred had stepped.


	
	After the incident occurred, Amerind employed a company to fill up holes in the flooring with a product called MagnaPatch. Mr Belshaw said that Amerind employed the same company on other occasions to fill cracks in the concrete. He said that repairs were carried out to three sections of the flooring and that the repairs lasted for 8 to 12 months, but that the patches started to crack and they had to be fixed up again. He said that Stelcad had nothing to do with the repairs. Mr Belshaw agreed that there was a problem with holes continuing to appear in the concrete over the course of Amerind’s occupation of the Premises and that, while things had been done to try to stop the problem, it kept on happening. However, no one to the knowledge of Mr Belshaw spoke to Stelcad about the problem.
	
	
	Mr Neil Adams, an ergonomics and safety management consultant, prepared a report dated 31 May 2013, which was tendered on behalf of Mr Aldred. Mr Adams said that he examined the floor of the Premises in April 2013 and that the depression encountered by Mr Aldred was over 1,300 millimetres long, more than 150 millimetres wide and over 25 millimetres deep. Mr Adams said that there were reasonable means available to control, if not entirely eliminate, the risk of a trip and fall as a result of a worker encountering depressions in the floor of the Premises. He described the possible means as follows:
	



	
	all substantial changes in the level of the concrete could have been repaired, either permanently by removing and reinstalling concrete slabs as appropriate, or temporarily by the use of suitable amounts of materials such as asphalt or concrete;
	
	
	the depressions could have been filled and refilled as required with material that was suitably robust and appropriately flexible, such as asphalt;
	
	
	sheets of steel (or similar material) of suitable thickness could have been screwed down over the depressions; and
	
	
	appropriately contrasting highlighting paint could have been applied to the floor around each of the depressions to render the depressions more visually obvious and to serve as a constant reminder to workers of their presence and potentially hazardous nature.
	


Mr Aldred’s Claims


	
	In his further amended statement of claim filed on 9 July 2013, Mr Aldred alleged that Stelcad was under a duty of care to him, was in breach of that duty, and was negligent. The allegations made in the statement of claim may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	Stelcad is the owner of the Premises, which were leased by Amerind from Stelcad;
	
	
	As at 20 October 2009, Mr Aldred was employed by Amerind to provide warehousing duties using a forklift in the Premises;
	
	
	In the course of his employment, and working under the direction and control of Amerind, Mr Aldred utilised the equipment and system of work provided to him by Amerind;
	
	
	On 20 October 2009, it was necessary for Mr Aldred to climb onto a forklift to move sheets of timber veneer;
	
	
	When he stepped off the forklift onto his left foot, he stepped into a hole in the concrete floor of the Premises and his left ankle rolled;
	
	
	Stelcad was negligent in the following respects:
	



	
	failing to take any, or any adequate, precautions for his safety;
	
	
	putting him in a position of peril;
	
	
	failing to provide him with a proper and safe system of work;
	
	
	failing to carry out any, or any adequate, risk assessment in respect of the task that he was required to undertake on the pitted concrete floor;
	
	
	providing a warehouse floor that was unsafe;
	
	
	failing to investigate and correct numerous depressions in the warehouse floor;
	
	
	failing to repair substantial changes in the floor level, either permanently, by removing and reinstalling concrete slabs as appropriate, or temporarily, by the use of suitable amounts of material such as asphalt or concrete;
	
	
	failing to fill and refill the depressions with appropriate flexible material such as asphalt;
	
	
	failing to place over and screw down sheets of steel or similar material over each of the depressions; and
	
	
	failing to highlight appropriately the depressions by painting around each of them to render them more visually obvious and to serve as a constant reminder to workers of their presence and potentially hazardous nature.
	



	
	In its further amended defence to the further amended statement of claim, filed on 30 January 2014, Stelcad denied that it was negligent. Stelcad also made allegations that may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	By reason of the provisions of s 5B and s 5C of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (the Civil Liability Act), Stelcad was not negligent by or for failing to take precautions against the risk of harm to Mr Aldred;
	
	
	The injury suffered by Mr Aldred was not causally connected to any act or omission of Stelcad within s 5D of the Civil Liability Act;
	
	
	The risk in question was an obvious risk, of which, by the operation of s 5G of the Civil Liability Act, Mr Aldred is presumed to have been aware and Stelcad did not owe to Mr Aldred a duty to warn him of the risk of injury by reason of s 5H of the Civil Liability Act;
	
	
	If Stelcad is liable to Mr Aldred as alleged, he materially contributed to his own injuries and disabilities by reason of his failure to keep a proper lookout.
	



	
	Section 5B(1) of the Civil Liability Act relevantly provides that a person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of harm unless the risk was one of which the person knew or ought to have known, the risk was not insignificant and, in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions. In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against the risk of harm, the court must consider, amongst other things, the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken, the likely seriousness of the harm and the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm.
	
	
	Under s 5D of the Civil Liability Act, a determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises two elements. The first element is that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation). In determining, in an exceptional case, whether negligence that cannot be established is a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court must consider whether or not, and why, responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party. The second element is that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability). For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court must consider whether or not, and why, responsibility of the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.
	
	
	Section 5G of the Civil Liability Act relevantly provides that, in proceedings relating to liability for negligence, a person who suffers harm is presumed to have been aware of the risk of harm if it was an obvious risk, unless the person proves, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she was not aware of the risk. Further, under s 5H, a person does not owe a duty of care to another person to warn of an obvious risk to that other person. Under s 5F, an obvious risk to a person who suffers harm is one that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person. Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge.
	
	
	In addition, Stelcad relied in its defence on s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) (the Compensation Act). Section 151Z(2) relevantly provides that, if in respect of an injury to a worker for which compensation is payable under the Compensation Act, the worker takes proceedings independently of the Compensation Act to recover damages from a person other than the worker’s employer (the third party) and the worker is entitled to take proceedings independently of the Act to recover damages from that employer, then the damages that may be recovered from the third party are to be reduced by the amount by which the contribution which the third party would be entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise exceeds the amount of the contribution recoverable.
	
	
	Stelcad asserted that any damages awarded against it should be reduced by reason of the negligence and breach of duty of care on the part of Amerind in the following respects:
	



	
	the particulars of negligence alleged by Mr Aldred against Stelcad;
	
	
	its servants’ or agents’ negligently or carelessly operating forklifts in and around the Premises, thereby creating damage to the concrete floor, being cracking and damage to the joins between the concrete slabs;
	
	
	failing to repair and maintain the areas of the concrete floor that had developed cracking in circumstances where Amerind knew or ought to have known of the existence of such cracking;
	
	
	failing to devise, implement, maintain and enforce a safe place or safe system of work;
	
	
	failing to highlight the depressions in the floor to render them visually obvious;
	
	
	failing to implement appropriate and ongoing hazard identification and risk assessment processes; and
	
	
	failing to repair or cover the areas of the concrete floor that had developed cracking.
	


The Conclusions of the Primary Judge


	
	The primary judge identified six questions concerning Stelcad’s liability to Mr Aldred that required determination as follows:
	



	
	whether Stelcad, as owner of the Premises, owed Mr Aldred a duty of care;
	
	
	the scope of any such duty of care;
	
	
	whether there was a breach of any relevant duty of care, having regard to the relevant provisions of the Civil Liability Act;
	
	
	whether any such breach was causative of Mr Aldred’s injury;
	
	
	whether Mr Aldred contributed to his own injuries by his own negligence; and
	
	
	whether any deduction was warranted by reason of s 151Z(2) of the Compensation Act in respect of any negligence on the part of Amerind.
	



	
	The first two questions are closely related. Thus, it is necessary to determine not so much whether Stelcad, as the owner of the Premises, owed a duty of care to Mr Aldred, an employee of Amerind, the tenant of the Premises under the Lease, but what the scope of such a duty was.
	
	
	The primary judge found (at [48]) that, when the Lease was granted, Stelcad did not know, nor should it have known, that the concrete flooring of the Premises would become damaged over time by reason of the use by Amerind of forklift trucks within the Premises. There was no challenge by Mr Aldred to those findings.
	
	
	However, as the primary judge observed, the question was whether a duty of care arose because Stelcad subsequently became aware of a problem with the flooring. That depends upon the significance to be given to a handwritten document that was tendered on behalf of Mr Aldred without objection (the April Meeting Notes). The April Meeting Notes, which were produced by Stelcad in response to a subpoena served on behalf of Mr Aldred, appear to be notes made in respect of a meeting held on 27 April 2009. The meeting appears to have been attended by six people, who are identified in the April Meeting Notes as “David, Luke, Lee, John, Joe and GS”. There was no evidence as to the identity of those individuals, although other documents in evidence, which were produced by Stelcad in response to the subpoena, suggest that “Luke” may have had a connection with Amerind.
	
	
	The April Meeting Notes begin as follows:
	


Factory, to [sic] big now – after smaller space

Say 6,000m2?

Stelcad’s other properties (? 5 yrs to purchase? @ C’town)

Lease 3 yrs + ?


	
	They then appear to record the state of repair of the Premises. Thus, they say:
	


Office w/c needs painting

Office already painting by Amerind

Signs ? OK, see council […] may need to pay fees

A/C filters not cleaned […]

Sarking – wind storm

Factory WC – cistern “kicked in” – not cleaned

There are then four items against which the notation “$AMER” appears, as follows:

Damage to cladding increased – need armourguard

or buffers – stop forklifts from hitting walls

Floor – Forks breaking concrete edging

(Luke can’t stop – tried before)

Bottom drive bitumen break up on sides

(due to trucks cutting corners)

Glass P/S just need […] Amerind to fix

That suggests that the author of the April Meeting Notes was listing repairs for which Amerind would be required to bear the cost. There is then a further item as follows:

Rear drive damage – Erosion? B/S Only on

side of bitumen dr. – trucks turning on

bitumen & not concrete causing problems

At the end of the April Meeting Notes, the following appears:

Get prices for Amerind

road works

walls

painting

floors

*Look at rental situation

That also suggests listing of repairs for which Amerind had the responsibility, although Stelcad was to obtain details of the cost of the repairs.


	
	The primary judge found that the April Meeting Notes could not be relied on by Mr Aldred to impute relevant knowledge of a dangerous defect in the Premises to Stelcad. His Honour was not persuaded that, on the basis of the April Meeting Notes alone, Stelcad was aware, or ought to have been aware, of any defect in the flooring of the Premises that might give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury to employees of Amerind, as a tenant using the Premises in the course of their employment, let alone the particular defect giving rise to Mr Aldred’s injury. His Honour found, having considered the terms of the Lease, that Stelcad was not under any relevant duty to take reasonable care to prevent a foreseeable risk of injury to Mr Aldred. His Honour considered that the case as pleaded against Stelcad by Mr Aldred reflected a duty of care owed by an employer/occupier, and not an owner, of the Premises.
	
	
	The primary judge said that his finding that there was no relevant duty of care owed by Stelcad extended to a finding that the scope of any duty that may have been owed by Stelcad to Mr Aldred did not include taking reasonable care to avoid the relevant risk of harm, namely, foreseeable risk that Mr Aldred might injure himself when alighting from a forklift onto the flooring of the Premises, by placing his foot in the defect in the floor. His Honour said that he made that finding because the Premises were factory premises in which Mr Aldred worked on a daily basis. He and Amerind were aware of the irregularities in the flooring caused by the movement of the forklift trucks over sections of the flooring and the gradual deterioration of the concrete at the joins. His Honour found that it was not foreseeable by Stelcad, as owner of the Premises, that Mr Aldred would suffer injury in the way that he did.
	
	
	Further, the primary judge concluded, the likelihood of harm to Mr Aldred was quite remote to Stelcad. His Honour considered that Mr Aldred had not established that the risk of harm was not insignificant. His Honour concluded that, in the circumstances, a reasonable person in Stelcad’s position would not have taken any precautions against such a risk. Therefore, Stelcad could not have been negligent, having regard to the provisions of s 5B of the Civil Liability Act, and no issue of causation could arise to be determined pursuant to s 5D of the Civil Liability Act.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the primary judge found that Mr Aldred did not contribute to his injuries by his own negligence. His Honour found that Mr Aldred’s view of the irregularity in the flooring was obstructed by the load being carried by the forklift and that, when he stepped off the forklift, he was unaware of the defect into which his foot was to be placed. In those circumstances, his Honour would not have made a finding of contributory negligence. There is no challenge to that conclusion by Stelcad.
	
	
	Finally, in relation to liability, the primary judge concluded that, if Mr Aldred had been entitled to succeed against Stelcad in a cause of action in negligence, Stelcad would have been entitled to a complete indemnity from Amerind under s 151Z(2) of the Compensation Act. His Honour considered that Amerind owed Mr Aldred a non-delegable duty of care, which was co-existent with any duty said to be owed to him by Stelcad, as owner of the Premises. His Honour considered that Amerind was clearly negligent in failing to provide a safe system of work for Mr Aldred, in circumstances where the defects had appeared over a period of time prior to his injury and Amerind was clearly aware of the defects. His Honour noted that it was Amerind’s contractual obligation to repair the defects, and that it did so following Mr Aldred’s injury. His Honour held that the terms of the Lease created no contractual obligation on Stelcad to repair the flooring and, therefore, it would have been entitled to a total indemnity from Amerind.
	


The Appeal


	
	By his notice of appeal filed on 29 August 2014, Mr Aldred makes complaint in relation to three areas:
	



	
	the primary judge erred in failing to find that Stelcad owed him a duty of care, in failing to find that Stelcad had notice of the condition of the Premises that caused him harm and in failing to find that Stelcad was in breach of its duty of care;
	
	
	the primary judge erred in finding that Amerind would have been obliged, under s 151Z(2) of the Compensation Act, to indemnify Stelcad if Mr Aldred succeeded against it, and in treating the contractual relationship between Stelcad and Amerind as determinative of the issue of breach as between Mr Aldred and Stelcad; and
	
	
	the primary judge erred in the assessment of damages in that the award for non-economic loss was manifestly inadequate, the allowance for future economic loss did not reflect the likely impact on Mr Aldred of the economic incapacity from which he suffers and his Honour estimated Mr Aldred’s need for domestic assistance and failed to give adequate reasons for the award that he made in that respect.
	



	
	In relation to the first complaint, there was generally no dispute between the parties as to the relevant principles. Rather, the disputation was as to the application of those principles to the facts of the present case. One particular area of dispute was the correctness or otherwise of the primary judge’s reliance on the existence of “dangerous defects” as being essential to a finding of a duty of care of a landlord to a third party (such as Mr Aldred). It is therefore desirable to state some general principles as to the liability of a landlord to entrants on demised premises.
	


Relevant Legal Principles


	
	The duty of care of a landlord is that which arises under the ordinary principles of the law of negligence. That is to say, the duty of a landlord is to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to a person who enters onto the demised premises. The nature and extent of the duty and its practical content in a particular case is governed by the circumstances of the case. [1]  In the absence of a contract supporting a higher duty, the duty of a landlord in relation to the safety of premises does not in general require the landlord to commission experts to inspect premises to look for latent defects. Nor does a landlord have a duty to make premises as safe as reasonable care can make them. In general terms, the duty of a landlord is to be determined by reference to foreseeable risk of harm and what a reasonable person would do in response to that risk. [2] 
	
	
	The nature and scope of the duty that is owed may differ as between landlord and tenant, on the one hand, and landlord and other persons, on the other. The latter is likely to be less stringent than the former. Further, the reasonableness of steps to be taken will be affected by the terms of the lease, including the level at which the rental is pitched, the obligations of the parties allocated inter se and any specification of limited purposes to which the premises may be put. [3] 
	
	
	The primary judge relied on Lapcevic v Collier [2002] NSWCA 300, which applied Jones v Bartlett, for the proposition that:
	


[t]he duty of care of the landlord to the third party is only attracted by the presence of dangerous defects in the sense identified earlier in these reasons. These involve dangers arising not merely from occupation and possession of premises, but from the letting out of premises as safe for the purpose for which they are not safe. What must be involved is a dangerous defect of which the landlord knew or ought to have known. [4]  [emphasis added]

Earlier in Jones v Bartlett, the term “dangerous defect” had been described as follows:

[…] a dangerous defect will, or may, cause injury to persons using the premises in an ordinary way. They are defects in the sense that they are more than dangerous; they are dangerous in a way not expected by their normal use. Many domestic items might be said to be dangerous: gas ovens, caged fans, hard floors, electrical circuits and panes of glass may cause serious or even fatal injuries. However, they are ordinarily only dangerous if misused. They will only be defective if they are dangerous when being used in a regular fashion and ordinarily would not be dangerous when so used. [5] 


	
	However, in Loose Fit v Marshbaum, this Court stated that:
	


Jones v Bartlett does not stand for the proposition that a landlord of commercial premises breaches the duty of care owed to an entrant onto the premises only if the entrant is injured by a “dangerous defect”. […] The questions that have to be addressed are whether there was a foreseeable risk of harm to the entrant and, if so, what (if anything) a reasonable person in the landlord’s position would have done in response to that risk. The existence of a “dangerous defect” might be an important consideration in answering those questions, but it is not necessarily the only decision. In New South Wales it is necessary also to take account of s 5B of the [Civil Liability Act]. [6]  [emphasis added]


	
	Counsel for the respondent sought to contradict the first sentence just quoted on the basis that it was inconsistent with Lapcevic v Collier’s application of Jones v Bartlett. However, Jones v Bartlett did not concern commercial premises. In that case, before the two passages quoted above, was the following comment:
	


This case, like [Northern Sandblasting v Harris], is concerned with a letting for residential purposes. What follows is to be understood with that in mind. That which is required in respect of premises let for commercial or educational or other purposes may well differ, but that is not for decision in this case. [7] 


	
	One difference between residential and commercial premises is that a lessee of the former may have a comparatively limited capacity to rectify defects in the premises. Moreover, because leases of commercial premises encompass a very wide range of situations, from small retail leases to large trading operations, it can be particularly difficult to articulate generalisations about such premises without considering the circumstances of the individual case.
	
	
	The relevant duty is owed not only to tenants but to other entrants on the demised premises. Nevertheless, the duty of the landlord to such other entrants will in many cases be narrower than that owed to them by an occupier of the premises, such as a tenant. As between an occupier-tenant, on the one hand, and the landlord, on the other, of commercial premises, liability for injuries sustained by an entrant onto the demised premises will primarily rest with the occupier-tenant, because the tenant is generally in possession and has control of the demised premises and can determine who enters and under what conditions. However, everything must depend on the particular circumstances of each case. [8] 
	
	
	During the course of argument, counsel for Stelcad agreed that the term “dangerous defects” could be understood as meaning no more than some defect that involves some risk of injury, and therefore can be understood consistently with the reference to “risk” in the Civil Liability Act. Notwithstanding the primary judge’s use of the language of “dangerous defect”, for the reasons that follow, his Honour did not err in concluding that Stelcad did not owe a duty of care to Mr Aldred, and in any event did not err in concluding that any such duty was not breached.
	


Duty of Care and Breach of Duty


	
	Any duty that Stelcad owed to entrants onto the Premises, such as Mr Aldred as an employee of its tenant, Amerind, is to be determined by reference to foreseeable risk of harm and what a reasonable person would do in response to that risk. In the circumstances of the present case, the question is whether there was a basis for concluding that Stelcad was aware, or ought to have been aware, of the deterioration in the concrete flooring of the Premises and any attendant foreseeable risk of harm.
	
	
	Mr Aldred contends that an inference should be drawn from the April Meeting Notes that, by 27 April 2009, Stelcad knew that damage was being done to the flooring of the Premises by forklifts running over it and that the damage was giving rise to a risk of injury to entrants into the Premises. He contends that, in circumstances where Stelcad called no witness to explain the circumstances in which the April Meeting Notes were brought into existence, or to explain the discussions that were recorded in them, such an inference could more readily be drawn. [9]  That inference is based principally on a part of the April Meeting Notes that says:
	


Floor – Forks breaking concrete edging

(Luke can’t stop – tried before)


	
	There are, in effect, two inferences that Mr Aldred seeks to have drawn. The first is that the contents of the April Meeting Notes came to the attention of a relevant employee or officer of Stelcad. That might be shown by demonstrating that one of the persons present at the meeting was the relevant officer or employee of Stelcad. Alternatively, it might be shown that one or other of the persons who attended the meeting had a duty to communicate the information imparted at the meeting to the relevant officer or employee of Stelcad and that there was no reason why that person would not have discharged that duty. The second inference is that the information that was imparted at the meeting recorded in the April Meeting Notes was to the effect that the damage to the flooring that was being caused by forklifts was such as to create a foreseeable risk of injury to persons in the Premises. Mr Aldred says that, if that inference can be drawn, then a duty arose on the part of Stelcad to take steps to obviate the risk.
	
	
	As I have indicated, the primary judge found that there was no defect at the time when the Lease was granted and there was no basis for concluding that Stelcad ought to have been aware of the possibility of deterioration in the flooring by reason of the use of forklifts. The case has been put solely on the basis that the defect developed during the term of the Lease and that Stelcad was aware of the defect, or ought to have been aware of the defect, by reason of the information imparted in the course of the meeting recorded in the April Meeting Notes. That requires a consideration of the terms of the April Meeting Notes, as well as the relationship between Amerind and Stelcad in relation to the Premises, as governed by the terms of the Lease.
	
	
	The provisions of the Lease have some bearing on the issues, in that Mr Aldred relies on the power conferred by cl 17.2 on Stelcad to enter the Premises and carry out repairs for which Amerind was responsible. As indicated above, the extent to which a duty is imposed upon a landlord, and the content of that duty, will be influenced by the terms of the tenancy. Mr Aldred contends that, because Stelcad had the power to enter the Premises and carry out repairs, it was under a duty to him, as an entrant on the Premises, to exercise that power, notwithstanding any breach by Amerind as tenant.
	
	
	The provisions of the Lease to which reference is made above clearly demonstrate that Amerind had a contractual obligation to inform Stelcad of any damage to or defects in the Premises and any circumstances likely to occasion any damage or injury occurring within the Premises (cl 7.6). It is also clear that the alleged defect, consisting of the breaking up of the edges of concrete slabs, was occasioned by the activities of Amerind in driving forklifts on the floor. That gave rise to an obligation on Amerind to repair the damage occasioned by its conduct (cl 7.4).
	
	
	By April 2009, more than three years of the term of the Lease had passed. The commencement of the April Meeting Notes indicates that the likely purpose of the meeting was to investigate the possibility of early termination of the Lease. Thus, they record that Amerind no longer required a space as large as that afforded by the Premises. It appears that there was discussion about the possibility of Amerind’s either buying or acquiring a tenancy of other properties owned by Stelcad. It is in that context that they apparently record work that would be required to reinstate the Premises to their condition at the time of the commencement of the Lease.
	
	
	While the purpose of the meeting in the first place would not be decisive as to whether or not information was conveyed to Stelcad, as landlord, concerning a possible reasonably foreseeable risk of injury, it is relevant to the construction of the document itself. Thus, it is not possible to construe the April Meeting Notes as recording the conveying by Amerind, as tenant, of information about the state and condition of the Premises so as to inform Stelcad of the existence of a possible risk of injury.
	
	
	Clause 7.6 is significant in relation to the April Meeting Notes. Under cl 7.6, as I have said, Amerind was required to give notice to Stelcad of any damage to and of any accident or defects in the Premises and, any circumstances likely to occasion any damage or injury occurring within the Premises. There is no suggestion in the April Meeting Notes that the reference to the breaking of concrete edging was in some way raised in the context of the obligation imposed on Amerind under cl 7.6.
	
	
	The overall thrust of the April Meeting Notes was to record defects for which Amerind bore responsibility under the Lease. Thus, in the light of the provisions summarised above, Amerind was required to keep the Premises in good repair, save for responsibility for “fair wear and tear” (cl 7.2). Further, Amerind had an obligation at its own expense to make good any damage to any part of the Premises caused by it or by persons under its control (cl 7.4). Clearly enough, as I have said, the damage to the flooring was caused by the operation of forklifts by Amerind and its employees.
	
	
	In the hearing of the appeal, Mr Aldred sought to advance a contention that the deterioration in the concrete flooring was “fair wear and tear” within the meaning of cl 7.2. That contention was not advanced before the primary judge. Indeed, counsel for Mr Aldred contended precisely to the contrary. Before the primary judge, Mr Aldred expressly contended that the damage to the flooring of the Premises was not “fair wear and tear”. Rather, he contended that it was in some way a structural defect, such that any obligation to repair it lay with Stelcad. Significantly, there was no suggestion that the damage to the concrete flooring was “fair wear and tear”. A contention was advanced that the primary judge made a finding to that effect. However, his Honour made no such finding. His Honour did no more (at [12]) than refer to the language used by Mr Aldred in evidence that the damage to the concrete resulted from “wear and tear”.
	
	
	There was never an enquiry as to whether or not the damage to the concrete flooring was “fair wear and tear” within the meaning of the Lease. There was certainly no finding by the primary judge that the damage constituted “fair wear and tear” within the meaning of the Lease. It is not now open to Mr Aldred, as he sought to do, to contend that the damage to the concrete edges by reason of the use of forklifts by Amerind was damage for which Stelcad had any responsibility under the Lease.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I do not consider that the April Meeting Notes, even assuming that they came to the attention of the relevant officer or employee of Stelcad, are capable of conveying to that officer or employee information to the effect that there was a foreseeable risk of injury in the Premises, arising from the state and condition of the concrete flooring, such as to attract a duty on the part of Stelcad, as owner and landlord, to take steps to obviate that risk of injury. There is no basis for construing the April Meeting Notes as putting the recipient on notice of enquiry as to whether or not the broken concrete edging might give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury. It is impossible to draw any inference from the evidence as to when the hole in question first appeared. Some six months had elapsed since the time of the meeting in April when Mr Aldred suffered his injury. There is no basis for concluding that Stelcad ought to have been aware of the deterioration in the concrete flooring of the Premises and any attendant foreseeable risk of harm.
	
	
	There was no breach by Stelcad of any duty of care that it owed to Mr Aldred as an entrant on the Premises (even if such a duty was owed). It follows that there was no error on the part of the primary judge in reaching that conclusion. That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.
	


Other Complaints


	
	Having concluded that the first of the three matters of complaint cannot succeed, it is unnecessary to deal with Mr Aldred’s complaints concerning s 151Z of the Compensation Act and the assessment of damages.
	


Conclusion


	
	The appeal must be dismissed with costs.
	
	
	JC CAMPBELL AJA: I agree with Emmett JA.

		17 July 2015",2015-07-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2767190,R v JT [2015] NSWDC 203,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal by the prosecution against sentences imposed on a young person, JT. He committed two very serious offences of robbery in company. It is difficult to tell them apart in seriousness. Despite that, the magistrate imposed a control order consisting of a total term of 14 months with a non-parole period of six months on one offence and community service of 150 hours on the other.
	
	
	I will say immediately having considered this material I am satisfied that the Crown should succeed on its appeal and I should re-sentence JT to sentences which properly reflect the objective gravity of his awful conduct. It is quite easy to determine with some precision exactly what that conduct was because the offences I am about to describe were all committed just outside the Macquarie Fields Police Station and CCTV cameras captured almost everything which occurred.
	
	
	It was at about 3 o’clock one morning when two relatively young men, Stephen Lechner who was 23 and Aiden Lutzo who was 18, decided to go and get some McDonald’s. They walked along the road. Walking in the opposite direction was the respondent to this appeal and four other people of varying ages. Initially it seemed that the groups would pass without incident, but one of the respondent’s friends, Mr Usoalii, approached the two, I will call them “victims” because they were, and asked for cigarettes. Mr Lechner pulled out his cigarettes. By this stage all offenders surrounded the two victims. It seemed, however, that after the cigarettes had been obtained that would be the end of it.
	
	
	This offender, along with others, started to walk away. But one offender, Mr S, put his hand in one of the victims’ pockets and someone said “hand over your stuff”. This caused the respondent and the two people he was with to return back towards the victims. Various of the offenders began going through the pockets of the victims, someone said “take his jacket”, and when there was some slight resistance from the victims a whole lot of violence ensued.
	
	
	Of course in sentencing the offender it is important to take into account not only what he did, which was bad enough, but by participating, as he continued to do, in a joint criminal enterprise involving violence committed by others with whom he was acting he is also criminally responsible for the actions of those others.
	
	
	It is frightening to consider what this violent group of young men did in the early hours of that morning. The Crown tendered the CCTV footage. It was distressing in the extreme to see how human beings can treat other human beings. It was not enough that there were five of them and only two of the others, it was not enough that at least this offender appeared to be significantly larger than the victims, they used their superior numbers to inflict significant injuries upon the victims including, and this is perhaps the worst aspect of what I have to say, kicking an unconscious person in the head whilst he was lying on the ground and then simply walking away leaving him unconscious and, for all the offenders knew, dead in the middle of the road.
	
	
	To emphasise. After Mr Lechner had been subject to a great deal of violence, he ended up on the ground. Mr S, one of the co-offenders, stopped going through his pockets and stomped on his head twice and then kicked him to his head. After that, he went up and himself kicked Mr Lechner in the head and simply walked away.
	
	
	Having inflicted that significant level of violence on one human being, one might have thought that any decent person would pause and reflect on the wrongfulness of what had just occurred. But this offender was not finished. He ran up to the other offender, picked up a beer bottle which happened to be lying nearby and struck Mr Lutzo in the head with it. Fortunately for both Mr Lutzo and the offender the beer bottle did not break, but it was clearly the offender’s intention that this bottle would be used as a very significant weapon.
	
	
	After that occurred Mr Lutzo managed to run away, away from where his unconscious friend was lying on the ground. But he, too, was kicked in the head by Mr S which caused him to fall backwards where he remained unconscious.
	
	
	Fortunately, the offenders had had enough by this stage and they left, leaving two victims, Mr Lutzo and Mr Lechner, lying in the ground unconscious and, for all they knew, dead.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, the injuries were significant. Mr Lechner had a number of injuries, including peri orbital swelling disclosed on a CT brain scan, abrasions, bruising and ongoing neck pain. Mr Lutzo had more significant injuries because his CT scan showed bleeding in the brain which is of obvious seriousness.
	
	
	Despite the difference in injuries, I have decided to impose identical sentences on both matters. The level of violence was the same. It was really an accident that Mr Lechner was not injured as significantly as Mr Lutzo was.
	
	
	The five offenders were arrested fairly soon afterwards. In a recorded interview with police this offender admitted responsibility, said that he had been drinking since six in the afternoon and expressed his remorse when shown the CCTV footage. Somewhat remarkably although the offender was 16 and a half at the time of this offending, he has no criminal history. I say somewhat remarkably because it is unusual for an offender to commit offences of such seriousness as his first offence .
	
	
	The offender was brought up by both parents initially but they separated in 2008 with the offender having minimal contact with his father since then. The offender lives with his mother and his siblings in Canley Heights. He was not exposed to any domestic violence as he grew up, so it could not be said that violence was a way of life for him.
	
	
	A Juvenile Justice report was, of course, prepared. The offender’s mother noted that as this offender became older, he began to ignore her rules and mix with undesirable associates, consume alcohol and use drugs. At one stage he was at high school but often truanted, which led to a number of suspensions. Following a period of custody relating to these offences, he stopped going to school. There were no suggestions while he was at school, however, of any violence or aggression towards staff or other students.
	
	
	The Juvenile Justice report says “a major contributing factor to JT’s offending is his susceptibility towards negative peers”. It is always difficult to determine, when sentencing someone who is said to have mixed with the wrong crowd, who in fact is the “wrong crowd”. Is the offender himself partly responsible for the violent behaviour of his co‑offenders? I will accept, however, the Juvenile Justice report on face value which paints this offender as someone who has been led astray by negative peers. Certainly on the night that these offences were committed the offender’s interaction before the violence ensued was brief and indeed he was walking away when things turned ugly, but once violence did erupt he participated enthusiastically and significantly.
	
	
	I should mention in that light that although he was 16 and a half at the time of his offending, he was the tallest of the offenders; in fact the tallest of the seven people involved. He is a person who looks much older and larger than his years would suggest.
	
	
	I accept that the offender is ashamed of his actions and was shocked at seeing what he did. He claimed that he could not remember too much of the evening because of his intoxication.
	
	
	I am sentencing him as a juvenile and so s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act is important in that I must exercise my functions having regard to the principles set out there. I have re-read them, as I do every time I sentence a juvenile, in order to ensure that I overlook no principle which I must follow.
	
	
	I fully accept that 16 and a half year olds do not think like adults and that rehabilitation of a young person is very important indeed. But I do have to say that you do not have to be terribly mature to know just how wrong it is to kick an unconscious person in the head and to hit someone on the head with a beer bottle and then to walk away leaving both unfortunate victims unconscious in the middle of the road.
	
	
	I take into account of course, in the offender’s favour, that this was clearly unplanned. It seems that someone other than the offender decided to rob both of the victims and resort to violence on the spur of the moment when they saw the two victims in the early hours of the morning. I take into account that the use of the bottle, as I have already mentioned I think, was also a spur of the moment decision by the respondent. He did not have the bottle with him, just saw it in the course of inflicting violence upon one of the victims and decided that he would use it against him.
	
	
	There is a fundamental rule of sentencing which applies, albeit with less force in the case of sentencing a juvenile, and that is that the sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct.
	
	
	I accept that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. I accept that the offender is remorseful and I, of course, take into account his prior good character as well as his early pleas of guilty. But it remains the case that custodial sentences are required for both offences, custodial sentences longer than that imposed by the magistrate on one count alone.
	
	
	The order I therefore make is that I allow the appeal.
	
	
	For the offence consisting of sequence 1, I impose a sentence consisting of a control order containing a non-parole period of nine months to commence from 21 January 2015 and a head sentence of 15 months.
	
	
	For the offence which is sequence 3, I impose a control order consisting of a non-parole period of nine months commencing from 21 April 2015 and a head sentence of 15 months.
	
	
	The overall sentence, thus, consists of a non-parole period of one year commencing from 21 January 2015 and the head sentence of one year six months.
	
	
	The offender will be released to parole on 20 January 2016 and, for more abundant caution, I direct that he serve the entirety of his non‑parole period in juvenile detention. He is to be supervised upon his release from custody.

		18 September 2015",2015-07-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767194,R v Magribi [2015] NSWDC 264,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Many people in this community undergo financial hardship from time to time. Fortunately, very few of them resort to criminal behaviour in order to obtain money in an effort to overcome their financial hardship. The offender is one of those few people who responded to financial difficulty by committing crimes.
	
	
	He committed a break, enter and steal for which he was sentenced and received a small penalty in the Local Court but then he got involved in drug supply. He was detected by the police as a drug supplier, charged and granted bail. Unfortunately, the way he carried out his drug supply business was to obtain drugs on credit, and by the time of his arrest he had accumulated a substantial debt. The people to whom he owed money had threatened him and so when they put a proposition to him that he could work off his debt and get paid $5000 by doing something that was clearly illegal, he decided that it was an appropriate way for him to achieve what he wanted by committing even more criminal offences.
	
	
	The drug supply matter is being dealt with in the Local Court. I have been told that the Magistrate has referred Mr Magribi for assessment as to his suitability to serve the sentence the Magistrate is considering imposing by means of an intensive corrections order. I have ignored that circumstance in coming to the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Magribi for the conduct now being dealt with in the District Court.
	
	
	That conduct is this; having had a proposition put to him in the term I have described, he was given a ticket to fly to South Australia. He did so on 9 October last year. He then went to a branch of the St George Bank and handed over a document known as a third party authorisation form. This falsely purported to be signed by a man named Narus Attalla. The effect of the form was to link the offender’s bank account to the St George account of Mr Attalla. Having done so, the offender left the bank. The conduct I have described thus far is an offence of using a false document to obtain a financial advantage.
	
	
	This was the most important step in the criminal conduct which was designed to get money out of Mr Attalla’s bank account, in effect to steal it. On that same day, $91,000 was transferred via online banking from Mr Attalla’s bank account to the offender’s bank account. This put the sum of $91,000 at the offender’s disposal. Shortly before midday, he went to the Light Gardens branch of the St George bank and transferred $45,000 from his account to the account of a Hyunsook Kim. This is an offence of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	He then withdrew $15,000 in cash and left the bank. This is another offence of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	He then went to an ATM and withdrew $500 in cash. Shortly afterwards there was another transfer via online banking from Mr Attalla’s account to the offender’s bank account which put more money at the disposal of the offender. He then went to the St George bank branch at Edwardstown in South Australia and withdrew a further sum of money in cash, this time $10,000.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards he went to yet another St George bank branch and transferred $40,500 from his account to the account of a Jason Galea. That is another offence of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime. He then took out another $15,000 in cash and left that branch. Once more there was another transfer via online banking from the account of Mr Attalla to the offender’s bank account, this time for $50,600 and shortly afterwards, once more the offender went to a St George bank branch, this time at Unley. On this occasion he transferred $48,000 from his bank account to the bank account of a Jado Ahn.
	
	
	This represents another offence of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime and when I sentence him for that matter he has asked me to take into account three further offences, offences I have already mentioned, which are on the Form 1 attached to that offence.
	
	
	In total, the offender withdrew $40,500 in cash and transferred $133,500 to other recipients. He was detected when, on 13 October 2014, he went to a Westpac Bank in Haymarket. When he went to withdraw money from his own bank account staff were alerted by a warning on the system and they contacted police. Police arrested the offender and took him back to a police station. He initially told police that his phone had been lost and his phone contained his banking details and that he knew nothing about his account being used in the way I have described. Indeed, he said he have never even travelled to South Australia. Police responded by showing him some CCTV footage of the offender committing some of the offences a few days earlier. He then changed his mind and told police that he was responsible for the transfers and withdrawal of the money.
	
	
	He explained the circumstances in which he had committed this offence and told police that he had brought $40,500 in cash with him from Sydney by taping it to his body. He handed over that money to a man he called Mr X, an associate of the person who had earlier been supplying him with drugs for on supply.
	
	
	These offences are very serious. Mr Magribi knew that the people involved in this offending were associates of a drug dealer. He knew that substantial sums of money were involved and he performed many and intrinsic steps as part of his offending conduct. He flew interstate. He presented the false document. He made the transfers. He withdrew cash and then there is a clear indication of the offender’s level of recklessness as to whether these moneys were the proceeds of crime - he taped the cash to his body before flying back to Sydney. On top of all that he was at the time on bail for the supply prohibited drug matter.
	
	
	The offender lives with his parents in Lakemba. There has been some disharmony in the family home at times and indeed he has a troubled relationship with his father which continues. His early years were unremarkable. He told a psychologist that his parents were strict but affectionate people. Although there were many rules at home he considered them reasonable and fair but things started to go downhill when Mr Magribi was around 15 or 16 years of age.
	
	
	Problems developed between he and his father concerning his choice of friends and associates. His father disapproved of them. His father, indeed, asked that he leave home when Mr Magribi was only 16 years of age. He returned a few weeks later but was asked to leave again and so he established his own home. It was in these circumstances that Mr Magribi found himself in the financial difficulties that I mentioned at the outset of these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	He was retrenched from one position and although he tried to get extra work in his other job working in a café, eventually when the café was sold he lost that job as well. He began to eat into his savings although he still had some left when he began to commit criminal offences for financial gain.
	
	
	Mr Magribi gave evidence before me today. His evidence was unusual in the justification he offered for committing criminal offences. He seemed to think that it was understandable that he would resort to criminal offending as a result of difficult financial circumstances and expressed the opinion that at least he did not commit more serious offences such as robbery or offences involving violence. I suppose there is that to be grateful for but he did display a remarkable lack of insight into the consequences of his actions, in particular the consequences for him of his criminal behaviour.
	
	
	Personal deterrence is of much more importance in this sentencing exercise than would ordinarily be the case and I say that even considering the possibility that some of Mr Magribi’s answers were the result of immaturity rather than anything else. Certainly these offences were the sort of offences that were always going to be detected. Mr Magribi did not disguise himself and he used his own bank account but that scarcely makes them any less serious. The sums of money were quite considerable and the loss to either the bank or the person whose bank account it was, would have been considerable if everyone had got away with what they were doing.
	
	
	Mr Magribi pleaded guilty at an early stage and so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been. It is certainly a mitigating feature that at least part of the motivation active upon Mr Magribi when he committed the offences for which I must sentence him was the threat which had been made to him in the event that he did not satisfy the debt he owed. On the other hand, as the Crown pointed out, it was Mr Magribi’s decision alone to put himself in this criminal milieu. He began associating with people who he knew to be involved with drugs. He owed them money, not only because he was arrested, but as he told me because he gambled money away and lost it that way.
	
	
	So although, as I have said, I do regard the circumstance that Mr Magribi was threatened as a mitigating feature, the weight that I would give it is less than would otherwise have been the case because of the circumstances in which the threat was made.
	
	
	I mentioned the need for personal deterrence but general deterrence is also of crucial importance. It is one thing to commit a crime, but it is another thing to be able to benefit from it. What Mr Magribi did was ensure that the proceeds of one crime he committed, using the false document, were available to those above him in the criminal hierarchy through the commission of other crimes.
	
	
	Many people, as I noted at the outset of these remarks on sentence, get into dire financial circumstances, and some - fortunately not many - but some will resort to criminal activity of the kind that I have described in these remarks on sentence. It is important therefore that general deterrence operate to persuade those in the position Mr Magribi found himself to deal with their financial difficulties in some way other than the commission of these types of criminal offences.
	
	
	The submissions made to me today by Mr O’Brien who appears for Mr Magribi focussed, at least in terms of the ultimate outcome, very much on attempting to persuade me that an Intensive Corrections Order should be imposed.
	
	
	I mention only for the purpose of completeness that there might be difficulties faced by the magistrate if I were to impose an Intensive Corrections Order for two years, for example, when the magistrate comes to sentence Mr Magribi for a drug supply matter, but I emphasise that I have put those considerations to one side. They may have been relevant had it been necessary for me to consider the future listing of this matter, but have no other relevance. Ultimately I have to follow the steps that the authorities require of me before I can consider an alternative to full time imprisonment.
	
	
	It was, at least by implication, conceded by Mr O’Brien that a custodial sentence was required. The next step for me is to consider what sentences are appropriate for each of the offences committed by Mr Magribi. I then consider issues of accumulation and totality, and only then do I examine whether alternatives to full time custody are available.
	
	
	Having performed that exercise I have decided that there are no alternatives to full time custody which are available to me. The seriousness of Mr Magribi’s conduct and the number of offences mean that the sentence that I have decided upon is more than two years, and thus no alternatives to full time custody are available.
	
	
	I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Before I announce that, I will indicate the sentences I would have imposed had I not imposed an aggregate sentence. For sequence 1 it would have been 18 months imprisonment. Sequence 2, 12 months imprisonment. Sequence 3, nine months imprisonment. Sequence 6, 12 months imprisonment. Sequence 8, 18 months’ imprisonment, taking into account of course the matters on the Form 1.
	
	
	I will give Mr Magribi credit for two days pre-sentence custody and thus date the sentence I am about to announce from 15 July 2015. I set an aggregate sentence of imprisonment commencing consisting of a non parole period of 15 months, with a head sentence of 30 months. Thus Mr Magribi is to be released to parole on 14 October 2016.
	
	
	Are there any other orders required?
	
	
	I will adjourn the consideration of the question as to an order under s 91(1) of the Victims Right and Support Act.
	
	
	ADJOURNED TO 21 AUGUST 2015

		11 November 2015",2015-07-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767208,BA v R [2015] NSWCCA 189,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


The applicant BA was tried on an indictment containing seven counts:

Count 1: Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 16 years (s 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Act).

Count 2: Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 16 years (s 61M(2)) of the Act.

Count 3: Aggravated act of indecency towards a child under 10 years (s 61O(2)) of the Act.

Count 4: Aggravated act of indecency towards a child under 10 years (s  61O(2)) of the Act.

Count 5: Aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years (s 66A(2)) of the Act.

Count 6: Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 16 years (s 61M(2)) of the Act.

Count 7: Aggravated indecent assault of a child under 16 years (s 61M(2)) of the Act.


	
	The trial took place before Wells SC DCJ and a jury at the Lismore District Court between 8 and 15 October 2013. On 15 October the jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to each of the seven counts on the indictment.
	
	
	On 12 December 2013 the applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 18 months. That sentence was for count 5. The sentences imposed for the other counts were of lesser duration and were subsumed by the sentence for count 5.
	
	
	The Crown appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that the sentence imposed for count 5 was manifestly inadequate. On 30 July 2014 the Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed for count 5 was varied to a total term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of term of 2 years. The term of imprisonment was to commence on 16 October 2013 and expire 14 October 2019, with the applicant being eligible for parole on 15 October 2017 (R v BA [2014] NSWCCA 148 (McCallum J with Gleeson JA and Fullerton J agreeing)).
	
	
	This application is for leave to appeal against the applicant’s conviction on count 5. In order to understand the issues before the Court, it is useful to set out the provisions of s 66A of the Act.
	


“66A    Sexual intercourse - child under 10

(1)    Child under 10

Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is under the age of 10 years is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 25 years.

(2)    Child under 10 - aggravated offence

Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is under the age of 10 years in circumstances of aggravation is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: imprisonment for life.

(3)    In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which:

…

(d)    the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender …”


	
	There was no issue at trial or in the appeal that the child was aged 6 at the time and that she was under the authority of the applicant. The issue in the appeal relates to whether sexual intercourse, as defined, took place.
	
	
	Section 61H of the Act defines “sexual intercourse” as follows:
	


“61H    Definition of “sexual intercourse” and other terms

(1)    For the purposes of this Division, sexual intercourse means:

(a)    sexual connection occasioned by the penetration to any extent of the genitalia (including a surgically constructed vagina) of a female person or the anus of any person by:

(i)    any part of the body of another person, or

(ii)    any object manipulated by another person,

except where the penetration is carried out for proper medical purposes, or

(b)    sexual connection occasioned by the introduction of any part of the penis of a person into the mouth of another person, or

(c)     cunnilingus, or

(d)    the continuation of sexual intercourse as defined in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

…”


	
	The sexual intercourse relied upon by the prosecution at trial was that “an act of cunnilingus” had taken place. The appeal concerns the meaning of “cunnilingus” as defined in s 61H(1)(c) and the reasonableness of the verdict on this basis.
	
	
	The interpretation of “cunnilingus”, which was accepted in the appeal, was that given by McCallum J in the Crown appeal and by Mildren J in R v NLR [2008] NTSC 10; 181 A Crim R 146. In the Crown appeal McCallum J held:
	


“37   … The Crimes Act defines sexual intercourse in several ways. Penetration of the vagina is one form of sexual intercourse, as defined in s 61H(1)(a). Cunnilingus is defined as a separate kind of sexual intercourse, in s 61H(1)(c). It does not entail penetration as an element. The term cunnilingus refers to oral stimulation of the female genitals with the mouth or tongue. Penetration during an act of cunnilingus could be an aggravating factor, but I am unable to accept that the absence of penetration during such an act is a factor which supports an assessment that the conduct falls towards the lower end of the range of seriousness. …”


	
	In R v NLR Mildren J considered the meaning of cunnilingus, which is also defined as sexual intercourse in s 1 of the Criminal Code (NT). His Honour held that because the term was not defined, it should bear its ordinary meaning:
	


“[4]    I have been referred to a number of dictionary definitions of the word. According to Collins English Dictionary, 3rd edn, the definition is “a sexual activity in which the female genitalia are stimulated by the partner’s lips and tongue”. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines it as “stimulation of vulva or clitoris by licking”. The Macquarie Dictionary, 3rd edn, defines it to mean “oral stimulation of the female genitals”. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition is “oral stimulation of the vulva or clitoris”.”


	
	His Honour reviewed the cases and held that the licking or sucking of the vagina or vulva, including the labia majora or clitoris all amounted to cunnilingus and was satisfied that the kissing of the mons pubis involved oral stimulation of the vulva and was also cunnilingus (R v NLR  at [5] – [10]).
	
	
	The grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant are:
	


Ground 1: The verdict on count 5 is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in law in her directions as to what was necessary to satisfy the element of the offence of “sexual intercourse”, to wit, “cunnilingus”.

Ground 3: The trial miscarried on account of the erroneous direction in relation to count 5 given by the trial judge.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	The applicant was the de facto partner of the complainant’s mother. At the time of the offences the complainant was six years old (d.o.b. February 2006) and the applicant and the complainant’s mother had been in a relationship for about two and a half years. They were planning to get married. The complainant referred to the applicant as “daddy”. The applicant resided with the complainant, her mother and their one year old son, M, in East Lismore. The complainant and M each had their own bedroom. The applicant had been diagnosed with agoraphobia and spent most of his time at home.
	
	
	The complainant’s evidence in chief comprised her video recorded interview with police on 2 September 2012 (MFI’s 2 and 4) and some short evidence at trial. The complainant’s evidence was that the incidents occurred “a couple of days ago” on a day “in between Sunday and Saturday” when her mother was out shopping for a new mattress. The complainant was home alone with the applicant and M had been dropped home from day care by the applicant’s mother and was playing in his bedroom.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother, RM, gave evidence that she was out purchasing a new futon mattress on Wednesday 29 August 2012. At about 3pm she travelled alone to Byron Bay for a 4pm appointment to collect the mattress at the futon shop. It was a normal school day and the complainant had caught the bus home from school as she usually did. The school bus normally arrived at the driveway between 3.50pm and 4pm.
	


Count 1


	
	The complainant gave evidence that the incident started in the lounge room when the applicant asked her ‘“Do you want to kiss me on the lips?” and I was not so sure I said “I’m not really sure” and he kissed me on the lips” (Q&A 133). The kiss lasted for “a little bit and I wasn’t really sure” (Q&A 137). The complainant said that this kiss was the first of three kisses on the lips by the applicant.
	


Count 2


	
	The complainant gave evidence that after the first kiss on the lips by the applicant, she went into her bedroom “trying to get away from him” and “trying to get a lay down”, however, the applicant followed her and “kissed me on the lips again” (Q&A 138-143). When the applicant did this, the complainant was “not quite sure” and “really not very, very happy about it” (Q&A 144-145).
	


Count 3


	
	The complainant gave evidence that after the applicant kissed her on the lips for the second time he “took off his shorts and his undies and then I, then he showed it [his penis] to me” (Q&A 154-157). “He showed his penis to me” (Q&A 78) and “I felt disgusting” (Q&A 79). The complainant observed that the applicant’s penis “looked like a big, big bone”; “but it was just a big muscle”; “it looked like, it just looked like a big bone but was it was a big muscle and that’s all I can remember about the penis” (Q&A 158-160). She said that the applicant’s shorts were silver and his underpants were blue. He “took them off totally. He put them on the ground”. The applicant did not remove his shirt (Q&A 161-167).
	
	
	When the applicant exposed his penis to the complainant he told the complainant to “lick it” (Q&A 306). The complainant then said:
	


“A.308   But I didn’t. I wasn’t that sure and he also said “Put your mouth around it” but I didn’t.

Q.309   So lick it and put your mouth around it?

A.   Yeah and I didn’t.

Q.310   And you didn’t?

A.   Yeah.”

Count 4


	
	When the complainant was questioned about being asked by the applicant to lick his penis and put her mouth around it, she gave evidence that the applicant also asked her to lick his bottom.
	


“Q.311   And what, did you tell him that you didn’t want to do it [lick his penis and put her mouth around it]?

A.   Yeah.

Q.312   And what did he say to that?

A.   He said “I’m gonna do it”.

Q.313   He said “I’m gonna do it”?

A.   Mmm.

Q.314   What did he mean by that?

A.   He was wanting to do what he what I just said that he did by … to and he said “do it to me” to put my mouth in and kiss his bum and I said “no way. His butt and his penis” but I didn’t.

Q. 315   Yeah?

A.   Because I didn’t want to and he wanted me to do it.”

Count 5


	
	Earlier in the complainant’s interview the following was said:
	


“Q.78   Yeah. Okay. Now what did he do?

A.   He showed his penis to me.

Q.79   Yeah.

A.   And I felt disgusting.

Q.80   Yeah.

A.   And I was, and then he asked me to actually kiss him on the lips and I was saying, no way.

Q.81   Yeah.

A.   And then he asked me another silly question, show me your bagina.

Q.82   Yeah.

A.   Yeah. And I sort of did.

Q.83   Yeah.

A.   And then I just [demonstrates] felt like that.

Q.84   Yeah.

A.   And I go tried to get away from him.

Q.85   Right.

A.   And then he licked and kissed my bottom.

Q.86   So licked and kissed your bottom?

A.   Mmm, mmm. And that’s all I can remember from last night.”


	
	Later in the interview, the complainant said that after the applicant took his pants off and she saw his penis:
	


“Q.168   Left it on. Okay so, can you tell us in more detail what happened after your dad took his pants off and you saw his penis?

A.   He asked me to take my undies off and I didn’t really want to and then he pulled them down off me, off my feet and, and then he licked it and kissed it.

Q.169   What was it that he licked and kissed?

A.   My bum [count 6].”


	
	The complainant was in her bedroom at the time, standing up near her bed and the applicant was on her bed. The applicant took the complainant’s underpants “right off” as opposed to pulling them down (Q&A 170-182). Later in the interview when the complainant was asked questions in relation to the act of kissing her bottom [count 6], she said that the applicant also kissed her near the “bagina” and used a diagram to clarify what she meant:
	


“Q.287   … So when your daddy kissed you on the bottom, what, did you have your back to him or your front to him?

A.   My back.

Q.288   Your back?

A.   No, my front to him and then he um twisted me round.

Q.289   So what, do you know what this part of your body’s called here? [As he asks the question, the interviewer uncovers a diagram of the front of a girl and points with his pen to the crotch area of the diagram]

A.   Your bagina.

Q.290   Bagina. And did your daddy kiss you anywhere near your bagina? [Interviewer points with his pen to the crotch area of the diagram]

A.   Um, yeah.

Q.291   Yeah.

A.   Yeah he kissed me at first near my bagina.

Q.292   Yeah and anywhere else?

A.   And on the butt as well.

Q.293   And on –

A.   The bagina and the butt.

Q.294   Now can you draw on there where he kissed you on the front?

A.   [Drawing] [The complainant points with the pen to the crotch area of the diagram without touching it and then draws an arrow on the outer right side of the diagram, pointing to the hip]

Q.295   And put a circle round?

A.   In this area [the complainant draws a rectangular shape enclosing an area from across the hips to across the upper thighs].

Q.296   Yeah. Okay. Thank you. All right now when your dad was doing that, kissing around your bum and your vagina, did you say anything to him?

A.   I said “stop” but he didn’t.

Q.297   He didn’t?

A.   Stop when I said stop.”


	
	The diagram of the front of a girl’s body marked by the complainant was tendered at trial as Exhibit 1. After the complainant’s interview had been played for the jury, the complainant was referred by the Crown’s trial advocate to Exhibit 1 during further evidence in chief:
	


“Q. … Do you remember that that is the picture that you drew on when Michael was asking you some questions and he asked you to show, mark on that picture where it was that Daddy [the applicant] was licking you on your front bottom or your vagina?

A. Yes. (T.23.32)

…

Q. … I know it’s a bit embarrassing but what were you showing in the first one where you can see the eyes and the face of the little girl?

A. The front of the little girl.

Q. And where you drew something on it, what were you showing Michael by the bit that you drew?

A. The other place where [the applicant] licked.” (T.24.4)

Count 6


	
	The complainant gave evidence that the applicant “licked and kissed my bottom” (Q&A 85). Having removed the complainant’s underpants:
	


“A.168   … He licked it and kissed it.

Q.169   What was it that he licked and kissed?

A.   My bum.”


	
	Following the complainant’s evidence that the applicant licked and kissed her bottom, the interviewer showed her two diagrams of a girl:
	


“Q.204   … So if I was to show you this picture here [interviewer shows the complainant two diagrams, one of the front of a girl’s body and one of the back of a girl’s body], right and I’ll just let the camera have a look at that, can you tell me what that’s a picture of? [Referring the complainant to the diagram of the front of the body].

A.   A girl.

Q.205   A girl? And what’s that a picture of? [Referring the complainant to the diagram of the back of the body]?

A.   A girl’s bottom.

Q.206   A girl’s back. Okay. So if I was to put those down here [interviewer places both diagrams down side by side in front of the complainant] are you able to draw on there with this pen whereabouts your dad licked you?

A.   [drawing] [on the diagram of the back of a girl’s body, the complainant draws an arrow on the outer right side pointing to the bottom].

Q.207   So you’ve drawn a little arrow pointing to your bottom, so can you put a circle around where you think his tongue touched you?

A.   [Drawing] [The complainant marks the diagram of the back of a girl’s body with a circle around the bottom].”


	
	The diagram of the back of a girl’s body, marked by the complainant, was tendered at the trial as Exhibit 2. After the complainant’s interview had been played for the jury, the complainant was referred by the Crown’s trial advocate to Exhibit 2 during further evidence in chief:
	


“Q. Can I ask you to look at the other picture, the picture that shows the little girl from behind so you can see her bottom?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you also draw something on that picture?

A. Yes.

Q. Is the bit that you drew the bit that’s not quite a circle but it’s like a circle around the girl’s bottom?

A. Yes.

Q. What were you indicating to Michael when you drew that?

A. To show where he licked.

Q. Near your bum or your butt?

A. Mm.” (T.23-24)


	
	The complainant was asked during the interview what the bottom is used for:
	


“Q.284   … Now when you told us about your bottom, what do you use your bottom for?

A.   Um, weeing and pooing.

Q.285   Yeah. Weeing and pooing and what else?

A.   You can birth babies from your bottom.

Q.286   You can birth babies from your bottom and anything else?

A.   Nothing else.”

Count 7


	
	The complainant said that she “quickly put my undies back on” before the applicant “got a chance to actually grab my undies” and ran away from the applicant up the hall. She went into the lounge room to watch some television (Q&A 187-189, 217-218):
	


“A.218   And then I just got away for a while and then he, then he found me and then he wants, wanted to kiss me again and I was not quite sure and I was lying down and he came and kissed me on the lips again.

Q.219   So he wanted to kiss you again on the lips and did he do that?

A.   Yeah.

Q.220   Yeah.

A.   And I was not quite sure and then he did it.

Q.221   Did he say why he wanted to kiss you on the lips?

A.   No.

Q.222   No?

A.   He … “I like you”.

Q.223   He said “I like you”?

A.   He really said that.

Q.224   Did he say anything else?

A.   No.

Q.225   All right. Just “I like you”?

Q.226   So that last kiss was in the lounge-room was it?

A.   Mm.

Q.227   And did anything happen after that?

A.   He wanted to lie down with me and I, and I said I wanted to have, I lay down on my own but he said no and then he laid down with me.

Q.228   Yep. Where was that?

A.   In the lounge room.

Q.229   And where did you lay on the lounge or on the floor or somewhere else?

A.   I lay on the lounge with – there was a big blanket.”


	
	In cross-examination at the trial the complainant agreed that some of the things which she had said to the interviewer were not true. Instances of this were:
	


She told the interviewer that the applicant had asked her to ring a seven year old “boyfriend” of hers, C, to come over and watch what they were doing. She agreed that this was not true.

She told the interviewer that her mother had told her that if she found out that the applicant had kissed her [the complainant] on the lips, that she [the mother] would not marry the applicant and that he would not live with them. At the trial, the complainant agreed that her mother had not said that to her, but that it was something that she had thought of herself, “after the time it happened”.

During the interview when the complainant was asked how she knew that what the applicant had done was bad, when giving her answers the complainant said that her mother had said to her “Don’t ever do it with, with um my husband”. In cross-examination she agreed that her mother did not say those words to her.


	
	It was in that context, that the following questions and answers were given by the complainant in cross-examination:
	


“Q. Why did you tell the police officer in the interview that she said those words to you?

A. I don’t know.

Q. Did you say it because you wanted the police officer to believe you when you said that [the applicant] had licked you on the bum and the vagina?

A. That bit is true.

Q. If it was, why did you say bits that were untrue?

A. I’m not so sure.

Q. I suggest to you you said things that were untrue because when you said [the applicant] licked you on the bum and the vagina that was untrue too, what do you say to that?

A. That’s true.

Q. That is true isn’t it?

A. Mm, that’s a true bit about it.” (T.46.7)


	
	The complainant’s mother in cross-examination said that she had had several conversations with the complainant about “stranger danger” but that she never said to the complainant words to the effect of “don’t ever do it with my husband” or “we might have to move away”.
	
	
	The complainant told the interviewer that when she went to school, she told two friends of hers (MG and JB) what happened:
	


“Q.340   And did you tell them together or separately?

A.   Together.

Q.341   And can you remember what you told them?

A.   What my dad licked me on the bum and, and the bagina.

Q.342   Yes and what did they say?

A.   They won’t tell anybody but ….”

When it was put to the complainant in cross-examination that she did not tell her school friends that “daddy licked you on the bum and the vagina”, the complainant responded “not really”. What she told them was “something bad happened”. The complainant agreed that what she had told the interviewer was not “right” and was a “lie” (T.35.29-36.18).


	
	There was other background evidence in the trial relating to conversations which the applicant had with a male friend and the complainant’s grandmother on the evening of 29 August. They are not relevant to the issues raised in the appeal and it is not necessary to set them out.
	
	
	When the two school friends, MG and JB, gave evidence, their evidence did not include any complaint by the complainant concerning any actions of the applicant.
	
	
	The complainant told the interviewer that the first person she told about what happened with the applicant was her “nanna”. The complainant’s maternal grandmother (MH) gave evidence of what the complainant told her on Saturday 1 September 2012:
	


“Q. Take your time and tell us as best you can what - exactly what it was that she said to you?

A. She said that [the applicant] had kissed her on her bagina and her vagina - she used the word “bagina” instead of vagina.

Q. “Bagina”?

A. “Bagina”.

Q. With a B?

A. With a B. Kissed her on her bagina, licked her on her bottom and sucked his penis. I was very shocked by this --

Q. If I can just stop you. You say that she used the word “bagina”, was that something that you were already familiar with?

A. She often - she - when she talked about that part of her anatomy she always called it a “bagina”, yes.

Q. So it was a word that she had previously used in discussion - in conversation with yourself?

A. Yes.

Q. And you understood by “bagina” that she was talking about her vagina?

A. Yes that’s correct.

Q. Do you remember anything else that she said to you at that time?

A. I asked her to - I said “Can you tell me again what had happened?” So she repeated what had happened again. I said “Are you telling me the truth?” and she said “Yes I am telling you the truth. She then told me that when someone was - sucked someone’s penis then they could not get pregnant.

…

Q. I think you’ve told us already that you asked her on more than one occasion if what she was telling you was the truth?

A. That's right.

Q. On each occasion she said that it was the truth?

A. Yes.

Q. Was that the full extent of the conversation as you recollect it that evening?

A. She did talk about other acts and other things that she had seen or heard on that night, yes.” (T.77.9 – 78.10)


	
	In cross-examination MH said:
	


“Q. Did she say to you that in effect, [the applicant] had made her suck his penis?

A. That’s what she indicated to me yes.

Q. As far as you were concerned, she was telling you that she had sucked his penis?

A. That’s what was indicated yes.” (T.85.2)

MH was taken to the statement which she made to the police on 19 September 2012 which was to similar effect and which included the complainant saying to her “when you suck a penis semen comes out and you can’t get pregnant” (T.86.49).


	
	The Crown did not pursue the response of MH to the last question in her evidence at [36] hereof.
	
	
	Subsequently, defence counsel explored that issue in cross-examination:
	


“Q. Was it about other things that she had seen or heard, other than what she was purporting had happened between her and [the applicant] on the Wednesday afternoon?

A. Yes.

Q. Were these other things sexual things?

A. Yes.

Q. Were they things that had occurred on times other than that Wednesday afternoon?

A. They weren't things that had happened to her, they were things that she was telling me about of a sexual nature.

Q. Did you tell the DOCS or the police about them?

A. No.

Q. Is there any reason why not?

A. I didn’t think it was - it wasn’t relevant to what had happened that night.

Q. Did it involve her saying things similar to the, “if you suck on a penis, semen comes out and you can't get pregnant”, style statements?

A. Not exactly specific, they weren't specific things no.

Q. But it was her talking about sexual matters?

A. Yes it was.

Q. And it had nothing to do with the accused [the applicant]?

A. Not at all.

Q. Were they things that seemed to you to be a bit incredible or a bit upsetting - or what were they?

A. A bit of both - both incredible and upsetting, yes.” (T.91.13)


	
	After the complainant had told her what she said the applicant had done, MH called the DOCS helpline that Saturday night. She was contacted by the police the following morning. Thereafter investigations commenced and statements were taken. The complainant’s mother RM said that the DOCS officers had emphasised to her the importance of validating the complainant by telling her that she believed her. RM agreed that at the time she had considerable difficulty in knowing who to believe and who to support.
	
	
	Ms Morrison, an officer from DOCS, spoke to the applicant on the Sunday afternoon and advised him of what the complainant had said. She made a note of his response at the time as follows:
	


“On Wednesday I was asleep on the lounge. [The complainant] came home and I asked her to put her lunchbox away and change her uniform. She came out and wanted the TV on and asked if we could have a cuddle and we did. We watched TV and I was lying behind her. She reached back to give me a kiss on the cheek and gave it to me on the lips. I told her it was inappropriate. We watched some more TV. She got a snack and sat next to me. She had a dress on and she pulled down her undies and showed me her vagina and asked me to touch it and I told her no for it was inappropriate. She told me it feels good and she told me she likes to touch herself on the vagina because it feels good. I told her it was wrong. I asked her about the lip kissing. She said she kisses Nanna on the lips. I asked if anything else has happened and she told me Nanna has kissed her on the bum and the vagina”. (T.126.1)

THE DEFENCE CASE


	
	The defence case can be briefly stated. This is because it was clearly rejected by the jury and played little part in the appeal. The applicant gave evidence in the trial. The effect of his evidence was largely in accordance with the note made by Ms Morrison. He said that after the complainant had kissed him on the lips, he requested that she kiss him on the cheek and the forehead, but not the lips in future. He said that shortly after that the complainant was lying on the lounge and he asked her to move to a different part of the lounge which she did. As she was sitting, she lifted her legs in the air, pulled her underpants down and “flashed her vagina at me … and said “touch it”” (T.152.34). The complainant said “it feels good to touch myself”. The applicant told the complainant that the way she was behaving was wrong and that she should put her underpants back on.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that the complainant told him that her nanna had kissed her on the lips and “on the bum and on the bagina” (T.153.45 – T.154.9). He said that he had heard the complainant use the word “bagina” to refer to her vagina. He said that the allegations which the complainant made were wholly untrue and that he did not kiss or lick her around the front area of her genitalia in the region of her vagina, or at all.
	
	
	EXTENSION OF TIME
	
	
	Before considering the merits of the appeal, there is a preliminary matter. This involves an extension of time for the applicant to seek leave to appeal against his conviction. There has undoubtedly been a considerable delay between the applicant’s conviction for count 5 on 15 October 2013 and the bringing of this appeal. The circumstances giving rise to the delay are set out in an affidavit of Jasmine Stanton of 13 April 2015 and an affidavit of Peter Allport of the same date. Without going into the detail of those affidavits, it is clear that the applicant sought to appeal against his conviction at an early point in time but because of circumstances for which he was not responsible, that did not take place.
	
	
	Since the delay which has occurred has not been due to fault on the part of the applicant, I would grant an extension of time to enable the applicant to seek leave to appeal against his conviction for the offence in count 5.
	


Ground 1: The verdict on count 5 is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.


	
	The applicant submitted that in order for count 5 to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied that he had kissed or licked the complainant’s vagina. It was not sufficient for the jury to be satisfied that he had kissed or licked the complainant’s “bagina”, given the diagram which was Exhibit 1, or “near my bagina”. He submitted that it was significant that at no time did the complainant in terms, or otherwise, say that he had “licked” her “bagina”. The use of the word “licked” was restricted to her “bum” or “butt”. The only exception was at Q&A.341, which concerned whether the complainant had made any complaint to her school friends:
	


“Q.341   And can you remember what you told them?

A.   What my dad licked me on the bum and, and the bagina.”

He submitted that this evidence was given in summary form, referred specifically to “licked me on the bum” before any reference was made to the “bagina”, and was not supported by the evidence of the two school friends when they made statements and gave evidence.


	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence could not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had been kissed on the genitalia. Even if one were to accept that the complainant was kissed in the area marked on Exhibit 1, the most that this could prove was the possibility of an indecent assault although such was neither charged nor alleged as an alternative to count 5 at trial.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the act alleged by the complainant of kissing her “near my bagina” could not amount to cunnilingus. The allegation depended on what the complainant meant by “near my bagina”. The complainant was never asked to explain what she meant when she used that phrase. When asked in her recorded interview “where he kissed you on the front” (Q&A. 294) the result was the drawing firstly of an arrow, which pointed to a location other than the vagina, and the drawing of a rectangle (Exhibit 1) while saying “in this area”. The area of anatomy within the rectangle extended from the waist to the upper thighs. On the basis of that material, the applicant submitted that cunnilingus did not extend to a kissing or licking of the upper legs, upper or inner thighs, or the area indicated by the arrow. He submitted that proof of kissing “near to” or even “on” or “in” this area (which was large and extended beyond the area to which the definition of cunnilingus applied), could not sustain proof beyond reasonable doubt of an offence under s 66A(2) of the Act.
	
	
	In making that submission the applicant accepted that this point had not been taken at trial. Although her Honour had dealt with the issue in her directions to the jury, it had not been a matter specifically raised by defence counsel. The applicant accepted that the primary issue argued for the defence at trial was whether the charged events had occurred at all, not whether count 5 was capable of being established on the evidence.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that for this point to be argued, he required leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The applicant submitted that leave should be granted by the Court in this case because the failure to raise this issue at trial had resulted in a miscarriage of justice (R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20 at [20]; 62 NSWLR 346; Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]; R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; 64 NSWLR 527 at [99]).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s submissions failed to acknowledge that the vagina was one part of the female genitalia and that kissing near the vagina could also be on the genitalia. It submitted that her Honour’s directions were clear about what matters the jury had to be satisfied and that the jury’s verdict meant that they were so satisfied. The Crown submitted that experienced trial counsel did not take this point from which it could be inferred that he was satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support count 5 provided the jury were satisfied that the events had occurred as described by the complainant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence to establish count 5 was that of the complainant being her interview and further examination and cross-examination at the trial, together with the complaint made to MH and the surrounding circumstances immediately before and after the acts relied upon for count 5. By reference to that last consideration, the Crown relied upon the fact that counts 1 – 4 and 6 – 7 had been proved and that these were indicative of the applicant being sexually aroused and having an interest in the complainant’s vagina for his own sexual purposes.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that if there were any doubt as to the meaning of the complainant’s evidence when she made her videoed statement to the police, this was removed during cross-examination at trial as follows:
	


“Q. Did you say it because you wanted the police officer to believe you when you said that [the applicant] had licked you on the bum and the vagina?

A. That bit is true.

Q. If it was, why did you say bits that were untrue?

A. I’m not so sure.

Q. I suggest to you, you said things that were untrue because when you said [the applicant] licked you on the bum and the vagina that was untrue too, what do you say to that?

A. That’s true.

Q. That is true isn’t it?

A. Mm, that’s a true bit about it.” (T.46.11)


	
	The Crown submitted that the first mention of the word “bagina” was volunteered by the complainant at Q&A.81-82 where she said:
	


“Q.81   Yeah.

A.   And, then he asked me another silly question, show me your bagina.

Q.82   Yeah.

A.   Yeah and I sort of did.”

The Crown submitted that the reference to “bagina” was made by the complainant before the interviewer pointed to the crotch of the figure in Exhibit 1 and that the inference could be drawn that the complainant clearly understood what part of her body was the vagina, because she exposed it to the applicant at his request.


	
	In support of that proposition, the Crown noted that a viewing of the videoed statement showed that when asked to draw where the applicant kissed her on the front (Q&A.294), the complainant initially pointed to the crotch area with the pen and then drew the arrow at the side of the figure. The Crown submitted that because of that evidence, the jury could readily discount the suggestion that the complainant intended to indicate the entire area within the rectangle was that to which she was referring when she used the word “bagina”.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	It is true, as both the applicant and Crown noted, that the point raised by this ground of appeal was not taken by the defence at trial and if it is now to be relied upon, the leave of the Court is required by the Criminal Appeal Rules. In my opinion, leave should be given. This is because it relates to an element of the offence. The question of whether the evidence was capable of establishing count 5 is fundamental to whether the offence was made out. If the evidence were not so capable, then the applicant’s conviction on that count has given rise to a miscarriage of justice of the kind requiring this Court to intervene.
	
	
	In R v Kanaan the Court (Hunt AJA, Buddin and Hoeben JJ) said in relation to rule 4:
	


“99    ... That Rule provides that no direction or omission to give a direction at the trial shall, without the leave of this Court, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken by the appellant at the trial to the direction or omission challenged. Leave to rely on an error to which no objection had been taken at the trial will be granted only where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice: Regina v Abusafiah (1991) 25 NSWLR 531 at 536; Regina v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20 at [20]. There is a miscarriage of justice where, by reason of the error made, the appellant may have lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open to him) of being acquitted.”


	
	It follows that leave to rely upon this ground of appeal should be granted to the applicant.
	
	
	The Court was invited by both sides to view the videoed statement of the complainant, which made up most of her evidence in chief. The Court did so before the hearing of the appeal so as to better appreciate not only the written submissions before it but the oral submissions. The exercise was useful because it was clear that there were some errors in the transcription of the recorded interview. It was also important to observe the gestures of the interviewer and the complainant at various times during the interview.
	
	
	Fundamental to the Crown case in relation to count 5 was the evidence of the complainant in the videoed statement of 2 September 2012, five days after the offence was said to have occurred. It is correct, as the Crown submitted, that the complainant mentioned the word “bagina” without prompting for the first time in the interview at Q&A.81. It is, however, also of significance that shortly thereafter the complainant said: “And then he licked and kissed my bottom” (Q&A.85). Nothing was volunteered by the complainant concerning any actions by the applicant directed towards her vagina. Similarly, when the issue of the applicant kissing and licking her bottom was raised again by the interviewer (Q&A.197 and Q&A.243-244) no mention was made by the complainant of the applicant doing anything in relation to her vagina. On the contrary, the question and answer at 244 was:
	


“Q.244   … and licking, licking your bum and then laying on the lounge with you in the lounge room and kissing you again in the lounge room, did he do anything else that was naughty?

A.   No, he did do other thing.”

The “other thing” had nothing to do with the complainant’s vagina.


	
	The next mention of “vagina” did not occur until Q&A.289-296 of the interview. This evidence is important because it represents the high point of the Crown case in respect of count 5.
	


“Q.289   So what, do you know what this part of your body’s called here? [As he asked the question the interviewer uncovers a diagram of the front of a girl and points with his pen to the crotch area of the diagram]

A.   Your bagina.

Q.290   Bagina. And did your daddy kiss you anywhere near your bagina? [Interviewer points pen to the crotch area of the diagram]

A.   Mm yeah.

Q.291   Yeah.

A.   Yeah. He kissed me, at first near my bagina.

Q.292   Yeah and anywhere else?

A.   And on the butt as well.

Q.293   And on –

A.   The bagina and the butt.

Q.294   Now can you draw on there we he kissed you on the front (drawing). [The complainant points with the pen to the crotch area of the diagram and then draws an arrow on the outer right side of the diagram, pointing to the hip.]

Q.295   And put a circle around.

A.   In this area [the complainant draws a rectangular shape enclosing an area from across the hips to across the upper thighs.]

Q.296   Yeah, okay, thank you. All right, now when your dad was doing that kissing around your bum and your vagina, did you say anything to him?

A.   I said “stop” but he didn’t.”


	
	It is important to note that on this occasion the complainant did not volunteer anything about her vagina. On the contrary a leading question was put to her directed to the vagina, with the interviewer twice pointing with his pen to the crotch area of the diagram, Exhibit 1. What followed was the complainant not volunteering that the applicant kissed her “on” the vagina but responding to the question by saying “at first near my bagina”. In answer to the interviewer’s follow up question, “Anywhere else?” the complainant said nothing further about the vagina, but referred to being kissed on the butt as well. The next question (Q&A.293) was interrupted and the complainant volunteered “the bagina and the butt”. The issue was further complicated by the leading question (Q&A.296) which referred to “kissing around your bum and your vagina”.
	
	
	Putting that evidence at its highest, from the Crown’s point of view, it amounts to evidence that the complainant said that the applicant kissed her on or near her vagina. Those answers may be mutually exclusive. Near the vagina was never explained. The complainant could have been referring to the genitalia or she could have been referring to “near” the vagina but not on the genitalia. Even if the interrupted question at Q&A.293 is interpreted as evidence that the applicant kissed the complainant on the vagina, that response remains ambiguous because of the marking by the complainant of Exhibit 1.
	
	
	Exhibit 1 shows an arrow pointing towards the hip, not the vagina. It also shows an area within a rectangle extending from the hips to the top of the thighs. Little assistance is provided by the fact that the complainant initially pointed with the pen to the crotch area because five questions earlier the interviewer pointed twice at the crotch area of the diagram when asking Q.289 and Q.290.
	
	
	I have concluded that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that evidence that the applicant committed the offence which gave rise to count 5. The next issue is whether the other evidence upon which the Crown relied, satisfies that test.
	
	
	The evidence of the complainant’s grandmother does not have that effect. There are a number of reasons why this is so. Firstly it was not direct evidence but a hearsay report of what MH remembered having been told by the complainant. Secondly, the evidence was subject to the interpretation which an adult would normally place on what a child of such tender years meant when she spoke about what the applicant had done. Put another way, the evidence went no higher than setting out what the grandmother understood the complainant to mean when she described what happened. An example of the difficulties arising from such evidence is the apparent incorrect assertion that the complainant said that she sucked the applicant’s penis, or as was set out in her police statement, “[The applicant] made me kiss him on the penis”. Thirdly, these complaints were made in a context of the complainant making a number of other apparently sexualised statements which did not involve the applicant but which the complainant had heard about.
	
	
	The grandmother’s understanding of what the applicant meant when she used the word “bagina” does not take the matter further. By saying that when she used the word “bagina” the complainant meant the vagina is subject to the same imprecision that exists in relation to the videoed interview of the complainant. It remains unclear what she [i.e. the complainant] meant by the word “bagina”.
	
	
	The further evidence in chief and cross examination of the complainant at trial did not take the evidence further. Her evidence was given on 8 and 9 October 2013, more than a year after the events of 29 August 2012. By reference to Exhibit 1, the complainant gave this evidence:
	


“Q. And where you drew something on it, what were you showing Michael by the bit that you drew?

A. The other place where [the applicant] licked.”


	
	This was the first time in terms that the complainant had used the word “licked” in relation to the front part of her body. That evidence, however, was significantly qualified because it was given in relation to the rectangular area drawn on the diagram which extended from the hips to the upper thighs. It does not resolve the lack of precision arising from the videoed interview. This is particularly so in view of the following evidence:
	


“Q. Do you have any of your own memories, separate from the video that you’ve just watched, about this day?

A. No.” (T.26.35)


	
	At T.35.24-34 the complainant agreed that she had not told her two friends at school any detail of what had happened between the applicant and her, other than to say “something bad happened”. Similar responses were made by the complainant at T.46.11-.24 to leading questions. In any event, the responses by the complainant were at best ambiguous and she did not volunteer any extra detail by her using her own words. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Crown case was advanced by the evidence in chief and cross-examination of the complainant at trial. This is particularly so when she appears to have had no independent recollection (about the video) of that day.
	
	
	The Crown submission that the applicant’s conviction for counts 1 – 4, 6 – 7 showed that he was sexually aroused and had a sexual interest in the complainant’s vagina should not be accepted. The evidence of the offences giving rise to those counts was not relied on in the trial as tendency evidence, nor as evidence establishing a sexual interest in gaining access to the complainant’s exposed vagina, or an interest in her vagina generally. It was common ground that no tendency notice was given. At most, the evidence relating to these offences provides a context or the surrounding circumstances against which to consider the evidence relating to count 5. Most particularly there was no account given by the complainant which involved cunnilingus or any licking or kissing of the vagina or in that area until the leading question by the interviewer at Q&A 290. It follows that the evidence of the surrounding circumstances did not support an interest in the complainant’s vagina on the part of the applicant. Moreover, the evidence of the surrounding circumstances was not relied on at trial by the prosecution for such a purpose.
	
	
	The question raised by this ground of appeal is whether the Court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant committed the offence giving rise to count 5. This is a question of fact. In considering this ground, the Court must undertake its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. In M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 the plurality (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
	


""7   Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence

to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty but in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. …""


	
	This test has been restated to reflect of terms of s  6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58]. McHugh, Kirby and Gummow JJ said that the reference to “unsafe or unsatisfactory” in M v R is to be taken as “equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as “unreasonable” or such as “cannot be supported having regard to the evidence””. These principles were more recently re-affirmed by the majority of the High Court in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. SKA v R made it clear that this ground of appeal requires the Court to consider for itself the sufficiency of all the evidence led at trial on the particular issue under consideration.
	
	
	Applying those principles, and having fully reviewed the evidence for myself, I am not satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant engaged in sexual intercourse (i.e. cunnilingus) with the complainant as alleged in count 5. This ground of appeal has been made out.
	
	
	In view of my conclusion in relation to ground 1, it is not necessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal. In deference to the comprehensive submissions of the parties, however, I wish to say something about the remaining grounds.
	


Ground 2: The trial judge erred in law in her directions as to what was necessary to satisfy the element of the offence of “sexual intercourse”, to wit, “cunnilingus”.

Ground 3: The trial miscarried on account of the erroneous direction in relation to count 5 given by the trial judge.


	
	In order to understand the submissions, it is necessary to set out the directions of the trial judge which have been criticised. Count 5 was addressed by her Honour in the summing up in the following terms:
	


“Now finally with respect to count 5, this is a charge of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child. If you would turn to your elements document, you will find this on the second page:

“The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt each and everyone of the following elements that the accused had sexual intercourse with [the complainant]. Secondly that she was under the age of ten, namely six and thirdly that she was under his authority.”

Sexual intercourse means and includes a range of acts - it is quite broadly defined in the law - it includes cunnilingus, which is contact between the mouth of the accused and female genitalia and may include kissing, licking or sucking.

The Crown does not have to prove that full penetration occurred or that the accused ejaculated or that the sexual intercourse was for the accused’s sexual gratification. So here in short, the Crown relies upon her evidence that the accused kissed her on or near her vagina. The Crown says that is evidence that there was contact between his mouth and her genitalia.

Secondly, the Crown in relation to this charge, must prove her age. Again, that is not in dispute and that she was under his authority, the third element.

…

Now you might members of the jury, give very close consideration to the evidence in this regard. Again, there was not a significant line of questioning with her about the particulars of the various acts that she says took place. The questioning was more directed at whether any of this took place at all or whether it happened in the way she said. You must though, when you’re considering the elements of a particular charge and in particular this charge, you need to give careful consideration to whether you accept there is sufficient evidence that would amount to the particular act of sexual intercourse.

Here, the Crown relies on that part of the definition of sexual intercourse that includes cunnilingus, that is contact between the mouth of the accused and the female genitalia. I say that because in her evidence in this trial, [the complainant] had this to say, if I can just turn up the correct part.

I have already mentioned it, but I want to mention this evidence again in the context of this particular charge. She said (at 168) that she had been asked to take her undies off, she did not want to do it and he pulled them off, off her feet and he licked it and he kissed it. She was asked:

“Q. What was it that he licked and kissed?

A. My bum.”

Then later (at 197):

“Q. You told us right at the start that he kissed and licked your bottom?

A. After he pulled off my undies in my bedroom, standing near my bed”,

which she was not sure about. Then (at 284) she said, this is the part where she was asked to just describe what she used her bum for and she said “weeing and pooing”. And she was asked:

“Q. So when your daddy kissed you on the bottom, what did you have your back to him or your front to him?

A. My back.

Q. Your back?

A. No my front to him and then he untwisted me around.”

Then she was asked this question:

“Q. So what, do you know what this part of your body is called here?

A. Your bagina.

Q. Your vagina and did your daddy kiss anywhere near your vagina?

A. Yeah.”

And the question reads:

“Q. He kissed me at first near my vagina?

A. Yeah”,

confirming what he had said and she was asked:

“Q. And anywhere else, on the butt as well?

A. The vagina and the butt.”

Now there, that is reiterating the evidence in respect to this aggravated sexual intercourse, that is, the contact between the accused’s mouth and what she described as her vagina and the evidence for (count 6) the kissing of her bum.

In order to prove this particular charge, you would need to be satisfied that she was kissed, not on her anus or her bum, but on her “bagina” - vagina or that part of her genitalia. Her bum or anus is not a part of the genitalia. It is, in order for the kissing of the genitalia to be established for this count, you would need to be satisfied of her evidence that she was kissed on the vagina and not the bum. Because if it is just the bum, then that is not part of her genitalia, that is not part of her reproductive system.

So you would need to scrutinise carefully that evidence about whether or not the Crown has proven that she was kissed on the vagina and indeed, you would need to bear in mind that as a young child at the time, whether she appreciated the difference and that the Crown has established that she was as she says, kissed in that area of her anatomy.

To that extent, the Crown relies on her ability to distinguish between the back, the diagram where she indicated the bottom and the front where she indicated her vagina. You might think as I said, there was little challenge about that, but it is something about which you would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.

The real challenge as I have already said, was as to whether you could accept what she says as to these things happening at all; happening beyond reasonable doubt.

In this case the Crown really does rely wholly on the evidence of the complainant child, there being only herself and the accused present at the time that these alleged events occurred. Because that is so members of the jury, you would need to scrutinise her evidence carefully.

There is evidence, and I will come to this shortly, that she complained to her grandmother that she told the police what had occurred and that is evidence - it is a matter for you - that is the complaint to her grandmother that supports her account.

But it is not evidence that is independent of the complainant. She is the only person, aside from the accused, she is the only person who can give an account of what took place. An account that the Crown relies on to prove these charges beyond reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, you would need to carefully scrutinise her evidence to determine whether it is reliable - that is, whether you are satisfied that she has given not only an honest account, but an accurate account about the essential matters in this particular trial.” (SU 14.10.2013 – p 20.5 – 24.4)


	
	The applicant submitted that her Honour had misstated the evidence in that she had referred to the complainant’s evidence that she had been kissed “on or near her bagina” when it was the complainant’s evidence that she had been kissed “near her bagina”. He submitted that her Honour substituted the complainant’s term “bagina” for “vagina” in restating for the jury the relevant portion of the complainant’s interview. The applicant said that her Honour misquoted some of the complainant’s answers in her interview which might well have confused the jury. The applicant submitted that her Honour’s direction to the jury that the question was “whether the Crown has established that she was as she says kissed in that area of her anatomy” lacked any real precision and might have misled the jury.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	It is true, as the applicant submitted, that her Honour did misquote some of the evidence and read to them Q&A.291 which had been incorrectly transcribed on MFI 2, being the transcript of the videoed interview with the complainant. The small part of the evidence which her Honour misquoted would not have been of significance given that the jury had seen the transcript when the video was played and could have called for it in the course of their deliberations if they needed it, rather than relying upon their recollection of what her Honour had quoted. The error in transcription, in the circumstances of this case, did not disadvantage the applicant since it placed an important piece of evidence as part of a question rather than as part of an answer. In any event, it was no fault of her Honour that there had been an error in transcription.
	
	
	It was not an error on the part of her Honour to summarise the complainant’s evidence to the effect that she had been kissed “on or near her vagina”. That was the effect of her evidence if one accepted that her use of the word “bagina” meant “vagina”. The problem was, as her Honour identified, what precisely was meant by the complainant when she used the expression “near my vagina”. It is for that reason that her Honour specifically raised the issue of whether the complainant appreciated the difference between being kissed on or near the vagina, in the sense of on her genitalia, as distinct from other parts of her body.
	
	
	It mattered not that her Honour on occasions used the term “bagina” for “vagina” in her summing up. The real issue was what the complainant understood or meant by the terms “bagina” or “vagina”.
	
	
	Given the way in which this matter was run at trial, with the emphasis being on whether conduct of the type described by the complainant occurred at all, as distinct from whether that conduct gave rise to the offence, her Honour’s summing up on count 5 was quite unexceptionable. Her Honour, unlike either counsel in their addresses to the jury, was careful to set out what needed to be proved to establish that sexual intercourse had taken place and she identified the evidence which was relevant to that question. On more than one occasion, her Honour directed the jury that to establish an act of sexual intercourse they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had kissed the complainant on her genitalia being part of her reproductive system. Nothing more needed to be said by her Honour.
	
	
	It was not necessary for her Honour to do more than correctly state what had to be proved by the Crown to establish the offence when the real issue before the jury was whether the events, as alleged by the Crown, had occurred not whether that conduct gave rise to the offence. It is not without significance that her Honour was not asked by the defence at the conclusion of her summing up to give any further directions.
	
	
	It follows that these grounds of appeal have not been made out.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	Since ground of appeal 1 has been made out, a verdict of acquittal should be entered in favour of the applicant in respect of count 5. No alternative count was relied on by the Crown and the possibility of a lesser offence being made out was expressly eschewed by the Crown in the appeal. The verdict of acquittal has considerable implications. As indicated earlier in this judgment, the sentences for the other counts of which the applicant was found guilty have been served and his present imprisonment is due entirely to the sentence imposed for count 5. In those circumstances, because the conviction for this count cannot stand, the applicant should be released from custody forthwith.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Leave should be granted to the applicant to bring this application for leave to appeal against conviction in respect of count 5.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against conviction in respect of count 5 should be granted and the appeal allowed.
	
	
	The applicant’s conviction for count 5 should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.
	
	
	The applicant should be immediately released from custody.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2767210,R v Beattie (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 961,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 4 March 2015, Matthew Beattie (the offender) was arraigned on an indictment before a jury panel and me. It contained a single count alleging that on 7 July 2013 at Corlette he murdered Dennis O’Brien (the deceased). In fact, the fatal assault had taken place on 30 June 2013, but the deceased had passed away some days later. The offender pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. That plea was not accepted by the Crown, and a trial proceeded before a jury of 12 and me.
	
	
	At an early stage of the trial, it became clear that the only real issue was whether the Crown could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, in light of his intoxication by way of alcohol, prohibited drugs, and prescribed drugs. On 19 March 2015, the jury determined that issue in favour of the Crown by returning a verdict of guilty of murder.
	
	
	On 12 June 2015, I received evidence on sentence, including two victim impact statements, and helpful oral and written submissions from each counsel.
	
	
	On the same day, three offences were placed before me by way of a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The offender had pleaded guilty to each of those charges some time before. With regard to those offences, I sentence with the applicable jurisdictional limit of the Local Court in mind: R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317; (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. I shall briefly discuss each of those far less serious offences when I come to discuss the circumstances of the murder.
	
	
	The imposition of sentence was thereafter stood over for some weeks, in order to avoid it coinciding with the anniversary of the death of the deceased.
	
	
	It is in the foregoing procedural context that the offender will be sentenced for the offence of murder today.
	
	
	As I have said, the only issue at trial was the intention of the offender at the time of the fatal assault. No other facts were placed in dispute. In the proceedings on sentence as well, there were few if any disputes about matters of fact. I have borne in mind that any aggravating feature beyond the elements of the offence must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, but any mitigating feature need only be proven in favour of the offender on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The maximum penalty in New South Wales for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life without parole. Parliament has also created a standard non-parole period of 20 years that applies in the circumstances of this case. I have kept each of those important guideposts firmly in mind.
	
	
	In neither the trial nor the proceedings on sentence did the Crown allege that the offender possessed an intention to kill the deceased. Both parties were agreed that I am to impose a sentence that reflects no more than an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. Nor did the Crown submit that the ultimate penalty is called for in this case.
	


The offence 


	
	The offender was born in August 1986, and accordingly at the date of the fatal assault was aged 26 years. The deceased was born in September 1984, and accordingly in late June 2013 was 28 years of age.
	
	
	By 30 June 2013, the offender and the deceased had been very close friends for many years. They had grown up together in the south western suburbs of Sydney. The offender and his then-wife, Ms Simone Beattie, were also very close to the family of the deceased.
	
	
	Some time before the fatal incident, the deceased, his partner Ms Casey Williams, and her children had moved away from the area, and made a fresh start in Port Stephens. They were living in a townhouse in the suburb of Corlette, quite near to the Nelson Bay RSL. At the time of the offence, Ms Williams was pregnant with a child of the deceased.
	
	
	On Friday 28 June 2013, the offender and his wife travelled by car from Sydney to Corlette. They were planning to watch the deceased play rugby league the following afternoon, and to stay over the weekend with his family at their home. The mother of the deceased, Ms Lisa Carr, travelled with them. Some amphetamines were ingested on the trip north. On the Friday evening, after their arrival at the home, things passed happily and unremarkably.
	
	
	On the Saturday morning, the offender and others made a trip to a local hotel, so that bets could be placed with the TAB. It was also at that time that the offender began to drink alcohol. By the time of the fatal assault at about 3 am the following day, he had consumed well over 30 mixed drinks of vodka and apple juice. He was able to drink that enormous amount because of a well-developed tolerance to alcohol, combined with the ingestion of amphetamines throughout the day. Those two factors meant that he remained on his feet and alert when many others would have been unconscious.
	
	
	A friendly lunch took place, followed by attendance at the football game. After that the offender, his wife, the deceased, his partner, the mother of the deceased, and the children enjoyed dinner at the same hotel. Again, the atmosphere was a happy one.
	
	
	Subsequently, the offender and the deceased travelled to the RSL club to which I have referred. They continued drinking there. At a later stage, the two of them were asked to leave by security. The offender, by this stage well affected by alcohol, became argumentative. The police needed to become involved. The offender and the deceased eventually departed, but not before the offender had made very aggressive and unpleasant statements to the police.
	
	
	Eventually, Ms Beattie and Ms Carr collected the two intoxicated young men from the waterfront near the RSL club and drove them home. There the socialising and drinking continued. By this time it was the early hours of the Sunday morning. The offender took the medication Seroquel, which he had been prescribed to deal with his bipolar disorder, a topic to which I shall return later. He also saw fit to add to the enormous amount of alcohol, the amphetamines, and the prescribed medication that he had consumed by taking a tablet of Xanax. That is a prescribed medication, but it had not been prescribed to the offender. The position of the offender is that he has no memory of events from that point on.
	
	
	Thereafter, a dispute developed between the offender and his wife. It was generally felt that the offender had spoken too harshly to Ms Beattie, and the deceased became involved to some degree in the ill-feeling. The offender and the deceased ended up in a separate flat below the townhouse. Ms Beattie, Ms Carr, and Ms Williams were all up and about at this time, though the children were sleeping.
	
	
	The offender and the deceased were standing very close to each other inside the flat. The deceased expressed his love for the offender as a brother. I have my suspicions about the state of mind of the offender at that stage, but I act upon the concession of the Crown that one cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any aggravating factor in that regard. Accordingly, I put my suspicions to one side.
	
	
	What is clear is that the offender began to bash the deceased savagely. The deceased made no effort to defend himself, despite encouragement to do so by his mother, who was present and observed the fatal attack upon her son. The beating extended over a few minutes at the least. The offender used sufficient force to break one of his hands during the course of the beating. He also used a weapon in the form of a standing fan that ended up being broken into pieces. At one stage Ms Beattie, who was also present, tried to interrupt the offender by asking him to think of their child, but he merely stared at her blankly. The attack ended with the deceased very badly injured, but alive and semi-conscious.
	
	
	Emergency services were called at 3.02 am. In that telephone call, Ms Carr described her son as having been “beaten to a pulp”.
	
	
	The police arrived promptly. In accordance with the culture of which the adults at the premises were a part, no one was prepared to cooperate with the police by telling them frankly what had occurred. The offender had not fled the scene, and remained inside the flat with the deceased. The offender behaved very aggressively towards the police, and threatened them with violence. He also hindered their investigation of what he had done by trying to lock them out of the flat. That conduct constituted the offence of hindering police. Pursuant to s 546C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) that is a wholly summary offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 months. After a short time, the police used force to subdue the offender and arrested him. The deceased was taken from the home by ambulance and admitted to hospital.
	
	
	The offender was driven to a police station some distance away and placed in a holding cell commonly known as a dock. At some stage whilst inside that cell he urinated, and he has admitted by his plea that he recklessly damaged police property in doing so. That forms the basis of the second charge on the certificate, and pursuant to s 268 and Table 2 in Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the available sentence in the Local Court is imprisonment for 2 years.
	
	
	Whilst the offender was detained, the police sought to remove his wedding ring. He became very aggressive yet again, and committed the third offence on the certificate of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. Again, the available sentence is imprisonment for 2 years.
	
	
	Eventually the offender either fell asleep or passed out. When he awoke, many hours later on the Sunday afternoon, he had no memory of what he had done. Indeed, in his first telephone conversation with his wife, he expressed concern about his hands, rather than about anybody else. I accept that he was genuinely shocked when he was told by his wife that his close friend was gravely injured, and that he, the offender, was responsible for his injuries.
	
	
	For some days the recovery of the deceased appeared to be progressing well. However, on 7 July 2013, he tragically passed away. By pleading guilty to manslaughter, the offender accepted that the severe beating that he administered to the deceased had substantially contributed to his death.
	
	
	In the meantime, the offender had been charged with an offence of violence against the deceased and admitted to bail. When he heard that the deceased had died, he handed himself in to a police station. That was on 8 July 2013; Mr Beattie has been in custody ever since.
	


Assessment of objective seriousness of offence


	
	Every murder is an offence of the utmost seriousness, constituting as it does the taking of the life of a fellow human being in the gravest circumstances known to law. Nonetheless, it is possible to make an assessment of the seriousness of each example of the offence of murder, and it is necessary to do so in order to give content to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Here, the intention of the offender was to inflict really serious physical injury, and not to inflict death. As a result of his gross intoxication by a number of substances, the offence was unplanned and spontaneous. Were it otherwise, the offence would not have been committed in the presence of witnesses, not least the mother of the deceased. I am unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the motive for the offence, and am forced to ascribe it to an irrational outburst brought on by gross intoxication. All of those factors are in favour of the objective seriousness of the offence being assessed less severely.
	
	
	To be weighed against those matters is the fact that the fatal assault was a severe and sustained beating. It was not a single punch or kick, or anything like it. It was also unprovoked, and had no flavour whatsoever of self-defence. It was inflicted upon a man who refused to defend himself against someone whom he loved as a brother. A weapon was used. The assault occurred in the home of the deceased, where the children of Ms Williams were sleeping, and where the offender was a guest. I have not forgotten that the fatal assault was witnessed by two women who loved the deceased very deeply; namely, his mother and his pregnant partner.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I accept the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that the murder falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but not to a great degree.
	


Subjective features


	
	I turn from a discussion of the offence to a discussion of the life of the offender.
	


Plea to manslaughter and remorse


	
	As I have said, the offender pleaded guilty to the unlawful homicide of the deceased. He did so whilst having no memory of the fatal assault. All that was in question was his intention. At the end of the trial, the offender was found guilty of an offence that was greater than he had admitted, and accordingly there can be no utilitarian discount for his plea of guilty: see, for example, R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310. Nevertheless, the offender deserves some credit for the highly focused way in which the trial unfolded, as a result of his admission of so many matters: see s 22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act).
	
	
	Separately from that, I accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender is remorseful for what he has done. The evidence for that comes from his plea; the fact that he handed himself in when it became clear that he would be charged with murder; and the things he has written and said, including on oath. He has spoken of his remorse for what he has done, despite his amnesia of it, to many persons, including a psychologist.
	
	
	Although some of the remorse expressed by the offender is to be explained by his regret about the fact that he must spend many years in custody for his actions, nevertheless by no means all of it is to be explained in that way. I accept that the offender bitterly regrets what he has done, and even now struggles to deal with the enormity of it. I also accept that, for many years into the future, he will suffer from the loss of a man whom he regarded as his brother, a loss that the offender knows occurred at his own hand.
	


Background of the offender


	
	The following matters were described in a psychological report that was tendered in the case for the offender on sentence, and confirmed by the offender on oath. The Crown Prosecutor did not dispute them.
	
	
	The offender grew up in Camden, a rural town on the edge of Sydney. He enjoyed a happy and stable upbringing that was free of deprivation or abuse. He left school in year 10, and undertook a number of unskilled jobs. At the time of the offence, he was working as a forklift driver and warehouse man.
	
	
	By the time of the offence he had fathered two children to two different women, one of whom was his wife.
	
	
	His mother has suffered from depression, and he himself was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2011. He was prescribed medication for that condition.
	
	
	The offender commenced to drink alcohol at the age of 14, and by the time he was aged 21 he was a binge drinker. Over the years, alcohol became a central part of his life. As well as that, he commenced to abuse cannabis at the age of 15; amphetamines at the age of 17; and cocaine at the age of 21. He has used other prohibited drugs on occasion.
	


Psychological assessment


	
	The psychologist expressed the opinion that the offender had become dependent upon prohibited drugs and alcohol by 2013. He also assessed the offender as an impulsive man; troubled by substance abuse; self-destructive in his approach to life generally; and volatile in his relationships. He also assessed him as a man of poorly controlled anger, prone to outbursts of temper and aggression. The psychologist thought that the offender is a person of fragile self-esteem, vulnerable to the real or imagined slights of others.
	
	
	I accept all of those assessments. Apart from anything else, they are thoroughly consistent with the events of the evening and early morning that culminated in the fatal assault upon the deceased.
	
	
	The psychologist expressed the view that the offender is severely anxious and depressed in custody. He is medicated for those two conditions, as well as for his bipolar disorder. The offender suffers from no other serious psychiatric illnesses, and is physically well. He is now almost 29 years of age.
	
	
	The psychologist put forward the firm view that depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder had nothing to do with the commission of the offence. Rather, it was the product of the combined force of aspects of the personality of the offender and his gross intoxication by various substances.
	


Other adverse conduct


	
	The offender is not a person of good character. Although his criminal record is not extensive, it is instructive. It is convenient to consider its entries in the order in which the offences were committed.
	
	
	In 2009, when he was aged 23, the offender drove with a middle range of alcohol in his blood, and was fined.
	
	
	In June 2010, he committed the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offender gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence that that was a drunken interaction with another person at a licensed club; he has little real memory of the incident. On 13 October 2010, he was fined and placed on a 12 month bond that expired on 12 October 2011.
	
	
	Less than one month later, in July 2010, he possessed or used a prohibited weapon without a permit. The details of that offence were not placed before me. In the District Court on 2 February 2011, he was placed on a two year bond for that offence. That bond expired on 1 February 2013; that is, less than five months before he committed the most serious offence known to law.
	
	
	In the same month, he also supplied a prohibited drug. Again, the details of that offending were not placed before me. Offences of possessing a prohibited drug and dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime were taken into account on a Form 1 in due course. For the supply, he was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 2 February 2011 and concluding on 1 August 2012. A non-parole period of nine months was served until his release from prison on 1 November 2011. Again, it can be seen that his parole expired less than one year before he committed the offence of murder.
	
	
	Quite separately from his criminal record, in February 2014, whilst bail refused on the charge of murder, the offender engaged in a telephone conversation from prison with his former wife. He was well aware, of course, that the telephone conversation was being monitored. To state things succinctly, his wife raised the probability that their romantic relationship was coming to an end. The response of the offender was to threaten that he would arrange the murder of any man with whom she was intimate whilst he was in custody. In the witness box before me, he accepted that he had intended that that threat to arrange a contract killing of any man who replaced him in the affections of his wife would be taken seriously by her.
	
	
	It is true, as defence counsel submitted, that there is no evidence that any such steps were actually taken. I also accept that the world of the offender was, at that stage, continuing to collapse around him.
	
	
	Having said that, the fact that an offender who is bail refused for a brutal murder would see fit to threaten his wife that he would arrange a contract killing, in circumstances in which he well knew that the call would be monitored by the authorities, hardly instils confidence in his character or his prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	In short, on the one evening the offender brutally murdered a man. On the same night he threatened police on more than one occasion, and was violent towards them. In the past, he had been involved in some sort of drunken altercation and inflicted actual bodily harm upon the victim. Furthermore, he has possessed or used a prohibited weapon. After the murder, he threatened to arrange a contract killing.
	
	
	It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the offender is a person prone to actual or threatened violence. On the other hand, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, on the morning that he commenced to drink vast quantities of alcohol, the offender affirmatively knew that he was liable to become violent as a result. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that anger and violence (either actual or threatened), along with the abuse of alcohol and prohibited drugs, have been features of the life of the offender for some years.
	


Approach to intoxication


	
	The evidence taken as a whole, both from the trial and on sentence, amply shows that the offender has serious and long-standing problems with alcohol and drugs. It is to be recalled that he had consumed a huge quantity of alcohol on the day and evening in question. It was supplemented by ingestion of amphetamines, along with prescription medication, some of which had been prescribed to him and some of which had not. On the evening in question, the combination of aggression, alcohol and drugs became a lethal one. Nevertheless, in accordance with s 21(5AA) of the Act, the self-induced intoxication of the offender at the time that he committed the offence is not to be taken into account by me as a mitigating feature. Defence counsel did not submit to the contrary.
	


The future


	
	The psychologist who assessed the offender was cautious about his prospects of rehabilitation. Nevertheless, he was of the opinion that, if the offender were able to address his issues with drugs and alcohol, and his anger and aggression, his prospects would be “generally positive”.
	
	
	Separately, the offender is spoken of very highly in the other documents tendered on his behalf on sentence. They were authored by his mother, an older family friend, and a close friend from work. It seems that he was the school captain of his primary school in year six, and was a gifted student, both academically and on the sporting field. He is also spoken of as a hard worker, a good father, and a firm friend. I accept that he will have a substantial amount of love and support available to him in the years ahead.
	
	
	Turning to make my own assessment of the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender, whilst in custody he has failed two drug tests. I accept his evidence that that those failures were the result of him illicitly obtaining from other prisoners a sedative or synthetic opiate that he used simply to sleep and relax. It is noteworthy that he has not been convicted of any offences against prison discipline to do with violence in the many months since he came into custody.
	
	
	As well as that, I accept that the offender has come to see the catastrophic consequences to all concerned of his abuse of alcohol and drugs, and that he must address his unresolved issues with regard to anger and violence. I think it is imperative that he be offered, and accept, help with regard to those issues in the years ahead. It will not be easy for the offender to free himself from his tendency to aggression whilst serving many years of imprisonment in maximum security. Nevertheless, if that offer of help is made and accepted, and if the offender is able to overcome the aspects of his personality that have underpinned his offending, I have a guarded optimism about his prospects of rehabilitation.
	


Various matters


	
	I turn briefly to discuss various aspects of my task.
	
	
	I was provided with a number of comparative cases from the Bar table. That was of assistance. But because each case must turn on its own facts, I shall not detail those other matters.
	
	
	I do not propose mechanistically to work through the aggravating and mitigating factors contained in s 21A of the Act that I have found to be established. These remarks on sentence fulfil that role. I have referred myself to the section with the assistance of the submissions of counsel, and have taken care to avoid double counting.
	
	
	It was agreed between the parties that any sentence should commence on the date that the offender came into continuous custody, that being 8 July 2013. For abundant caution, I shall backdate that by one further day to give credit for the period that the offender spent in custody from the early hours of the morning until the afternoon of 30 June 2013.
	
	
	The three offences on the certificate, whilst not to be dismissed as trivial, pale into insignificance when compared to the offence of murder. The Crown Prosecutor expressed his contentment with a sentence structure whereby the sentences for the certificate offences are completely concurrent, not only with each other, but also with the non-parole period of the sentence for the murder. I shall adopt that course, and shall impose for the certificate offences fixed terms that reflect the head sentences that I would otherwise have imposed: see s 45 of the Act.
	
	
	I am required by s 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to inform the offender that, once he is convicted and sentenced for this offence of serious violence, he will be liable to be detained even after the full expiry of his head sentence, if he is judged to be a danger to the community.
	
	
	Defence counsel did not submit that special circumstances had been made out that would permit a variation in the usual ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence for the offence of murder. Nevertheless, I have turned my mind to the question. The offender is not a person who has been free of criminality in the past. He has been imprisoned before, albeit for a short period. And the parole period that I shall impose must inevitably be very substantial. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that special circumstances have been established.
	


Victim impact statements


	
	Ms Lisa Carr read her own victim impact statement, which was also tendered in evidence. In that document, she describes the lacerating pain that she has suffered as a result of the loss of her youngest child. I accept that that pain has been made even harder to bear because she saw her son fatally bashed with her own eyes. She describes his murder as having torn an entire family apart. And she poignantly explains that all family celebrations such as Christmas and birthdays are now conducted at the graveside of her son.
	
	
	Ms Kristy O’Brien, the elder sister of the deceased, read her own victim impact statement. It was to similar effect. She describes how many are simply going through the motions of living, rather than obtaining any enjoyment from life. She details the psychological difficulties that she has suffered as a result of the loss of her brother. And she explains that the loss is that much harder to bear because it was inflicted by a man whom everyone regarded as family.
	
	
	In short, the life of a much-loved son, brother, partner, and now father has been lost as a result of the infliction of senseless alcohol and drug-fuelled violence.
	
	
	Because there was no application by the Crown to the contrary pursuant to s 28(4) of the Act, I have dealt with those statements in accordance with long-established principle: see R v  Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.
	
	
	On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my condolences to all of those who have suffered, and who will continue to suffer, as a consequence of the murder of Dennis O’Brien. It is possible that the conclusion of the proceedings today will provide some closure. But I accept that the effects of the events of the early morning of 30 June 2013 will be felt for decades to come.
	


Imposition of sentence


	
	Matthew Beattie, you are convicted of the offences of hindering police, recklessly damaging property, and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. With regard to each offence, I impose a fixed term of imprisonment for 9 months that commences on 7 July 2013, and that expires on 6 April 2014.
	
	
	Matthew Beattie, you are convicted of the offence of murder. I impose a non-parole period of 15 years, to date from 7 July 2013. That will be followed by a parole period of 5 years, to commence on 6 July 2028 and to expire on 6 July 2033. The first date upon which you will be eligible for parole is 6 July 2028.
	
	
	To express my orders another way, I have imposed a total head sentence of imprisonment for 20 years to commence on 7 July 2013, with a total non-parole period of 15 years.

2767220,Nasrallah v R; R v Nasrallah [2015] NSWCCA 188,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: This appeal raises an important question as to the use of police officers as ad hoc voice identification experts in criminal trials. The appellant was arraigned on an indictment containing four counts of importing a border controlled drug, Gammabutyrolactone (GBL), and one count of supplying the same drug. He pleaded guilty to the count of supply but not guilty to the four counts of importation.
	
	
	The prohibited drug was imported in each case in packages shipped from China. As to each of the four counts on the indictment, the packages were intercepted by Customs and not delivered. However, in addition to those four packages, there was evidence in the Crown case of four further occasions on which similar packages from China were delivered to the appellant’s home address. The Crown relied on that evidence as tendency evidence.
	
	
	In the case of a number of the consignments, the freight forwarder was the company, DHL. The evidence in the Crown case included 21 recordings of telephone calls made to that company inquiring as to the progress of three of the packages (those relating to counts 2 and 3 on the indictment and one of the delivered consignments). The content of the calls is such as to implicate the caller in those three importations.
	
	
	After his arrest, the appellant was initially refused bail. Whilst on remand, he made telephone calls from the gaol which, as is standard procedure, were recorded. Police obtained recordings of 178 of those calls for voice comparison purposes (a small number was also relied upon as directly implicating the appellant in the offences). It was not disputed that the appellant was the caller in those calls. In addition to those recordings, Federal Agent Succar, the case officer for the investigation, had spoken to the appellant twice and had a recording (lawfully obtained) of one of those conversations. The other was an occasion when subpoenas were served and few words were spoken by the appellant.
	
	
	Over the appellant’s objection, the trial judge admitted evidence from Federal Agent Succar to the effect that the voice of the caller in the 21 disputed DHL calls was the voice of the appellant, as heard by Federal Agent Succar on the recordings from the gaol and in his two direct conversations with the appellant. The evidence was admitted under s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) as ad hoc expert opinion evidence.
	
	
	The appellant was convicted of all four importations. He has appealed against his conviction. The first ground relates to the admission of the evidence of Federal Agent Succar. The remaining three grounds relate to the fact that the appellant’s barrister later made a concession that 20 of the 21 DHL calls were the voice of the appellant, a concession the appellant contends was made without instructions. The Crown has appealed against the alleged leniency of the sentence imposed.
	
	
	I have concluded that the appeal against conviction should be allowed, the conviction quashed and an order made for a new trial. In that circumstance, it is not necessary to determine the Crown’s appeal. That appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ad hoc expert voice identification evidence


	
	The first ground of appeal is:
	


the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Federal Agent Succar as ad hoc expert voice identification evidence.


	
	It is helpful to begin with an analysis of the way in which the issue of the proposed expert evidence emerged at the trial.
	
	
	At a pre-trial directions hearing a week before the trial, the Crown raised a number of issues that would have to be determined by the Court before a jury was empanelled. One was an issue raised by the appellant as to the admissibility of the 21 DHL calls and, in particular, whether the Crown could establish that they had been lawfully recorded. There was no suggestion at that stage that if those recordings were admitted there would be expert voice identification evidence comparing the voice of the caller in those calls with the recordings of the appellant in his calls from the gaol. On the contrary, although the Crown foreshadowed tendering the calls from the gaol for that purpose, she said the comparison would have to be made by the jury, explaining “there’s no witness. It wasn’t a case of a long-running investigation” (see transcript of 22 October 2013, T3.34).
	
	
	On the Friday before the trial was due to commence, the trial judge held a voir dire to determine the pre-trial issues including the admissibility of the DHL calls. During the hearing on the voir dire, the Crown began to lead oral evidence from Federal Agent Succar as to his comparison of the 21 DHL calls with the calls from the gaol. The barrister then appearing for the appellant objected and the judge noted what the Crown had said on the earlier occasion (that it was going to be a matter for the jury to compare the voices). The Crown evidently indicated her intention at that point to use Federal Agent Succar as a voice identification expert. The transcript records that the barrister appearing for the appellant had not been informed of that intention until that morning. He had accordingly not had any opportunity to prepare to argue the admissibility of the alleged expert evidence. For that reason, the argument had to be stood over until the following Monday.
	
	
	Before the continuation of the voir dire hearing on the Monday, the appellant’s barrister noted that the Crown had not served any supplementary statement from Federal Agent Succar setting out the proposed expert evidence. The matter was stood down for that to occur. A statement was prepared during a short adjournment and was tendered on the voir dire (statement dated 28 October 2013, identified in the transcript as exhibit 6 on the voir dire but described in the appeal books as exhibit E on the voir dire).
	
	
	In his supplementary statement, Federal Agent Succar stated that he is “an Australian with a Lebanese background”. He described his experience of the Arabic language, both at home and in the performance of his duties as a police officer. He also said that he had studied Arabic as an elective subject in 2004 when he completed a degree in business and computing. It should be noted, however, that none of the disputed calls was in Arabic. All of the calls are in English. The Crown’s contention appears to have been that Federal Agent Succar had relevant specialised knowledge in the identification of the accent of Arabic speakers when speaking English.
	
	
	In his original statement, Federal Agent Succar had evidently purported to identify the voice of the appellant on the DHL calls after listening to only four of the calls from the gaol (T32.25). In his supplementary statement, he said that, since making the original statement, he had listened to the DHL calls and about 142 of the gaol calls “on multiple occasions”. He said:
	


I can say that I recognised that the voices heard in the 21 calls to be that of [the appellant]. The pronunciation and the use of some words, such as “youse” occurs in come (scil: some) of the DHL calls as well as some of the 142 calls from NSW Corrective Services”.


	
	The Crown expressly relied on s 79 of the Evidence Act, which provides:
	


“If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.”


	
	The reference to the opinion rule is a reference to s 76 of the Act which provides:
	


“Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion is expressed.”


	
	The Crown did not rely on s 78 of the Evidence Act (relating to lay opinions).
	
	
	The argument before the trial judge proceeded on the common assumption that Federal Agent Succar’s supplementary evidence was evidence of an opinion that the voice of the caller in the 21 DHL calls was the voice of the appellant. The evidence was sought to be admitted to prove the existence of that fact. In accordance with s 79, the evidence was accordingly not admissible unless Federal Agent Succar had specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience and the opinion was wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.
	
	
	On the present state of the law, it is accepted that, for the purpose of s 79 of the Evidence Act, an expert witness can be one who has acquired his or her specialised knowledge ad hoc (that is, for the very purpose of the legal proceedings in which the opinion evidence is relied upon): R v Leung & Wong [1999] NSWCCA 287; 47 NSWLR 405 at [40] per Simpson J (as her Honour then was); Spigelman CJ and Sperling J agreeing at [1] and [67] respectively. The correctness of that view was accepted in Irani v R [2008] NSWCCA 217 at [14] per Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) at [14]; McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreeing at [1] and [34] respectively.
	
	
	The trial judge ruled that the evidence was admissible under s 79, relying on those decisions and the authorities cited therein. Her Honour remarked that the activities undertaken by the witnesses in those cases to acquire their ad hoc expertise “do not provide a minimum test for the admissibility of voice identification evidence”.
	
	
	The trial judge also cited the remarks of Wood CJ at CL to like effect in R v Madigan [2005] NSWCA 170 at [92], where his Honour said “there are no preconditions for the admissibility of voice identification evidence, other than relevance under s 55 of the Evidence Act” (citing R v Riscuta and Niga [2003] NSWCCA 6 at [34] per Heydon JA). However, the remarks of Heydon JA in Riscuta (and the decision of R v Adler (2001) 52 NSWLR 451 cited by his Honour as the authority for that proposition) were not concerned with voice identification evidence given by an ad hoc expert. They were cases in which the identification in question was made by a person who had some prior familiarity with the voice the subject of the identification.
	
	
	In the argument in the present case, the appellant had also submitted that, if admissible under s 79, the evidence should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act. The judge rejected that submission but noted that the jury should be given appropriate warnings in accordance with ss 116 and 165 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The appellant submits that the Court’s recognition of ad hoc voice identification expertise is wrong but no notice was given that a bench of five should be convened in order to consider whether Leung and Irani were wrongly decided. In light of those authorities, the submission must be taken to have been put only formally in this Court. I am of the view, however, that the evidence of Federal Agent Succar was not admissible under the principles stated in those cases.
	
	
	It is important to be clear about the circumstances in which the witnesses in Leung and Irani were accepted as having ad hoc specialised knowledge (within the meaning of s 79) so as to warrant admitting evidence of their opinions concerning the voices in question.
	
	
	In Leung, police had covertly recorded conversations between three men while they opened packages imported from Bangkok. Parts of the conversations were in foreign languages. At the trial, the recordings of the conversations (referred to as the DAT tapes) were admitted, together with a transcript of a translation prepared by a qualified interpreter. During the preparation of the transcript, the interpreter had discerned three different male voices, which he called M1, M2 and M3. His basis for distinguishing the three different voices was described in the judgment of Simpson J at [18] as follows:
	


He reached this conclusion by evaluating the pitch and the volume of the voices, and the speed of the language used. He said the speaker he nominated as “M1” was a Cantonese speaking person with a medium to high pitched voice and spoke relatively quickly. [In the evidence he gave before the jury, he described this voice of as medium pitch]. “M2” was a person who spoke accented Cantonese as though that language was not his mother tongue, also in a medium to high pitched voice, but at a relatively low volume. This speaker spoke some sentences in Mandarin. “M3” was a Cantonese speaker with a relatively high pitched voice.


	
	At a later point in time (a week before the trial), the interpreter was asked to listen to tape recordings of conversations between each of the three appellants and Federal police and to compare the voices on those tapes with those on the DAT tapes in order to express an opinion as to the identity of the voices on the DAT tapes. The interpreter concluded that the voice he had nominated as “M1” was the voice of Leung and the voice he had nominated as “M3” was the voice of Wong.
	
	
	Justice Simpson’s conclusion that the interpreter could give evidence as an ad hoc voice identification expert was subject to an important qualification expressed at [44] to [45] of her Honour’s judgment, as follows:
	


44. Voice comparison is not necessarily a question for expert evidence, although it may be. If the two sets of tape recordings in the present case had been in English, it would have been open to the Crown to have left it to the jury to make their own comparison and assessment of whether the voices on the DAT tapes (or any of them) corresponded to either of the voices on the police tapes. That course theoretically remained open but would have left the jury with a task immeasurably more difficult, given the reasonable assumption that no member of the jury understood either of the Chinese languages involved. The jury would, truly, have been comparing voices only, without the intrusion of language and speech patterns that are part of voice identification.

45. There is another aspect to the task undertaken by Mr Fung that should be mentioned. He was not asked to compare the voices until a few days before the commencement of the trial. There was no specific evidence as to the instruction he was given, but it is an obvious inference that he would have approached his task on the assumption that the two voices on the police tapes were in fact the same as two of the voices on the DAT tapes, and that his role was to determine which voice on the police tapes corresponded to voices identified as M1, M2 or M3 on the DAT tapes. This is a quite different task to determining whether either of the voices so corresponded. If there were any real basis to doubt the assumption, the manner in which Mr Fung was asked to perform the comparison might raise real questions of propriety. The situation is analogous to physical identification by photographs or by a police lineup, in which care must be taken not to suggest that a particular person is the suspect. However, for reasons which will appear below, I am satisfied that in this case the assumption was a valid one. It was therefore proper for Mr Fung to approach his task on the basis that two of the voices on the DAT tapes did in fact correspond to the two voices on the police tapes, and his function was to determine which was which.


	
	Although the decision in Leung stands as authority for the proposition that a person who has repeatedly listened to voice recordings can give evidence as an ad hoc voice identification expert, that conclusion was heavily qualified by those remarks. Further, as explained at [42] of the judgment, the task undertaken by the interpreter in that case was highly specialised, invoking the interpreter’s considerable specialised knowledge in foreign language and accent.
	
	
	The judgment of Simpson J provides a helpful analysis of the provenance of the notion of an “ad hoc expert” which Her Honour noted appears to have originated in the New Zealand decision of R v Menzies [1982] 1 NZLR 40. No question of voice identification arose in that case. Evidence had been admitted in the trial of tapes undoubtedly recording the voice of the appellant. The issue with which the relevant ground of appeal was concerned was the admissibility of a transcript of those tapes prepared by a police officer. The trial judge had initially refused to admit the transcript. However, after listening to two tapes, the judge changed his ruling because, on being listened to only once or twice, the tapes were unintelligible. The police officer, who had listened to the tapes “over and over again”, was accepted by the trial judge to have acquired “a special expertise in their interpretation”. The judge allowed the jury to have the transcript. The Court of Appeal upheld that ruling. A premise of the Court’s decision was that, in the case of a recording in a foreign language or where deficiencies in the recording “make it necessary to play tapes more than once to enable a better understanding”, while there should normally be at least one playing of the tapes to the jury, “the evidence of an expert should be admissible as an aid”. It was on that premise that the Court said “he may be a temporary expert in the sense that by repeated listening to the tapes he has qualified himself ad hoc.”
	
	
	Justice Simpson noted that the idea of an ad hoc expert was subsequently endorsed by the High Court in Butera v DPP [1987] HCA 58; (1987) 164 CLR 180. Again, that was a case concerned with the admissibility of a transcript of a recording rather than with voice identification evidence. The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to traffic heroin. The Crown case included a tape recording of a conversation among some of the alleged co-conspirators which was mostly in Punjabi but partly in English and partly in Thai or Malay. Parts of the conversation were muffled and could only be made out after being listened to repeatedly by a person familiar with those languages. Applying Menzies, the High Court held that the transcript was admissible as a means of assisting the jury to understand the tape: at 187 per Mason CJ, Brennan and Deane JJ. In a separate judgment, Dawson J also cited Menzies as authority for the proposition that “an ad hoc expertise may be acquired by a witness by playing and replaying a tape so as to become more familiar with its contents than could be done by playing it only once or twice.”
	
	
	In Leung, Simpson J noted that each of those decisions was before the Evidence Act 1995 but drew comfort from two cases decided after the introduction of the Act in which the same principle was applied: Eastman v R (1997) 76 FCR 9 and R v Cassar; R v Sleiman (No 17) [1999] NSWSC 436.
	
	
	In Eastman, the Full Federal Court held (applying the decisions in Menzies and Butera) that the trial judge had not erred in admitting a transcript of indecipherable tapes prepared by a police officer who spent “literally thousands of hours” listening to the tapes. It was not in dispute that the voice on the tapes was Mr Eastman. Although the case was decided after the introduction of the Evidence Act, there was no consideration of the admissibility of the evidence under s 79 of the Act. The Court did make passing reference to s 48 of the Act.
	
	
	Cassar was a decision during a trial. The issue was the same as in Eastman; the Crown sought to tender transcripts of indistinct tapes of conversations recorded by a covert listening device. There was no issue as to the identity of the voices. Justice Sperling admitted the transcripts, relying in part on s 48 of the Evidence Act. His Honour did not consider s 79, citing Menzies and Butera as authority for the following proposition:
	


Where a tape is indistinct, a transcript made by an “ad hoc expert”, being a person qualified only by having listened to the tape many times, may be used for this purpose. That is particularly so where the tape needs to be played over repeatedly before the words uttered could be made out unaided: Menzies at 49 cited in Butera at 188;


	
	Although in Leung the use of the ad hoc expert went beyond an opinion as to the words said on the tape and extended to identifying the person speaking, that was in the context of the important qualification at [45] of the judgment to which I have referred.
	
	
	In a number of decisions since Leung (including Irani) voice identification evidence has been admitted from a police officer who became familiar with the voice of the accused during the course of the investigation. The evidence has not been dealt with in those cases as being that of an ad hoc expert but rather simply as identification evidence given by a person familiar with the relevant voice.
	
	
	On any analysis, those cases are very different from the present case. In Irani, the appellant was convicted of four counts of supplying cocaine. In each case the sale of the drug was alleged to have been made to an undercover informant and recorded by police. The detective who gave voice identification evidence had spent “about two months” listening to recordings of the drug sales to the undercover informant. The detective had played the recordings many times for the purpose of preparing a transcript of them and had spent about four days replaying them to the undercover informant for him to confirm the accuracy of the transcripts.
	
	
	The principal issue in the trial was whether the undercover informant was lying when he identified the appellant as the person involved in the sale of the drugs. The detective’s evidence was that, when the appellant and his co-offender presented themselves at the police station, he “immediately identified their voices”. The evidence was voice identification evidence which the detective was able to give because, before hearing the appellant’s voice at the police station, he had become very familiar with it from repeatedly listening to the tapes. The evidence may well have been admissible without resort to s 79 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In any event, the appellant submits that the present case is distinguishable from Irani since, in that case, the detective had spent two months repeatedly listening to recordings for the purpose of transcribing them. It was that lengthy undertaking, which could not practicably be replicated by the jury, from which he acquired the experience by reason of which he could properly be classified as having ad hoc expertise.
	
	
	The evidence in the present case was admitted on a different premise. The fact in issue was whether the voice on the DHL tapes was the voice of the appellant. Federal Agent Succar professed no prior familiarity with the appellant’s voice and had acquired no specialised experience beyond that which the jury could itself acquire. His only familiarity with the appellant’s voice was that which he acquired for the purpose of constituting himself an ad hoc expert to prove the fact in issue. He did so by listening to the very evidence the Crown intended to put before the jury.
	
	
	As already noted, the Crown acknowledged at the pre-trial directions hearing that the comparison of the 21 disputed DHL calls and the calls from the gaol was a task the jury could (“would have to”) make themselves. Indeed, it appears at that point that the Crown did not consider Federal Agent Succar to have any relevant expertise. Leaving aside his putative specialised knowledge acquired as “an Australian with a Lebanese background”, his assertion of identity was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury. To that extent, his evidence was irrelevant and should not have been received for the reasons explained by the High Court in Smith v R [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650 at [10] to [12].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that reliance on Smith in the present case is misplaced for two reasons. First, it was noted that Federal Agent Succar had listened to a greater number of calls than were made available to the jury. Of the 142 calls listened to by him, only 52 were ultimately tendered in the trial (the Crown explained that the tender of a smaller number of calls was to ensure that details prejudicial to the appellant were not before the jury). That submission entails hindsight reasoning. As already noted, it was initially acknowledged by the Crown at the trial that the jury could make the relevant comparison itself and that there would be no expert evidence. The Crown’s decisions to qualify Federal Agent Succar as an expert, and then to tender fewer calls than he had listened to, came after that concession was made.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown submitted that Federal Agent Succar was better placed than the jury to make the voice comparison because of “his knowledge and experience with Arabic persons speaking English”. It is necessary to consider whether that cultural experience took the matter any further. In his statement, Federal Agent Succar said:
	


Arabic is my second language. I was born in Australia and attended School and University in the NSW Education System.

In 2004, I completed a degree in Business and Computing, whereby I studied Arabic as an elective subject. I can say that I have a moderate proficiency in the Arabic language, whereby I am fluent in conversational Arabic. My Arabic reading and writing are at a very basic level.

During the course of my duties as a Federal Agent, I have often been called upon by other AFP members to use my Arabic language skills and to provide language assistance during meetings with Arabic speaking community members who wish to provide information to the AFP about possible criminal activities and community engagements. I have also used by Arabic language skills during other operational duties, such as search warrants.

I am familiar with conversational Arabic and the requirement to develop the guttural tones associated with pronouncing letters in the Arabic alphabet, Arabic numbers and Arabic words. I observe that once developed, the guttural tones can transpose into the pronunciations of English words. A person, who has a proficiency in Arabic, may speak English in a way that is consistent with a person who has developed guttural tones as a result from speaking Arabic over an extended period.


	
	The terms of the opinion expressed to be based on that specialised knowledge are set out earlier in this judgment. The opinion went little further in identifying particular features of the voice on the recordings than to note the use of the word “youse”. The use of that term is now recognised by the Macquarie Dictionary as the colloquial, albeit non-standard, form of the personal pronoun for the second person (both plural and singular). It is hardly a unique feature of speech.
	
	
	In his evidence, Federal Agent Succar expanded upon the issue of pronunciation, referring to the guttural tones that are required to speak the Arabic language that “may transpose into the way they speak English”. Implicitly, the contention was that, by reason of his upbringing in a Lebanese family in Australia, the completion of a unit of Arabic as an elective subject in an unrelated degree and the use of his Arabic language skills during community engagements as a police officer, Federal Agent Succar had specialised knowledge of the sound of English spoken by an Australian with a Lebanese accent. On its own, that specialised knowledge (if properly characterised as such) would not have qualified him to give evidence of an opinion as to whether the voice on the DHL tapes was that of the appellant but only as to whether it was the voice of an Australian speaking English with a Lebanese accent. It is doubtful whether that is an issue for expert opinion evidence.
	
	
	In my view, the voice identification evidence of Federal Agent Succar was inadmissible.
	


Concession in closing address


	
	Before determining what flows from that conclusion, brief reference should be made to the remaining three grounds of appeal. Each relates to the fact that, in his closing address, counsel for the appellant made a concession as to all but one of the disputed DHL calls. The appellant alleges that the concession was made by the barrister without instructions.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal based on that allegation are:
	



	
	the appellant’s convictions constitute a miscarriage of justice in that the trial was unfair on the grounds that Counsel made concessions as to the voice identification evidence contrary to the appellant’s right to a fair trial under s 80 of the Constitution and the common law;
	
	
	the appellant’s convictions constitute a miscarriage of justice in that the trial was unfair on the grounds that Counsel made concessions as to the voice identification evidence that deprived the accused of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open;
	
	
	the appellant’s convictions constitute a miscarriage of justice in that the trial was unfair on the grounds that Counsel made concessions as to the voice identification evidence that amounted to material defect or irregularity in the trial.
	



	
	The relevant part of the closing address by the appellant’s barrister was as follows:
	


Essentially, what I took from the Crown’s submissions to you today was that there were two killer pieces of evidence, so to speak. Words were used that the Crown case comes together with a particular DHL call, and that was to the person on the switchboard by the name of Marte. Also, you will know from the Crown’s submissions that the 666 mobile telephone number was assigned particular importance to the proving of the Crown case.

I respectfully agree that those two pieces of evidence are key in this case. The DHL calls really are the key. Again, because it has never been the role of the accused to prove anything, it has always been the Crown’s role, and the Crown has been in a disadvantageous position not knowing what would be submitted on behalf of the accused. Let me make it clear that the submission is not being made that the person in the DHL calls is not the person in the other recorded calls that you had before you, except for the one call, and that’s the call on 11 January at 3.25. This is a matter for you and only you.

You have some evidence from Agent Succar about his opinion as to whether the voices are the same. On behalf of the accused I ask you to listen to the voice on that call and the other calls and make up your own minds. If after you listen to that call you find yourself agreeing with the substance of the submission, that that is not the accused person, then there develops real problems with the Crown’s argument, or submission, that the accused person was directing others, or getting others to act for him.


	
	In the absence of the jury, the judge then sought to confirm that she had correctly understood the import of the concession, as follows:
	


HER HONOUR:   Mr Biscoe, I just wanted to make sure I understand your position about the calls because the way you put it was different than I anticipated. Is it your position that it is not disputed that it is the accused’s voice in 20 of the DHL calls, but not the one that you have singled out?

BISCOE:       That is so, your Honour. That is right.

HER HONOUR:    All right. So in terms of giving a voice identification warning about Agent Succar’s evidence, you really just want it to focus on that one call?

BISCOE:       That is so.


	
	In accordance with that exchange, the judge gave the jury the conventional warning as to identification evidence but confined it to the single call referred to by the barrister in his closing address. Before giving that warning, her Honour said “the accused does not dispute that he was the caller in 20 of the 21 calls” (SU18).
	
	
	The appellant swore an affidavit in the appeal stating that he did not give the barrister any instructions to admit that it was his voice on any of the DHL calls in evidence at the trial. He said that he was not asked about that matter by the barrister and did not give instructions for any concessions to be made regarding those calls. He was cross-examined by the Crown and did not resile from that evidence.
	
	
	The barrister was called by the Crown to give evidence in the appeal. He rejected the appellant’s affidavit evidence as being not truthful. However, the barrister acknowledged that he had no specific recollection of discussing with the appellant “accepting that it was the appellant’s voice in the 20 DHL calls” as to which the barrister made the concession to the jury (T8.22). He also acknowledged that any discussion as to “what was going to be able to be said on the appellant's behalf in the closing address” was “very, very limited” owing to the pressures the barrister was under at that point in the trial.
	
	
	On the strength of the barrister’s evidence, which impressed me as being both careful and frank, I am persuaded that the barrister’s concession made in closing address at the trial was not discussed with the appellant and that the appellant did not at any point indicate his agreement to the making of that concession.
	
	
	The result is that the voice identification evidence was not only wrongly admitted but was also not the subject of the required warning. The warning was given as to one of the 21 calls but its impact must have been dramatically diluted by the concession as to the other 20. The exchange between the trial judge and the barrister set out above and the content of the judge’s summing up suggest that her Honour had prepared on the basis that a careful and comprehensive warning should be given as to all of that material but, in the event, her Honour was expressly told it was not necessary to give that warning.
	
	
	In the particular circumstances of this case, once it is accepted that the concession was made without instructions, it is unnecessary to decide whether it was within counsel’s authority to make such a concession. The expert voice identification evidence having been wrongly admitted, the concession was made in a forensic context counsel should not have had to face. The unfairness to the accused was compounded by the fact that the judge did not extend the warning to all of the calls, which in turn was directly due to the concession. The combination of those circumstances has persuaded me that the trial miscarried. In light of that conclusion, I do not think it is necessary to determine the difficult question raised by ground 2. The substance of grounds 3 and 4 is effectively folded within what follows.
	


Application of the proviso


	
	The Crown submitted that, even if ground 1 were decided in favour of the appellant, the Court would nonetheless conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred and would accordingly exercise its power under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300, this Court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. In Weiss at [41], the High Court said that the appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence (that is, the whole of the record of the trial) and determine whether, making due allowance for the natural limitations of proceeding on the record, the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt. The Court said:
	


There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognizing that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself.


	
	In Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v R [2012] HCA 14; 246 CLR 92 at [22], the High Court acknowledged the prospect of cases in which, although persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, an appellate court should nonetheless hold that the proviso is not engaged. The examples given were the case of a significant denial of procedural fairness or the case of a failure in a trial by judge alone to comply with a statutory requirement to give reasons.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there is nothing about the present case or the grounds of appeal that would prevent the application of the proviso. I do not accept that submission. If both the voice identification evidence of Federal Agent Succar and the concession made by the barrister during his closing address are removed from consideration, the independent assessment of the evidence by this Court necessarily requires the undertaking of a task in all likelihood never undertaken by the jury in the present case. The Crown submitted that the appellant’s assertion that the jury “quite likely simply relied upon the concession and the evidence of Agent Succar” is “pure speculation”. I do not agree. The temptation to do so must have been overwhelming in the circumstances. Whilst care must be taken in reading too much into the length of time of a jury’s deliberations, it may be observed that the jury in the present case returned with verdicts of guilty to all charges less than two hours after retiring to deliberate.
	
	
	It should be acknowledged that, apart from the DHL tapes, the Crown relied on a considerable body of circumstantial evidence but I do not think it was seriously suggested that this Court could consider the proviso on that limited basis. As noted in Weiss, the proviso must be considered by reference to the whole of the record of the trial.
	
	
	It is clear that, in the present case, the task invited by the Crown would require this Court to listen to the 21 DHL tapes and the 52 gaol tapes tendered in the trial in order to determine a factual issue which the jury was, in effect, told it did not have to determine. That is not a situation contemplated in the principles stated in Weiss. It requires a new factual determination.
	
	
	The issue whether this Court should undertake that task has some analogy with an issue considered by the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal, (albeit in a different context) in R v Compton and Barrett [2013] SASCFC 134; 237 A Crim R 177. The appellants were each convicted of the rape of a boy. The grounds of appeal alleged a misdirection (ground 1) and that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory and could not be supported having regard to the evidence (ground 2). In support of ground 2, counsel for one of the appellants invited the Court to view an audio-visual record of the evidence of the complainant at trial. It was submitted that the appellate court, in considering the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground, should form its own view as to his credibility and reliability.
	
	
	The Court did not consider it appropriate to embark upon that course (at [158] per Stanley J; Kourakis CJ and Peek J agreeing at [24] and [26] respectively). Justice Stanley said:
	


Exercising the circumspection called for by the Court of Appeal in El Moustafa and approved by the majority in SKA, I do not consider it appropriate that this Court embark on that course, even if empowered to do so. To do so would involve the expenditure of considerable time and resources on the part of this Court. More importantly, the exercise threatens the constitutional role of the jury in circumstances which would not necessarily result in a more accurate assessment of the complainant’s evidence than that made by the jury. The obligation of this Court to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence, for the purpose of considering and determining this ground of appeal, as described by the High Court in M v R, does not require that we do so. To do so would be tantamount to disregarding the considerations, identified in M v R, that it is the jury which is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and it has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the course pressed upon us involves an invitation to this Court to substitute its own assessment of the reliability and credibility of the complainant based on our assessment of his demeanour, for that of the jury, rather than undertaking an assessment of the evidence that was before the jury as to its sufficiency and quality.


	
	Without viewing the video, the Court rejected ground 2, holding that the matters raised concerning the complainant’s reliability did not preclude satisfaction of the appellants’ guilt (at [162]). Ground 1 having been upheld (by majority), the Court accordingly ordered a retrial rather than entering a verdict of acquittal.
	
	
	Although the Court was there concerned with an unreasonable verdict ground rather than the application of the proviso, the concerns articulated by Stanley J reinforce my concerns in the present case. I do not think s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should be understood to contemplate, let alone dictate, that an appellate court should be, in effect, the first tribunal of fact to undertake the comparison of the voice on the DHL tapes with the voice on the gaol tapes unadorned by the voice identification evidence or the concession of counsel.
	
	
	For those reasons, the orders I propose are:
	



	
	that the appeal against conviction be allowed;
	
	
	that the conviction be quashed;
	
	
	that there be a new trial;
	
	
	that the Crown appeal be dismissed.

2767225,R v Badger [2015] NSWSC 985,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Nicholas Badger has made a release application under the provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW), as amended by the Bail Amendment Act 2014 (NSW). The application relates to two distinct offences or series of offences. First, he seeks bail in relation to a charge of receiving, which was committed on 28 March 2013 and in relation to which he was dealt with in the Local Court and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months. That sentence is to expire on 7 October 2015, it having commenced on 7 July (or 8 July perhaps). In relation to that matter the applicant has lodged a severity appeal to the District Court, which is currently listed for hearing on 7 August in Gosford.
	
	
	The second series of offences is far more serious and relate to an incident or incidents which occurred on 11 October 2014. As a result of those incidents, Mr Badger was charged with two offences of armed robbery; the weapon in question being a knife and also with offences of stealing from a dwelling, larceny of a motor car and possession of prohibited drugs - two counts relating respectively to amphetamines and cannabis.
	
	
	Simply by stating the offences themselves, one can see their seriousness, but when one looks at the facts on sentence, which appear at this stage not to be disputed, one can see that they are, indeed, very serious offences and offences in relation to which a custodial sentence is either inevitable or very, very close to inevitable. The sentencing exercise will be guided by the Court of Criminal Appeal’s guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 11; 46 NSWLR 346.
	
	
	The Crown points to the fact that the sentence will, as I say, almost inevitably result in a further period of custody for the applicant and that in those circumstances, there is a significant risk that if he is granted bail, he will fail to appear. There is also a risk, according to the prosecution submissions, of the applicant committing further offences. That risk arises as a result of what apparently is a significant drug problem that the applicant has struggled with over many years.
	
	
	The applicant proposes in his release application that he go into a full-time rehabilitation program and to that end, on two previous occasions, judges of this Court have made orders for a drug and alcohol report. On 16 February 2015 McCallum J adjourned the bail application to 21 April 2015 and ordered a drug and alcohol report and on 21 April 2015 Hidden J adjourned the application until today and ordered a drug and alcohol report.
	
	
	Throughout that period the applicant has remained in custody and there is at least a certain amount of irony in the fact that it is now put against him (and I should say properly put), that because the sentence hearing will be relatively soon, there is little purpose in granting him bail. That submission, as I say, is a proper one to make in the circumstances, but it has to be balanced against the fact that the applicant has been before the Court, both in February and April of 2015 seeking bail.
	
	
	In any event, I now have before me a report from the Australian Council of Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. It is not necessary to go through the details of that report, but the critical features are that it is a recognised and well established program, which has enjoyed a degree of success in dealing with clients suffering from significant drug and alcohol problems. Mr Badger clearly falls into that category. Secondly, it says that there is currently available to him a bed in a full-time rehabilitation program at the Canton Beach Family Addictions Recovery Centre Residential Program.
	
	
	Further, I was provided with a moving letter from the applicant’s mother, Dereen Badger. Mrs Badger’s letter is a realistic one, in that she acknowledges the problems that her son has had over a number of years in spite of the fact that he had been raised in a family with “good morals and good values”. She acknowledges that he “made poor choices”. She acknowledges that he had earlier essentially failed, notwithstanding his best intentions, to complete rehabilitation courses and says that at that stage he was very vulnerable.
	
	
	When first approached by the Legal Aid lawyers, Mrs Badger was not prepared to support her son’s bail application because she felt that he was in a critical stage of his, as she puts it, “ice addiction” and she did not want him to think that she condoned his actions or his addiction. Since that time she has noticed changes in him and, in particular, the remorse that has been expressed and positive steps that he has taken whilst in custody.
	
	
	He said things to her like, “It’s never too late to change” and that he understands that his “recovery journey” will be a long one. She says that her family will be supportive of him, whatever be the result and also notes that he has indicated a desire to remove a number of what I might respectfully call unsightly facial tattoos because, “they are a constant reminder of his very poor choices”. Mrs Badger is prepared to offer a surety, so certain is she now that he will comply with any conditions of bail that are imposed in his struggle against drug use.
	
	
	He was not called to give evidence, but his solicitor asked him in open Court about his drug use in gaol; it being observed that he has been in custody since 8 November 2014. He was directly asked the question whether or not he had used drugs in custody. As I sat here awaiting his answer, I fully expected his answer to be no, whereupon I would have given it very little weight, because what else would he say? In fact, what he said was that when he first went into custody he did use drugs initially and he said he did so for a few days, but since then had stopped using drugs and had availed himself of what I gather to be fairly limited opportunities for rehabilitation.
	
	
	I have to say that I found that answer, particularly the fact that he acknowledged using drugs, knowing full well that I was listening, to be a refreshingly honest response by the applicant and it has persuaded me that his application at least has some considerable merit. But, we remain in the situation where the Crown opposes bail for the very cogent reason that at some point in the future he will be incarcerated as a result of the robbery offences.
	
	
	There is some tension in a number of the authorities on this subject so that, for example, in a case called R v McLeod (Supreme Court (NSW), 13 April 1994, unrep), Mathews J said:
	


“The rehabilitation program is a very long one, as the applicant is well aware. Indeed, that is one of the reasons for seeking that I send him to it now, so that a sentencing Judge’s hands will be virtually tied and the Judge will feel constrained to continue the rehabilitation order. That, as I perceive it, is not the function of a bail application.”


	
	That was a decision made under the Bail Act 1978 (NSW), but the sentiments remain pertinent. On the other hand, in a bail application decided by Schmidt J (R v Aaron Paul (Supreme Court (NSW), 28 May 2014, unrep)) her Honour said:
	


“In reaching that conclusion, the question is raised by the Crown as to whether such bail conditions might have an impact on the sentencing exercise to be conducted by the Local Court on 16 June. I have expressed my opinion that given the nature of the provisions of the current legislative scheme and its concern with risk assessment and risk mitigation, which I have discussed, I cannot see how conclusions reached in relation to those statutory concerns can have any impact on the sentencing exercise which will have to be undertaken on 16 June. The sentence will have to be determined on the basis of the relevant evidence led in those proceedings.”


	
	That decision of Schmidt J was made under the Bail Act 2013, but before the significant amendments made by the Bail Amendment Act 2014. Since those amendments, the Court of Criminal Appeal has considered the operation of the amendments on a number of occasions and in a case called DPP v Campbell [2015] NSWCCA 173 the Court was confronted with a somewhat similar situation and said this, para 24:
	


“Rehabilitation is an issue of obvious importance, but given the time between now and when he is to appear for sentence, it is unlikely that much will be achieved that will assist the sentencing Judge to assess his future prospects of successfully ensuring a life of drug and alcohol addiction. There is merit in the Crown submission that allowing the respondent bail so that he can enter a residential rehabilitation program at this point could be perceived as this Court fettering the sentencing Judge’s discretion.”


	
	As I have said, there is real tension between those authorities and it is difficult to reconcile what Schmidt J said with what the Court of Criminal Appeal said. However, it obviously is something that needs to be considered on a case by case basis, and I do not consider myself bound by the remarks that I have just quoted from Campbell, even though in some cases that may be quite persuasive and, indeed, determinative of certain bail applications.
	
	
	Of course, it is a consideration that cuts both ways, as I pointed out in argument, in a case where it was “touch and go” as to whether a custodial or non-custodial sentence should be imposed. A lower Court judicial officer might feel that the refusal of bail in this Court in the weeks and months leading up to the sentencing proceeding was a relevant consideration, exercising the sentencing discretion in them. It should be made clear that anything that this Court does, when considering a bail application, should not in any sense be seen to constrain the sentencing discretion or, to take another instance, the responsibility of a parole board when hearing an application for revocation of parole or reinstatement of parole. Different factors are at play and different legislation guides the determinations to be made in each instance.
	
	
	I wish to make it clear, in view of the decision to which I have ultimately come, that I do not consider that anything I say today should influence the outcome of the sentencing proceedings. What should influence it is the conduct of the applicant in the meantime and the seriousness of the offences with which he has been charged. He acknowledges here today, and his lawyer acknowledges here today, that he will be sent to gaol in due course.
	
	
	I have to consider, in determining his application whether or not the legitimate bail concerns that have been raised by the prosecution are unacceptable risks for the purpose of the operation of ss 18 and 19 of the Bail Act as amended. Section 18 provides me with an exhaustive list of considerations to be taken into account in formulating that conclusion.
	
	
	As with all such lists, there are things that go both ways. It seems, from the letter of his mother that the applicant has good community ties. The offences for which he is to be sentenced are of an extremely serious nature. The prosecution case is so strong that the applicant has admitted his guilt in relation to the matter.
	
	
	The applicant, surprisingly perhaps, given what I understand to be his long standing drug addiction, does not have a criminal record of any great magnitude, and in New South Wales at least appears to have no offences of violence on his record. He also has an interstate record, some of which includes offences of violence in Victoria, going back a number of years. But, on the whole, given the concession he makes as to his drug problem, his record is not a bad one.
	
	
	There is no suggestion, as I understand it, of his committing serious offences whilst on bail or non-compliance with such conditions. Whilst it is not clear on any of the evidence, I am prepared to assume, given his involvement in drugs, that he has criminal associates. The question then is how long he has to spend in custody. That is how it is put in s 18(1)(h) of the Bail Act. If one starts from today, it is probable, I suppose that he will be sentenced in the next couple of months, as the Crown Prosecutor puts it. His matter is for mention in the District Court this week and one would expect there to be a sentence date in the next six to eight weeks, although one cannot be certain.
	
	
	I do not think that the Act should be construed to start from today. The fact of the matter is he has been in custody since 8 November 2014 and will remain in custody if bail is refused, until September or October, coming on to a period of 12 Months. So, he will spend a lengthy period of time in custody. As I have said, he has twice before come to the Court seeking bail, but because the drug and alcohol report was not ready and because of the lengths of adjournments and delays in this list, he has ended up having his matter dealt with today, in July.
	
	
	As I have said, there is a very strong, if not inevitable, likelihood that a custodial sentence will be imposed. Sub-paragraph (j) is relevant to a resolution of the application concerning the sentence imposed in the Local Court for receiving. Again, in view of the fact that I do not want to be seen to be fettering the discretion of the District Court Judge who deals with that severity appeal, I should be somewhat circumspect in what I say.
	
	
	But, as is pointed out by his solicitor, the imposition of a three month full-time gaol sentence for an offence of receiving, committed in 2013 for a person with quite a short criminal history, at first blush appears to be a very stern sentence. Indeed, such a sentence should only be imposed once a Court had considered s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and a finding that it was the only suitable or available or reasonable sentence, given the facts. In the circumstances, I think the prospects of success are quite good.
	
	
	The applicant has some need to be free to prepare for his Court case, but certainly, another lawful reason would be his attempt at rehabilitation. The views of the victims have not been made known to me, although one might expect, given the nature of the facts that they would be concerned if he is released.
	
	
	All of those things considered in balance and taking into account the very cogent submissions made on behalf of the Crown, I have come to the view that the bail concerns that I have can be ameliorated or mitigated by the types of conditions that Mr Shukoor proposes on behalf of Mr Badger and I propose to grant him conditional bail.

2767227,New South Wales Crime Commission v Cresnar [2015] NSWSC 1304,"Judgment – Ex Tempore


	
	HER HONOUR: This is an application brought by the NSW Crime Commission for a restraining order pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) and related relief.
	
	
	The Act provides that the Commission may apply for such an order ex parte. Section 10A(4) provides that if the Court thinks fit it may nonetheless require the Commission to give notice of the application to certain persons. Having considered the material in support of the application, I do not consider it either necessary or appropriate to require the Commission to do so.
	
	
	Determination of the application is governed by s 10A(5). That section provides that if certain conditions are satisfied the Supreme Court must make a restraining order. The requirements of the section are, first, that there be in support of the application an affidavit sworn by an authorised officer deposing to certain things.
	
	
	The present application is supported by an affidavit sworn by Jonathon Lee Spark on 20 July 2015. Mr Spark is an authorised officer for the purpose of the Act and has, in the affidavit, deposed to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity within the meaning of the Act; namely, receiving corrupt commissions or rewards contrary to ss 249B(1)(a) and (1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The affidavit annexes a statement of facts prepared by the Independent Commission Against Corruption setting out the circumstances of an investigation into a series of alleged corrupt benefits received by the defendant in the context of his being employed as the person responsible for awarding contracts in the cable laying division of Ausgrid. The statement of facts recites a series of exchanges with different companies to which the defendant is alleged to have awarded very substantial contracts in exchange for very substantial personal benefits received. The benefits allegedly received range from home entertainment equipment, payments towards renovations at the defendant's home, travel and other benefits.
	
	
	Mr Spark’s affidavit deposes to the further fact that he inquired of the author of that statement as to its reliability and provenance. He received in response a letter from the Independent Commission Against Corruption setting out detail as to the basis on which it was contended that the contents of the fact sheet were true to the best of the knowledge and belief of its author. On that basis Mr Spark deposed to the basis for the suspicion held by him.
	
	
	As to the final requirement of the section, on the basis that material, which I have read, I consider that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicions.
	
	
	It follows, in accordance with s 10A(5) of the Act, that the requirements of the section are satisfied and accordingly that I must make the restraining order sought.
	
	
	The Commission also seeks ancillary relief, which I am satisfied is appropriate in the circumstances.
	
	
	For those reasons, I make orders 1 to 8 in the form of order provided by the Commission.

		07 September 2015",2015-07-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767242,Elsleiman v R [2015] NSWCCA 192,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: Following a plea of not guilty and a 12 day jury trial in 2013 in the District Court, the applicant was convicted of the following offence under subsections 307.9(1) and 11.1(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth):
	


“On or about 11 April 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, [Gabriel Elsleiman] did attempt to possess a substance, being a substance that is reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully imported, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity of the substance being a marketable quantity”.


	
	The offence arose out of the intended shipment from the United States to the applicant’s motor vehicle workshop in South Strathfield, Sydney, of a motor vehicle engine containing a pure net weight of 1,720.2 grams of cocaine secreted in seven canisters. Authorities in the United States seized the consignment and despatched it to Australia after removing the cocaine. Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) Agents then substituted an inert white powder in the canisters, reconstructed the consignment and delivered it to the workshop. The applicant removed the canisters from the engine and delivered them to Mohamed Metleg on whose instructions he was acting. The applicant’s case at the trial was that he had, at most, a suspicion that the engine, and the canisters in it, contained illegal substances. The issue at the trial was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had the requisite intention or knowledge applicable to the offence. The Crown presented a circumstantial case to which the applicant responded by giving evidence.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal against his conviction on the ground that the jury’s verdict was “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence” (see s 6(1) of that Act). In determining such a ground of appeal, this Court must make “an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality” and determine “whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty” (SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14] and [11] quoting M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487). The “central question” to be answered in making such an independent assessment is whether the court is satisfied that the applicant is guilty of the offences (SKA v The Queen at [20]).
	
	
	Having made an independent assessment of the record of the trial, I consider, for the reasons stated below, that the Crown proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and that it was thus open to the jury to convict the applicant. Whilst leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should therefore be dismissed.
	


Relevant statutory provisions


	
	The Criminal Code provisions under which the applicant was charged are in the following terms:
	


“307.9 Possessing marketable quantities of border controlled drugs or border controlled plants reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully imported

(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a)   the person possesses a substance; and

(b)   the substance is reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully imported; and

(c)   the substance is a border controlled drug or border controlled plant; and

(d)   the quantity possessed is a marketable quantity.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years or 5,000 penalty units, or both.

(2) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(b) and (d).

(3) The fault element for paragraph (1)(c) is recklessness.

(4) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person proves that he or she neither intended, nor believed that another person intended, to sell any of the border controlled drug or any of the border controlled plant or its products.

(5) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person proves that the border controlled drug or border controlled plant was not unlawfully imported.”

“11.1 Attempt

(1)   A person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.


	
	The following provisions of the Criminal Code concern the fault elements relevant to s 307.9(1):
	


“5.1 Fault elements

(1)   A fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence.

(2)   Subsection (1) does not prevent a law that creates a particular offence from specifying other fault elements for a physical element of that offence.

5.2 Intention

(1)   A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.

(2)   A person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist.

(3)   A person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events.

5.3 Knowledge

A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events.

5.4 Recklessness

(1)   A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if:

(a)   he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and

(b)   having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.”


	
	By reason of these provisions and in the circumstances of this case, and given the manner in which it was conducted by the parties at trial, it was sufficient for the Crown to prove in relation to s 307.9(1)(a) and (c) that the applicant believed that the engine contained a border controlled drug. Whether the applicant had that belief was the sole issue at the trial (see [2] above). As indicated by s 307.9(2) absolute liability applies in relation to s 307.9(1)(b) and (d).
	


Principles applicable to circumstantial cases


	
	As stated by the plurality in R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618, in a circumstantial case, “all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence” (at [46]) and:
	


“48 Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither at trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial case to be considered piecemeal”.


	
	Having emphasised that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Latham and Rothman JJ agreed) stated in Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21; 84 NSWLR 581:
	


“53 At the same time, the trier of fact must bear in mind that a circumstantial case is to be considered holistically: R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [48]-[49] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ). Putting to one side for the moment ‘indispensable’ intermediate facts … it would be wrong for a jury to acquit an accused merely because it harbours reasonable doubts about some inculpatory evidence, though it ignores or unduly minimises other, more compelling evidence of the accused's guilt. As it is often the case that ‘one piece of evidence ... resolves doubts as to another’ (Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] [1984] HCA 7; (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 535 (Gibbs CJ and Mason J)), it is necessary to weigh and consider the totality of the evidence: Hillier at [48]-[49]. In doing so, the finder of fact ought not stretch credulity or engage in tortuous reasoning in order to explain away each and every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence: R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 at [42] (Dunford J); Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55] (Giles JA).

The evidence at the trial


	
	The applicant owned and operated a motor vehicle mechanic and auto electrical business under the name “Strathfield Auto Electrical” at South Strathfield in Sydney. He is a qualified mechanic and auto electrician.
	
	
	He gave evidence that Mohamed Metleg approached him three or four weeks prior to 11 April 2012 (the date of the applicant’s arrest) to discuss the stripping of an engine. He said that he had known Mohamed Metleg for about six months, having met him once or twice through his brother, Omar Metleg, the applicant’s accountant. Roy Malouf, for whom the applicant had done some motor vehicle work, was present when the following conversation occurred.
	


“Well, he approached me about, say, three to four weeks prior to my arrest. He asked me if I was a – ‘I heard you’re a good mechanic.’ I said ‘Yeah’. I go, ‘What do you need done?’ He said, ‘I’ve got a V8 engine I need stripped.’ I said, ‘What do you mean stripped?’ He goes, ‘I need the pistons taken out of them and I’ll give you 500 bucks for them.’ I’m like, ‘Yeah … I can’t – I won’t be able to do it today. Possibly tomorrow. I’m a bit busy today.’ He goes, ‘I don’t need it done today. I will let you know when I need it done’. I’m like, ‘Yep. No worries’” (Transcript pp 316-317).


	
	On 5 April 2012 the United States Customs and Border Protection Service in Nashville, Tennessee, seized a large cardboard box scheduled for consignment to “Ron” at “Motor Sports” at the applicant’s work address in South Strathfield. The DHL Express label on the box described its contents as a “New Chevy 350 Engine” valued at USD $6,900. The Service removed seven steel canisters from the engine containing, in plastic bags, a white powder that subsequently tested positive for cocaine.
	
	
	On 8 April 2012 the Service despatched the engine (in its original packaging but without the white powder) to the AFP in Sydney where it was examined by AFP Crime Scene Scientist Nathan Green on 10 April 2012. His examination revealed that:
	


“(a)   the engine was inoperable;

(b)   the spark plugs had been welded closed;

(c)   the 16 valve heads had been welded shut, which would prevent air from being introduced for combustion and exhaust gases being expelled;

(d)   there were no pistons;

(e)   canisters were inserted inside seven of the chambers, where the pistons would normally be located;

(f)   the canisters did not look like pistons;

(g)   there was one open-ended steel canister in one of the chambers;

(h)   a layer of white or grey residue and a metal plate covered the bottom of the eight chambers;

(i)   the residue and metal plate would inhibit the engine from operating;

(j)   each end of the crank shaft had been cut off and the remainder of the shaft had been welded into position, rendering it inoperable” (Crown’s Written Submissions, [17]).


	
	At 10.59 am on 10 April 2012 a DHL employee in Sydney received a telephone call from a person describing himself as “Ron Bayless” who paid for the taxes associated with the consignment with a credit card. Detective Senior Constable Nilon of the New South Wales Police gave evidence that she believed that “Ron Bayless” was a false name but accepted that there was no evidence that the applicant was the person purporting to be Ron Bayless (Transcript p 294).
	
	
	On 10 or 11 April 2012 Mohamed Metleg and Ray Malouf visited the applicant at his workshop. At Mohamed Metleg’s suggestion, he and the applicant went for a walk to get a coffee. On the applicant’s evidence, the following conversation occurred:
	


“… He said, ‘When can you do that engine?’ I said, ‘Is it ready?’ He said ‘Yep’. I said, ‘Okay. I can probably do it today or tomorrow.’ He said, ‘All right. No worries. I’ll organise for it to be dropped off and take – I’ll organise for it to be dropped off”, and I said then, ‘All right. No worries. Let me know exactly when it comes, that way I can organise time for it.’ He said, ‘Yep. No worries. I will let you know.’ And we just pretty much finished it, finished that is.’

…

[The applicant said] ‘What do you need exactly?’ [to which Mohamed Metleg replied:] ‘Just the pistons taken out of it.’

‘ … I recall that he said, ‘Can you do it today?’ I said, ‘I can’t, I can’t be a hundred – I can’t guarantee that it – I can do it today, though.’ I said I will let him know either today or tomorrow. He goes, ‘Look, if you, if you can do it today for me, I’ll chuck in a bottle of scotch for you. Whisky.’ I laughed and said, ‘Yeah. All right. No worries. I’ll get it done as soon as I can then.’” (Transcript pp 319-320)


	
	At 1:56, 2:56 and 3:57 pm on 11 April 2012 an AFP Agent posing as a DHL employee had three telephone conversations with the person purporting to be Ron Bayless. That person told the Agent that the applicant’s workshop would be open until 5.30 pm for delivery purposes.
	
	
	At 2:53 pm Mohamed Metleg arrived at the workshop and had a conversation with the applicant in the office. He then left (Transcript p 320).
	
	
	At 4.10 pm AFP Agents posing as DHL delivery drivers delivered the reconstructed consignment to the applicant’s workshop. At the time of the delivery the workshop was under electronic surveillance via two video cameras in the rear laneway, two video cameras installed inside the workshop, a listening device in the workshop’s office and a video camera covering the front of the workshop. New South Wales Police Officers and AFP Agents were also conducting physical surveillance.
	
	
	Dominic Dos Santos, the applicant’s only employee at that time, gave evidence that the applicant told him to sign for the delivery. The applicant did not recall making that request but accepted that the surveillance footage shows Dominic Dos Santos signing for the consignment (Transcript p 323).
	
	
	The delivery truck left the workshop at 4.29 pm and at 4.31 pm Mohamed Metleg and Roy Malouf arrived at the rear of the workshop. The applicant was unable to explain how they came to arrive so soon after the delivery truck departed (Transcript pp 345-346).
	
	
	The applicant said that he then had the following conversation with Mohamed Metleg:
	


“[Mohamed Metleg] said, ‘Is the engine here?’ I said, ‘Yep.’ He said, ‘Can you do it - can you do it tonight?’ I said ‘Yep.’ No, sorry. He said ‘Can you do it tonight? What time can you drop off the pistons?’ I said, ‘From 7 to 8.’ He said, ‘Okay.’ Just before he left, he said, ‘Get rid of the paperwork for me’” (Transcript p 323).


	
	The applicant’s evidence was that he understood that he was to remove the pistons and deliver them to Mohamed and Omar Metleg’s house in Greenacre. He said that when he was asked to “get rid of the paperwork” he became “a bit suspicious”:
	


“I just had second thoughts, like, what’s going on? Why does he want me to get rid of the paperwork? But I didn’t think too much into it” (Transcript p 324).


	
	At 4.35 pm and 4.46 pm respectively Dominic Dos Santos and Zac Ahmed (the applicant’s cousin) left the workshop in separate vehicles in order to return one of the cars to a customer. Zac Ahmed was driving a black BMW owned by another customer.
	
	
	At about 5.15 pm the applicant was alone in the workshop and closed the front roller door. Between 5.14 and 5.17 pm the surveillance cameras recorded him removing documents from a clear plastic sleeve on the consignment box and setting fire to them in the workshop using brake cleaner. Once the documents were burnt, the applicant swept up the ashes, placed them in a garbage bin, took the bin outside and emptied its contents into a large wheelie bin.
	
	
	The documents in the sleeve comprised a bill of lading, an invoice and a packing list. Photographs of those documents that were taken when the United States Service seized the consignment show that the documents referred to the consignment of a “New Chevy 350 Engine” to “Motor Sports” at the address of the applicant’s workshop. They also show that, in a prominent position, on the side of the box adjacent to the plastic sleeve containing the bill of lading and other documents, there was a DHL Express document with the words “EXPRESS WORLDWIDE” and “AU – SYD” affixed. The consignee was listed on it as “Ron” at “Motor Sports” at the workshop address in “AUSTRALIA”. The consignor was shown as a person with an address in Merryville, Tennessee, “UNITED STATES”.
	
	
	At 5.24 pm, Zac Ahmed and Dominic Dos Santos arrived back at the workshop in the same black BMW in which Zac Ahmed had earlier left. At 5.50 pm the applicant drove away in the black BMW with Zac Ahmed as his passenger, (on his evidence) leaving the workshop unlocked when he left (Transcript p 325). Dominic Dos Santos appears to have left at or before this time.
	
	
	After three missed calls from Omar Metleg to the applicant’s telephone, the following conversation was recorded at 6.00 pm:
	


“[Applicant]: Yeah

[Omar Metleg]: (unintelligible)

A: Hello

O: Yeah where are you at?

A: Why?

O: Where are you?

A: I’m playing with my dick, what am I doing? I’m at work.

O: How long are you going to be, I want to eat, are you going to be long?

A: Yeah hala I’m on the way, I’ll be there in ten minutes.

O: Yallah, Bye

A: Bye

O: Bye”


	
	In cross-examination, the applicant accepted that the terms of this conversation (particularly the applicant’s response “I’m playing with my dick” to the question “Where are you?”) suggest a degree of familiarity between him and Omar Metleg but asserted that his relationship with Omar Metleg was on a professional level only (Transcript p 401).
	
	
	It appears that the applicant returned to the workshop by himself at 6.33 pm and turned on the lights. It is not clear from the evidence where he had been in the previous half hour.
	
	
	Between 6.34 pm and 6.48 pm an interior surveillance camera filmed the applicant dismantling the engine using various power tools whilst wearing white gloves. He said in evidence that when he saw the canisters inside the engine he knew that they were not pistons and became concerned and worried, and thought that “something wasn’t right here” (Transcript p 327-328). That concern continued until he arrived at the Metlegs’ house with the canisters (Transcript p 359). However, he did not raise that concern with anyone.
	
	
	At 6.48 pm the surveillance camera recorded lights (or a light) in the workshop turning off. The applicant said that an automatic timer had caused them to do this and that only the lights at the back of the workshop, and not those at its front, turned off (Transcript p 329). He said that he did not turn the lights back on because he only had about 10 minutes remaining until he completed removing the canisters. He denied in cross-examination that the surveillance camera recording appears to show a torch being used in this period (Transcript p 383).
	
	
	At 6.52 pm, whilst the applicant was removing the canisters, he received another call from Omar Metleg which was recorded as follows:
	


“A: Hello George speaking

O: How far are you going to be? How long are you going to be?

A: Huh?

O: How long are you going to be?

A: I don’t know. I’ll be there soon.

O: How long?

A: I’ll be there as quick as I can. I don’t know bro.

O: (Speaking to person in background ‘He doesn’t know’. Ten, fifteen, twenty?

A: Fifteen.

O: Fifteen.

A: Bye.

O: Bye.”


	
	The applicant agreed that the name “George” that he used was not his name but denied that he used it to avoid being detected by the authorities (Transcript p 376).
	
	
	Of the eight canisters in the engine, the applicant removed only the seven that were sealed and that contained the inert white powder. The eighth canister was empty and “open ended” and he said that he did not remove it because “it wouldn’t come out” (Transcript p 378). Nathan Green’s evidence was however that each of the canisters was inserted and secured in the same way with the inference being, as asserted by the Crown on appeal, that there was no reason why any canister would be more or less difficult to remove than any other (Transcript pp 80-81).
	
	
	At 6.56 pm the applicant opened the workshop’s rear roller door and placed the canisters in the same black BMW.
	
	
	At 7.01 pm the following telephone conversation between the applicant and Omar Metleg was recorded:
	


“A: Yeah

O: Yeah

A: Yeah

O: No

A: All right, bye

O: Well hey, um …

A: Huh?

O: (Whistling) wait for my call

A: Huh?

O: Just wait for my call

A: Bye

O: Bye”


	
	At 7.05 pm the applicant drove the BMW along the laneway behind his workshop with the headlights turned off. He denied that he did this in order to avoid detection (Transcript p 393), asserting that it was instead “just a habit” (Transcript p 406). He then began to drive to the Metlegs’ house.
	
	
	At 7.13 pm the following telephone conversation between the applicant and Omar Metleg was recorded:
	


“A: Gab?

O: Yeah what are you doing?

A: Nothing, I’m at yours

O: Yeah?”


	
	The applicant gave evidence that when he arrived at the Metlegs’ house Mohamed Metleg, Omar Metleg, Roy Malouf and Mohamed’s aunt were sitting on the front balcony (Transcript p 332). He put the canisters on the balcony floor and said: “They’re the – that’s what you wanted?” to which Mohamed Metleg responded “All right” (ibid). Roy Malouf then handed the applicant $500 and the applicant took the bottle of whisky that was there for him (ibid).
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that, as he was leaving the Metlegs’ house, Roy Malouf told him that he wanted to go back to the workshop and pick up the rest of the engine parts. He said that he did not ask Roy Malouf why he needed to do this that night because he “just wanted to get it out of the way” and that although it was “inconvenient” he wanted to “get rid of the stuff so I can start tomorrow afresh” (Transcript pp 334, 361, 359).
	
	
	At 7.36 pm the applicant arrived back at the front of the workshop followed by Roy Malouf in another vehicle. At 7.38 pm a hidden listening device in the workshop recorded the following conversations between the two:
	


“V1: Where am I going to move it

V2: Huh

V1: Where am I going to move

V2: Where

V1: It’s in a holding space

V2: Where are you going to move the car to?

V1: I’ll do it now. Can you fit?

V2: Nah I can’t. Move the car ya fuckin idiot.

[The applicant was then observed to move a white Camry and Roy Malouf reversed his white utility into the workshop. The applicant put on a pair of white gloves].

V1: Look, Look

V2: Cuz, do me a favour

V1: Anything

V2: Shut the fucking roller door

V1: Shut it?

V2: I didn’t say lock it, shut it

V1: I don’t know what you’re talking about

[The applicant then lowered the rear roller door].

V1: Look, … look this is what you do. Everything in this box, that way it’s covered. This is not heavy enough … This one, lift it up, chuck everything in it.

V2: What the fuck are you gonna do with this box? Burn them you dickhead

V1: Where am I gonna burn em? I can’t burn em here.

V2: Out the back

V1: Where?

V2: In the laneway there … the trick is in the thing there (inaudible) … fuckin’ box how am I going to carry the box.

V1: The box, all right, you know what to do? That was when you put these here … there’s always cars out in this lane.

V2: Yeah alright.

V1: You cover it. So you can hide everything in here.”


	
	The applicant said in evidence that he thought that he was “V1” and he expressly identified Roy Malouf as the maker of the statements “Do me a favour, shut the fucking roller door” and “Move the car you fucking idiot” (Transcript p 334).
	
	
	The applicant agreed in cross-examination that at that stage he was not intending to do anymore work that night but when asked why he put gloves on he said “because I’m touching the engine, I’m working” and:
	


“I wasn’t doing anymore work, but like I said, I don’t like to get my hands greasy and oily stuff, which is why I am wearing gloves again, because I am about to touch an engine” (Transcript p 394).


	
	The following exchange then occurred between the applicant and the Crown:
	


“Q.   Is it your evidence that every single time you touch a part of a car engine you put gloves on?

A   Not every single time, but when I’m doing, for example, heavy engine work, yes, I’m putting gloves on.

Q.   But, sir, this isn’t heavy engine work.

A.   Well it is, it’s dismantling a full engine.

Q   But you have already just dismantled the engine, sir.

A.   I know, but I’m approaching it again, I’m touching it again, like …

Q.   I’m going to suggest to you that the reason you put your white gloves on was so that there weren’t any fingerprints of yours on that engine.

A.   No, it’s not true” (Transcript pp 394-395).


	
	At 7.41 pm the police entered the workshop through the front roller door to execute a search warrant and arrest the applicant. On entering, the police shouted:
	


“Police.” “Search warrant.” “Stay where you are.” “Don’t move.” [and] … “Go on the ground” (Transcript p 169).


	
	Senior Constable Hill, who was about the third or fourth to enter the workshop, gave evidence that the two men in the workshop (the applicant and Roy Malouf) “both sort of looked up at us” before the applicant ran away into the workshop office, closing the door behind him (Transcript p 173). Two police officers pursued him and attempted to open the door, which appeared to be jammed in some way. When they entered, the applicant complied with their instructions to lie on the floor with his hands out.
	
	
	The applicant did not have gloves on when the police entered the workshop office. He said that he could not recall when he took them off but denied that he had done so to avoid an inference that he had committed an offence (Transcript pp 396-397). He said that he ran away when the police entered because he thought that he was being robbed, but he agreed that the words “police” “stop” “search warrant” could be heard on the relevant video recording of the police entry (Transcript p 396).
	
	
	A subsequent execution of a search warrant at the Metlegs’ house located a handwritten note that recorded the consignment number, the consignee’s address as “Motor Sports” at the applicant’s workshop, the credit card number given to DHL to pay for the taxes and other information.
	
	
	On appeal, the Crown’s written submissions summarised the evidence given at the trial concerning the value of the cocaine contained in the canisters as follows:
	


“16 Evidence from a senior AFP agent with experience in valuing narcotics established that the concealed cocaine was valued as follows:

(a)   the street value in Australia as at April 2012 was between AUD $1.2 million and AUD $1.3 million;

(b)   the wholesale value in Australia as at April 2012 was about AUD $550,000; and

(c)   The wholesale value in the United States of America as at April 2012 was between AUD $20,000 to AUD $25,000”.

The Crown’s submissions on appeal


	
	The Crown’s written submissions summarised the matters that it contends support the jury’s verdict as:
	



	
	although present at the time the consignment was delivered, the applicant instructed his employee, Dominic Dos Santos, to sign for the delivery;
	
	
	the applicant would have been aware from the labels and documents on the cardboard box and the description of the consignor and the contents, that the consignment had been imported from overseas;
	
	
	the applicant would have been aware from the labels and documents on the cardboard box that the consignment was addressed to a person, Ron, and a business name, Motor Sports, which were not associated with him or the delivery address in South Strathfield;
	
	
	the stated description of the contents and value of the consignment, ‘New Chevy 350 engine’ and ‘USD $6,900’ respectively, were at odds with the actual contents, namely a reconditioned, inoperable engine with multiple mechanical anomalies;
	
	
	the instructions from Mohamed Metleg to strip the pistons were at odds with the stated description of the contents and value of the consignment;
	
	
	the instruction from Mohamed Metleg to ‘get rid of the paperwork for me’ in conjunction with the applicant’s evidence that he acted on this instruction by destroying the documents associated with the consignment;
	
	
	the applicant’s dispatch of Mr Dos Santos and his cousin from the workshop, sending them on errands, before he commenced destroying the consignment documents and before he commenced disassembling the engine;
	
	
	the applicant’s incineration of the bill of lading, the invoice and the packing list associated with the consignment by spraying brake cleaner on the documents, re-applying that agent to keep the documents burning, using his feet and hands to push the documents into the flame to ensure that no skerrick of them remained and disposal of the ashes into a large industrial bin;
	
	
	the discovery by the applicant of numerous mechanical anomalies which rendered the engine inoperable, including welded spark plugs, welded valve heads, the absence of pistons, the presence of metal canisters in the chambers, the metal plate covering the bottom of the eight chambers and the shortened and welded crank shaft;
	
	
	the discovery by the applicant of a layer of white or grey cement or plaster residue covering the bottom of the eight chambers;
	
	
	the inconsistency between the applicant’s evidence that he was instructed to remove and deliver pistons and his discovery that there were no pistons and his concession that the canisters he extracted did not look like pistons, from which it can be inferred that the applicant well understood that his task related to the extraction and delivery of the concealed substance and not pistons;
	
	
	the fact that the applicant removed only the seven canisters which contained a concealed substance and left in situ the empty open-ended canister, from which it can be inferred that the applicant knew precisely which of the objects inside the engine he was required to extract and deliver and that the only item of interest was the substance concealed inside the seven closed canisters;
	
	
	working by himself after normal business hours and in partial darkness, from which it can be inferred that the applicant did not want to be observed dismantling the engine and extracting the canisters;
	
	
	wearing gloves when dealing with the engine and the cardboard box in which it was delivered;
	
	
	proceeding with the removal of the canisters, despite his evidence that he was ‘concerned’, ‘worried’, ‘did not know what they were’ and ‘thought something wasn’t right’ [at least] from the time he had discovered the canisters, the numerous mechanical anomalies and the residue of white or grey cement or plaster;
	
	
	despite the concerns about which the applicant gave evidence, he did not mention those concerns, the absence of pistons, the discovery of metal canisters, the white plaster of Paris-like substance he had observed or the engine’s mechanical anomalies in the telephone conversations with Omar Metleg at 6:52pm, 7:01pm or 7:13pm or at the meeting with Mohamed Metleg, Omar Metleg and Roy Malouf on the balcony at the Metlegs house;
	
	
	using the false name “George” when he answered the telephone call from Omar Metleg at 6:52pm;
	
	
	the coded, cryptic and allusive nature of the telephone conversation with Omar Metleg at 7:01pm;
	
	
	the use of a customer’s car, including travelling for some distance in that car at night-time with the headlights switched off;
	
	
	returning to the workshop with Roy Malouf, at approximately 7:36pm, to remove and destroy the consignment packaging;
	
	
	attempting to minimise the extent of his relationship with Mohamed Metleg, Omar Metleg and Roy Malouf, which is contrary to the tenor and content of their interactions. This establishes that the applicant was very close to, familiar with and entrusted by the others involved with the consignment;
	
	
	attempting to flee from the Police, despite the evidence establishing that when the Police entered the workshop they yelled “Police”, “Search warrant”, “Stay where you are”, “Don’t move” and “Go on the ground”, that the applicant looked directly at them and that the Police were wearing Police overalls with the word POLICE emblazoned prominently on the chest; and
	
	
	inferences arising from the value of the concealed drugs and the apparent trust placed in the applicant by others to extract and deliver the concealed substance.
	



	
	The Crown’s written submissions place particular emphasis on the following matters:
	



	
	the applicant’s extraction of the canisters when his evidence was that he was engaged to remove pistons, and it was obvious that no pistons were present in the engine;
	
	
	the way in which the canisters had been secured in the engine, with a cement or plaster of Paris substance and a secured metal plate;
	
	
	the obvious mechanical anomalies which would have clearly indicated that the engine was inoperable;
	
	
	the applicant’s destruction of the key consignment documents by incineration, and disposal of the ashes;
	
	
	the applicant’s discussion with Roy Malouf about disposal of the cardboard box;
	
	
	the applicant’s attempt to evade the Police; and
	
	
	the apparent trust placed in the applicant by Mohamed Metleg, who on the applicant’s evidence he had met only once or twice, by entrusting him with the extraction and delivery of cocaine with a potential street value of $1.2 to $1.3 million.
	



	
	The Crown pointed out that the importers had left the applicant in sole control of the drugs from about 4.30 pm until 7.00 pm on 11 April 2012. In oral argument, the Crown again emphasised the unlikelihood of importers of drugs with a street value in the order of $1.3 million engaging, then leaving the drugs with, someone who was not complicit in the enterprise and whom the apparent principal (Mohamed Metleg) had only met once or twice before. The Crown submitted that it was highly unlikely that the importers would have taken the risk that on ascertaining that the canisters were not pistons the applicant might have disposed of them in ignorance of their value or might have reported what had occurred to the police.
	


The applicant’s submissions on appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that the matters relied upon by the Crown did “no more than support an inference that at some point during the deconstruction [of the engine], the [a]pplicant became suspicious about what the canisters contained” (Applicant’s Written Submissions, [77]). Although acknowledging that a circumstantial case requires the evidence to be considered as a whole, the applicant understandably addressed the individual matters that the Crown relied upon, asserting their irrelevance or seeking to minimise their significance.
	
	
	First, the applicant submitted that there was no evidence that he was aware of many of the matters relied upon by the Crown, for example, the fictitious consignee name and business (“Ron” and “Motor Sports”) and the role of the fictitious person “Ron Bayless”. This does not however render those matters irrelevant. Evidence of them properly formed part of the large volume of material that the jury was required to consider in order to assess the applicant’s conduct and determine whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant believed that the consignment contained border controlled drugs.
	
	
	The applicant particularly emphasised that there was no evidence that he had read any of the documentation associated with the engine or was otherwise aware that the engine had been shipped from overseas. It was however open to the jury to conclude that the applicant must have read, or at least have seen, sufficient parts of the shipping documents which he burned for him to appreciate that the shipment was from the United States. The surveillance footage showing the applicant holding the documents out in front of him before he burned them (Exhibit DD, Transcript p 324). As well, immediately adjacent to the plastic sleeve from which he removed those documents was a prominent bar code document clearly indicating that the shipment was from overseas (see [25] above).
	
	
	In any event, the Crown did not need to prove separately that the applicant knew that the shipment was from overseas. As observed in Wood v R, quoting Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521 at 535, “it is often the case that ‘one piece of evidence resolves … doubts as to another’” (at [53], see [9] above). This is an aspect of the requirement that the evidence be looked at as a whole. Thus, if the remainder of the Crown’s case were regarded as proving the applicant’s knowledge or belief that the engine contained concealed drugs, it could readily be inferred that he obtained that knowledge from Mohamed Metleg or some other participant in the enterprise and that he became aware by the same means that the drugs were border controlled drugs that had been intended to be illegally imported from overseas.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant submitted that it was not of significance that Mohamed Metleg arrived at the applicant’s workshop at 2.53 pm (and again at 4.31 pm) on the very afternoon that the engine was delivered because an obvious possibility was that Mohamed Metleg made arrangements for the delivery. Thus, it was said that there was no inconsistency with the applicant’s case.
	
	
	Fourthly, the applicant submitted that his instruction to Dominic Dos Santos to sign the delivery docket is not of significance because the surveillance video showed that the applicant was busy doing other things when Dominic Dos Santos was signing. However, this submission does not negate the possibility that the applicant instructed Dominic Dos Santos to sign in order to avoid a record of the applicant’s involvement being created.
	
	
	Fifthly, the applicant submitted that his burning of the consignment documents indicates nothing more than a suspicion on his part and in any event that he did not burn the bar code document that was affixed to the box.
	
	
	Sixthly, the applicant submitted that no adverse inference could be drawn from the fact that the applicant drove his customer’s BMW on 11 April 2012.
	
	
	Seventhly, the fact that the lights were turned off at 6.48 pm (if the automatic light switch explanation were rejected), the failure immediately to turn on the car lights, the failure to turn the office lights on (see [31] above), the applicant’s use of the name George and his flight when the police arrived are all equally consistent with the applicant being highly suspicious as they are with him having the relevant knowledge or belief required for the offence.
	
	
	Eighthly, the applicant’s communications with Omar Metleg are said not to be significant because there is no evidence except “for the very phone calls that the Crown rely upon, that Oma[r] Metleg was ever involved in the importation of the Cocaine” (Applicant’s Written Submissions, [99]). However, it was not necessary for the Crown to prove Omar Metleg was involved in the importation. The applicant’s conversations with him stood as part of the evidence against the applicant without it being necessary to draw any conclusion about Omar Metleg’s complicity.
	
	
	Ninthly, the applicant submitted that although “it is demonstrably obvious that [Roy] Malouf was involved in the importation”, there was no evidence that he had any conversation with the applicant about the importation.
	
	
	Tenthly, the applicant submitted that he was closely monitored by the Metlegs and Roy Malouf during the time that he had the engine. This was not however the case between approximately 4.30 pm and 7.00 pm when the applicant had ample opportunity to deal with the cocaine in a manner inconsistent with Mohamed Metleg’s interests or to report the delivery to the police.
	
	
	Eleventhly, the applicant submitted that the applicant’s remuneration for his role in the operation ($500 and a bottle of whisky) was completely inconsistent with his knowing participation in the importation of drugs with a street value in the order of $1.2 million. However, although $845.00 and a bottle of whisky were found in the BMW that the applicant was driving (Transcript p 309), the only evidence of the remuneration was given by the applicant and it was therefore open to the jury to disbelieve him in relation to that (and other matters) as there was no objective or corroborating evidence to support his contention.
	
	
	Twelfthly, the applicant submitted that the proposition that he had no idea what the canisters contained was supported by the fact that it took some hours for the “highly trained United States customs officials, searching for something illegal [to remove] the canisters from the engine” and that they “had no idea what the canisters contain[ed] until such time as they had managed to remove the lid[s]” (Applicant’s Written Submissions, [118]). However, this submission does not answer the Crown’s contention that the whole of the evidence justified the jury’s conclusion that the applicant knew or believed that the engine contained border controlled drugs within the canisters. The Crown’s case did not depend on the applicant’s observation of the canisters in the engine, although that was a material fact because they were clearly not the pistons he had been told to extract. In any event, a comparison with the actions of the United States customs officials is inapt because, whilst no doubt highly trained in searching for drugs, it cannot be assumed that they had a high level of experience in dismantling motor vehicle engines, unlike the applicant who was a trained mechanic.
	


Resolution of the Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	As recorded earlier, my independent assessment of the evidence at the trial leads me to conclude that the Crown proved its case against the applicant beyond reasonable doubt and that the applicant was therefore rightly convicted. In reaching that conclusion, I give weight to the advantage that the jury had over this Court in seeing and hearing the applicant give his evidence and in assessing the whole of the evidence during the course of the 12 day trial. In particular, the jury heard and saw the surveillance footage and recordings, none of which the parties showed or played to this Court. Further, because the applicant’s sole proposed ground of appeal was that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable, it must be assumed that the jury was properly instructed by the trial judge in all respects.
	
	
	Given that the evidence must be looked at in a holistic fashion, it is unnecessary in a case such as the present to identify any single piece of evidence that is inconsistent with the applicant’s innocence. Nevertheless, the evidence of the applicant’s careful destruction of the consignment documents contained in the plastic sleeve affixed to the box containing the engine (see [24] above) is particularly notable. This was powerful evidence against the applicant as the destruction occurred well prior to the applicant dismantling the engine and observing that there were no pistons in it, but instead eight canisters, seven being sealed.
	
	
	Furthermore, the applicant did not seek any explanation (from anyone) of Mohamed Metleg’s instruction to him to “get rid of the paperwork for me”. Instead, he acted upon it in a way that suggested that he had knowledge, or a belief, that the engine contained an illicit substance. The applicant did not simply “get rid of the paperwork” by disposing of it in a nearby bin, he instead set fire to the documents ensuring that they were completely burnt before disposing of the ashes in a wheelie bin in the rear laneway.
	
	
	The applicant gave no adequate explanation for this conduct. Moreover, whilst he conceded that the instruction made him “a bit suspicious”, he did not raise that suspicion in that conversation with Mohamed Metleg, nor in any of the subsequent conversations that he is known to have had that evening. In particular, he did not raise it with Omar Metleg, with whom his recorded communications show that he had a degree of familiarity. Further, he did not suggest that he was too frightened to raise his concerns nor otherwise satisfactorily explain his conduct.
	
	
	I consider the following matters to be particularly significant. I mention them only briefly as they are referred to more fully above, at least once. I do not suggest that any one of them is itself inconsistent with the applicant’s innocence. Rather, it is their cumulative effect, when taken with the applicant’s destruction of the consignment documents and the remainder of the evidence, that constituted a powerful Crown case against the applicant.
	



	
	The applicant’s instruction to his employee to sign for the delivery.
	
	
	The applicant’s failure to communicate to the Metlegs, Roy Malouf or the police the concern that he asserted that he developed when asked to “get rid” of the consignment documents.
	
	
	The similar lack of communication when he again became concerned upon dismantling the engine.
	
	
	The applicant’s removal and delivery of the canisters when he had been asked only to remove and deliver pistons.
	
	
	His failure to remove the canister that was empty.
	
	
	His continuation of work in partial darkness after the workshop lights went off or were turned off.
	
	
	His wearing of gloves when dealing with the engine, including after returning to the workshop with Roy Malouf at 7.36 pm.
	
	
	His removal of the gloves between the time that the police entered the workshop and his arrest.
	
	
	Proceeding with the removal of the canisters despite his asserted concern that something “wasn’t right”.
	
	
	His use of the false name “George” when he answered the telephone call from Omar Metleg at 6.52 pm and his failure to explain why he did so.
	
	
	His driving of the BMW vehicle down the rear lane with its headlights switched off.
	
	
	Engaging in a conversation with Roy Malouf about burning the consignment box on their return to the workshop after the applicant delivered the canisters.
	



	
	To these matters must be added the unlikelihood, as asserted by the Crown, of Mohamed Metleg leaving the valuable consignment in the sole care of the applicant for a number of hours unless he was satisfied that the applicant was privy to the nature of the consignment and willing to deal with it on the intended illicit basis. A similar circumstance was regarded as an important aspect of the circumstantial evidence in Lau v R [2014] NSWCCA 179 at [88].
	


Orders


	
	Leave to appeal should be granted but, for the reasons that I have given, the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the judgment of Macfarlan JA and his Honour's proposed orders. Having undertaken an independent assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied that the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt the applicant's guilt of the offence charged.
	
	
	BUTTON J: Assessing the whole of the evidence in the trial, there was a very powerful circumstantial case against the applicant.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant of the offence of which he was convicted.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA, for the reasons given by his Honour.

		22 July 2015",2015-07-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767244,Glare v R [2015] NSWCCA 194,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Hamill J, for the reasons his Honour gives, that the Crown was correct to concede that the sentence imposed on 23 October 2014 is attended by error, and that a lesser sentence is required. I agree with the aggregate sentence proposed by Hamill J and the indicative sentences indicated by his Honour, and the consequence that the applicant is entitled to be released immediately, in accordance with s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	HAMILL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Cogswell SC in the District Court sitting at Albury on 23 October 2014. He raises two grounds of appeal, each of which has significant merit. The respondent concedes that error is established in relation to the first ground of appeal. The applicant accepts that the second ground of appeal, which relies on principles of parity and proportionality, need not be determined in terms but that the matters argued under that ground should inform the exercise of re-sentencing. The applicant submits that a different, less severe sentence is warranted and ought to be imposed. The respondent disputes this and argues that this Court would form the view that no lesser sentence than that imposed by the District Court is warranted.
	
	
	The concession in relation to the first ground of appeal is correctly made. In exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, I have concluded that a different, less severe sentence is warranted and ought to be imposed. The application for leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal allowed and the applicant resentenced. The sentence I propose will result in the applicant’s immediate release. These are my reasons for those conclusions.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to seven offences pursuant to ss 112(2) and 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The four counts of aggravated break, enter and steal under s 112(2) carried a maximum penalty of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. The three counts of aggravated break and enter with intent to steal carried a maximum penalty of 14 years: s 112(3). In each case, the circumstance of aggravation was being in company: s 105A.
	
	
	Apart from three offences of drink-driving committed in 2002, 2005 and 2012, the applicant had no prior criminal history. His involvement in this series of offences was aptly explained in the opening paragraphs of the sentencing Judge’s remarks on sentence:
	


“1. A young man was settling into family life here near Albury with his wife and daughter. They were planning on having another child. He had a good job. He described it as the best job he had ever had. A year later he was emaciated and had been charged with no fewer than seven very serious crimes under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

2. The precipitous fall in this young man's lifestyle commenced casually. He casually shared drinks and stories with friends but they introduced him to the drug commonly known as ice. As the young man said, it grabbed him immediately and he was then chasing it until he was finally detained in custody.”


	
	The offences were serious by their nature and repetition but, as Cogswell DCJ found, they fell towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness contemplated by ss 112(2) and 113(2). In particular, the circumstance of aggravation in each case was that the applicant was in company with his co-offenders: see paragraph (b) of the definition in s 105A. That may be contrasted with the other circumstances of aggravation defined in section 105A namely (a) being armed with a weapon, (c) using corporal violence, (d) inflicting injury, (e) depriving a person of their liberty and (f) entering premises knowing that there is a person inside. Further, the offences were committed in a very amateur fashion and were largely unplanned.
	
	
	The facts of the offences were summarised by the sentencing judge in the following way:
	


“6. On 12 October 2013 Mr Glare and an accomplice took themselves to the Corowa Golf Club. Mr Glare kept watch whilst the accomplice broke in. The accomplice raided some poker machines, causing about $60,000 in damage. He got about two and a half thousand dollars in cash. Mr Glare was so reckless by that stage in his drug habit that he and his accomplice left behind an iron bar which had been used to break in, and the iron bar retained Mr Glare's DNA profile. I repeat that Mr Glare was the lookout although he is charged with the same offence as the man who broke in. That is an aggravated break, enter and steal which is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. Parliament regards that offence as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to it. It has also fixed a standard non-parole period of five years.

7. Next in time were two break-ins, both at the Tocumwal Golf Club. They were committed on 18 and 19 October last year. Again he was with an accomplice. They climbed onto a roof but the accomplice fell through and they left the scene. Their expertise in these crimes was such that they returned to the same scene the following morning. Police were waiting. They broke in again and the police arrested them. At that stage Mr Glare admitted his offences. He was put on bail.

8. Because those two offences did not involve any actual theft, he was charged with aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a crime. That and the first offence I spoke about were aggravated because Mr Glare was in company.

9. Returning to the break and enter with intent, Parliament has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to that offence but no standard non-parole period. One of his accomplices - there were apparently two - received a prison sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of six months.

10. About six months later, Mr Glare was at it again. On 6 March 2014, he and another accomplice turned up at the Oaklands RSL Bowling Club. They used a jemmy bar to prise open the door and get into the kitchen. They found nothing of value so they decided to leave. That resulted in another charge of aggravated break and enter with intent, under s 113(2) of the Crimes Act. Again they decided to return to the same scene a day later on 7 March 2014. They broke in and walked around again. This time all that they were able to find was a tub of ice cream, to which Mr Glare helped himself. That gave rise to a charge of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. That is one of the crimes to which, as I mentioned, Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment and five years standard non-parole period.

…

12. Over the evening of 9 -10 March 2014, Mr Glare and an accomplice broke into the Redlands Cafe in Redlands Road, Corowa. They cut security bars off the window and forced the window open. The owners found that over $800 of goods had been stolen, mostly snack food and confectionary. This too resulted in a charge of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act.

13. The final and seventh offence is a further aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence against s 112. That is a crime that Mr Glare admitted to committing when he was being interviewed about other crimes. He said that he had broken into the Rennie Football Club with someone else and they stole some equipment and some beer as well as even a heart defibrillator. That resulted in another charge against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act.”


	
	Counts 1-3 took place over a seven day period while counts 4-7 occurred six months later over a period of a little less than one month.
	
	
	There were four offences on a Form 1 to be taken into account in sentencing for count 5: s 33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). These were possession of housebreaking implements, receiving stolen property, larceny and enter a building with intent. There were twelve offences on a Form 1 attached to count 7. These were 7 counts of receiving, 3 counts of dealing with the proceeds of crime and 2 counts of possessing unlawfully obtained goods.
	


ground one

“His Honour erred in failing to take into account the pleas of guilty and assistance in the specification of the indicative sentences for each count in accordance with s 53A(2)(B) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).”


	
	The original notice of appeal, filed on 26 May 2015, contained this single ground. In view of the delay and proximity of the applicant’s release date, the Registrar listed the matter urgently. The respondent fairly acknowledges that this ground is established.
	
	
	The learned sentencing Judge held that the applicant was entitled to a reduction in his sentence of 40% based on his plea of guilty and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. His Honour indicated the individual sentences that he would have imposed and then indicated the starting point for the aggregate sentence (5 years). It was at that point that the 40% discount was applied; resulting in a term of three years in relation to which his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 18 months.
	
	
	Where a sentencing judge imposes an aggregate sentence under s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the Judge must record the individual sentences that would have been imposed on each count. These individual “indicative” sentences should represent the sentence after the application of a discount for a plea of guilty or similar: s 53A(2)(b); R v Cahill [2015] NSWCCA 53. In R v Cahill Johnson J (with whom Leeming JA and Schmidt J agreed) said:
	


“107. The indicative sentences here constituted a series of head sentences. The indicative sentences should have factored in the discount for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty: s.53A(2)(b); JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39](3).

108. The sentencing Judge did not comply with the requirements of s.53A(2)(b) and s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Compliance with s.53A(2)(b) would have seen indicative sentences assessed by taking into account such matters in Part 3 (ss.21-43) or elsewhere in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as were relevant. These included, amongst other things, the Respondent’s pleas of guilty and any factors under s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which applied.

109. It was erroneous to select an aggregate sentence and then apply a 25% discount for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty to that sentence. The purpose of s.53A should be kept in mind. In the course of a valuable summary of principles surrounding aggregate sentencing, RA Hulme J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreeing) said in JM v R at [39](1):

‘Section 53A was introduced in order to ameliorate the difficulties of applying the decision in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 in sentencing for multiple offences: R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [31]. It offers the benefit when sentencing for multiple offences of obviating the need to engage in the laborious and sometimes complicated task of creating a ‘cascading or 'stairway' sentencing structure’ when the principle of totality requires some accumulation of sentences: R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [43]; Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [231]; Behman v R [2014] NSWCCA 239; R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 at [55]-[57].’”


	
	The respondent’s concession that error is disclosed should be accepted.
	
	
	It is accordingly necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in accordance with the High Court’s decision in Kentwell v The Queen  [2014] HCA 37; 313 ALR 451 at [40]-[43].
	


ground 2 and re-sentencing


	
	The applicant has raised a second ground of appeal based around considerations of parity in relation to count 3 and count 6. While there is some ostensible merit in this ground, it is not necessary to come to any final conclusion given that the Court is to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh and, in doing so, will take into account the known sentencing outcomes for the co-offenders in respect of count 3 (Simon Garsed) and count 6 (Benjamin Clancy).
	
	
	While the offences are serious and repetitive, they are at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness that might be encountered for offences under ss 112(2) and 113(2).
	
	
	In Attorney General’s Application (No 1); R v Ponfield and Ors [1999] NSWCCA 435; 48 NSWLR 327, Grove J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed) pronounced a non-numerical guideline judgment in relation to the offence of break, enter and steal. While the present case concerns the aggravated offence in relation to which a standard non-parole period now applies, the factors identified in the guideline judgment remain important in assessing the objective seriousness and the appropriate level of sentence in any particular case. Grove J said:
	


“48. A court should regard the seriousness of offence contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act as enhanced and reflect that enhanced seriousness in the quantum of sentence if any of the following factors are present. Necessarily, if more than one such factor is present there is accumulative effect upon seriousness and the need for appropriate reflection.

(i) The offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or on parole.

(ii) The offence is the result of professional planning, organization and execution. (iii) The offender has a prior record particularly for like offences. (iv) The offence is committed at premises of the elderly, the sick or the disabled. (v) The offence is accompanied by vandalism and by any other significant damage to property.

(vi) The multiplicity of offence (reflected either in the charges or matters taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s21 of the CP Act). In sentencing on multiple counts regard must be had to the criminality involved in each: Pearce v The Queen 1998 72 ALJR 1416. (vii) The offence is committed in a series of repeat incursions into the same premises.

(viii) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value. (ix) The offence was committed at a time when, absent specific knowledge on the part of the offender (a defined circumstance of aggravation - Crimes Act s105A(1)(f)), it was likely that the premises would be occupied, particularly at night.

(x) That actual trauma was suffered by the victim (other than as a result of corporal violence, infliction of actual bodily harm or deprivation of liberty - defined circumstances of aggravation: Crimes Act s105A(1)(c),(d) and (e)).

 (xi) That force was used or threatened (other than by means of an offensive weapon, or instrument - a defined circumstance of aggravation Crimes Act s105A(1)(a)). 

49. It will of course be requisite for a sentencing court to give appropriate weight to matters in mitigation as manifest in the particular case. These will include evidence of genuine regret and remorse and any rehabilitative steps taken by the offender. Whilst addiction to drugs and alcohol is a relevant circumstance for the Court to consider it is not of itself a mitigating factor (See R v Henry supra at pars [193] - [203] and [217] to [259]).”


	
	The first count charged against the applicant involved significant damage to property committed by one of the co-offenders. Counts 4 through to 7 were committed while the offender was on bail. There was also a “multiplicity” of counts. Otherwise, the matters that Grove J identified as aggravating the criminality from an objective perspective were absent in the present offences. While there was a return to two of the premises, this was indicative of the amateur nature of the offending rather than the kind of systematic “repeat incursions” of which Grove J was speaking in paragraph (vii).
	
	
	Considerations of deterrence, both general and personal, mean that the only appropriate penalty was (and remains) the imposition of a custodial sentence: s 5(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, the subjective or personal case presented by the applicant was a moving and compelling one. He came to court with significant family and community support and had taken significant steps in overcoming his pernicious addiction to methylamphetamine which had led him into the company of those with whom he committed the offences and into the commission of the offences as a means to obtain money to fund his drug habit.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report described the applicant’s personal history. He was born and raised in the town of Corowa and was the youngest of 3 children who had a positive upbringing. Nothing in his family background explained his resort to crime. By the time he came to be sentenced he was married with two children aged 4 and 1 years old. He enjoyed excellent support from his family. He had completed year 10 in the local high school and then held a variety of jobs including two years of service with the Australian Navy. Until his 12 month interaction with the drug “ice” it seems that he was in full-time employment for all or most of his adult life. He expressed genuine contrition and remorse and was described as “fundamentally pro-social, and appeared to demonstrate good insight into his offending behaviour”. The author of the presentence report assessed him as being a low to medium risk of reoffending.
	
	
	There were a variety of references and testimonials tendered on his behalf. These spoke highly of his character, work ethic and involvement in the local community. He had played football and cricket with local clubs and was an active contributor to these clubs. Subject to the drink driving offences to which I have referred, he was a person of good character prior to his involvement with drugs.
	
	
	An affidavit read on re-sentencing showed that the applicant has made the most of the limited opportunities to rehabilitate while in custody. He is undertaking a TAFE course in Skills for Work and mathematics. Upon his release he has a job opportunity with a qualified mechanic with whom he previously worked. He has been subject to threats from other inmates and some acts of victimisation as a result of the assistance he provided to police. As a result, he has been kept in protective custody.
	
	
	Based on his strong employment record, family support and the efforts he has made to defeat his drug habit, his prospects of rehabilitation appear to be very good. Subject to the obvious caveat that this is an exercise in prediction, he is unlikely to offend again. Those assessments are also strongly related to the expectation that his experience in custody will have a salutary impact on him and will achieve the purpose of specific or personal deterrence. His prospects really turn on his ability to avoid illegal drug use.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge allowed a combined discount of 40% and that appears to be an appropriate one given the early plea and contents of his recorded interview on 4 April 2014. The sentencing Judge also found special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and made a significant adjustment to the proportion between the total sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	Like the sentencing Judge, I am of the view that it is appropriate to impose an aggregate sentence under s 53A. I would also find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2B) largely in the desirability for the applicant to have a lengthy period of supervised parole so that he has the best chance to remain drug-free and to become again a valuable member of the community. In reaching that conclusion, I also take into account the difficulties that the applicant has experienced in custody.
	
	
	I have considered and taken into account the sentences imposed on the co-offenders in respect of counts 3 and 6. Timothy Garsed was sentenced to a total sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of six months in relation to count 3. He had a substantial and relevant criminal history and there was an offence of possessing house-breaking implements taken into account in sentencing. Benjamin Clancy was sentenced to a total sentence of one year and ten months with a non-parole period of nine months in relation to count six. He too had a significant criminal history. On the other hand, the applicant committed count 6 while he was on bail for similar offences. Each of those co-offenders received a discount of 25% for their pleas of guilty but, unlike the applicant, had not assisted the authorities. However, the applicant was sentenced in relation to a multiplicity of similar offences. While a comparison between the individual circumstances is difficult, the task must be undertaken: see at Green and Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [30]. I agree with the applicant’s submission that considerations of equal justice suggest that the indicative sentences for the applicant should be somewhat less than those imposed on the co-offenders. As Dawson and Gaudron JJ said in Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26;189 CLR 295 at 301:
	


“Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.”


	
	For the purpose of s 53A(2), I record that I would propose an aggregate sentence and that the individual sentences that would have been imposed (after taking into account relevant matters, the application of the 40% discount and some rounding up and down of the numbers) are as follows:
	



	
	Count 1: 1 year 8 months
	
	
	Count 2: 10 months
	
	
	Count 3: 9 months
	
	
	Count 4: 1 year 6 months
	
	
	Count 5: 1 year 10 months
	
	
	Count 6: 1 year 7 months
	
	
	Count 7: 2 years 3 months.
	



	
	The indicative sentence for count 1 is significantly higher than counts 2 and 3 because of the property damage occasioned to the Corowa Golf Club. Counts 4-7 attract higher sentences because each of those offences was committed while the applicant was on bail. That is a matter of significant aggravation. Count 7 is the highest indicative sentence because of the other (12) offences to be taken into account on the Form 1. Personal deterrence and retribution have greater weight in relation to that matter: Attorney General’s Reference No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42].
	
	
	If aggregate sentences were not to be imposed there would necessarily be a degree of accumulation between the sentences. Given their proximity in time there would be very little accumulation between counts 1, 2 and 3 and those sentences would largely be ordered to be served concurrently. Similarly, there would be little accumulation as between counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 themselves. However, there would be an accumulation of something in the order of three months between the two sets of offences that is between counts 1 – 3 and counts 4 – 7. I have reached those discretionary conclusions by reference to the principle of totality and noting the similarity in the offending, the timing of the offences and the fact that the multiplicity of offending is a factor taken into account under the guideline judgment in assessing the objective criminality (while, at the same time, complying with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45]).
	
	
	The aggregate sentence that I would impose is 2½ years with an aggregate non-parole period of one year and three months. This sentence has already expired and, under its terms and the provision in s 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the applicant is entitled to be released immediately.
	
	
	The orders that I would propose are:
	



	
	Grant the application for leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to an aggregate sentence comprising an aggregate non-parole period of one year and three months commencing 30 March 2014 and expiring 29 June 2015 with a balance of term of one year and three months commencing 30 June 2015 and expiring 29 September 2016.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 50(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), order that the applicant is to be released on parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period. Note that the non-parole period has expired and that the applicant is entitled to be released forthwith.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 51(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) order that the applicant’s parole be subject to the usual conditions under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) including a condition that the applicant is to obey the reasonable directions of the probation and parole service including such directions as to counselling in relation to drug rehabilitation as the officers of that service may provide.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Hamill J.

2767245,Stepanovic v R [2015] NSWCCA 191,"Judgment


	
	Price J: Ivica Stepanovic, the applicant, was tried in March 2013, before Charteris SC DCJ and a jury of 12 on an indictment containing the following charges:
	
	
	Count 1: That [the applicant] on 28 March 2012, at Glebe, in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of Graeme Moseley situated at 20/150 Wigram Road, Glebe, and did commit a serious indictable offence therein namely larceny of a briefcase containing a wallet, bankcards, personal documents, keys, a pair of glasses, a sum of money and a mobile phone, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, knowing that there was a person or persons in the said premises.
	
	
	This is an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 20 years.
	
	
	Count 2: That [the applicant] on 28 March 2012, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales did dishonestly obtain items, namely two Vodafone recharge vouchers to the value of $29 and other items to the value of $22.70 from Town Hall Square Newsagency by deception, namely, using a stolen credit card in the name of Graeme Moseley.
	
	
	Count 3: That [the applicant] on 28 March 2012, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales did dishonestly obtain items to the value of $49.00 at St Martins City News Sydney by deception, namely, using a stolen credit card in the name of Graeme Moseley.
	
	
	Count 4: That [the applicant] on 28 March 2012, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales did dishonestly obtain items to the value of $84.50 at Meing Kiosk Sydney by deception, namely, using a stolen credit card in the name of Graeme Moseley.
	
	
	Counts 2, 3 and 4 are offences of fraud contrary to s 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	The trial commenced on 25 March 2013 and the jury returned its verdict of guilty to all counts on 27 March 2013.
	
	
	On 23 August 2013, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment was imposed by the trial judge comprising of a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months commencing on 1 October 2012 and expiring on 30 June 2016, with a parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 July 2016 and expiring on 30 June 2018.
	
	
	Notice of Grounds of Appeal
	
	
	The applicant, who represented himself in this Court, appeals against his convictions for the three counts of fraud. He does not appeal against his conviction on count 1. The applicant’s handwritten Notice of Grounds of Appeal discloses the following:
	
	
	The applicant appeals the 3 counts of obtain money by deception due to him not having used the credit cards that he was found guilty of using. Further, he believes that the trial judge erred in giving the jury proper instructions in the way they came up with the trial verdict for the fraudulent counts.
	
	
	That the co-accused pleaded guilty to her role with the credit card changes and that the credit cards had nothing to do with the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant does not believe that he should have been tried for the fraud charges when the co-accused is the one captured on CCTV using the cards and not himself.
	
	
	The applicant alleges that the lawyer that was appointed to him failed to follow any of his instructions that he put to him to ask the main witness.
	
	
	That the main witness should have been asked about her bipolar disorder and her misleading police in the past and credibility (sic). 
	
	
	According to paragraphs one to three of the Notice of Grounds of Appeal, the applicant, in reality, contends that the jury’s verdicts in the fraud counts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. He also challenges the trial judge’s directions to the jury in respect of these counts.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to consider the matters raised in paragraphs four and five. No submissions were made, or evidence adduced, in support of the applicant’s complaints concerning his legal representation at trial. There is nothing in the trial transcript to suggest that he was not competently represented during the trial.
	
	
	It became evident from the applicant’s written submissions that his appeal was not confined to the convictions for the three counts but that he wishes to appeal against sentence. The applicant states:
	
	
	“I just want to try and get a few months of (sic) if possible if (sic) I was given extra time fore (sic) something she did And I belive (sic) that they were sepret (sic) crimes and that maybe they should have been seprented (sic) sentences 4 each crime” (AWS 3).
	
	
	Argument on the conviction appeal 
	
	
	The applicant submitted that Jennifer Townsend (‘the co-accused’) committed the credit card fraud, which was recorded on camera. He contended that the co-accused was not threatened or forced to do what she did. The applicant pointed out that she pleaded guilty. He argued that the trial judge had not directed the jury properly.
	
	
	Ms Dowling SC, for the Crown, argued that this was an overwhelming Crown case. Ms Dowling submitted that the applicant’s involvement in the joint criminal enterprise with the co-accused, to steal and use Mr Moseley’s credit cards, was well established on the evidence (CWS 11).
	
	
	Legal principle 
	
	
	The doctrine of joint criminal enterprise was explained in Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; (2003) 219 CLR 1 by Hayne J at [110]:
	
	
	“In its simplest application, the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise means that, if a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement with another or others that they will commit a crime, and one or other of the parties to the arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, all are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.”
	
	
	In considering the applicant’s appeal against conviction, the Court is required to examine all of the evidence in determining whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty. In Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83, Bathurst CJ said at [307]:
	


“The principles on which an appellate court is required to deal with a ground of appeal that a verdict was unreasonable are now well established. They were set out by the High Court in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 (M) and have been consistently reaffirmed since that time. They were summarised by a majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 (SKA) in the following terms:

""[11] It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty’” (italics added).


	
	The evidence at trial 
	
	
	I do not propose to recount all of the evidence, but will summarise significant parts of it. The applicant did not give evidence nor did he call any evidence in his case.
	
	
	The principal Crown witness was Ms Townsend, the co-accused. Ms Townsend pleaded guilty to one count of breaking and entering with a 25 per cent discount for her plea and a further 15 per cent discount for providing assistance to authorities. She was sentenced to 19 months imprisonment which was suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The co-accused signed a written undertaking that she would give evidence on behalf of the prosecution against the applicant.
	
	
	Ms Townsend gave evidence that in the early hours of Wednesday 28 March 2012, she arranged to meet the applicant at his home in Glebe. She drove from Bowral, arriving at about 5am. The applicant was waiting for her at the window and came down to let her in. Ms Townsend and the applicant consumed ice.
	
	
	The co-accused said that the applicant asked her to drive him around to look for a house to break into to get money for drugs (T98 1-4).
	
	
	After driving around, the applicant told Ms Townsend to stop because he had seen an open window with a hedge outside. Ms Townsend stopped the car and waited while the applicant entered the house. Approximately 10 or 15 minutes later, the applicant returned carrying a briefcase which was covered by his jacket (T98 21-28).
	
	
	Ms Townsend testified that the applicant, who was seated in the front passenger seat, opened the briefcase and told her that it contained a mobile phone, credit cards, keys, a wallet (she was unsure about the wallet), money and a man’s reading glasses (T99 29-43). The applicant kept the money.
	
	
	Ms Townsend and the applicant then went to Town Hall in the city. After parking, the applicant told Ms Townsend to use one credit card, possibly the American Express and she said that they may not be able to as the card was in a man’s name. Ms Townsend used the card at a Newsagency to purchase phone credit with Vodafone and possibly cigarettes.
	
	
	While Ms Townsend was in the Newsagency using the credit card, the applicant was elsewhere trying to use the other cards (T100-101; 102).
	
	
	After using the credit card at the Newsagency, Ms Townsend tried to purchase cosmetics at the Woolworths, Town Hall but the card was declined and the woman serving her became suspicious, asking to see her identification (T101).
	
	
	Ms Townsend remained in the Town Hall Woolworths area for approximately half an hour, trying to find the applicant. At one point, Ms Townsend found the applicant trying to buy something from a street stall which sold magazines and drinks outside Town Hall station. Later, Ms Townsend rang the applicant who told her that he was on his way back to Glebe. Ms Townsend then drove towards Glebe and picked him up. The applicant wanted to drive to Kings Cross to buy drugs and Ms Townsend drove with him in the front seat, towards Kings Cross. As the applicant wanted to get rid of the suitcase, which was in the boot, Ms Townsend stopped the car in a backstreet while the applicant got the suitcase out of the boot and put it in a bin. As they were driving towards Kings Cross, the applicant threw the keys out of the car window and they parked on the main street.
	
	
	They then had a drink in a hotel. Ms Townsend left the hotel in search of someone from whom she could purchase cocaine. She met a person in a park who was selling drugs and telephoned the applicant, telling him to come. After waiting for 10 minutes, Ms Townsend rang the applicant again, saying “I don’t want to stick around here, I’m gonna move the car around the corner” (T104).
	
	
	Upon returning to the car, Ms Townsend was arrested.
	
	
	Graeme Moseley gave evidence that the theft occurred at his house in Glebe between 7.15am and 7.45am on 28 March 2012 (T59 40-41; T60 23-24). He had not locked the sliding doors which led onto a patio area. His briefcase and mobile phone were missing. The briefcase contained, inter alia, a set of keys, his wallet with a driver’s licence, ATM card, American Express credit card, Visa card and between $300.00 and $350.00 in cash (T60-61; 65).
	
	
	Ex O, photo 1, which is still CCTV footage, shows that the applicant and Ms Townsend entered the Town Hall shopping centre at 7:47am.
	
	
	Ex O, photo 4, shows the applicant standing at the entrance to the Town Hall Newsagency at 7:50am on 28 March 2012, while Ms Townsend enters the shop. At 7:52am, Ms Townsend used Mr Moseley’s American Express card to purchase two Vodafone pre-paid recharge vouchers.  Ex C is a receipt for $80.70 from Town Hall Square Newsagency which includes two Vodafone recharge vouchers each worth $29.00, purchased by Amex at 7:52am. Ex B, Mr Moseley’s American Express card statement records the purchase of $80.70.
	
	
	Ex A, Mr Moseley’s ANZ Credit Card Visa statement shows that on 28 March 2012, two purchases were made: $49.00 from St Martins City News Sydney and $84.50 from Meing Kiosk Sydney. Ex S shows that the applicant’s phone was recharged to the value of $49.00 at 8:09am on 28 March 2012.
	
	
	Senior Constable Imrie gave evidence that at about 9:45am on 28 March 2012, he observed a gold Toyota Camry (registration no. AJ15RJ) parked on the northern side of Cathedral Street in Woolloomooloo. He watched the applicant open a bin and then jam a large black item, about the size of a suitcase, into the bin and close the lid (T71 47-50; T72 7-9). Shortly thereafter Senior Constable Imrie saw the applicant throw a silver item from the passenger side window of the vehicle as it was moving (T72 17-18). The items were later identified as a briefcase and a set of keys belonging to Mr Moseley, the subject of an aggravated break and enter that same morning (T72 44-50; T73 4).
	
	
	The applicant’s case was that Ms Townsend was a dishonest and unreliable witness, who had lied to the sentencing judge in order to reduce her sentence.
	
	
	   Consideration 
	
	
	The applicant’s contention that he should not have been convicted of the credit card fraud as he had not personally used the stolen credit cards arises, it seems, from his lack of understanding of the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise. It was plainly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant and the co-accused had agreed to break into Mr Moseley’s home and to thereafter dishonestly use the stolen credit cards. Although they may have had different roles in carrying out the agreed crime, each is equally responsible for the acts of the other. It does not matter that the applicant did not personally use the stolen credit cards. As was said by the majority (French CJ, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Gageler JJ) in Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; (2013) 87 ALJR 434 at [37]:
	
	
	“The doctrine of joint criminal enterprise provides the means of attaching liability for the agreed crime on all the parties to the agreement regardless of the part played by each in its execution.”
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint that the trial judge erred in giving the jury proper instructions in the way they came up with the verdicts in the three counts of fraud is without foundation.
	
	
	The trial judge gave careful directions to the jury concerning the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise and summarised the competing cases. The directions included the following (T9 27/03/13):
	
	
	“The prosecution in this case has relied on what is known as the principle of joint criminal enterprise. The law of this State is that if two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, that is an agreement to carry out a particular criminal activity, each is to be held criminally responsible for the acts of the other participants in carrying out that enterprise or that activity. That is so regardless of the particular role that might be played in the enterprise by the various participants. To rely on joint criminal enterprise the prosecution must establish firstly that there exists a joint criminal enterprise and secondly, that the accused participated in that joint criminal enterprise. Under our law a joint criminal enterprise exists when two or more persons reach an understanding or an arrangement that amounts to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The agreement need not be expressed in words. Its existence may be inferred from all the facts and all the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence” (italics added).
	
	
	In my view, the appeal against conviction must be dismissed.
	
	
	The sentence appeal
	
	
	The applicant’s appeal against sentence is essentially confined to his belief that he should not have been convicted of the three counts of fraud. However, a further complaint is that an aggregate sentence should not have been imposed and that he should have been separately sentenced for each of the four counts.
	
	
	Section 53A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:
	
	
	“A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.”
	
	
	The trial judge imposed an aggregate sentence upon the applicant in accordance with s 53A(1). Before doing so, he announced an indicative sentence for each offence, as required by s 53A(2)(b). I do not detect any error in his Honour’s approach.
	
	
	Orders 
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction dismissed.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	R A Hulme J: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	Davies J: I agree with Price J.

		22 July 2015",2015-07-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767249,R v Mawad [2015] NSWSC 1237,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	Tony Mawad applies for bail and makes a release application under the provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) (“the Act”). Because of the amendments to the Act in 2014 and the nature of the charges that he faces, he is required by s 16A to show cause why his detention is not justified.
	
	
	I have been taken to a variety of cases by his solicitor which discuss the meaning and content of the show cause requirement and I accept the submission that is made in general terms that each case would be determined on its own merits and that it is possible for a combination of circumstances working together to amount to material that would satisfy the show cause requirement: cf R v Young [2006] NSWSC 1499 at [20] per Johnson J (dealing with “exceptional circumstances” under the Bail Act 1978 (NSW)).
	
	
	If the show cause requirement is satisfied that is not the end of the matter. The Act then requires the court or bail authority to consider whether or not there are bail concerns arising from the particular facts and circumstances pertaining to the applicant. If there are such concerns by reference to the exhaustive list of factors in s 18, the bail authority must determine whether those concerns amount to unacceptable risks for the purpose of s 19. If there are unacceptable risks then bail must be refused: s 19(1).
	
	
	It has been held that factors which might operate under s 18 in that latter determination might also be relevant to the question of whether or not the show cause requirement has been satisfied, but it is a separate and distinct test and it must be, according to the chart which is contained in the Bail Amendment Act 2014 (NSW), the question to be considered first: R v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83.
	
	
	The facts and circumstances of the present offence are contained in the Crown case statement which is attached to the court attendance notices. The offences are by their nature extremely serious and involve a reasonably well organised and executed robbery on the commercial premises of Masters Home Improvement at Chullora.
	
	
	I note that the form of court attendance notice as they are before me may suffer from some technical difficulty in that the suggestion is that the business was robbed, whereas ordinarily the victim of a robbery would be a person. However, the Crown case statement makes it clear that the particular charges relate to two people, Adam Krahe and Nitasha Rana, each of whom were employees of Masters Home Improvement.
	
	
	On 22 April 2014 a group of men including, unquestionably, a man called [REDACTED] and, allegedly, the applicant and a man Torik Jamal entered those premises and robbed the above-mentioned victims by threatening them with a handgun which they believed to be a real gun and which looked like a black revolver style firearm. It may be that it was not a real gun but in any event the psychological and legal impact of its use was such that it is an offence in which a firearm was used for the purposes of s 16B of the Bail Act.
	
	
	The robbers stole an amount in excess of $40,000 before making their escape. I said in that brief summary of the facts that the man [REDACTED] was unquestionably involved and I say that because since the commission of the robbery he has been interviewed by police and ultimately provided full admissions as to his role. He went on to nominate the applicant and the man Jamal as his co-offenders.
	
	
	There was an investigation into the matter, included in that investigation were some covert recordings made of communications between, relevantly the applicant and [REDACTED], and those communications contained comments which are at the very least suspicious and possibly amount to admissions made by the present applicant for bail.
	
	
	Further, the investigating police executed a search warrant on 1 October 2014 at the applicant’s home and in the course of that located a firearm, which was a 6 mm airsoft calibre KWC manufactured repeating air pistol.
	
	
	That is an air gun which is caught by the extended definition of firearm in the Firearms Act. It was designed to propel a 6 mm airsoft plastic projectile but it was not in working order.
	
	
	As a result of the finding of that item, the applicant was charged with an offence of possession of an unauthorised firearm. That offence by itself is an offence which carries generally a significant gaol sentence if conviction flows, as of course do the very serious allegations of robbery.
	
	
	The applicant is represented on the bail application by Ms Bannister and she puts to me a combination of circumstances which are said to show cause why his detention is not justified. That is, as I have already foreshadowed, a combination of circumstances, including the expected delay in the case coming on for trial. At this stage the case is listed for a committal hearing in August of this year in which the now Crown witness [REDACTED] will be cross-examined.
	
	
	Even allowing for the possibility that that process will take place and conclude on 13 August and the applicant is then committed for trial, there is a likelihood that he will have been in custody for a period in excess of a year and possibly up to 18 months before the case comes on for trial. That is the first factor.
	
	
	As unacceptable as that is, by itself it would not in my assessment amount to satisfaction of the show cause requirement given the serious nature of the offence, the apparent strength of the Crown case and the almost inevitable result of a conviction for the various offences.
	
	
	However, the real force of Ms Bannister’s submission is that the applicant relies on a letter from his wife which sets forth their life together and, in particular, the fact that they have two children aged respectively five years and just short of two years, each of whom suffers from a disability. One has a hearing impairment and the other one appears to, although the diagnosis is not certain, to suffer from an autism spectrum disorder of some kind.
	
	
	Both of the children are finding the separation from their father to be devastating and there are also difficulties for the family in accessing or funding medical and counselling resources as a result of the fact that the income of the family was almost entirely dependent upon the applicant’s work and business as a glazier. I am told, and I accept from Ms Bannister, that that business is currently able to be resurrected if the applicant receives bail but that that situation may not last very long into the future.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s submission that it is not a matter of granting bail because of sympathy. However, the circumstances of the children, in combination with other factors to which I will presently return, satisfies me on balance that the applicant has shown cause why his continued detention is not justified.
	
	
	As I have said, that is not the end of the matter because it is necessary to assess whether there are bail concerns and, if so, whether there are unacceptable risks in the grant of bail.
	
	
	I accept the prosecutor’s submission that there is at least a risk of non-attendance and also a risk of the commission of serious offences and with that a risk of danger to the community and individuals within it.
	
	
	Less likely I think, given what I have read, is that there is particular risk to the victims or a risk of interference with the witnesses, although the man [REDACTED] is probably known to the applicant and may be perhaps subject to some form of risk. So I am prepared to take it into account as a bail concern.
	
	
	I am then required (and do) consider the exhaustive list of factors in s 18. I will not go through each of them in terms because many of them have already been considered. It need hardly be said that the offence is extremely serious: s 18(1)(b). The Crown case is conceded to be one of some strength [18(1)(c)] and I accept that concession. While certain weaknesses in it have been pointed out but it does remain on its face a reasonably strong case.
	
	
	The applicant does not have a history of violence [ s 18(1)(d)] other than an assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence, which was dealt with in the Children’s Court many years ago, and I do not take that into account other than noting its existence
	
	
	He does appear on the facts to have some criminal associations and I take that into account: s 18(1)(g). He is likely to spend a very long time in custody if bail is not granted: s 18(1)(h). There is a high likelihood of a custodial sentence if he is convicted: s 18(1)(i). While there is some history of non-compliance with bail acknowledgements [s 18(1)(f)], it is far from the worst example of such a consideration that I have seen sitting in the Bail Court.
	
	
	He does not have special vulnerability or needs himself [s 18(1)(k)] but I do note the situation with his children and his partner provide a need for the accused to be free for a lawful reason, namely, the care of those children and his family and the resurrection of his business while that is still possible: s 18(1)(m). He also has a legitimate need to be free to prepare for his appearance: s 18(1)(l).
	
	
	Perhaps most significantly, the proposed bail conditions are such that I am satisfied that the bail concerns that I do identify do not rise to the height of “unacceptable risks”: s 18(1)(p). My conclusion is that the bail concerns are alleviated by the bail conditions that Ms Bannister proposes, not least of which is the offer of a very large amount of surety which is basically the family’s entire interest in the family home. I would accept that it is most unlikely that Mr Mawad would put his wife’s house at risk by failing to appear.
	
	
	For those reasons I have decided, after some anxious consideration, that the application will be granted and bail will be granted on the following conditions.
	
	
	The applicant, Tony Mawad, is granted bail subject to the following conditions:
	



	
	To be of good behaviour.
	
	
	To report to Bankstown Police Station daily between the hours of 8 am and 5 pm.
	
	
	To live at [REDACTED].
	
	
	To appear at the Burwood Local Court on 13 August and on such date thereafter as required.
	
	
	Not to drink alcohol or enter any premises in which alcohol is sold.
	
	
	Not to take any illegal or prescription drugs (other than a drug prescribed to the applicant by a doctor).
	
	
	Not to associate or communicate by any means (except through his/her lawyer) with Torik Jamal.
	
	
	The applicant is not to be absent from the address at which he is required to live between the hours of 8 pm and 6 am except in the event of a medical emergency
	
	
	Not to have any contact in any way (except through a legal representative) with [REDACTED] or any person notified as a prosecution witness in the case.
	
	
	Not to apply for any new passport or travel document.
	
	
	Not to go within 500m of any point of departure from the Commonwealth of Australia.
	
	
	One acceptable person is to deposit acceptable security in the sum of $300,000 and agree to forfeit it if the applicant fails to appear before court in accordance with the bail acknowledgment.
	
	
	One acceptable person is to deposit $ 10,000 which he/she agrees to forfeit if the applicant fails to appear before court in accordance with the bail acknowledgment.
	
	
	To present himself at the front door at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the curfew condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so, having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy.

		31 August 2015",2015-07-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767252,R v Pemble [2015] NSWDC 168,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Very belatedly, sentencing judges have realised the true harm that sexual assault causes to the victims of such offences. Such harm is often significant and long-lasting. It is only in more recent times that the courts have begun to impose sentences which reflect that harm.
	
	
	In 1972 when the offender committed his offences the courts had an approach to sentencing offenders such as the present which we now know to be wrong. Sentences imposed at that time did not adequately reflect the consequences which flowed from conduct such as I will shortly describe. In 1972 sentences for this type of offence were far more lenient than sentences for similar conduct now.
	
	
	The law requires that I choose a sentence in this case which reflects the earlier, now discredited, approach. I must try to assess what the offender would have got had he been sentenced soon after he committed his offences, and impose that sentence. I have spoken elsewhere about my disagreement with that approach. To sentence the offender according to standards which existed in the early 1970’s is to perpetuate the errors that were made by sentencing courts at that time. Surely it would be better for the courts when sentencing for offences committed in the 1970’s, to be right some of the time than wrong all of the time. Offenders such as Mr Pemble benefit from earlier mistakes made by sentencing courts, even where we now know that those earlier decisions were wrong.
	
	
	As will be obvious, I do not agree with the present state of sentencing law so I should make it abundantly clear that I recognise that my views must be put aside. I am entitled to suggest that the law is wrong and that it should be changed. I am not entitled to ignore it. Accordingly, I will sentence the offender as though he was dealt with at the time of or soon after his offending conduct.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty to one count of indecent assault on a male pursuant to s 81 of the Crimes Act. That offence, now repealed, carries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. When I sentence him for that matter he asks that I take into account two other matters, also offences against s 81, on a Form 1.
	
	
	The facts of those three offences are as follows. The offender began as a Marist brother in 1967. The complainant in this matter C grew up in the Rutherford area with his parents and siblings. The family were devout Catholics who would attend mass each Sunday in Rutherford. C went to St Paul’s Catholic Primary School at Rutherford where, in later years there, he commenced duties as an altar server. At the age of 12 he moved to Marist Brothers High School at Maitland where the accused was a teacher. Towards the end of the school year in 1971 the offender selected C as a personal assistant of sorts to help him with preparations for school sports activities, such as carnivals, and at times in performance of that function C would be taken out of lessons.
	
	
	The first offence which I am about to describe appears on the Form 1. It was during a school day in early 1972 that the offender took C to the sports room. Once inside the offender closed and secured the double doors. It was then that the offender pushed C up against a wall, placed the front of his own body against C’s and commenced grinding his pelvis against him. The offender had an erection and he rubbed his erection up and down the front of C’s body while nuzzling and kissing his neck. This lasted about five minutes. They then left the room without anything being said.
	
	
	The next offence also appears on the Form 1. This also occurred at the beginning of 1972. C recalls the offender asking to meet him outside the sports room. The offender opened the doors, they went inside and once again the offender shut and locked the door. Similar activities then occurred. The offender pushed C up against the wall and pinned him there with the front of his body. C could feel the accused’s erect penis at the front of his body whilst the offender nuzzled and kissed the side of C’s neck, grinding his erection against him as he did so.
	
	
	Then the offence for which the offender must be specifically sentenced occurred. It was the offender who suggested to C that they take their clothes off. They did so. They then went up the ladder going to the mezzanine level where the gym mats were kept. The offender went up first and the complainant followed him. The offender hauled C up so that the front of C’s naked body slid along the front of the offender’s naked body. At this time the offender had an erection. C recalls the accused’s erect penis coming into contact with his upper chest then the rest of the front of his body, as we was slid along. He ended up lying on top of the offender. The offender began nuzzling and kissing his neck and was moving C slightly so that there was friction between their bodies. This continued for about five minutes until the offender ejaculated. C did not know what had happened. He asked “What’s that?” In an annoyed tone the offender replied “You know what it is”. C repeated that he did not and the offender repeated “You know what it is”. C became scared. They both climbed down the ladder and dressed and left the sports room.
	
	
	These events went unnoticed by the authorities for many years. C felt shame and disgust for many years and it began to affect his marriage. Those feelings worsened when publicity began to be given to offending of various paedophiles in the Catholic Church. In February 2013 he disclosed the offending to his wife and the authorities were subsequently notified.
	
	
	The offender has disclosed other sexual offending against two other boys which occurred around the same time. He is not to be sentenced for those offences because he has not been charged with them, but he is not entitled to say that his misconduct was isolated in the sense that he only indecently assaulted a single victim, C.
	
	
	C read a victim impact statement to the court. It speaks eloquently of the consequences for him of the offender’s misconduct. Not surprisingly, after these offences occurred, his attitude towards school changed considerably. He previously had been a happy participant in school sports and his parents were often praised about his respectful, polite and well-behaved manner, but after he was abused by the offender he became anxious and fearful at school. He was constantly afraid that people would find out what had occurred. He withdrew, became a consistent truant and his grades plummeted. Swimming pool change rooms and the possibility of being near others possibly naked, frightened him to the point that he was physically ill. He rarely completed homework and was caned. He failed his School Certificate in 1974 and much to his horror it was suggested that he repeat fourth form. He refused. Fortunately he was then enrolled in a co-ed school away from Maitland where he enjoyed school and made many friends. He felt less threatened although he never went near a sporting event.
	
	
	Matters came flooding back to him as there was consistent news reporting of abuse by clergy. Those friends he had who knew that he attended Marist Brothers mentioned the subject and he became uncomfortable each time they did. He once again felt himself descending into the schoolboy who avoided personal contact and conversation as a protection mechanism.
	
	
	Even though the offences occurred many years before, his marriage began to be affected. He describes shutting down and becoming more and more distant. Those consequences were entirely foreseeable. It is entirely foreseeable that, as a child, C would be affected the way he described and equally foreseeable that those consequences would continue for many, many years after the offence was committed.
	
	
	The offender is now 67 years of age. He grew up in a happy home. He went to teacher’s college in 1969 and formed a close relationship with a young woman. This confused him because he had decided to enter the Marist Brothers order. He considered leaving the order but instead he was taken out of teacher’s college and sent to teach in a high school. He was, as he told the author of a pre-sentence report, just a kid himself at the time. He was not a fully mature adult when he began teaching at a high school where there were children of C’s age around him.
	
	
	Since committing the offences that I have described, he has committed no other offences. He went on to have a distinguished career as a teacher and headmaster although he has now retired and has been studying and working in Belgium.
	
	
	Of course one of the important circumstances I have to consider in determining the appropriate sentence concerns the objective gravity of the offender’s misconduct. The criminal law attempts to break down criminal behaviour into various categories, as it tries to work out the objective gravity of particular offending. In cases of this kind courts often refer to questions such as “Was there skin to skin contact”, “Was clothing removed?”, “Did a male offender ejaculate?” “Did the offender hold a position of trust?” Of course, often the effects of an offence upon a victim of it do not depend on the answers to such questions and such attempts at categorisation are often meaningless to many. Considerable harm can be caused from conduct which the criminal law regards as relatively innocuous. However considerations such as these do not arise in the present case because the answers to such questions reveal a significant degree of objective gravity: thus there was a great deal of skin to skin contact; the offender and his victim were naked; the offender did ejaculate onto the victim’s body; the offender held a considerable position of trust over C, not only because he was a teacher but also because of his position in the Catholic Church. And then there is also the age of the complainant. He was but 13, while offences under s 81 are not specific to assaults upon children. Finally, as Mr Walsh quite properly conceded, C was vulnerable, so objectively this is a serious example of an offence against s 81.
	
	
	Quite rightfully the offender has expressed his deep remorse for his actions. I find those expressions of remorse to be genuine. In particular I note that he disclosed uncharged acts and that he pleaded guilty to this offence. It is notorious that it is difficult to prove old offences of child sexual assault where, as is almost invariably the case, there is no witness to what occurred. Thus, had the offender wished to tough it out and plead not guilty, the chances of him being found guilty were probably not all that high. The fact that he has pleaded guilty in those circumstances is a reason that I accept that he is remorseful for what he has done.
	
	
	He also wrote an eloquent letter of apology which was tendered on his behalf. I am satisfied that the sentiments that he expressed in that letter of apology are genuine and are very much to his credit. Since I have mentioned his plea of guilty I should say that it has a utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system and so the sentence that I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	The offender is entitled to have me take into account his otherwise good character. Many testimonials were tendered and they all speak of the good work done by the offender in the past 35 years as a teacher, headmaster, counsellor and friend. There is much that he has done of which he is entitled to be proud and these offences seem to have been isolated, committed at a time when the offender himself was quite young and unprepared for the sexual challenges which life presents, particularly life as a Marist Brother. They represent a single period of misconduct which has not been repeated and his prospects of rehabilitation are thus good.
	
	
	I take into account the delay which has occurred since the offences were committed. Consistent with his remorse it could not be said that he has gone through life untroubled by what he has done. Many offenders do. Many offenders carry on as though they have done nothing wrong at all without fearing the knock on the door which would reveal them to have committed offences many years ago. But that is not this case. The offender even admitted his misconduct in counselling sessions in 1985 and again in 1988. People other than me will no doubt comment on the circumstance that those to whom he admitted his misconduct apparently did nothing about it.
	
	
	I have returned to where I have started, the idea of sentencing someone in 2015 for an offence committed in the early 1970’s. Both the Crown and Mr Walsh provided me with cases, reports and statistics dealing with sentences for breaches of s 81 in the early 70’s. They have all been very helpful. I mention one report in particular, that done by Mr Ivan Potas. He refers to statistics which demonstrated that in 1975 a recognisance to be of good behaviour was imposed in about two-thirds of cases and a sentence of imprisonment in only about a quarter of cases. But, as I have already mentioned, it must be remembered that s 81 covered assaults against adult males as well as children and there was no need for there to be any breach of trust involved. So when those statistics are considered, it must be remembered that the objective gravity of the conduct for which this offender is to be sentenced was much more significant than many, if not most, offences which would have been covered by s 81.
	
	
	Mr Walsh asks me to find that the offender will do his time in custody harder than the general prison population. I accept that. There is a risk that the offender will serve his sentence in protection and if he does, there is a further risk that this will involve harsher conditions of custody than would otherwise be the case. Then there is the offender’s age. Prison is a nasty place at the best of times. It is a place for young men, not for 67 year olds with no other criminal history.
	
	
	Then there is the offender’s medical condition. He has had a considerable number of hip replacements and knee replacements and finds it difficult to walk. He suffers from a number of conditions which are referred to in medical reports and sending him into custody now would risk possible postponement of treatment planned for August. On the other hand, there is nothing to suggest that he will not receive proper treatment in custody or that postponement of treatment would be of much significance.
	
	
	Mr Walsh concedes that a fulltime custodial sentence is within the range in the present case. He submits further however that so is a suspended sentence of imprisonment and impresses upon me that that is the appropriate sentence. However, in the particular circumstances of this case, I do not regard a suspended sentence as sufficient punishment or denunciation of the offender’s misconduct. In making this assessment, of course I have had regard to the matters on the Form 1. Denunciation is very important. After all, protection of innocent children such as C was, is crucially important in selecting the appropriate sentence to impose. A fulltime custodial sentence is very much a sentence of last resort but that is what is required.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case. They arise primarily from the fact that in 1972 non-parole periods were usually much less than 75% of the head sentence. I therefore impose sentence as follows.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months and a head sentence of 18 months to date from today 23 July 2015. The non-parole period will thus expire on 22 April 2016 on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

		17 August 2015",2015-07-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767254,R v Toksoz [2015] NSWSC 1234,"ex tempore Judgment (release application)


	
	Ahmet Toksoz makes an application under the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) as amended by the Bail Amendment Act 2014 (NSW). It is a release application and he seeks to be released on conditional bail.
	
	
	The application arises in circumstances where he is charged with a number of extremely serious offences and in particular offences of shooting with intent to murder (two counts), taking part in the supply of MDMA and another less serious but associated offence of failing to disclose the identity of the driver.
	
	
	Because of the serious nature of the offences and in particular the involvement of a firearm in those offences ss 16A and 16B of the Bail Act casts upon the applicant a heavy burden, that burden is to show cause why his detention is not justified.
	
	
	Ms Bannister who appears on his behalf on the application puts forward a combination of circumstances which she says satisfy the show cause requirement.
	
	
	In summary form, and adopting her nomenclature, she relies on, first, the delay in providing the brief. In that regard I note that a document has been tendered which shows that a large amount of the material expected to be served as part of the prosecution brief is yet to be served and at the moment it is unclear when it is to be served. That is in circumstances where the applicant has been in custody since 19 December 2014.
	
	
	Secondly, Ms Bannister relies on the consequent delay in bringing the matter to trial. Those two things are obviously related and until one knows when the prosecution brief will be served and whether there is going to be a committal hearing, and based on some of the things I will speak about when I speak about the strength of the prosecution case a committal proceeding seems, as far as one can predict the future, a possibility if not a likelihood. There is unlikely to be a trial date before 2016 and probably later in that year.
	
	
	The third thing Ms Bannister relies upon concerns the strength of the Crown case. She argues that it is a weak case. She places before me the interview conducted with one of the victims of the shooting offence, Mr Timothy Venesjarvi, along with a walk-through interview with that witness.
	
	
	The Crown case is essentially that the applicant, along with a co-offender called Goktas, set up a “drug rip-off” whereby they would go with a view to conducting a drug transaction and then, by using a gun which was ultimately produced by Goktas, would steal the drugs.
	
	
	The case is one of common purpose because all of the evidence points towards the fact it was Mr Goktas who produced the weapon. That does not of itself make it a weak case. The applicant’s presence there is unlikely to be, contrary to Ms Bannister’s submission, purely coincidental.
	
	
	However, Mr Venesjarvi provide certain information which on its face suggests that, far from being part of a common purpose, the applicant was unaware that a gun was to be produced and when it was may have been trying to “stop the other guy”. Mr Venesjarvi said in the recorded interview on 12 December 2014:
	


“Q493   O.K. And you said, urn, when, when you grabbed the firearm, tell me

about, um, what the other male was doing at that time?A   I don’t know. He somehow had his hand on the gun too. I don't know

if he was trying to stop the other, the other guy or not. It all happened

within about six seconds.

Q 500   So I don’t know, it was more towards his mate next to me, -----

Yeah.

So I don't know if his mate maybe thought he was going to get shot

Q 501 Yeah.

-----by mistake, but either way —

502   But did the, did the mate, the other guy, urn, did he, um, try to, um - -

A    No. He didn't touch me or anything in the car

Q 504   Yeah.

A   He just had his, there were three hands.

Q 505   But when the three hands were on that firearm, what were you feeling?

A   It was trying to be turned on me. I don’t know if it was by the other guy who had his, the guy who actually was holding it, or if it was the other guy with him.

Q506    Mmmm

A   I don’t know if he was trying to stop him.”


	
	The man referred to as the “the other male”, the “mate” and the “other guy” is the applicant. Mr Venesjarvi made a similar observation in the walk-through interview on 18 March 2015:
	


V2.   As soon as I twisted [the gun] away the guy with the beard was positioned

next to him.

V.1   O.K.

V.2   And he also grabbed his hand onto the gun.

V.1   O.K. So at the time the gun was facing back out this way, was it?

V.2   Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure if he thought maybe the gun was going to

be shooting at him but either way he jumped in and grabbed the

gun too.


	
	In this extract, “V2” is the witness while the “guy with the beard” is the applicant.
	
	
	Based on that limited material that I have been taken to, I would assess the prosecution case against the applicant to have some real difficulties. It could not be said to be a strong one.
	
	
	On the other hand, I do accept the submission made by Ms Mascia (for the prosecution) that there are inferences to be drawn by his presence there and the circumstances in which he came to be there arising from the statement of a Kelsey Coakes who apparently set up the meeting which led to the production of the gun and the attempted drug rip-off.
	
	
	The fourth matter relied upon by Ms Bannister is the personal hardship that the applicant is suffering which is, she puts it, beyond that which would ordinarily be endured by a person on remand. The reason for this is that since he has been in custody one of his brothers passed away and the applicant was denied the ability to attend the funeral by those who make such decisions.
	
	
	The other evidence before me, which includes an affidavit of his mother and an affidavit of another brother, provides cogent evidence that this is an extremely close family and I accept that the inability of the applicant to attend the funeral created exceptional hardship. As his mother put it:
	


“Being in custody has been extremely difficult for him. His brother, Tolga Toksoz, 21, with whom he was very close, passed away this year, while he was in custody. He was denied access to attend the funeral. He was extremely upset about Tolga's death and naturally remains so. He is upset not only at his passing, but also at not being able to grieve when family (this continues to today). He feels upset on a continuing basis that he did not have closure in seeing his brother before his burial and saying good bye. Ahmed is religious. In our religion it is important to farewell the spirit. Also, in our religion, the body is wrapped in cotton cloth and buried in the soil. It is only the immediate male relatives who are allowed to carry the body and bury a deceased family member. The applicant feels he failed in his duty to carry his brother's body. He has recounted to me many sad dreams where he has been unable to say good bye to his brother, and had other dreams of burying him. He tell me he prays daily for his brother. I know his anguish would exist even if he were on bail now but it is has been and continues to be worsened by his incarnation for the reasons above and his failure to do his duty at the burial. I know he will carry that with him for the rest of his life. His unhappiness is compounded by his continued separation from us as we are all still grieving for Tolga.”


	
	The applicant also relies upon the availability of substantial surety to ensure his compliance or attendance on bail. That includes a secured amount of $200,000 from his brother which I take it will be based on his interest in real estate and $5000 from his mother.
	
	
	It is well-established that a combination of circumstances might in particular cases satisfy the show cause requirement. In this regard some of the older law which applied under the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) has some application. In particular, Johnson J in the case of R v Young (2006) NSWSC 1499 found exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail in a murder case based around the coincidence of a number of features of the case, such features may be subjective to the particular applicant, thereupon the nature of the offence or otherwise suggests the person is one who will answer bail.
	
	
	Another part of the older law which has certain resonance in this case are the comments of Sperling J in the case of R v Cain (2001) 121 A Crim R 365 to the effect that the prospect that a private citizen, who has not been convicted of any offence, might be imprisoned for as long as two years pending trial is not consistent with modern concepts of civil rights.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the combination of factors to which Ms Bannister has referred satisfies the show cause requirement in ss 16A and 16B.
	
	
	The next question concerns the assessment of bail concerns. Because of the very nature of these offences bail concerns arise. They include the risk that the applicant will not appear, they include the risk of the commission of a serious offence, they include the risk of danger to the victim or other members of the community. That simply arises by virtue of the allegations themselves.
	
	
	The Crown also puts to me that there is a risk of interference with witnesses or evidence. I do not presently see that that is a genuine bail concern given the material before me but the other bail concerns most assuredly do arise.
	
	
	The question then is, by reference to the factors in s 18 of the Bail Act, whether or not those bail concerns are ameliorated to the degree that they do not rise to the level of being unacceptable risks. If they do rise to that level s 19 is in mandatory terms and requires bail to be refused.
	
	
	However, I have referred in dealing with the show cause question and treating the question separately and not conflating them, in accordance with the authority in the Court of Appeal, I have referred to those matters and those matters are also relevant to the s 18 considerations.
	
	
	I do not propose to address those individual factors seriatim, although I do note that I have taken into account the very serious nature of the allegations made as well as the likelihood of a gaol sentence being imposed if a conviction follows.
	
	
	I have also taken into account what is compelling evidence of the accused’s community ties and family ties and the real problems that emerge in relation to the proof of these allegations arising from the material in the recorded interviews with Mr Venesjarvi.
	
	
	One of the most compelling features from my point of view is the length of time that the accused is likely to spend in custody enjoying as it were the presumption of innocence.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, and I should indicate I have considered all of the matters in s 18 are relevant, I propose to grant conditional bail.
	
	
	Bail is granted on the following conditions.
	



	
	To be of good behaviour
	
	
	To report to The Hills Local Area Command daily between the hours of 9am and 5pm.
	
	
	To live at [REDACTED].
	
	
	To appear at Burwood Local Court on 12 August 2015 and on such date thereafter as required.
	
	
	Not to drink alcohol or enter any premises in which alcohol is sold.
	
	
	Not to take any illegal or prescription drugs (other than a drug prescribed to the applicant by a doctor).
	
	
	Not to associate or communicate by any means (except through his lawyer) with Hasan Goktas.
	
	
	The applicant is not to be absent from the address at which he is required to live between the hours of 8pm and 7am except in the case of a medical emergency.
	
	
	Not to have any contact in any way (except through a legal representative) with [REDACTED] or any person notified to be a crown witness including [REDACTED].
	
	
	Not to apply for any new passport or travel document.
	
	
	Not to go within 500m of any point of departure from the Commonwealth of Australia.
	
	
	One acceptable person(s) is to deposit acceptable security as security for the payment of $200,000 which he/she agrees to forfeit if the applicant fails to appear before court in accordance with the bail acknowledgment.
	
	
	To present himself at the front door at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the curfew condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so, having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy.
	


EX TEPORE JUDGMENT (BAIL VARIATION)

ACCEPTABLE PERSON


	
	On Thursday 23 July 2015 I made orders granting a release application under the Bail Act 2013. In doing so I imposed a number of bail conditions. Relevantly, pursuant to s 26(2) I made it a condition that one acceptable person enter into an agreement and deposit an acceptable security to forfeit the sum of $200,000 if the accused fails to comply with the bail acknowledgement.
	
	
	I did not specify that any particular person was an acceptable person and was not asked to do so. Although s 26(4) allows the bail authority, in this case the Supreme Court, to decide which person or persons is an acceptable person, my general approach is not to do so. The reason is that the prosecutor is usually not in a position to test any assertion as to a proposed acceptable person’s character or security. Further, for the bail list to function, a prosecutor does not generally require such witnesses for cross-examination and does not have immediate access to criminal histories or other police holdings relevant to the question.
	
	
	At the time of making the order granting the release application, I had before me a body of evidence concerning the accused’s personal and family circumstances, as well as evidence that persuaded me that there were some potentially significant weaknesses in the prosecution case.
	
	
	Relevant to the security requirement, exhibit 2 was the affidavit of Mehmet Toksoz, the applicant’s brother, who I will refer to as Mehmet. The affidavit said, amongst other things, “I have no criminal convictions.” The affidavit also set out Mehmet’s capacity to offer security. He owns a piece of real estate in Kellyville that is now estimated to be worth $750,000 and Mehmet has equity in the approximate sum of $200,000 in that property.
	
	
	The matter came before me again on Friday 31 July 2015 in the duty list. A problem had arisen when Mehmet had attempted to enter the security condition at the Burwood Local Court Registry. It seems that the registrar was not prepared to accept Mehmet Toksoz as an acceptable person. When the matter came before me the accused was represented by a legal clerk, who was granted leave to appear. Mehmet was present, along with other members of the accused’s family.
	
	
	I was provided with correspondence between the accused’s solicitor and the DPP in which the DPP indicated its view that Mehmet was not an acceptable person. I also was provided with a copy of Mehmet’s “Criminal history - bail report.” However, the DPP was not represented and I indicated that I would not deal with the matter in the absence of prosecution representation. I adjourned the case until 9.30 this morning.
	
	
	I advised Mr Moussa, who appeared then for the accused, of three matters I wanted to have addressed this morning. One was whether the clerk at Burwood had made a decision pursuant to the power under s 26(4)(b) of the Bail Act and if so, what power I had to review that decision; two, whether what was really being sought was a variation of the original bail decision, and three, the precise meaning of the entries on the criminal history and status of the various matters there referred to.
	
	
	Section 26(4) of the Bail Act provides:
	


(4) A decision as to which person or persons, or class or description of persons, is an acceptable person and what security is acceptable security for the purposes of a security requirement is to be made by:

(a) the bail authority imposing the bail condition, or

(b) the officer or court to whom the bail acknowledgment is given (if no decision has been made under paragraph (a))


	
	Regulation 23 provides:
	


23 Verification that proposed bail guarantor is acceptable person

A bail authority must not enter into a bail security agreement with a person unless the bail authority is satisfied:

(a) that a decision has been made as to which person, or class or description of persons, is an acceptable person to enter into the bail security agreement, and

(b) that the person:

(i) is an acceptable person referred to in that decision, or

(ii) belongs to a class or description of acceptable persons referred to in that decision.


	
	Nothing in the Bail Act or the regulations provides any guidance as to what constitutes an acceptable person for the purposes of s 26 of the Act. The term “acceptable person” is also used in s 27, which concerns character acknowledgements. It provides:
	


“27 Bail conditions can require character acknowledgments

(1) Bail conditions can require one or more character acknowledgments to be provided.

(2) A

""character acknowledgment"" is an acknowledgment, given by an acceptable person, other than the accused person, to the effect that he or she is acquainted with the accused person and that he or she regards the accused person as a responsible person who is likely to comply with his or her bail acknowledgment.

(3) A decision as to which person or persons, or class or description of persons, is an acceptable person for a character acknowledgment is to be made by:

(a) the bail authority imposing the bail condition, or

(b) the officer or court to whom the bail acknowledgment is given (if no decision has been made under paragraph (a)).

(4) A bail authority is not to require a character acknowledgment unless of the opinion that the purpose for which the acknowledgment is required is not likely to be achieved by imposing one or more conduct requirements.

(5) The regulations may make further provision for character acknowledgments and requirements to provide character acknowledgments.”


	
	There is a form commonly used by clerks and registrars in court registries which includes a questionnaire for people who are applying to be considered to be acceptable persons. That form includes two relevant questions which, if asked at the Burwood Court, may have caused the Registrar or clerk to have some misgivings about whether or not Mehmet was an acceptable person. The first is, “Have you been charged or convicted of any criminal offence?” and the second is, “Do you have any criminal charges, including court attendance notices, outstanding?” There is a requirement that the person provide details.
	
	
	What was not known at the time of the original bail application was that there are a number of offences that have been alleged against Mehmet Toksoz over a period from 2011 until now. In the “criminal history - bail report” that is now before me, it shows that he was given a caution in the Children’s Court for an offence of stalking in 2011. It also shows that he was dealt with in the Fairfield Local Court for offences of driving whilst his licence was suspended, possessing a driver’s licence without authority and, perhaps most significantly, stating a false name when apprehended by police. In respect of each of those offences he was fined. In respect of the stating false name offence, he was fined $300.
	
	
	The record goes on and there are a number of other offences referred to, but all but one of those have been withdrawn and the only matter that would, in general and common parlance, be considered to be a criminal matter was an offence of resisting police, for which he was placed on a bond under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for six months.
	
	
	The Bail Act (s 4) defines “conviction” to include a finding of guilt so, as a matter of technicality, the statement in Mehmet’s affidavit that he has no criminal convictions was erroneous. However, I think most people and indeed I suspect some, if not many, criminal lawyers would have thought, even looking at this record, that that statement was true.
	
	
	I certainly do not find that Mehmet deliberately misled his solicitor or the C ourt in asserting that he had no criminal convictions. He may have believed, and I will give him the benefit of the doubt, that the matters dealt with in Fairfield in 2013 were driving offences rather than criminal offences and that he would have been told, I am sure, when he was given the s 10 bond that he was not convicted, so it was an easy mistake to make and, I accept, a mistake that he did in fact make.
	
	
	However, the question of whether the affidavit contains deliberately false statements is not now the relevant one. The relevant question is whether or not he is an acceptable person. Going back to the three questions that I raised on Friday, Ms Bannister, who appears today, puts to me that questions of “finality” do not arise and that (1) what happened at Burwood was not a final decision or subject to any review by me and (2) I am not functus officio in terms of the original bail decision.
	
	
	Ms Mascia, who appears for the Crown, contends that one way or another the matter should be dealt with as a matter of substance rather than form. While some, I suppose, interesting questions might arise as to jurisdiction, I have little doubt that I have, at the very least, jurisdiction to consider an application to vary the bail in order to exercise the power that unquestionably resides in the bail authority granting bail to make a determination as to which person or class of persons is an acceptable person under the Act: see ss 26, 51 and 55 Bail Act.
	
	
	What I propose to do in terms of the formalities of jurisdiction is to treat the application as a variation application and to consider the questions of substance that arise. Both parties have attempted, without success, to find some guidance or authority on what an acceptable person is.
	
	
	As I said in argument, when the question arises under s 27 it is in the context of an acceptable person giving an opinion or vouching for the accused person’s character. In those circumstances it may be extremely relevant to determine the character of the proposed acceptable person and matters such as stating a false name in connection with a driving offence may be determinative.
	
	
	Similarly, if the condition proposed is one whereby a person simply promises - without security - to forfeit a sum of money if the accused does not comply with bail conditions, again, the extent of a person’s criminal history may be a very relevant factor. It is, of course, also a relevant factor when considering whether a person is an acceptable person when, as here, they are proposing to sign over by way of mortgage or caveat the title to their home.
	
	
	However, what constitutes an acceptable person in one instance might be very different to what constitutes an acceptable person in another. It is also then going to be a question of degree and a proper assessment of the person’s criminal history.
	
	
	I do not consider that a dismissal of the charge in the Children’s Court has any bearing at all on what I have to decide. I accept Ms Mascia’s submission that the driving offence of stating a false name is something that should be taken into account in considering whether Mehmet is an acceptable person. I suspect that the seriousness of the resisting police offence is reflected by the fact that the Burwood Local Court did not record a conviction and imposed a very short bond.
	
	
	I have not mentioned it yet but there also two outstanding charges of common assault and affray. Those two offences, it is accepted, arose out of an incident that took place on 17 September 2014. It was subject to a court attendance notice generated on 20 July 2015, but the matter was not brought to the attention of Mehmet Toksoz until the incident with the bail arose last Friday, which is to say 31 July 2015. That may be a reflection of the seriousness of the allegation. In any event, he denies it and is presumed to be innocent. Whilst it has some bearing on an assessment of whether he is an acceptable person for the purposes of the Bail Act, I do not take it into account as being a matter of any great moment.
	
	
	In the end, it becomes a value judgment based on all of the circumstances.
	
	
	A relevant circumstance is the basis upon which I came to the conclusion that bail should be granted. That was on a consideration of the strength of the prosecution case and difficulties that may arise as a result of certain things that had been said by the victim as to the role that Mr Toksoz played.
	
	
	I think it is also highly relevant that the acceptable person has to put up security in the sum of $200,000. I think it is also relevant that even though there is a criminal history it does not, in my assessment, include any matters of great significance. Even the false name matter was dealt with by way of a small fine of $300.
	
	
	Whilst I do have some concerns, I am ultimately firmly persuaded that Mr Mehmet Toksoz is an acceptable person and, pursuant to s 26(4)(a) decide that he is so. The condition of bail imposing a security requirement, which is condition (12) as I have recounted them in paragraph [29] above will be varied accordingly.

		27 August 2015",2015-07-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767263,R v TEBBUTT aka KARKOE [2015] NSWDC 323,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Benjamin James Karkoe appears today for sentence in relation to two offences which were each committed, as I understand it, on 1 August 2013 at Broken Hill. One offence is an indictable offence of supplying amphetamine in an amount of 97.4 grams being an amount more than the trafficable quantity. That is an offence to which he pleaded not guilty at the Broken Hill District Court and in respect of which there was a trial held by judge at the end of which I found him guilty on 22 May 2015.
	
	
	The facts of that offending are set out in my judgment of 22 May 2015, a copy of which has been provided to the prisoner today.
	
	
	That offence, being an offence contrary to s 25 in conjunction with s 29, Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a pecuniary penalty of 2,000 penalty units.
	
	
	The second offence with which I am concerned is an offence of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to s 193C, Crimes Act 1900, which when dealt with summarily, as in reality it is being dealt with at this time, carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or a pecuniary penalty of 50 penalty units. This crime relates to the prisoner’s possession of $2,950 in Australian bank notes at the time of the search of the prisoner’s premises at Broken Hill as particularised in the facts that I recited in giving judgment in relation to the supply amphetamine charge.
	
	
	The prisoner is for sentence in relation to that second charge because the matter came to the Court on a s 166 Certificate. This Court may, pursuant to s 167, Criminal Procedure Act, sentence an offender in relation to a summary offence if it is a related offence to principal offending required to be dealt with on indictment or by committal for sentence.
	
	
	The facts and circumstances of the prisoner’s possession of the cash the subject of the deal with proceeds of crime charge are so intimately bound up with the essence of the Crown case in respect of the amphetamine that I propose in relation to that offence to impose a sentence of 12 months imprisonment, but I propose to make that sentence entirely concurrent with the sentence of imprisonment I impose in relation to the far more serious offence.
	
	
	The prisoner has not been represented before me either at the trial or at the sentence proceedings, although I have had the opportunity, only in the last week, to revise the judgment I gave on 22 May 2015. The transcript of the trial has only become available, as I understand it, either today or yesterday, and the only part of that transcript that I have actually looked at at this stage - I have had no opportunity because I am sitting in Wagga conducting a lengthy criminal list and I have been involved in a criminal trial up until the moment - is the transcript of proceedings after I returned the verdict of guilty on 22 May 2015.  
	
	
	The transcript on that date and other transcript which I have yet not read on the days throughout the trial and before the trial commenced reveals or would reveal that I regularly asked the accused to get legal advice. In fact after finding him guilty, I, on at least three occasions that I can count, advised him to go and get legal advice and/or legal representation for his appearance today.
	
	
	The prisoner told me in the course of the proceedings today that he actually did go and get some legal advice as late as yesterday from a solicitor in Wagga whose name I do not recognise - not that that means a great deal - which really is shutting the door of the stable after the horse has bolted. I can only say in the scheme of things, in determining the appropriate sentence for the prisoner, the prisoner really has not done himself much justice in a range of ways in the course of these proceedings.
	
	
	I do not wish to be seen as criticising him, he has a right to act as he would wish, but in my view he chose to represent himself at the trial. He full well knew the issues - in fact it has become not only clear throughout the trial that he fully understood the issues when I tried to give him every available assistance in that regard, but subsequent material that has come to the notice of the Court, including what he said in reply to the Crown’s submissions today, which reveals he was fully cognisant of all the relevant issues that were required to be considered by the Court. He determined the course that he took in the fond hope I believe to avoid the consequences of his conduct. I accept that he has expressed contrition in relation to the offending and contrition in relation to - if could paraphrase his word - the ‘path’ he was taking in 2013. But the truth of the matter is, with appropriate advice or with the exercise of some common sense on his part, the course of these proceedings might have been somewhat different than has ultimately been the case.
	
	
	That is not to say that the accused has been disruptive or discourteous. He has been entirely courteous and cooperative throughout the course of the proceedings. I fully appreciated from the moment the matter came before me and from the time that I realised that he was going to remain unrepresented that the accused faced quite a number of difficulties. He had a lack of familiarity with aspects of the Court procedure. He is not a natural advocate or public speaker. He is not a highly educated person, although he certainly is not an unintelligent person. He has been able to, I point out, articulate the points that he wished to make even if some of the points that he wished to make at the trial he admits now were either misleading, wrong or false.
	
	
	He has understood, far as I can best see, most of what has been required of him to consider. There have been some misunderstandings on his part. I must confess I cannot understand how he would think in some way that what I told him back on 22 May 2015 when I delivered judgment and verdict would involve him going off and getting advice at the heel of the hunt, a day before he was to appear at court. He tells me that he has no means to pay for his representation. Yet he is apparently ineligible for other representation from other sources based upon what he has told me.
	
	
	In any event, in sentencing the offender I am required to take into account the objective facts in relation to the matter by reference to not only what is revealed in the judgment I gave on 22 May, but what is revealed from what the prisoner has told me from the bar table and is reflected in his plea of guilty in relation to dealing with proceeds of crime. He told me, in the course of my understanding the proper basis for his plea in relation to that matter, that the cash which I identified as constituting the substance of that charge, was, to use my words, ‘substantially’ the proceeds of crime. He has admitted in the presentence report, which relevantly he accepts as correct and in his statements volunteered from the bar table without urging from me, that prior to his arrest in relation to this matter he had been involved in supplying “amphetamine” for some period of time beforehand. It is a little unclear precisely what the detail of that is, I should say, but it is a matter which prudently I have tried to avoid pursuing too greatly.
	
	
	In dealing with this matter and having regard to the facts reflected in my earlier judgment there is other material to take into account.
	
	
	The Crown has presented a criminal history which shows appearances at the Magistrates Court in Victoria in early 1996 and at the Local Court in Broken Hill in November 1996. Having regard to the character of that offending and, of course, the length of time since that offending, those findings of guilt in the Magistrates Court, to my mind, are irrelevant in this proceeding.
	
	
	I have a presentence report that I ordered in the context of the prisoner being unrepresented before me earlier and the need for me, if he remained unrepresented, to have some independent at least account of relevant matters. That material plus what the prisoner has told me from the bar table reveals that the prisoner was born on 26 November 1976 and will turn 39 in November of this year. He is a person without any mental illness or psychological issues, perhaps save for one matter which I am prepared to accept. That is as a consequence of a home invasion, the causes of which seem a little murky if I be so bold to say so, approximately four years ago, the accused had symptoms, not diagnosed, of post-traumatic stress disorder but certainly causing disruption to his sleep and the like which led to his commencement of the use of amphetamine-type drugs.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept from the bar table, although it has not been examined from the Crown, that the offender’s role in drug supply, particularly the supply of amphetamine, arises in part out of his use of the drug himself.
	
	
	He told me that he was born at Camden. He has lived with his family in Charleville in Queensland and then at White Cliffs, a very small community primarily concerned with opal mining, partway between Broken Hill and Wilcannia. He lived at White Cliffs until he was 17 and then moved to Broken Hill and has lived at Broken Hill for over 20 years except for three years in Melbourne and several years, it would appear, in Adelaide. He returned to Broken Hill from Adelaide, as I understood what he said, in 2001.
	
	
	Apparently his parents, or one of his parents still lives in Broken Hill. He has either got nine brothers or sisters, or he is one of nine brothers and sisters, with two currently living at Broken Hill.
	
	
	He has been in partnership with a lady who sits in court and he has five children from that relationship. The search video showed the accused being caught obviously unawares that the police were going to come to his home and it shows a number of children around the place.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept, in the context of some family discord as a result of his amphetamine use and his amphetamine supply activities, that there has been unhappiness on the part of his wife relating to his activities. But the facts of the matter are, as I understand it, he is in a firm relationship with his partner. He has five children who are dependent upon him as is his wife. During the time in custody his wife will be forced to care for the children for whom I am satisfied the prisoner has considerable affection and considerable connection. His partner threatened to walk out on him, according to the presentence report, after his arrest in relation to this matter.
	
	
	It is quite clear, without being critical of the offender, that he not only received - he volunteered it - good advice, it seems to me, before he lost his legal representation at Broken Hill, but it also seems to me that he has conducted these proceedings primarily in an endeavour, unsuccessful as it turned out, to put off the inevitable, or to put off what he would regard as the worst result that could happen. He has frankly told me - and I believe him to be genuine about this - that when his premises were searched by the police and he then went the next day - as I have recounted in the other judgment - to be interviewed by the police, he told the police lies or untruths about the real purpose for his possession of at least most of the amphetamine in his possession. He admitted it being in his possession - to try and put off the inevitable consequence of what he had done. He told me, amongst other things, he did not want to admit that he had been supplying amphetamine or that he was going to supply the amphetamine in his possession because he did not want to see himself handcuffed in front of his children. I can understand that. He then realised, of course, that there was a very real possibility he was going to go gaol. He must have known it was inevitable he would go to gaol if convicted. He was trying to put off the inevitability of a term of imprisonment by both the account that he gave to the investigating police of smoking the amphetamine or possessing the amphetamine for the purposes of using it himself, solely to avoid the consequence of an admission that would lead perhaps to him being remanded in custody and ultimately being convicted more easily than would have been the case without his admissions.
	
	
	I must say I do not condone that behaviour, but there is a human element of that which I recognise. A man with a very young family, even involved in this pernicious trade, might not have either the wherewithal or the courage or the understanding of the real situation to face up to the reality of the matter.
	
	
	I understand from what the prisoner told me from the bar table today, from what he told me in the course of the trial and also from some background in the presentence report that the prisoner has lived somewhat at the periphery of society. He made a comment today about working in Adelaide or Melbourne as a builder’s labourer just working for cash. He told me during the course of the trial that he had been involved in opal mining and his family had been involved in opal mining, which I am prepared to accept. I understand the character of the opal mining industry and the way in which it is very much a commodity/cash economy in many respects that the Australian Tax Office has not quite managed to infiltrate. I make that as no criticism of the prisoner.
	
	
	His family living in White Cliffs gives - if it be true, and I am prepared to accept it for these proceedings - evidence of their connection with the opal industry. The only reason you would live at White Cliffs, unless you are involved in the opal industry, would be I expect if you were in the tourist industry.
	
	
	He has been involved in restoring of cars, he said, and some of the cash in his possession the subject of the summary charge he said was from restoring cars but he cannot identify the extent to which that is so.
	
	
	He started smoking cannabis at the age of 14 years. He left school when he was about 17. He progressed to amphetamine use, he said, as a consequence of a home invasion that occurred four or five years ago in Broken Hill and a number of people apparently, or at least more than one person, broke into his house and stole cash from him. He was, at that stage, a reasonably heavy marijuana user.
	
	
	He then, with sleepless nights, started to take amphetamine. How amphetamines would help him go to sleep I do not know. I would have thought they would have had a counter effect upon him. But, in any event, he continued using amphetamines, he said, up until being arrested. In fact he frankly admitted from the bar table the police missed some of the amphetamine that was in his possession which he said he smoked in the weeks after his arrest. Although according to the presentence report he has had two lapses involving amphetamine since he has largely endeavoured to remain drug-free.
	
	
	The report from the Community Service states this:
	


“Financial gains and other motive identified by the offender regarding the offence.

During interviews, Mr Karkoe stated he had intended to sell the methamphetamine (sic), despite his recent claim in court of the substance being solely for his personal use. His justification included supporting five young children. However, the offender had also reported earlier in the interview that he had been selling cannabis since a young age prior to having children.”


	
	He is not charged in relation to other offending. But he told me today in fact that - if I might use the expression that he used - he was “dealing” at a young age, first of all in cigarettes and then in marijuana in leaf form which became something of an addiction to the use of that particular drug. Then, of course, he came to amphetamine, became a regular user, and moved into “dealing” in that. That is the effect of what he said. He said he was addicted to amphetamine at the relevant time and I am prepared to accept that is so.
	
	
	He expressed remorse to me from the bar table in two ways. In his initial remarks from the bar table he acknowledged that by selling drugs of this type he was helping to “destroy my community” as I noted his words. He said to me in his initial remarks, “I’m a good person and I don’t intend to repeat what I’ve done.”
	
	
	In his reply to the Crown, in which he was given every opportunity to say what he wished, he talked, as I have said earlier, about the fear he had and the consequences of what he knew he had done to attract police attention. He said that he was deeply concerned. In fact I thought he became emotional somewhat when he talked about the damage that can be done by the drugs in his possession to members of the community. Whether it be an act or not it is not really possible for me to conclude. I took what he said, and to some extent the manner in which he said it, as a genuine expression of belated remorse.
	
	
	If the offender had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity he might have been sentenced on a more limited factual basis and he would have certainly received, if he pleaded guilty at the Local Court, a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence. But that is not what has happened.
	
	
	Before I leave the presentence report, reflecting upon his situation, the Community Corrections officer assessed him at medium risk of re offending. He has identified criminogenic needs related to his employment which has been sporadic, his financial situation, his associations, his alcohol and drug problems and emotional issues as well as his attitude and orientation. The assessment of the presentence report is that he has never been involved in legitimate employment - which is a matter I alluded to earlier - but he “believes he is capable of holding down a job”.
	
	
	He acknowledged that he would need to take action towards addressing his financial situation and his partner continued to express her support for him although in difficult circumstances.
	
	
	His drug use is recognised as a background matter but drug use of itself provides little in the way of mitigation for committing offences of this type. Although it must be fairly said that the courts usually look more sternly to those who simply trade in drugs for profit without regard to the effect of the drug than persons who themselves are users.
	
	
	I accept that he is endeavouring currently not to use amphetamine. There are some comments in the assessment which are challenged by the prisoner and I propose to acknowledge the matters objected by the prisoner. He would require assistance with counselling on his release from custody.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor on his usual helpful way has dealt effectively with the critical issues. The criminal history he described himself as negligible. He said that this was a case of “substantial involvement in the supply of drugs”, to paraphrase the words of other judgments which I will come to in a moment, and it is a matter that requires a full-time custodial sentence. There are no exceptional circumstances having regard to both the personal circumstances of the prisoner and the character of the offending.
	
	
	He pointed out, quite properly, that even though the prisoner was charged with “deemed supply”, it does not prevent the Court concluding that a person is substantially involved in drug supply. In fact the prisoner’s admissions to the Community Service officer and his admissions to me and his statement about various matters, some of which I have summarised, make that abundantly clear. At least part of his motivation was financial gain.
	
	
	He correctly pointed out there has to be an element of general deterrence in sentencing for this type of offending to deter other people from seeking to profit with this pernicious trade. But he also pointed out, as I have pointed out, the prisoner has been cooperative throughout the process. He was extremely cooperative with the police, save for not telling them the entire truth. He was asked to come down to the police station, somewhat surprisingly as I have pointed out, the following day. Which he did. True it is he made a number of admissions against interest in that interview, but true it is also he sought to paint a different picture of his involvement in this crime.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are, I believe, he knew that he was - to use the colloquialism - caught ‘cold’, and he was trying to spin the best story to try and deflect his responsibility. I again point out that is a human reaction.
	
	
	The principles I need to apply are quite numerous and I will quickly deal with them. I am required to have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have to ensure that he is adequately punished to prevent and deter him committing further crimes and also preventing others and deterring others from committing similar offences. I have to protect the community from the offender, although I do not believe the prisoner is a threat to the community although drug dealing of course is a threat to the community in the general sense. I am required to make him accountable for his actions, to denounce his conduct. There is no specific victim but the prisoner himself, in a rather tearful way, acknowledged that there were people who would suffer from his actions, as he no doubt, from to time, may have suffered if in fact that is so.
	
	
	I am also required to promote his rehabilitation, and I am mindful of what the High Court said in Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 where the majority, when reflecting upon the’ purposes’ of criminal punishment, where they identified four of the current seven, said that they were ‘signposts’ that sometimes pointed in opposing directions.
	
	
	A court, pursuant to s 5 of the Act, must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, and that clearly is the case here, that I am satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	I am to have regard to the objective facts of the matter, that is, whilst a deemed supply in the context of the prisoner having the drugs in his possession clearly for the purposes of supply and being involved in that practice beforehand - that is not an aggravating factor I hasten to say - and I am mindful of the fact the prisoner has not been charged in relation to other offences. But it provides in essence, in a frank way I hasten to say by the prisoner, the explanation for his possession of the drugs with which I am concerned.
	
	
	I am sentencing the prisoner for an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and in that context, taking into account all other matters I am required to have regard to, for example, the substantial quantity and the range of quantities that are anticipated in relation to this particular drug for an offence pursuant to s 25 of the Act. I acknowledge, as is obviously the case in sentencing for drug supply or drug importation under the breaches of Commonwealth law, that quantity of itself is not a determinative factor.
	
	
	The Crown made some observation about hierarchy and the like. I have got no organisation chart here. I do not believe the prisoner is a member of an organisation. He gave an account to the police in fact that he bought the drug off somebody who either brought it to Broken Hill from Adelaide or from whom he obtained in Adelaide for a sum of money - in my memory it is in the facts earlier published - in the order of $7,000. It seems to me that what the case reveals is the prisoner is a person who has obtained amphetamine from another person for the purposes of him being the principal supplier of it, or supplying that part of it that he would wish to sell.
	
	
	Of course, I am not concluding beyond reasonable doubt that he was going to supply all of the drug. I accept, although I have difficulty accepting that he smoked it, that the offender was going to use part of the drug and the precise amount that he was going to supply I cannot conclude. But it would seem clear that he was to supply or on-sell a substantial part of the drug.
	
	
	I note the level of purity of the amphetamine; 38%, is reasonably high. I appreciate at that level of purity the drug in question could be cut or reduced in purity and thus the quantity could be expanded. That goes without saying. I point out, of course, that this drug was not crystal amphetamine. I am seeing disturbingly crystal amphetamine after manufacture or at early stages of supply with levels of purity up to 80%. In fact a great deal of crystal amphetamine coming to Australia from China has very, very high levels of purity creating enormous damage to the community. But I am also mindful of the fact that amphetamine and methylamphetamine, other than crystal methylamphetamine, might be sold to the community with purity levels as low as 3 to 1% - certainly below 10% when sold at street level.
	
	
	Whether the prisoner was going to go around selling individual amounts to individual users or whether he was going to sell it in a wholesale way to somebody who was going to further distribute the drug by cutting it down I cannot say. Certainly I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was going to himself cut it down. But then he must have appreciated, by its quality, bearing in mind he had been using amphetamines himself for four years, that it was fairly strong in its purity and was capable of being cut down.
	
	
	With regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I have not been drawn to any aggravating factors other than perhaps the aggravating factor of an offence committed for financial gain. But the truth of the matter is the reason that there are substantial penalties for dug supply in various forms is because the trade in drugs is for financial gain and for some people quite extraordinary financial gain. I could not conclude that as an aggravating factor as 21A(2) contemplates given that it is an intimate feature of the character of the offending.
	
	
	The same observation might be made of planning, although there is no evidence of any real planning here. Many times what are seen as steps in the planning process of the supply of drugs are merely - if I might use the word ‘merely’ advisably - the ordinary course of supplying drugs. The very character of the offence requires a basic level of planning in order for the offence to be committed.
	
	
	So ultimately I have concluded there are no specific aggravating factors independent of what the objective facts state.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors, I am prepared to find a number favourable to the prisoner. I am prepared to find that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. I am prepared to find that the prisoner does not have any significant record of previous convictions. Although he has been living on the periphery of society, noting his children and his relationship with his partner, I am prepared to find, notwithstanding his admissions made from the bar table and to the Community Corrections officer, that he is a person of some good character.
	
	
	As to whether he is likely to re-offend would depend very much upon his ability to avoid using drugs and his financial circumstances. The word is ‘unlikely’ to re-offend and I conclude in his favour on balance he is unlikely to re-offend from the salutary experience of this. I am prepared to accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation having regard to his age and his responsibility for his children and, as I say, the salutary effect of what has happened.
	
	
	I am prepared to even accept on balance that the prisoner has shown remorse by accepting responsibility for his actions, particularly in his comments today. He specifically acknowledged the damage done to the community by his activities or his potential activities and I accept that as evidence of remorse.
	
	
	Although it is not truly a mitigating factor, it must be fairly said there was assistance or perhaps better expressed as disclosure by the prisoner in some respects. He certainly made admissions against interests. But he is not entitled, of course, to a discount for “cooperation” because he has not provided the relevant cooperation s 23 of the ‘Sentencing Procedure Act’ provides.
	
	
	I have determined ultimately that I must impose a term of full-time custody. It has been held in a number of decisions such as Carrion (2000) 49 NSWLR 149 at [25], Gip (2006) 161 A Crim R 173 at [13], Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 at [27] and Fayd’Herbe v R [2007] NSWCCA 20 at [14] that a person must receive a full-time custodial sentence if they are substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs or “trafficking” unless there are exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	These observations from these cases reflect upon the remarks of Hunt J, in the unreported decision of Clark from 1990 which is, in legal terms, generations ago, that trafficking alone in any substantial degree should normally lead to a custodial sentence. One of the complications with that proposition is that the availability of various sentencing options and the like has changed since 1990. Of course, maximum penalties and the character of charges have changed too. It is accepted by the Crown in its submissions, and I accept it as true, that the offender’s offending as revealed in the facts that I gave in May and in the further admissions made by the prisoner reveal trafficking or supplying to a substantial degree, and of course there are no exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	I am mindful there are many decisions that discuss the issue of exceptional circumstances - Cacciola from 1998 and Gu, the case I earlier mentioned reflect upon these matters. In Cacciola for example, the youth of the offender, the fact that he had no prior convictions, his plea of guilty, his remorse, his readiness to assist the police and his good prospects of rehabilitation were not so exceptional as to warrant a non-custodial sentence. Priestley J said:
	


“A combination of subjective circumstances, each strong in itself, does not add up to exceptional circumstances unless the aggregate of all those circumstances point to the case being one of real difference from the general run of cases.”


	
	Of course, in that regard, one is talking about exceptional circumstances such as not to warrant a term of full-time custody. The objective seriousness of this matter, allowing for all mitigating matters, does not permit in any event a term of imprisonment that would permit an alternative to full-time custody as I have earlier foreshadowed. The law now provides that the only time a sentence of imprisonment can be served by other than full-time custody is when the sentence is for two years or less.
	
	
	Although I have not had a great deal of time to reflect upon this case, I took the opportunity of re-reading Adams J’s judgment in Fayd’Herbe, particularly his summation of a number of authorities going back to Clark set out in [11] through to [19].
	
	
	Fayd’Herbe was sentenced also in relation to an offence under s 25A, Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. That is an offence of ongoing supply and its facts are very different from this case. But there are a number of the authorities to which I have referred that are summarised in that matter.
	
	
	I have taken into account everything the offender has said to me and I have taken into account the helpful submissions of the Crown in the context of, as I said, the maximum penalty, weighing the objective facts and the objective seriousness of the offending against or with the mitigating factors and other subjective issues, giving all full credit to, I believe, the matters that arise from the case the prisoner has conducted before me. Inevitably there must be a term of imprisonment imposed.
	
	
	I have concluded, however, that there are special circumstances that warrant an adjustment of the non-parole period pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The prisoner may not appreciate the significance of that section but based upon the foreshadowed sentence that I have indicated - three years nine months - without a finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period would be something in the order - and I have not done the mathematics precisely - of two years and ten months or thereabouts.
	
	
	I am proposing to fix a non-parole period of 18 months which is substantially below what sometimes has been called, although criticised, as the “statutory norm”. I believe I should do this for several reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, I believe the term of imprisonment I will impose will have the necessary deterrent effect on the prisoner. I acknowledge the fact that this is the prisoner’s first time in custody and there will be considerable difficulties for him in custody not just for that fact, but he will be separated from his family in circumstances where, for some time at least, his family will be in Broken Hill and he will be no doubt some considerable distance away from Broken Hill. It may turn out in due course he will come back to Broken Hill gaol which will make it easier for him to have contact with his family, but I foreshadow there will be some period of time that he will be long-separated from his family.
	
	
	I also conclude that he needs an extended period of supervision to assist him to adjust to community living. As I said earlier, the impression I get - in fact there seems to be a clear picture emerging from the prisoner’s own statements and the presentence report - is the fact that the prisoner has been a person living sort of on the fringe or the periphery of the community and it is coming to the point where, if he wishes to maintain a relationship with his partner and his children, he will be required to take a role in a more mainstream position and that will include trying to obtain regular employment. Although I accept that with his connections with the opal industry he may continue in that trade, which I do not necessarily criticise.
	
	
	He will also need professional guidance for an extended period of time to avoid relapsing into the use of marijuana, and amphetamines has in part contributed to the circumstances with which I am concerned.
	
	
	It seems to me this matter could have, in many ways, ended up substantially different to the way it did ended up. I believe the prisoner has - if I be so bold to say so - been a fool to himself to believe that he could tough it out so to speak. This he now acknowledges is so, and as I have earlier said in the course of the proceedings after he was found guilty, on at least three occasions I almost begged him, although it may not have appeared to him, to go off and get some proper legal advice and to ensure that he had legal representation so his interests could be best represented with the hand that he had been dealt. In that regard, of course, I do not want to be seen to have been bending over backwards for the prisoner. But I have, in the judgment of this matter, had to make allowance for the fact that the prisoner has been unrepresented. He is not in the best position to have represented his own interests. For example, he has come without references. I have acknowledged that I am prepared to accept that he could provide some evidence if it was sought properly of support for his family, his relationship with his partner and his children. I accept as a fact that, putting aside the serous antisocial aspect of drug supply, he is generally not an antisocial person. There is no evidence available to me that he is a member of a bikie gang running around the community in Broken Hill, smashing up properties and dealing with drugs on the side or vice versa. But the truth of the matter is, as I have earlier pointed out, the conduct in which he was involved is pernicious and it does not matter whether you are doing it in a pinstripe suit or in a bomber jacket, by supplying drugs you are doing damage to the community. If one had children one would hope, as the prisoner expresses to me he now has, one would have some insight into the effect upon the community and desist from that behaviour.
	
	
	I just finish by saying in relation to the summary matter, I have already briefly referred to that, that the facts are self-evident from the earlier judgment I made, as well as the discussion I have had with the prisoner and the Crown about whether the prisoner should enter a plea. I propose to impose a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for that offence to be entirely concurrent with the non-parole period.
	
	
	Of course I have had regard to Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] of the majority judgment, but I am also mindful of cases like Hammoud, the issue of concurrency and partial accumulation reflected in the totality of the criminality of offences being dealt with at the same time involves a very fine discretionary judgment and in the scheme of things I have concluded, bearing in mind the way the matter has come before me, that the appropriate penalty for the summary offence should be served concurrently with the primary sentence.
	
	
	Could you stand up, thanks very much Mr Karkoe? In relation to the offence for which I found you guilty, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of one year six months from today. That non-parole period thus commences on 24 July 2015 and expires on 23 January 2016.
	
	
	In relation to that sentence, I impose a balance of sentence of two years and three months. That balance of sentence will expire, on my calculation, on 23 April 2018. That means it is a total sentence of three years and nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months.
	
	
	In respect of the summary offence of dealing with proceeds of crime, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months to date from today, 24 July 2015, it will expire on 23 July 2016. It is entirely concurrent with the non-parole period I have fixed. I thus will not fix a non parole period obviously for that sentence.
	
	
	Just take a seat, thanks very much. Yes Mr Crown.
	
	
	FOX: A formal order required for the forfeiture of the $2,950. I hand that order up--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well has the accused been shown the order?
	
	
	FOX: He has your Honour, yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you consent to the order to forfeit the sum of money, Mr Karkoe? I’m not - I need to hear your voice, that’s all.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes sir.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You do?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you. Thanks very much.
	
	
	On the application of the Crown, pursuant to s 18(1) Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989, I order that the cash in the sum of $2,950 found at 636 Chapple Street, Broken Hill - it says on 31 July. Wasn’t it 1 August? It’s 1 August, Mr Crown.
	
	
	FOX: 1 August, yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 1 August 2013 be forfeited to the state.
	
	
	I’ve signed that order and I’ll have that sealed. Can we have a copy given to Mr - we’ll give you the original, we’ll keep a copy for the file - do you have a seal - and I’ll give a copy for - sorry, sorry, the non-parole period. I apologise. I’ve made an error there Mr Crown. Naturally - the 18 months expires on 23 January 2017, not 2016. That’s only six months. And thus the balance of sentence, two years three months, expires on 23 April 2019. So I just correct the error. It would’ve been understood, 18 months from today would not be 2016, it’s 2017.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Your Honour--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: And sequence 3, sentence of 12 months imprisonment to expire on 23 July - there is an error there but - 2016. Right. Just take a seat Mr Karkoe. Now Mr Karkoe, you may not know this, I don’t know, but are there any reasons that the Corrective Services people should be alert to your protection in custody?
	
	
	OFFENDER: My protection?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes. I mean - I’m not suggesting you should go on protection, that can have implications for you that you don’t want, but is there any reason that you would fear to be in custody by reason of some animosity towards you by somebody within custody?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Not at all, no.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The Corrective Services officers will have to process you and that will involve a range of things that will occur. You’ve never been in gaol custody before, is that correct?
	
	
	OFFENDER: No--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: They’ll be fingerprinting you and they’ll give you such advice as they reasonably can in the circumstances to transition, but I am not au fait with the process involved in that but if at any time you believe there’s some reason that you need your safety protected you should advise the Corrective Services accordingly. I’m not suggesting for one moment you should go on protection because I do fully understand once a person puts themselves on protection, particularly mistakenly, it has ramifications for them throughout the system totally unintended. Do you understand what I mean? There are people who put themselves on protection because they’ve been convicted of child sexual assault offences and the like, but other people get put on protection, they’re mistakenly believed to be child sexual offenders or informants or whatever in the - yes Mr Crown.
	
	
	FOX: Your Honour, it may be of some assistance to Mr Karkoe, if he wishes he may make application, as I understand it, to be moved to a gaol closer to where his family are.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I understand that. The Corrective Services officers know this better than I and maybe from the floor of the Court they can assist me, but my understanding is when a person comes into custody for the first time they’re assessed by first of all a triage nurse, but there’s also an assessment committee or - isn’t there, in the first day or two, is that right? Not tonight but tomorrow or the next day? Or it’s the weekend coming up, maybe Monday, and then your classification will be worked out based upon the length of the sentence, the character of the offending, your prior criminal history, whether you’ve ever escaped before, do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: And then as you work your way through the system, your classification will, in some respects, take into account your family circumstances and the like and as I said in my remarks, it’s possible that you could end up back at Broken Hill gaol which, if you’re going to be in a gaol apparently is not a bad gaol to be in, but I’ve never been in gaol beyond visiting prisoners, so--
	
	
	OFFENDER: ..(not transcribable).. which gaol sir. As long as I’m close to my family I’m happy.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well anyway, these are matters to be worked out by Corrective Services but they won’t happen overnight, right? Right, thank you. You’re excused Mr Karkoe. Could you - Corrective Services--
	
	
	OFFENDER: Can I just ask one question?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes please?
	
	
	OFFENDER: So because all the numbers were getting swapped around and I’ve - figures going through my head, so how long am I in gaol for?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You’re eligible for - I’m sorry, I apologise, I understand the point you make. I’ve sentenced you to three years nine months imprisonment. I’ve fixed a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment. Those sentences date from today because you have no prior custody as far as I’m aware.
	
	
	OFFENDER: What does non-parole mean?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Non-period period means the minimum period of time you’ll spend in custody and on 23 January 2017 you’ll be eligible for release to parole. In other words, the Parole Authority will determine whether you should be released to parole on that date or a later date.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Okay.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: The minimum period you spend in custody would be 18 months. If you don’t get into any trouble in custody, you don’t have any difficulties in custody with drugs, if you don’t commit any offences whilst in custody, I can’t guarantee you you will be released on 23 January but bearing in mind you’re a non-violent offender as I would understand it, you’re likely to be released on the date I’ve fixed. But I’ve got no control over your release, that’s a matter for Corrective Services and the Parole Authority.
	
	
	OFFENDER: And my actions inside gaol?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: And your actions inside gaol will also contribute to that, do you understand? If a judge fixes a sentence of three years or less, he or she can direct someone to be released to parole. But if the sentence is more than three years, it’s a matter for the parole authority. But that non-parole period which expires - I’ll just repeat again - on 23 January 2017, represents the minimum period you must spend in custody, subject to your rights of appeal or the Crown’s rights of appeal. I mean both of you have rights of appeal and that’s obviously something I respect. I merely make decisions and I do the best I can in good faith and other people can form their own views about what I do. But if the sentence I fixed stands, then you’ll be eligible for release to parole on 23 January 2017. I’m sorry, I should have explained that to you.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yeah - no worries, yeah. I understand now.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you. If you are released to parole - I should just tell you this - you’ve got a balance of sentence of two years and three months. If you do get released on that date, you’ll be subject to supervision by the Parole Authority which includes officers of Community Corrections, the people that prepare the report. If you breach your parole, that is breach any conditions of your parole which might include having urinalysis, for example - it might include a number of conditions - residential conditions, employment conditions - if you breach your parole, it doesn’t come back to me, it doesn’t come back to another judge of the Court. The Parole Authority has the power to revoke your parole, take you back into custody, and you’ll serve either the balance of your sentence or such time as the Parole Authority deems appropriate before they will release you again. So in other words, say a person’s got two years balance of parole, they breach their parole after six months, they could come back and spend another 18 months in custody til their sentence expires or they might come back for six months and then the parole authority say, well if he’s shown some improvement, the situation’s settled down, we’ll release him again on parole, right? That’s all in your court and the court of the Parole Authority.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr Karkoe, you’re excused, thank you very much. Do I need to bring a drug destruction order Mr Crown?
	
	
	FOX: I’ll just check with the officer. Yes, there will need to a destruction of the drug order made.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well I order that the drugs be destroyed.

		15 January 2016",2015-07-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767266,R v Tregeagle [2015] NSWDC 188,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Over a four month period in 2013 the offender Lindsay Michael Tregeagle committed seven very serious offences. At the time he was but twenty-two years of age and he had given no indication before then that he was the sort of person who would threaten people with violence and then try to kill someone merely for his own financial gain. It is remarkable that he committed even a single offence and astounding that he kept going, injuring people as he did so, trying to kill one particular person, until he was fortunately stopped by police.
	
	
	He has now pleaded guilty to those seven offences. Three are offences of armed robbery, one is an offence of attempted armed robbery, one is an offence of armed robbery and inflict actual bodily harm. Then there is an offence of robbery and depriving liberty and, the most serious offence, wounding with intent to murder. These are, as the maximum penalties show, some of the most serious offences in the criminal calendar. Indeed, the last offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years and has a standard non-parole period of ten years. Of course, I have taken into account the maximum penalties in each case and the standard non-parole period in one case in determining the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal behaviour began on 2 May 2013 when the offender robbed a woman who was working at a bottle shop. On this occasion the offender went into the bottle shop dressed in disguise. He had a black hoodie jumper on with the hoodie pulled over his head, as well as a balaclava. He was carrying a knife straight out in front of him. He said to the victim, “Don't look at me. Just give me the money out of the till. Don't say anything.” The victim cooperated. She did what he asked. She asked, “Do you want the coins?” The offender said, “No. I want Bundy rum.” So as well as taking the money, he took three bottles of Bundaberg rum. He then told her to get on the ground and put her face on the carpet. He told her to, “Stay down and don't get up.” He then ran away, taking with him about $1,500 in cash and the alcohol.
	
	
	Obviously emboldened by his success, he committed another armed robbery a relatively short time later on exactly the same person. He again was disguised wearing a hoodie and a balaclava and again he told her, whilst armed with a knife, “Just give me the money. Don't look at me. Give me the money.”  Thing did not go as smoothly though. The offender noticed that there were no ten dollar notes handed over, so he accused the victim of hiding them. She said, “I don't have any ten dollar notes.” He said, “You are lying. You must have ten dollar notes. You must be hiding them. Give me the ten dollar notes.” He then pointed the knife towards the coin tray. The victim took the coin tray out and took some fifty dollar notes from underneath. She also removed some one hundred dollar notes and handed them to the offender. As a parting gesture, he said to her, “Get on the floor, bitch. Put your face in the carpet.” She did so. The offender ran away, taking this time $1,200 in cash.
	
	
	The next offence is the attempted armed robbery. This time the offender went into a shop quite early in the morning, 6.15am. He seemed to be armed with a different knife. This one looked like a breadknife and had a serrated edge. He said to the victim who was working in the shop, “Give me your cash.” Mr Keegan, as he was the victim, said, “I’ve got no cash. Piss off and get out of the shop.” He picked up a tomato stake and started to fend the offender off. Mr Tregeagle was not to be deterred. He said, “Give me the cash. I know you've got cash.” Mr Keegan said, “No, I don't.” The offender waved the knife in the direction of Mr Keegan, who used the tomato stake to defend himself, trying to dislodge the knife from the offender’s hand from a distance. He managed to hit Mr Tregeagle’s hand with the tomato stake and yell for help. Eventually the offender gave up. He ran away, hopped on a pushbike and cycled out of the area. No money was obtained.
	
	
	The offender did not take this defeat well. He returned a short time later to the same shop and the same man, Mr Keegan. This time he was armed with a baseball bat and this time there was no question of merely threatening Mr Keegan with a weapon in an effort to get him to provide money. The baseball bat was used almost immediately after the offender went into the premises. He swung it onto Mr Keegan’s left leg, causing him to fall to the ground. It was not good enough for the offender that he had achieved a substantial part of his objective with Mr Keegan lying on the ground. He continued to hit him with the baseball bat including Mr Keegan’s left leg and his left arm which he was using to defend himself. Eventually the offender stopped. Mr Keegan stood up and the offender said, “Now give me your cash.” Mr Keegan opened the cash register and said, “There’s the cash.” The offender said, “You get it out,” and so Mr Keegan did. Despite the fact that Mr Keegan was actually cooperating, the offender hit him again with the baseball bat, this time near the elbow area. Mr Keegan, not unnaturally, said, “Stop hitting me. I’m getting the cash for you.” He opened the till and the offender said, “Get it out.” He said, “Where’s all your fifty dollar notes?” Mr Keegan lifted the tray out to show that he had none, and the offender ran out of the store. This time he got $700. Mr Keegan was taken to John Hunter Hospital where it was found that he had fractures to his leg and his arm as a result of the attack.
	
	
	Next we move to another armed robbery offence, this time committed on 15 August 2013. The premises in this case were a video store. Once more, the offender was disguised with a hoodie and a balaclava and this time he had a knife. He came into the premises about 7.45 and said to the lady working there, “Give me the money, bitch.” She did so. She took the money out, despite the fact that the offender was very close to her, pointing the knife at her. She said, “Where do you want me to put the money?” She was told to throw it on the counter and again the offender said, “Where’s the rest of it? Where’s the fifties?”  He continued to look for fifty dollar notes. He said, “Where’s the rest of it?” The lady said, “You've got it all. There’s no more. That’s it.” He pushed her into the back corner of the store. She fell over and hit her left forearm and hand. He continued to demand money. “Where’s the money?” She said, “You've got it. There’s no more.” The telephone started to ring. This presumably deterred the offender from further arguing the point as to where the money was. He told her not to answer the phone, not to ring the police, and left. Ms Becker suffered a cut to her left thumb and bruising to her left forearm. He got $700 from this robbery.
	
	
	Then we come to the robbery of a newsagency where a Ms Noakes was working and a Mr Jenkins, who was seventy-one years of age, was helping. The newsagency opened very early and Ms Noakes was working there by herself. The owner of the newsagency asked Mr Jenkins to go and just sit with her to provide some security. I saw some closed-circuit TV footage depicting what happened in this offence. Ms Noakes is seen to be behind the counter preparing for the day whilst Mr Jenkins sits on a seat across from her reading a newspaper. The offender came into the store wearing, again, a hood and a balaclava. He had a knife which is described in the facts as about 12 inches long and which appeared to me to be a significant size, at least that length. He ran straight up to Mr Jenkins, grabbed him by the arm and shoulder and held the knife by the handle, placing the tip of the blade against the back of Mr Jenkins’ neck. He held it in place. He said, “Don't move. Just give me the money. I just want the fifties.” Ms Noakes took the notes from the till. The offender demanded notes from the other till, the post office section of the newsagency. So Ms Noakes took the money from there. All the time this was happening, the offender was menacing Mr Jenkins by holding the knife against his neck. Eventually he took the money and fled. Ms Noakes can be seen in distress as he leaves.
	
	
	Then we come to the most serious offence, as if what I have just described was not bad enough. On this occasion, once more, the offender entered a store intending to rob it. He went into a bottle shop at about 6.45pm where Mr Hamilton, the owner of the store, was working. I saw CCTV footage of this offence as well. As soon as the offender entered the store, he began menacing Mr Hamilton with the knife, waving it around in front of him. He said, “Give me the fucking money. Give me the fucking money,” as he moved closer and closer towards where Mr Hamilton was standing behind the register. Mr Hamilton told the offender, “Fuck off,” and he continued to express his displeasure about the circumstances that presented themselves to him. The offender was not deterred. He kept yelling, “Give me the money.” Mr Hamilton had his arms up to protect himself and so the offender started to lunge towards him, swinging his knife as he did so. He picked up a bottle of spirits and threw it at Mr Hamilton. Mr Hamilton then found himself cornered in behind the counter. He had nowhere to go but forward, and so he did so, holding up his arms in a defensive stance. He grabbed the offender by his jacket and tried to wrestle him out of the way. In the process, the jacket came off, and so did the balaclava. Fortunately, this exposed the offender’s face to the CCTV cameras and to Mr Hamilton. They wrestled and the offender managed to push Mr Hamilton over between a wine display and the fridge. Mr Hamilton fell onto the floor, smashing bottles of wine.
	
	
	Then this happened. The offender stood over Mr Hamilton while he was on the floor. He lunged at Mr Hamilton with the knife and although Mr Hamilton tried to defend himself, he was unsuccessful. The offender stabbed Mr Hamilton, holding him down, three or four times. Not content with that, he was kicking and punching Mr Hamilton as well. One might have thought that having stabbed Mr Hamilton, as he did, that would be enough, but it was not. He got off and started to walk away. Mr Hamilton, injured significantly, was bleeding on the floor. It was then that the offender decided to kill Mr Hamilton. He turned back, went over to where Mr Hamilton was lying on the floor and thrust the knife into his torso area a further three or four times. As if there was any doubt as to what the offender intended, he shouted, “Die. Fucking die,” as he did so. He then fled the store.
	
	
	As a result, Mr Hamilton was significantly injured. He had a fractured rib, a pneumothorax, the upper lobe of one of his lungs was lacerated, he had a left haemopneumothorax. Eight stab wounds were found to his left shoulder blade, left side of his back, left hip area, left upper arm, abdominal region, chest and left thigh, as well as lacerations to his hands, arms, neck and cheek.
	
	
	The images from the last offence after the offender’s balaclava and hoodie were removed were circulated, and information soon became made known to police as to the identity of the offender. He was arrested at work. He tried to modify his appearance by getting a tattoo on the back of his neck but clearly, given the video images and the fact that his fingerprints were found on the bottle that he had thrown at Mr Hamilton, there was not much doubt as to who the offender was. A search of his premises also found the knife that was used to stab Mr Hamilton, Mr Hamilton’s DNA being found on it.
	
	
	As a result of the offender’s terrible crimes, a number of people have been harmed. Victim impact statements were tendered by the Crown. Mr Jenkins reports that he had nightmares and was unable to sleep for a few months, thinking back to the robbery. Mr Hamilton, understandably, seems to have fared worse. He is thinking of selling the bottle shop, not surprisingly. He has permanent scarring. He is in permanent pain from injuries to his left side torso. Also not surprisingly, he is more easily spooked, frightened and more suspicious of new customers. He has to take medication for depression and anxiety.
	
	
	These consequences were entirely foreseeable. I have no doubt also that harm was occasioned to other victims too. I have mentioned the physical harm as I went through my description of the offences but there is also psychological harm too which is an almost inevitable consequence of being the victim of an armed robbery. For these reasons, armed robberies are considered very serious offences.
	
	
	So why did the offender at twenty-two with no real criminal history decide to act as he did? A psychologist who interviewed him reported that the offender said that he was abusing alcohol and in financial difficulties at the time, financial difficulties apparently of his own causing as he had begun to gamble to excess. Despite the fact that he had two jobs, he was losing money. So the offender thought the best way, apparently, that he could deal with his problem was to commit this series of offences.
	
	
	The offender has no real excuse in his upbringing as to why he would have done what he did. He is supported and loved by his family. His parents separated when he was in his mid teens and his mother was distressed by that circumstance, attempting suicide on a couple of occasions. The offender did not speak to his father as a result for some time but now that he has been in custody he has re-established contact with his father. He was a good worker. His supervisor gave evidence today in support of him, saying that he would have him back, were he able to employ him. He seems to have been an industrious young man, managing, as I have said, to work two jobs, doing his jobs well and being rewarded for his efforts.
	
	
	A great deal of time today was spent attempting to establish the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation. The psychological report tendered on behalf of the offender and the psychological report obtained by the Crown in response were the subject of examination and cross-examination. It may be that the offender was having troubles with alcohol at the time but certainly his voluntary consumption of alcohol is not a mitigating factor. Even if there were not the statutory prohibition against taking self-induced consumption of alcohol into account as a mitigating factor, in the circumstances of this case where the most serious offence, the attempted murder case, came after a number of other offences where the offender was apparently intoxicated, demonstrates that in no way can the offender’s self-induced intoxication be considered a mitigating feature.
	
	
	There was some suggestion that post traumatic stress disorder may have had something to do with the offender’s behaviour. The suggestion that PTSD may have been a factor arose from a claim by the offender that he had been sexually assaulted as a child. He did not give sworn evidence that that had occurred. He gave some details to the psychologist who interviewed him but there was no corroborative evidence. Quite whether he was telling the truth or not I simply do not know. I have no trouble at all accepting the circumstance that victims of sexual assault are reluctant to disclose it but in circumstances where the offender did not give sworn evidence, where he refused to be assessed and interviewed by a psychologist on behalf of the Crown, and where in at least one area he was exaggerating his responses to the psychologist who did interview him, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the sexual assault even occurred. Even if it did, I see little connection between it and the commission of these offences.
	
	
	Although there was a suggestion that sufferers from PTSD can experience angry outbursts, no friend or family member has reported any conduct of that kind. As well, the commission of these offences and his decision to go back and have another go at Mr Keegan with the baseball bat is contrary, as I understand it, to what would be expected from a sufferer of PTSD who might otherwise be expected to avoid threatening circumstances.
	
	
	Ultimately, I cannot be satisfied that the offender has good prospects for rehabilitation. There is no doubt hope for the future and I do not want to diminish the good work that the offender has apparently been doing whilst in custody. He seems, from the evidence before me, to have continued his industrious attitude, which he displayed before going to gaol, inside gaol. He has done many courses. He has obtained certificates. I am satisfied that his desire to deal with the various issues which confront him is genuine. But given that these most serious offences effectively came out of the blue and were apparently committed all because of the offender’s gambling problems, I would have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was not going to do the same thing next time he was short of cash.
	
	
	I simply cannot make that finding in the offender’s favour. That is not to say that he does not have any prospects of rehabilitation at all. I have got to decide under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act whether his prospects of rehabilitation are good. I simply say that I cannot make that finding on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	I also take into account the offender’s expressions of remorse. Once again I note that he did not give sworn evidence but the evidence which is before me suggests that he has expressed his remorse to a number of people. I am prepared to accept in his favour that he has feelings of regret for what his actions have done to the victims of his offending.
	
	
	These are serious offences, as I have said repeatedly. There are a number of aggravating features. In all cases the victims were vulnerable by reason of their occupation. In all cases, there was a degree of planning, some more than others, for example, the return to visit Mr Keegan, sequence 5, an offence which seems to have been motivated by revenge as much as by a desire to rob Mr Keegan. The offences were all committed for financial gain. Weapons were used in every case, but I note that is a statutory aggravating feature, of course, for sequences 3 and 5.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences I impose upon him will be 25 per cent less than they would otherwise have been. I also note that when comparing these offences with the R v Henry (1999)  46 NSWLR 346; (1999) ACrimR 149 guideline, the four to five year sentence postulated in that case was for a plea of guilty of limited utility. Here the pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest opportunity and so the comparison of the offender’s conduct with that postulated in Henry and the resulting sentence has to be looked at with that circumstance in mind.
	
	
	The principle of totality, of course, applies. Were there total accumulation, a sentence of enormous proportions would be imposed upon the offender. I was asked not to impose a crushing sentence upon him. The submission was made that we do not just put people away and throw away the key. Well in some cases we do. In appropriate cases, people are given life imprisonment. In appropriate cases, sentences which can be described as “crushing” must be imposed. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence imposed for an offence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s misconduct. So if giving weight to that principle leads to a very long sentence, that has to be imposed, even if it could be regarded as crushing someone, even someone as young as the offender.
	
	
	The submission was made that I would find special circumstances. No doubt there are matters capable of being regarded as special circumstances but the very length of the sentence that I must impose in this case provides a significant period of eligibility for parole which will be more than sufficient to deal with any issues that arise regarding the offender’s rehabilitation at the end of his release from custody.
	
	
	I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence. Were it not for that decision, I would have imposed the following sentences. Sequence 1, twelve years with a non-parole period of eight. Sequence 3, five and a half years. Sequence 4, four and a half years. Sequence 5, six years. Sequence 6, three years. Sequence 7, four and a half years. Sequence 8, four years.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of sixteen and a half years with a head sentence of twenty-two years. It is to have commenced on 6 September 2013. The non-parole period will expire on 5 March 2030, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		03 September 2015",2015-07-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767294,R v DOWELL; R v HEARNE [2015] NSWDC 320,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Thomas Dowell and James Robert Hearne appear today for sentence in relation to one charge which is common to both of them and clearly is the most serious charge to which they have admitted their guilt. That charge alleges that they, between 24 November 2014 and 13 December 2014 at Cootamundra in the state of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of Mark Kingwall situate at Eloula, 1088 Back Brawling Road, Cootamundra, and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, to wit larceny in circumstances of aggravation, to wit they were each in company of the other.
	
	
	This is an offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, has a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	The two offenders have other charges for sentencing in each case emerging substantially from the same facts.
	
	
	In respect of Mr Dowell he was also committed for sentence for an offence contrary to s 7A Firearms Act 1996 of possessing a firearm, to wit an air rifle, not being authorised to do so by licence or permit. It carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole for that offence.
	
	
	There are also two matters on a s 166 certificate to which the prisoner admitted his guilt. Those two offences, one described as sequence 3, the other described as sequence 4, were offences of possessing ammunition without holding a licence permit or authority to do so and not keeping a firearm safely.
	
	
	Those two offences are offences which can be dealt with summarily but will require discrete sentencing in this exercise.
	
	
	Both the s 7A committal for sentence matter and the two s 166 certificate matters are offences arising out of the to the commission of the principal offence. In other words, the possession of the air rifle arises out of the fact that the prisoner, with Mr Hearne, stole the air rifle, amongst other firearms, and for a period of time possessed it after the commission of the offence, likewise the ammunition charge. Of course, in the facts as they emerged which I will refer to in a moment, the prisoner failed to safely keep the air rifle because when he took police to find it, it had gone.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Hearne, he faces five other committal for sentence charges. Four offences contrary to 7A Firearms Act, each carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The other offence is possess unauthorised prohibited firearm contrary to s 7 Firearms Act 1996. I am mindful in relation to that offence that it carries with it a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and has a standard non-parole period of three years imprisonment.
	
	
	I note the greater maximum penalty for a s.7 offence as opposed to a s.7A offence, but in my examination of the facts of the matter, such as I understand them to be, in reality the objective gravity of the s 7 offence seems to be no greater than the objective gravity of any particular s 7A offence. One of those arises out of his possession, on the particulars in the court attendance notice, of a 12 gauge side by side double-barrel firearm and not authorised being to do so by licence or permit.
	
	
	The s 7 offence which carries the greater maximum penalty arises out of his possession of a .22 calibre firearm not being authorised to do so by licence or permit. I am no ballistics expert obviously. I am certainly not a possessor of firearms and have no particular familiarity beyond my legal experience. However it seems to me, that even though the legislature recognises one firearm as being an unauthorised firearm in the particular category, the offence brought against Mr Hearne contrary to s 7A is concerned with a firearm with what have potentially more lethal power than the firearm concerned with the offence under s 7.
	
	
	Be that as it may, the s 7A and the s 7 offences concerning Mr Hearn arise from the commission of the principal offence.
	
	
	There are three other offences under 7A arising out of the same circumstances, including possession of .22 calibre semi-automatic rifle, possession of another .22 calibre rifle, possession of a single barrel shotgun, all contrary to s 7A themselves the proceeds of the principal offence.
	
	
	The principal offence committed by the two offenders was committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise. It was committed at a property in the ownership of the victim, Mark Kingwall, who lived at that property with his family including three of his five children.
	
	
	The prisoners apparently entered the property and took a metal box from the bedside table of the victim’s bedroom in which the victim kept two sets of keys for his firearm safe and cabinet. The box also contained a key to his Land Cruiser used as a farm vehicle. The offenders used the keys found within the metal box to open the firearm safe and cabinet which was housed in a cupboard within an enclosed room connected with the shed adjacent to the residence.
	
	
	The prisoners opened both the entrance door to the enclosed room and the cupboard door to access the victim’s firearm safe and cabinet. The doors that were forced or opened were kept closed but not locked. A number of firearms and amounts of ammunition were removed by the prisoners from the firearm safe and cabinet. The firearm safe required one key to open the main door where some firearms were stored and another key to open the top locked section inside the safe in which the victim used to keep bolts for his firearms.
	
	
	The firearm cabinet had two sections, top and bottom. The top section stored the victim’s ammunition and registration papers with the bottom section storing his remaining firearms. Each was secured by a lock and also by a padlock. The padlock on each door had first to be opened and removed before a further key could be used to unlock each cabinet door.
	
	
	It was on 13 December the victim first noticed the metal box missing from his bedside table. He went out to the room housing his firearms and found the door to the room, the cupboard door and all firearm safe doors opened with firearms missing. The keys were hanging out of the top and bottom locks of the firearm cabinet with the key to his Land Cruiser found on the floor near the firearm safe. The metal box, which I would take it to be the metal box containing the keys initially, was unable to be located and police were notified.
	
	
	Dwelling on the firearms that were, taken which is the gravamen of the principal offence, although the prisoners have not been charged in relation to the stealing of the ammunition identified generally in the facts, there were nine firearms in all taken of which three remained unrecovered. One was a Lithgow .22 calibre rifle, one was a 12 gauge side-by-side double-barrel shotgun, one was a 12 gauge single-barrel shotgun, another was a .410 single-barrel shotgun, there was a .177 calibre rifle which I am told is an airgun, there was a 12 gauge under and over double-barrel shotgun, there was a Tikka .222 calibre rifle, a .308 rifle and a .22 semi-automatic rifle.
	
	
	The three firearms that remain unrecovered are the .22 rifle I first mentioned, the air rifle as I have described it and the .308 rifle.
	
	
	Police received information that the firearms, or some of the firearms, may be found at the residence of the prisoner’s father. I point out from the outset that the prisoner Mr Hearne’s father, to whom I refer, gave evidence before me and presented as a perfectly respectable, responsible person. He gave an explanation for the circumstances in which it would appear his son, or his son and the co-accused, had placed a number of the firearms in the father’s gun safe, he being a licensed or authorised firearms owner.
	
	
	When police arrived to inspect Mr Hearne senior’s gun safe, five firearms not registered to Mr Hearne were located and seized by the police. Mr James Hearne, the prisoner, was present and out of no doubt considerable embarrassment, or perhaps fear of the consequences of the truth being revealed in the presence of his father, told the police he wished to speak to them privately. He then made admissions to being in possession of the five unauthorised firearms seized by police from Mr Hearne senior’s gun safe.
	
	
	To his credit, Mr Hearne junior, that is the prisoner, participated in a recorded interview and made full admissions regarding the breaking, entering and stealing of the victim’s property and in company with Mr Dowell taking a number of firearms from the premises and consented to a buccal swab for DNA testing to be undertaken.
	
	
	Mr Dowell was located by police on 17 December 2014 at 26 Warren Street Cootamundra. Police located a box of Winchester .222 calibre ammunition and a rifle magazine for a .222 calibre rifle. He was later arrested at his mother’s residence and he participated in a recorded interview and he, to his credit, made full admissions to the breaking, entering and stealing offence with a slightly varied version to that of his co-accused, the details of which are not revealed to me.
	
	
	He said he retained possession of the air rifle which he hid in a shed at the back of 22 Warren Street, Cootamundra. He said that the magazine of the .22 calibre rifle and the box of Winchester .22 calibre ammunition had been secured in a cabinet drawer in the rear yard of the address at Cootamundra.
	
	
	Mr Dowell advised police that he and Mr Hearne had discussed stealing firearms to sell or use in exchange for drugs. Mr Dowell said that the victim’s property was targeted as he, that is Mr Dowell, was aware that the victim had firearms and knew where they were stored.
	
	
	He accompanied police back to the address at Warren Street, Cootamundra, to recover the firearm that he identified, the air rifle, but the rifle was not located. During the relevant period neither accused was the holder of a valid firearms licence or permit.
	
	
	Thus, ultimately six of the nine firearms that were stolen were recovered. The details of the recovery of the sixth gun I am denied beyond some information from the bar table today that another person was in possession of the firearm.
	
	
	Mr Dowell was younger than Mr Hearne. He was born on 27 June 1995 and thus was, as was pointed out, approximately 19 and a half years of age at the time of the commission of the offence.
	
	
	Mr Hearne was born on 5 August 1990, thus he was, on my rough calculation, five years older than Mr Dowell. However, for reasons I will explain in a moment, the distinction in their ages is of no moment. There is no suggestion, on my understanding of the facts, that Mr Hearne’s greater age gave him more criminal experience or in any way influenced the commission of the relevant offences.
	
	
	Mr Hearne has a significant criminal history for one so young. He has a number of appearances in the Children’s Court and the Local Court and has been convicted or found guilty of a number of offences including offences of dishonesty and of violence. In the Children’s Court he has been found guilty of entering inclosed lands and being carried in a convenience without the consent of the owner and misuse of a motor vehicle. He has been convicted in the Local Court of driving a vehicle recklessly or dangerously in February 2013 for which he was placed on an 18 months good behaviour bond. He was also convicted on the same date of driving whilst disqualified for which he received an 18 month good behaviour bond which was also given to him in relation to another less serious offence.
	
	
	On 4 November 2013, he was convicted at Cootamundra Local Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months with a non-parole period of four months. There was a finding of special circumstances and he was directed to undertake some form of supervision which required him to address his drug dependency issues which in fact he did, which is a matter I will come to in a moment.
	
	
	He was convicted at the Cootamundra Local Court on 1 December 2014 of common assault, an offence committed in August 2014, for which he was placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months. He was also convicted of an offence of common assault or found guilty of an offence of common assault in March 2013 and wielding a knife in a public place in the Children’s Court for which he was placed on probation for a period of 18 months.
	
	
	It can be fairly said of course that his criminal history is not an aggravating factor under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but it is a relevant matter to the assessment of the appropriate sentence. He is not entitled to any special leniency, even allowing for the fact of his youth, on account of his criminal history alone. Of course, I bear in mind that courts have given him opportunities to address the matters that underline the offending with which I am concerned, which I am quite satisfied is his dependency upon prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The offender, on the information provided to me by the Crown and not disputed by the defence, was subject to conditional liberty in respect of good behaviour bonds and probation ordered in the Children’s Court which were current at the time of the offending with which I am concerned.
	
	
	I mention the fact the offender had been released to parole and I understand from the detail of the report dated 16 July 2015 that in January 2014, which coincides with shortly after he is released to parole in early 2014, the offender entered the Triple Care Farm - TCF - programme and successfully graduated from the programme in April 2014. A document that was given to me sets out the character of the programme he undertook and it was said that he participated well in all aspects of the programme and was welcome to reapply in the future.
	
	
	Unfortunately for reasons that he is other in part referred to, the opportunity offered to him by undertaking that programme fell away when he went back to the use of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	In the matter of Mr Dowell, I have evidence from his mother and I have evidence from a psychiatrist who examined him in June 2015. I will deal with the evidence from the psychiatrist’s report first which was tendered without objection. That sets out some matters of history that were touched upon by the mother. It notes that the offender has a two and a half year old daughter despite his youth, and the daughter is in the care of his parents.
	
	
	He was diagnosed with ADHD around the age of nine or ten, although his mother suggests that it was when he was eight, and he was subject to medication for treatment of that condition until he was about 15 or 16 years of age. He did, on occasions, stop using the Ritalin that was provided to him to socialise, as he described it, because he felt restricted by it. He denied any other contact with psychiatrists. He had commenced on an antidepressant whilst in custody to treat what would appear to be symptoms of reactive anxiety and depression. He was sad and depressed when commencing that medication and felt hopeless. He said that the symptoms he was suffering whilst in custody in relation to the current matter had improved with that medication.
	
	
	He has other medical issues that are referred to in the report that I do not propose to dwell upon, and he gave a history of long-term drug and alcohol abuse and particularly the use of methamphetamine, as it is described, on a daily basis using up to half a gram, costing approximately $250 a day before he was charged in relation to the current matter.
	
	
	He said, however, that when he finished the programme that I referred to at TCF, he relapsed back into drug use pretty quickly and he said that he found it difficult to avoid the use of those drugs.
	
	
	His history of alcohol and drug abuse goes back to his early teens, starting with abuse of alcohol and then moving on to prohibited drugs.
	
	
	He has lived in Cootamundra, as I understand it, all of his life except for a period of time when his family moved to Cowra when he was in primary school. He is close to his family. He has two younger sisters and I got the impression from his mother that the family, apart from the prisoner’s conduct, is a stable, law abiding family. He had difficulties at school and he did not do particularly well there. Again use of medication for his ADHD and then conduct lapses and alcohol abuse and the like did not assist him.
	
	
	So far as the commission of the offence is concerned, he said to the psychiatrist that he had been using “ice heavily” and he committed the offences to get more drugs.
	
	
	He wished to remain abstinent from illicit substances as he told his mother and the psychiatrist and the support from his family. He said that he has difficulties in custody concentrating and sitting still. This may be a reflection of continuing symptoms of ADHD as an adult. He said that he had tried to avoid using drugs in custody with negative results from urinalysis.
	
	
	The summation of the psychiatrist was that his offending history was closely linked to his addiction to methamphetamine and the background of ADHD and a poor compliance with prescribed medication. He gave some symptoms of what I would call obsessive-compulsive disorder, or as the psychiatrist describes it alternatively, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, although this diagnosis was not altogether clear. He has some mild symptoms of depression. He has what is described as the criteria for Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood. That is essentially depressed mood in reaction to his current circumstances. He also met the criteria for ‘substance dependence’.
	
	
	The medical practitioner thought there was insufficient evidence to support a diagnosis of ‘antisocial personality disorder’ or ‘conduct disorder’ as a child, and although he had some appearances in the Children’s Court, he does not have an ingrained history of antisocial conduct reflected in that history. There are some further tests that need to be undertaken. He is deemed to be a person addicted to an illicit substance and he would, under the influence of those drugs, have difficulty rationalising his conduct in a thoughtful manner. The psychiatrist recommended that he should receive some ongoing assistance whilst in custody from a psychologist or a psychiatrist and he would need to improve his vocational skills and it was obviously important for him to remain abstinent from prohibited drugs. That is self-evidently so, and if he does not understand that by now, he will never understand it.
	
	
	His mother gave evidence that they continued to support him. She encouraged him when he was arrested to admit his wrongdoing. She spoke about his history of drug use which I am prepared to accept is correctly identified from the history given to the psychiatrist and from the evidence of the mother.
	
	
	She confirmed that the prisoner was a friend of the son of the victim. She mentioned that the prisoner and the son had some falling out before this principal crime was committed, but I do not understand there to be any suggestion the crime was committed as a revenge to that falling out. The evidence reveals the prisoner was aware of the fact the firearms were in the custody of the victim.
	
	
	She spoke of the relationship that he entered into when he was 15 with a woman that was somewhat older than him from which a child was born. How that came to pass without some sort of parental intervention I do not know. There was a suggestion by the mother that the older person introduced him to drugs. She also spoke about his ADHD and she felt that he came to use prohibited drugs as a substitute for the medication that he had previously taken as a child.
	
	
	She talked about, in her evidence, the disruption to his education, his attempts to find employment, usually unsuccessful, although he had worked from time to time at the abattoirs. She thought he was a person who was attracted to older people and she thought those people were a bad influence upon him from time to time.
	
	
	She said that in custody he professed the wish to avoid the use of drugs and to try and be a better father to his child and a son to his parents. Of course, these high-minded ideals are well and good to state, but as he has found out in his short life they are very difficult to achieve. Reflecting upon, for example, his time in a rehabilitation centre and relapsing back into drugs shortly afterwards.
	
	
	In relation to the submissions made by his learned counsel, she submitted that obviously the maximum penalty in relation to the principal offence was a significant issue in the case as was the standard non parole period, but the Court was also required to have regard to the maximum penalty of the relevant serious indictable offence pleaded in the charge, that is, the charge of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, that maximum penalty being five years, and I was also to have regard to the pleaded circumstance of aggravation, that is of being in company, to be seen at the lower level of seriousness of circumstances of aggravation that can be pleaded.
	
	
	I was referred to Ponfield factors as they are sometimes described and having regard to the matters identified by Grove J in that judgment, it was submitted that there were very few matters of aggravation. There was no vandalisation of the property and the like. One feature of the matter that emerges from Ponfield factors that are picked up, I hasten to say, in s 21A when it was subsequently introduced, was the fact that the prisoner was in breach of his conditional liberties in various form. Whilst it was submitted there was some degree of planning, there was no professional planning although it was conceded the prisoner was the person who knew the guns were in the safe.
	
	
	It was pointed out he made voluntary admissions and endeavoured to assist the police to relocate the air rifle. It is a shame neither he nor his co accused could find their way to assist the police to find the other three firearms. The gun he was in possession of or admitted to possession of after the event was the least dangerous of the firearms.
	
	
	He was entitled to 25% discount for the utilitarian benefit of his pleas of guilty. This is accepted by the Crown, I hasten to say, as it is accepted in relation to the co-accused. Both accused will receive that 25% discount to reflect the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton.
	
	
	It was also submitted, and correctly so, that his moral culpability had to be assessed in the context of his relative youth, being 19 and a half at the time. It was also pointed out that drug dependence was a contributing factor to his offending and whilst this is not a mitigating factor it was the case that it was a relevant matter to take into account, and it was pointed out that he had attempted, after his last term of imprisonment, to rehabilitate himself but no doubt his immaturity and other factors have contributed to the failure of that.
	
	
	Whilst his criminal history was conceded not to entitle him to any special leniency, bearing in mind he had the support of his family, he had the capacity to find employment, and the critical issue was need to address the drug dependency of the past and other issues, there ought be a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Hearne, the general facts obviously are the same. As I have already pointed out, the only matter absent in his case - and of course not relevant to him - is the fact that he was not in possession of the air rifle. It likewise should be pointed out in relation to him that he has provided no assistance to the recovery of the three other firearms.
	
	
	Mr Hearn is in a different position in a range of ways from his co accused in respect of matters which are of substance. Firstly, he has no relevant prior convictions. He has a finding of guilt in the Children’s Court for driving whilst suspended but that is, to my mind, irrelevant, so I am prepared to regard him firstly as a person without significant convictions - in fact without any convictions - and I am prepared to regard him as a person of good character.
	
	
	I have a presentence report in relation to him which speaks positively of his family circumstances which was impressed upon me by the evidence of his father. The circumstances of his arrest and charging in this matter has brought considerable stress to his family, particularly given his father’s background, and his father naturally has expressed disappointment, shock and disbelief, but his parents remain supportive but conditionally supportive, as his father pointed out.
	
	
	The employment and education of the prisoner has been unremarkable save for the fact that on leaving school in Year 11 he has been in regular employment. He commenced an electrical apprenticeship, however, lost his driver’s licence and could not complete that. He had other employment before entering the Royal Australian Navy on 20 February 2012 and remained in the Australian Navy until discharged on 12 January 2015.
	
	
	He was discharged on return of a positive urinalysis report for an illicit substance and this was a matter the subject of evidence from his father which I will come to shortly.
	
	
	I have all the certificates that have no doubt been seen by the Community Correction Service to confirm his service with the Royal Australian Navy and various qualifications which I accept he has achieved within that service.
	
	
	On returning to Cootamundra he was able to obtain employment managing a hotel. But he, because of a dependence which was really not fully appreciated by his parents, became a person who was prepared to commit a serious crime in order to obtain funds to obtain the relevant prohibited drug.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Service suggests that his use of cannabis and methamphetamine remain current at the writing of the report, and this is not a very good thing. One would have thought his arrest in relation to this matter and no doubt impressed upon by his father the inevitable consequence of committing such a serious crime would have prompted him to try and address his underlying problems. He has been referred to various facilities and there will be some evidence I will refer to in a moment from the father about that matter, and he has been assessed as suitable now for a particular programme but far, far too late. If the prisoner was going to be concerned to persuade a court that he should not serve full-time custody, he should have been prepared to address the issue of his rehabilitation in a more constructive manner some time before he did so.
	
	
	The prisoner had some difficulties discussing his attitude to the offending with the Community Corrections officer and he made some admissions which reflected some change in attitude perhaps for the better. It is noted that when in the Navy he convinced the Navy psychologist into believing that he was abusing alcohol rather than admitting to the use of prohibited drugs in order, no doubt, to remain within the Navy community.
	
	
	So far as his general attitude to offending, he could not provide much insight into why he became involved, and on the fourth interview, ultimately he said that he was well affected by drugs when he committed the offences but was not fully appreciative of the seriousness of his actions. He is assessed as being at a medium risk of re-offending with particular criminogenic needs identified in the report.
	
	
	The assessment of the Community Corrections Service was that he had longstanding and unresolved substance issues. Bearing in mind he had no history of supervision with Community Corrections, it was difficult for them to identify a constructive plan for him. It was thought that he displayed avoidant behaviour regarding his involvement in the offences, attempting to divert the interview process, and also trying to divert the officer from delving into the circumstances of the commission of the offence, although there was change in attitude, as I said, in that regard.
	
	
	It was said that it appeared that the offender’s substance abuse issues had impacted on most facets of his life and that is self-evident given his fall from grace, and the report sets about case management strategies including regular reporting and close supervision including admission to a rehabilitation facility should supervision be required of Community Corrections. He also needs some assistance in relation to treatment in respect of his use of prescribed medications and the like.
	
	
	There is some reference to “mental health” issues, but there is no evidence of substance to indicate the prisoner has a mental illness or a psychological condition that might invoke principles in cases such as De La Rosa from 2010 or Hemsley from 2004, summarised by respectively McClellan CJ at CL and Sperling J.
	
	
	The father’s evidence I found impressive. His father is a former police officer and now works in a non-investigative capacity with the Australian Federal Police and is a military reservist. He is a licensed person to own and use firearms and no doubt has an intimate knowledge of firearms, their use and misuse and their capacities.
	
	
	He supported the account of the prisoner and his regular employment but also said that he and his wife were totally unaware of the prisoner’s dependence on prohibited drugs. He noted that when he joined the Navy or at least left home to join the Navy he weighed about 100 kilograms but by the time he left the Navy he weighed about 70 kilograms.
	
	
	The prisoner was involved in naval operations off the borders of Australia in what is called, as I understand it, the Sovereign Borders Campaign or ‘Exercise’. He appears to have been affected by his experience in these matters but had not discussed the matter with his father and it does not appear to be a matter that he has raised with Community Corrections. I have the feeling that he has withheld things. I do not say these things detrimental to him, but it appears he withheld relevant information to particular people because he has difficulty discussing them.
	
	
	As the other evidence reveals, he failed a drug test with the Navy and was discharged and returned to Cootamundra, but what flows from the evidence of the father is that he has always tried to maintain regular employment and has the capacity to do so.
	
	
	The father gave a reason for the guns being placed in his safe without his knowledge which I accept. Initially not knowing anything about the background of the father, I suggested to his counsel that he would need to explain how he came to have the guns in his safe without knowing. But it is clear on the evidence he gave to me, which I accept, that he was completely blameless.
	
	
	He is extremely unhappy about his son’s conduct. The father and the family have been placed in a very compromising position through no fault of their own. He felt that his son had not completely broken his dependency upon drugs but was anxious to seek help and spoke of his acceptance into a rehabilitation programme. There is evidence of that in the material provided to me, and he believed the son had taken responsibility for his actions and the family would continue to support him, albeit it on a conditional basis, and that is that he stopped using drugs and there was no further criminality.
	
	
	Counsel for the prisoner generally adopted the submissions of counsel for the co-accused about the objective facts, noting the two offenders stood equally liable on a joint criminal enterprise basis, although there was evidence that the co-accused was the person who knew where the guns could be found. He submitted that nothing extra flowed from the separate charges of possession of a firearm, given the character of the original offence. However, subjectively this prisoner was in a much more favourable position with no relevant criminal history, not being on conditional liberty, and his age difference was not a factor in his sentencing, with which I agree.
	
	
	He pointed to his favourable subjective circumstances such as his employment history, his naval service, which obviously needs to be taken into account, and all things considered, it was submitted he had good prospects of rehabilitation. But his family were not blind to the struggles that lay ahead.
	
	
	It was conceded in submission that a term of full-term custody was required, but it was submitted that the Court should make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions in reply to the submissions of learned counsel for the two prisoners were that the two prisoners were equally liable. The Court should have regard to the relevant standard non-parole periods in the appropriate fashion, which I do. The Crown said that parity of sentencing was an issue. They both pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity, thus the relevant matters that arose to distinguish them, if at all, arose from the subjective circumstances.
	
	
	It was pointed out that the victim had lost three of the firearms, which I note. I have not been given the value of those missing firearms. I wish I was provided with the value of such matters in the facts.
	
	
	There was, it was submitted by the Crown, perhaps on my reference, an aggravation in the case of both offenders that the offences were committed without regard to public safety as an aggravating factor under s 21(2) and this was accepted, as I understand it, by the two counsel for the prisoners.
	
	
	It should be pointed out that the lack of regard or disregard of public safety arose from the moment the guns were taken out of the gun safe where they were safe, in carrying them away to another place. Also, with their possession of the firearms at relevant times, then their failure to either properly secure the guns that were missing or by giving the guns or selling the guns to others. The prisoners are silent on that last aspect. The Crown submitted that full-time custody was required.
	
	
	I should point out in passing, that in the material provided by Mr Hearne was a reference from his former master in the electrical trade. He confirmed the prisoner’s employment as an apprentice and the prisoner’s good qualities of honesty and punctuality. The referee told him that the prisoner did not hesitate to tell him of the offending with which I am concerned.
	
	
	In relation to this matter, quite a number of legal issues obviously arise for consideration as they always do in the sentencing of offenders. Amongst other things obviously I have to have regard to the maximum penalties for each offence and measure the appropriate sentence with the maximum penalties in mind.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of parity, as it might be described, I am mindful of the observations of the High Court in the 1984 decision of Lowe v R concerning the need to ensure that when co-offenders are sentenced in relation to common offending, no particular offender can claim a justifiable sense of grievance.
	
	
	I am also mindful of the decision of the High Court in Postiglione (1998) 189 CLR 295, particularly in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ which discussed the issue of parity in sentencing in the context of the concept of “equal justice”.
	
	
	As Rothman J in Jimmy v R (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 observed:
	


“Equal justice is an artefact of Aristotelian principles of equality. The like shall be treated alike and the unalike shall be treated unalike in proportion to their un-alikeness.”


	
	In terms of the objective facts, their respective possession of particular times of different firearms does not render greater or any significant un-alikeness between the two offenders. The critical offending is the offending for which they are jointly liable.
	
	
	I am mindful of the fact that the standard non-parole period of five years to what I have called the principal offence. In respect of one of the firearm offences affecting Mr Hearne’s situation there is also a standard non parole period. Of course, the issue of the appropriate approach to standard non-parole periods was discussed by the High Court in Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120. In the aftermath of that judgment we had amendment to ss 54A and 54B of the Act. It is now quite clear by reference to those respective provisions that a standard non parole period is a matter to be taken into account only in relation to the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence which carries a standard non-parole period, and the standard non-parole period does not limit the matters which are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the offender. The standard non parole period provides some guidance in relation to the matter, but it is not determinative of what the appropriate non-parole period should be.
	
	
	The general principles enunciated in the High Court decision of Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357, particularly in the judgment of McHugh J at [51], set out the proper approach to sentencing and the need to instinctively synthesis all the matters to be taken into account in relation to the offending.
	
	
	With regard to Ponfield, the guideline judgment in relation to breaking, entering and stealing, I take on board what was put by learned counsel for Mr Dowell. But, as I said, many of the matters - in fact most of the matters identified in Ponfield - have been translated into general sentencing principles subsequently by the legislature, sometimes word for word. They are a great tribute to the judicial wisdom of Grove J.
	
	
	With regard to the observations of counsel for Mr Dowell concerning the significance of the serious indictable offence pleaded and the significance of the circumstance of aggravation - adopted by Mr King, I hasten to say - I note the decision of Harris v R [2007] NSWCCA 130 where, in an examination of the relevance of the serious indictable offence of larceny, it was pointed out that as an offence per se it is a lesser indictable offence by reason of its maximum penalty than other serious indictable offences that the section contemplates. Furthermore, the aggravating feature of being in company is one of the least aggravating of the features encompassed by the definition of circumstances of aggravation.
	
	
	I hasten to say, of course, as we all know, there will be cases about which one cannot make any general rules where being in company could be a very, very significant circumstance of aggravation such as, for example, in the case of a sexual assault. But in this case, there is nothing significant about being in company other than the fact that the two men entered into a joint criminal enterprise and the two of them were able to thus carry away more than what one person could do. As I said, the premises were not seriously vandalised. Some of the property they stole, by reason of its character, attracts greater maximum penalties for its possession than the offence of larceny.
	
	
	I am also mindful in this regard of the decision of Huynh v R [2005] NSWCCA 220 which picks up the same points that were discussed in the decision of Harris.
	
	
	I note in the case of both prisoners that the observations of Wood J in Henry, the guideline judgment in respect of armed robbery matters ((1999) 46 NSWLR 36), particularly at [273], arise.  Though this is not an armed robbery matter. There his Honour pointed out that the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit is not a mitigating factor, but it may be relevant in the assessment of the objective facts such as throwing light upon the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of planning, whether in fact there are other circumstances of aggravation that arise which do not arise in this case, and the state of mind or capacity of an offender to exercise judgment. Certainly on the part of both prisoners there was a serious lapse of judgment in the commission of this offence.
	
	
	It is relevant subjectively to the impact of the dependency upon drugs, upon the prospects of recidivism and rehabilitation which of course can be a two edged sword. It may be also relevant to point out that addiction may not be a matter of personal choice.
	
	
	In this case, I bear in mind two features of the matter, one relevant to Mr Dowell, one relevant to Mr Hearne. It would seem in relation to Mr Dowell that he became dependent upon drugs, or certainly a user of drugs, at a very young age when he was obviously very immature and probably under the influence of other people. This is an important matter to bear in mind in his favour.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Hearne, his father gave evidence - which I am prepared to accept - of a culture within the Australian Naval forces into which the prisoner fell where the use of drugs appears to have been widespread. It is a very difficult matter for a young man to avoid the peer pressure involved in that type of environment, particularly a military environment, where one is closely dependent upon one’s colleagues in a range of ways.
	
	
	This is not a case, I hasten to say, in the context of the observations of Wood J where I could find that there was a display of gross irresponsibility to be taken into account.
	
	
	Of course, Henry itself is a poster case, notwithstanding the fact that it is a guideline judgment, for the need in each case to provide individual justice. The learned Chief Justice, even in formulating a guideline sentence for armed robbery, which could not be done in relation to break, enter and steal matters in Ponfield, pointed out from the decision of Lattouf, a decision of Mahoney ACJ, that there was a public interest in the sentencing process to recognise and maintain a residual discretion in the sentencing judge and a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles which will deter the commission of serious crime, but also fulfil other objectives in the sentencing process, such as, for example, achieving justice in the individual case.
	
	
	This same point was picked up by Wood J in a judgment in 2001 relating to the relevance or the significance of the newly introduced suspended sentences where his Honour adopted the principles laid down by the South Australian Full Court concerning the sentencing of young offenders and the interest of the community in returning young offenders back to the community in circumstances that might encourage rehabilitation, the encouragement of rehabilitation being in the community interest.
	
	
	I am required to have regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the purposes of sentencing, the need for some element of general and personal deterrence, but also to promote the rehabilitation of the offenders. They have to be made accountable for their offending, they have to be adequately punished, but at the same time there is public interest in assisting them, given their particular personal circumstances. I do not believe the prisoners represent a danger to the community.
	
	
	With regard to s 21A, I have identified the aggravating factors that arise in relation to each offender. In respect of relevant mitigating factors that arise under s 21A(3), in the case of Mr Hearne there are many. I am prepared to conclude in his favour that he is a person of good character, I am prepared to obviously find that he was a person without criminal convictions. I am prepared to find in his case, if he is able to live up to the standards that his father would wish to impress upon him, unlikely to re-offend. He is also a person who, in my view, does have good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly having regard to the constructive life he was able to lead until his discharge from the Navy.
	
	
	His plea of guilty is a relevant mitigating factor. For that he receives a discrete discount. I am prepared to accept that he was not involved in organised criminal activity.
	
	
	I cannot find that he has shown relevant remorse, although he did make important admissions. I do not know whether he has fully taken responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	With regard to his co-accused, Mr Dowell, likewise in his case I am prepared to find that if able to undertake rehabilitation from drug use he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I cannot find in his case that he is unlikely to re offend give his past history of offending, and he certainly was not a person of good character. Nor did he not have a record of previous convictions.
	
	
	With regard to his remorse, there is some evidence of his remorse in the attempts to assist the police to recover one of the firearms, but I do not believe he has taken full responsibility for his actions. Again, the silence of Mr Hearne and him in respect of the outstanding firearms is a very substantial matter.
	
	
	His plea of guilty is a mitigating factor for which he receives a discrete discount.
	
	
	There was some degree of assistance to the law enforcement authorities or pre trial disclosure by him in the context of revealing where he said a particular firearm was to be found. But it is worth bearing in mind that it was not recovered.
	
	
	With regard to planning, I am not prepared to find that the offences were planned offences as an aggravating factor. But I do not think I can find either as a mitigating factor that the offences were not part of planned criminal activity. The matter is a neutral matter. Certainly I agree there was no professional planning in the context of Ponfield principles.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I am satisfied that there are special circumstances in each case. In the case of Mr Dowell, there is his youth. He has previously been on parole and he has previously been subject to supervision but he is very young which is a very significant matter to take into account. I need only refer to the general principles set out in cases such as GDP and the like concerning that matter.
	
	
	He would be far differently treated, I can assure him, had he been older and more experienced as a criminal. Mr Hearne likewise would have been far more severely dealt with in relation to this offending had he had prior convictions, particularly like convictions of dishonesty.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Dowell, I believe that he needs an extended period of supervision to assist him to adjust to community living and he certainly needs direction in relation to drug counselling and rehabilitation programmes. He also obviously needs some assistance in relation to personal relationships and of course trying to get vocational skills that might provide him with some form of stable employment rather than casual employment down at the Cootamundra abattoirs.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Hearne, likewise I find special circumstances in his case. This is his first time in custody. There are matters relating to his circumstances that are self-evident from the outline of his background that will need to be taken into account and it may turn out that there are aspects of his custody that may need to be specifically addressed to his detriment by the Corrective Services authorities and I do not propose to dilate upon that aspect of the matter at the moment.
	
	
	He needs an extended period of supervision to assist him in relation to his drug usage, to seek counselling and rehabilitation and professional guidance in that regard. He will need professional assistance to adjust to community living as well.
	
	
	With regard to the sentences I propose to impose I have foreshadowed that the sentences for the possess firearm matters will be concurrent with the most serious offence. In my view, that criminality is intimately bound up with the most serious offence.
	
	
	In relation to that aspect of the matter, I am mindful of the principles in Pearce v The Queen, (1998) 194 CLR 610 (at [45]), concerning the need to address the totality of the criminality, but in my view the totality of the criminality is not increased by the continuing possession of firearms that were stolen and had to be in the possession of each of the prisoners in order to be taken away from the property from where the firearms were normally kept.
	
	
	In relation to one of the possession charges, I am required to fix a non parole period notwithstanding the fact that it will be entirely concurrent with the principal non parole period because the Act requires where there is a standard non parole period the Court must fix a non parole period unless of course the sentence is non-custodial.
	
	
	In the context of the principles arising from Pearce, I am mindful of decisions such as the decision of Hammoud that reflect upon the issue of concurrency and accumulation or partial accumulation as being very much discretionary matters having regard to all the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	I again emphasise the issue that I have earlier identified, that but for a number of the subjective circumstances relevant to each offender, the sentences to be imposed in respect of the principal would have been much greater. The truth of the matter is the stealing of firearms is a matter of considerable concern for the community. After the Port Arthur massacre, the community rose up as one and governments rose up as one to ensure that penalties in relation to the possession of firearms would be greatly increased and that the restrictions upon access to firearms would be greatly increased. The supervision of those who had access to firearms would be made much more intense. This is for the public good and the prisoners should understand the fact that the stealing of firearms must be regarded as a serious matter. I just trust, for the conscience of the prisoners, if nothing else, that the firearms that are missing are not used to maim, kill other people or commit serious crimes.
	
	
	I can assure the prisoners, there are states of the United States where, if that happened, they would be found liable for the principal offences caused by those firearms, including murder, as the Supreme Court of the United States has made clear in recent times.
	
	
	Now Mr Dowell, I will deal with you first if I may. In relation the offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Act, you are convicted. In respect of that offence you are sentenced to one year and nine months by way of a non-parole period. That sentence will commence on 18 December 2014 and will expire on 17 September 2016. I fix in relation to that sentence a balance of parole of one year six months. That means the total sentence in relation to that offence is three years three months dating from 18 December 2014.
	
	
	The assessment of your non-parole period, even in the context of special circumstances, has to be undertaken in the context of your previous performance whilst subject to supervision.
	
	
	In respect of the offence contrary to s 7A, Firearms Act 1996, I convict you and sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 12 months to commence from 18 December 2014. That sentence will expire on 17 December 2015.
	
	
	In relation to the two offences on the s 166 certificate, you are convicted and sentenced to nine months imprisonment in relation to each offence, each sentence to commence on 18 December 2014 and to expire on 17 September 2015.
	
	
	All those sentences will be concurrent, one with the other.
	
	
	Could you take a seat, thanks very much Mr Dowell.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Hearne, in relation to the offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of 12 months. That term of imprisonment commences today, as I understand it. Is that right Mr King?
	
	
	KING: Yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That is 29 July 2015. It expires on 28 July 2016. I direct that you be released to parole at the end of that non-parole period.
	
	
	In respect of that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of one year three months. That balance of sentence will expire on 28 October 2017.
	
	
	In relation to the offences contrary to s 7A - there are four of those aren’t there Mr Crown?
	
	
	HALL: Yes, there is your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: In respect of each of those offences you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months. In respect of each of those matters you are convicted, of course, and those sentences will commence on 29 July 2015 and expire on 28 July 2016.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm contrary to s 7 Firearms Act 1996, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of six months. That will commence on 29 July 2015 and expire on 28 January 2016 and I fix a balance of sentence of six months which expires on 28 July 2016.
	
	
	Just take a seat, thanks very much.
	
	
	What is the maximum penalty for that ammunition matter, I’m sorry Mr Crown? Do you know the answer to that Mr Murnane? 
	
	
	HALL: Yes, according to the Practice your Honour - can hand it to your Honour - it’s a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Fifty penalty units is it? There’s no term of imprisonment?
	
	
	HALL: Perhaps I could hand that--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’ll take your word for it. It’s a quarter to 6.
	
	
	HALL: I’m sorry your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: No, that’s all right, don’t apologise. It’s just an oversight on both our parts.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of possessing ammunition, the related offence, you are convicted. In lieu of the term imprisonment, obviously I cannot impose a term of imprisonment for an offence that carries a fine, you are fined the sum of $500. I give you 28 days to pay that fine.
	
	
	Thanks very much.
	
	
	Mr Dowell, do you understand the sentence I’ve imposed?
	
	
	OFFENDER DOWELL: Yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’ve backdated the sentence to the date you came into custody. I had distinguished you from your co-accused for the reasons I’ve tried to explain. The distinction ultimately is a non-parole period - a difference of nine months in the non-parole period. You’ll be eligible for release to parole on the date that I fixed, but that will be a matter for the Parole Authority. You’re excused, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Your client might not have those skills or that experience. Anyway, I’ve squarely raised the issue, Corrective Services understand it, they’re nodding, and I appreciate their assistance. They’ve always been of great assistance to me and I appreciate it very much. Mr Hearne, you’re in the hands of the Corrective Services officers now, thank you. Yes Mr Crown?
	
	
	HALL: Can I just raise one matter while both counsel are here your Honour?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes.
	
	
	HALL: Only in relation to the firearms. Is your Honour mindful to make an order the firearms be returned to the owner?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: All firearms found should be returned to the owner.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Hopefully he’s got them. Anyway, I direct that all firearms be returned to the lawful owner.
	
	
	HALL: Thank you your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you, sorry to keep you.

		14 January 2016",2015-07-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767308,R v Pratten (No 20) [2015] NSWSC 1102,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

HIS HONOUR: The accused applies to discharge the jury. I have decided not to do so.

First, I comment that the application before the Court is for the discharge of the jury on the basis that the Crown has essentially altered its case and the application relates specifically to the first five, possibly six, relevant transactions, each of which evidences the purchase of a farm property called Skallett registered in the name of a company incorporated in Vanuatu, Pacific Property Investments Limited (PPI).

All of those transactions relate to count 1 that between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2003 the accused dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from the Commonwealth by failing to declare income in his tax returns. The relevance of those first five transactions is that they occur, on the evidence that the Crown seeks to have the jury accept, on 29 July 2002. The sixth transaction that may be affected occurred on 28 October 2002.

The accused relies upon a series of documents contained in Exhibit F on the voir dire to which I have been taken and upon evidence adduced through Mr Greer, an accountant, relating to transactions that occurred prior to the financial year commencing 1 July 2002 and to which count 1 relates.

The essence of the matter is that a number of comments made by the Crown either in the statement of its case, or in the first trial, or in answer to a request for further and better particulars in relation to this trial, have identified certain monies from Vanuatu as monies received from an insurance company based in Vanuatu. This insurance company was originally called Rural & General Insurance International Limited (RGII) and later altered its name and became Commercial Pacific Limited, but it is the same company and I will refer to it as the Vanuatu Insurance Company.

It is necessary to set out some background. As a result of alterations to the legislative scheme regulating the insurance industry that occurred following the collapse of HIH Insurance, requirements were placed on insurance companies operating in Australia that precluded the accused’s insurance company from operating in Australia. As a consequence, it seems, the Vanuatu Insurance Company was established and Mr Pratten operated a broking company, Rural & General Insurance Broking (RGIB), the underwriter of which was the Vanuatu Insurance Company.

As a consequence of that operation, premiums received in Australia by RGIB were paid into trust accounts in Vanuatu, seemingly on behalf of the Vanuatu Insurance Company.

The Crown has alleged that those monies held in trusts, which were operated by two accounting firms sequentially, were used either to pay monies directly to the accused or to pay monies at the direction of the accused for his benefit. It is those monies that are alleged to be the income of the accused that was not declared by him and, allegedly, gave rise to the dishonest obtaining of a financial advantage by deception. The Crown says those monies are income and the accused knew they were income and knew that they were required to be declared in the relevant income tax years.

The reliance by the Crown on the transfer of funds from the broking company, RGIB, to the trust accounts of the Vanuatu Insurance Company and from those trust accounts to Mr Pratten or for his benefit was a significant, if not fundamental, aspect of the case as it was conducted previously. The Crown also placed reliance upon the allegation that the accused performed work for the Vanuatu Insurance Company and treated the Vanuatu Insurance Company as his own.

The accused, by an analysis of the fund transfers and by adducing evidence, has demonstrated, it seems to me, that the fund transfers for the purpose of purchasing the farm property Skallett, to which I have earlier referred, occurred at a point in time prior to the incorporation in Vanuatu of the Vanuatu Insurance Company.

As a consequence, the accused seeks to use those fund transfers as evidence to suggest that the Crown case theory and the basis for the proposition that these funds all came to Mr Pratten as income are flawed, namely, that there are hypotheses inconsistent with that theory and which may, as a consequence, be inconsistent with guilt of the charges laid, and that therefore the jury ought not convict and indeed cannot convict.

During the course of this trial, the Crown has adduced further evidence, which evidence was before the Court during the previous trial, that the monies used for the purchase of Skallett were monies held in the same trust accounts in Vanuatu at a point in time prior to the incorporation of the Vanuatu Insurance Company and that those monies relate to a loan of approximately $500,000 to a company controlled by the accused, Griffith Narrandera Primary Property Developments Ltd (GNPPD). The Crown alleges that those monies were then transferred from the trust account and utilised for the purchase of Skallett by PPI, a company the Crown says was also controlled by the accused and therefore, the Crown alleges, also used for the benefit of the accused.

Important in all of this is the actual charge and how it was the Crown put its case. The particulars of the Crown case in respect of count 1, to which all of these matters relate, is set out in the Crown Case Statement of 27 May 2011. I shall not refer to all of that statement, but at paragraph 79 the Crown refers to an amount of $1,068,724, being the income that was not declared during the relevant financial year from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. That amount was made up of $389,898 received into Mr Pratten's personal bank account between 7 January 2003 and 6 June 2003.

A further $678,826 was paid from the trust account (VITCO) to third parties, predominantly for the purchase of what I have referred to as Skallett by PPI.

Thus, from the outset, the Crown particularised its case as Mr Pratten receiving income, which comprised of payments to third parties on behalf of the accused or payments to companies owned or controlled by the accused. It does not seem on the material before me that the Crown confined its case to the proposition that the income was received exclusively from the Vanuatu Insurance Company.

Nevertheless, I accept that the accused may have understood the Crown case as so confined. The difficulty is that even if the Crown case were confined to transfers from the Vanuatu Insurance Company, the Crown is entitled, in order to persuade the jury that the five payments in question are not inconsistent with the remainder of the Crown case, to show that those five payments in question were also payments made at the direction of the accused and for his benefit. That is not coincidence or tendency evidence; it is simply a means of undermining the submission that might be made by the defence that the five payments do not fit the majority of the Crown case and are inconsistent with guilt otherwise proved.

Loans relating to GNPPD are generally not directly relevant to these charges. However, they become relevant if the GNPPD monies were to be used at the direction of the accused and for his benefit, such as to bring them within the particulars of the Crown case as outlined in the Crown Case Statement and otherwise.

There are two further aspects to this application for discharge of jury with which I must deal. First, it is not appropriate at this stage, and given the time that has now elapsed into the trial, to discharge the jury without very good reason. That reason would certainly include any unfairness to the accused that was unable to be remedied.

Secondly, there is a difference between an alteration in the Crown case, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the adducement of evidence by the Crown in order to undermine other evidence that might not suit the Crown case. The matter is here for retrial because the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that it was necessary for a jury to determine unanimously the each amount that make up the undeclared income and that were said not to have been declared and were dishonestly and deceptively used to obtain a financial advantage from the Commonwealth.

In making that determination, the jury is entitled to find that some amounts give rise to guilt and some parts do not, that is, that some amounts were income knowingly not declared and that some amounts were not. The fact, which for present purposes I accept, that the five payments were not monies from the Vanuatu Insurance Company does not mean that the jury is not entitled to take the view that other amounts are. Further, it does not deprive the accused of the capacity to argue that there is a flaw in the Crown theory that gives rise to a reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt in relation to all of the counts.

Moreover, the fact that the five, or possibly six, payments were made prior to the date of incorporation does not necessarily support the proposition that the monies cannot have been paid in the manner alleged by the Crown. Such a proposition could be supported only if it were proved that no premiums were remitted to the Vanuatu Insurance Company before it was incorporated. While that may be the usual inference (and under Australian law a necessary inference), it may be otherwise.

Two matters must follow. First, as a matter of fairness, it seems to me that the Crown ought to be confined to putting its case on the basis that the monies received by the accused were monies directly or indirectly from the Vanuatu Insurance Company. Secondly, to the extent that this evidence has been adduced otherwise than by giving appropriate notice to the accused for the purpose of cross-examining Ms Celona or Mr Greer, I direct that each of them, on the request of the accused, are to be recalled for further cross-examination.

		04 July 2016",2015-07-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767314,Rothe v Scott (No. 2) [2015] NSWDC 143,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for refusing the defendant leave to reinstate the defence of justification to imputations 3(b) and 3(c) pursuant to s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The basis upon which the defence was struck out on the previous occasion is set out in Rothe v Scott [2015] NSWDC 105.
	
	
	The plaintiff seeks orders pursuant to r 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) that the defendant’s application to reinstate the defence be refused.
	


The proposed new pleading


	
	The proposed new pleading, although limited to two of the three imputations, is even shorter and less helpful than the defence in its previous form. The defendant now seeks to plead a defence of justification pursuant to s 25 in relation to imputations 3(b) and 3(c) which is particularised as follows:
	


“The plaintiff operated the properties by allowing convicted paedophiles to reside there and notwithstanding that the properties were close to bus stops used, inter alia, by children.”


	
	The “properties” in question, although unidentified, are stated in the matter complained of to be two motels and the River Edge Indian Cuisine Restaurant. No details of when these paedophiles resided in any of these premises, or who they may be, are provided.
	
	
	Mr Dibb submits, and I agree, that this latest attempt to provide particulars is no more helpful than the previous particulars, and that his client thus has no idea of the case he is to meet since not only are the particulars inadequate, but the defendant continues to refuse to provide the particulars sought: Sims v Wran [1984] 1 NSWLR 317 at 328.
	


The defendant’s explanation for seeking to reinstate the defence


	
	When, and in what circumstances, may a party seek to reinstate a defence which has previously been struck out as embarrassing or hopeless under UCPR r 14.28?
	
	
	The defence in its earlier form was struck out because of its obvious inadequacy to provide any detail as to which property housed paedophiles, when this occurred, and how the plaintiff would have known they were paedophiles and agreed to this course of conduct. The defendant’s refusal to answer any of the particulars sought merely rubbed further salt into the wound. Mr Glaser, who was then acting for the defendant, acknowledged that the particulars were not answered, and said that this was because his client could not provide him with any of this information.
	
	
	The defendant dispensed with the services of Mr Glaser and appeared in person on 16 June 2015. No application was made, on the day of this application, or at the argument before me on 5 June 2015, for an extension of time to provide the particulars. On 16 June 2015, the defendant repeated to the court that he could not provide any particulars. He added that he could not lead evidence of these matters at the trial, because he had been given the information confidentially.
	
	
	The first intimation the plaintiff had that the defendant proposed that his defence of justification be reinstated was the plaintiff’s solicitors’ email of 24 July 2015, attaching a draft defence stating that the plaintiff allowed convicted paedophiles to reside in these properties “notwithstanding that the properties were close to bus stops” used by children. The plaintiff’s request for further and better particulars remained unanswered. The proposed defence instead states:
	


“Particulars of the paedophiles who resided at the properties will be provided following discovery by the plaintiff and/or the service of a notice to produce upon him and/or the service of subpoenas.”


	
	Where a fresh application of this kind is brought, there must be a material change in circumstances, or the discovery of material not previously available to warrant revisiting an earlier ruling of this kind. In Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [1999] NSWCA 313 at [38], Mason P stated:
	


“[38] The respondent's submission based on the interlocutory nature of this Court's orders also failed to grapple with a second difficulty. It had never been suggested that any change of circumstances might have justified revisiting the matter determined by this Court on 13 April. Even if the inspection order had been made by another judge of the Common Law Division, rather than the Court of Appeal, it is of critical importance that it was the culmination of contested proceedings. As McLelland J pointed out in Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Ltd (19 September 1988, unreported, see Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure NSW [13,047]):

In the present case I am dealing with an interlocutory order of a substantive nature made after a contested hearing in contemplation that it would operate until the final disposition of the proceedings. In such a case the ordinary rule of practice is that an application to set aside, vary or discharge the order must be founded on a material change of circumstances since the original application was heard, or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the court on the hearing of the original application.”


	
	Mr Goldsmith submits that the “new circumstance” is that his client did not need to answer any of the requests for particulars of justification, and the defendant’s previous solicitor was negligent in not pointing this out. Mr Goldsmith submits that his client is not required to provide any particulars of who these paedophiles are, or when they were housed by the plaintiff. The defendant’s former solicitor should have refused to answer the request on the basis that it sought irrelevant material and/or was oppressive, and should have foreshadowed that he could only provide those particulars after discovery, interrogatories, subpoenae and notices to produce.
	
	
	Is this correct? In Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law and Practice (LexisNexis) at [25,175] the authors state:
	


“In the case of the defence of justification, the defendant is not entitled to discovery before delivering particulars of the defence (Goldsmith v Constable [1937] 4 All E R 293; see also Zierenburg v Labouchere [1893] 2 QB 183; Yorkshire Provident Life Assurance Co v Gilbert & Rivington [1895] 2 QB 148; Arnold & Butler v Bottomley [1908] 2 KB 151.” [Citations included].


	
	The fresh discovery of material to support a plea of justification may be added to existing particulars, as Tobin & Sexton point out. However, a total failure to provide any particulars, on the basis that the evidence will be obtained at some later stage, is not permitted, because an unparticularised defence of justification is no defence at all, and may accordingly be struck out.
	
	
	In Brown on Defamation in Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the United States at [20.4(2)], Professor Brown reiterates:
	


“A “defendant is not entitled to discovery for the purpose of finding out whether he has a defence or not” (per Lord Escher M R in Zierenberg v Labouchere [1893] 2 QB 183 at 188 (CA). Accord: New Era Home App. Ltd v Toronto Star Ltd [1963] 1 O R 339 (HC) (Master).). He must be prepared to justify the accusation on his own, and not seek the assistance of the court for his proof (Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co v Hawkins (1859) 4 H & N 146 at 150; 157 E R 792 at 794..). He or she must give full particulars before discovery. (Per Greer LJ in Goldschmidt v Constable & Co [1937] 4 All E R 293 at 294 (CA), noted in (1938) NLJ 239. See also Ad-West Neon Inc v High-Line Construction Ltd [1992] 3 W W R 445, 8 C P C (3d) 290, 101 Sask R 220 (QB). [Citations included].


	
	The law on this issue has, as these statements of the relevant principles show, been settled for centuries.
	
	
	Additionally, Mr Goldsmith’s submission is not only contrary to longstanding principles in defamation law, but contrary to general practice in all areas of the law. A party who brings or defends a case cannot refuse to provide particulars on the basis that his opponent must provide that information on discovery or by notice to produce. It is a principle of long standing that a defendant is obliged to particularise a defence of justification based on existing materials rather than on the hope of later locating some material upon which the defence might be legitimately based.
	
	
	These principles have been restated in recent times. In Kingsfield Holdings Pty Ltd v Sullivan Commercial Pty Ltd [2013] WASC 347 at [40], Kenneth Martin J stated that “it could never be legitimate to plead a defence of truth in an expectation that in due course the process of discovery, or answered subpoenas, will unearth some supporting evidence”. Similarly, a subpoena issued in advance of particularisation of the defence of justification may be struck out as premature (Marshall v Smith [2013] WASC 432) or as a fishing expedition (Sali v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (No 2) [2013] VSC 719).
	
	
	Nor is a request for discovery from the plaintiff the answer. The purpose of the particulars of justification is not only so that the parties can know the case they have to meet, but also so that the parameters of discovery are clear (Brown, at [20-31]).
	
	
	Nor is it the case that a party giving such particulars can refuse to identify individuals by name, on the basis that this amounts to a discovery of evidence. Where an allegation is made that a plaintiff is guilty of, for example, conspiring with others to commit a crime, the plaintiff is entitled to “the names of person with whom, and the times and places at which” such events had occurred (Brown at 20-33, citing Wootton v Sievier [1913] 3 KB 499).
	
	
	The proposed redrafted defence of justification fails every test. The inadequacies of this pleading are such as to satisfy all three provisions of UCPR r 14.28(1), even though satisfying only one of these requirements would be necessary.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I make orders as follows:
	



	
	On the application of the defendant to amend the Defence in circumstances where it is acknowledged that the result will be the vacation of the half day hearing set down for 10:00am on Thursday 20 August 2015, and subject to the costs order set out below, the hearing date is vacated and the defendant is granted leave to file an Amended Defence (limited to the defences of qualified privilege pursuant to s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and at common law, honest opinion and unlikelihood of harm).
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs occasioned by the vacation of the hearing date on an indemnity basis, including the costs of today.
	
	
	The defendant’s Amended Defence is to be filed and served in 21 days.
	
	
	The defendant’s application to reinstate the defence of justification set out in paragraph 12 of the draft defence is refused.
	
	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Thursday 27 August 2015 at 9:00am.

2767315,R v Webber [2015] NSWSC 1052,"judgment


	
	The accused, Mr Geoffrey Webber was arraigned before me on 27th July 2015. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental illness to the single count on the indictment that, on or about 2nd May 2012 at Brookvale he murdered the deceased, Mr Luke Aaron Robins. On 16th April 2015 an election under s 132(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) was made by Mr Webber to be tried by a judge alone. This election was consented to by the Crown on 4th May 2015 and accordingly under s 132(2) the Court ordered trial without a jury.
	


Summary of Crown case


	
	In summary, the Crown case is that at just after 11:30pm on 2nd May 2012 Mr Webber and Mr Robins were waiting at the southbound bus stop on Pittwater Rd, Brookvale, opposite Warringah Mall. They did not know each other. Suddenly and without provocation Mr Webber attacked Mr Robins with a long, black-handled carving knife. Mr Robins valiantly tried to fight off his attacker but he was overpowered by Mr Webber who twice stabbed him in the chest. Police arrived on the scene very soon afterwards in response to 000 calls by witnesses. When Mr Webber saw them he ran onto a bus which had just arrived at the stop, attempting to get into the driver’s cubicle. Initially resisting arrest, Mr Webber was wrestled from the bus by police officers onto the footpath where he was arrested, handcuffed and cautioned. He remains in custody in the Long Bay Hospital. Despite the best efforts of police and ambulance officers to save him, Mr Robins tragically passed away within minutes of arriving at Royal North Shore Hospital.
	


General legal principles


	
	Section 133 Criminal Procedure Act prescribes my duties in a criminal trial without a jury. The section requires me to include in my judgment the principles of law and findings of fact I have relied on in reaching my decision. The section also requires me to take into account any warning which, in the circumstances of this case, would usually be given to a jury.
	
	
	I bear in mind that I have the responsibility of identifying the real issues for decision. It is necessary for me to state only so much of the law relevant to those real issues: Alford v Magee (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466.
	
	
	The starting point, and fundamental rule, as in any criminal trial, is Mr Webber is presumed to be innocent. It is relevant to record, given his plea, that he is also presumed to be sane. The presumption of innocence is rebutted if and only if the Crown proves the essential elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. It is for the accused to rebut the presumption of sanity by establishing his mental illness defence on the balance of probabilities, a much less exacting standard of proof.
	
	
	The elements of murder which the Crown must establish in the present case to prove Mr Webber’s guilt are that by his voluntary, or deliberate act of stabbing Mr Robins, neither in self-defence nor by provocation, Mr Webber caused Mr Robins’ death, intending at that time to kill him. Given the nature of his acts the consideration of a lesser intent can safely be put aside.
	
	
	Particular considerations apply to this case because Mr Webber has raised mental illness as a defence: Hawkins v The Queen [1994] HCA 28; 179 CLR 500; R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 63 NSWLR 490 at [32]. Those considerations relate to the order in which the issues are required to be approached. As Ms C Loukas SC, who appears for Mr Webber, argued the issues are to be approached in the order which I will now set out.
	
	
	The first issue is whether the stabbing of Mr Robins was a deliberate act. Mental illness is irrelevant at this stage. In truth there is no real issue about this. Criminal trials are not only accusatory, they are also adversarial in nature and, there is no issue that the actions of Mr Webber stabbing Mr Robins were willed and voluntary. Were it otherwise, the eyewitness accounts overwhelmingly establish this fact. It will still be necessary for me to say something about the facts and their aftermath because they inform the decision about the second issue.
	
	
	The second issue is whether Mr Webber is criminally responsible for the consequences of his actions. This involves resolution of the mental illness defence.
	
	
	Once again, there is no issue that Mr Webber suffered from a mental illness at the time he killed Mr Robins; probably for some years before, and ever since. Other than sporadically, that illness was untreated before he was taken into custody. He has been intensively treated since, and on the evidence, his condition is somewhat better now than then. In lay terms, the real issue is whether his condition at the time of the killing was severe enough to satisfy the elements of the legal defence.
	
	
	The mental illness defence is governed by the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). Section 38 provides for what is referred to as a “special verdict” if the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. This is a third category of available verdict in addition to verdicts of “guilty” or “not guilty”. It is important to understand that the legal consequences which follow a special verdict “are quite different from those which follow a plain verdict of not guilty on the ground that [Mr Webber] did not do the things charged” (The King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; 55 CLR 182 at 185). In the case of a special verdict, subject to the provisions of the Act, Mr Webber will not be “completely free”.
	
	
	If I return a special verdict, I am empowered to order that Mr Webber be detained “in such place and in such manner” as I think fit “until released by due process of law” (s 39 of the Act). It is important to understand that I am not authorised to release Mr Webber into the community unless I am satisfied that his safety, or the safety of any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release (s 39). A decision that he be detained in custody means that he will be a forensic patient under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which will review his case and make orders for his continued detention, care and appropriate treatment. The Tribunal may not release Mr Webber unless it is satisfied as required by law about his safety and the safety of members of the public. And it may only do so after it has given the Minister for Health and the Attorney General prior opportunity to make submissions about his possible release. The Tribunal will be bound to review Mr Webber’s case, at least every six months. It is composed of a President who is, was, or would be qualified to be, a Judicial Officer, a psychiatrist or psychologist, and a third member drawn from the community with appropriate qualifications and experience. Importantly, in this case, whilst under its supervision, the Tribunal may make orders for Mr Webber’s continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital or prison.
	
	
	I emphasise that the return of a special verdict will not mean that Mr Webber has not perpetrated what is the greatest wrong that may be committed according to the ordinary standards adopted by reasonable people; rather the law does not attribute criminal responsibility to him for it by reason only of his mental illness.
	
	
	Not every case of mental illness is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the mental illness defence absolving a person from criminal responsibility. As Dixon J (as the Chief Justice then was) pointed out as long ago as 1933 (in Porter at 187):
	


… a great number of [the] people who come into a Criminal Court are abnormal. They would not be there if they were the normal type of average everyday people. Many of them are very peculiar in their disposition and peculiarly tempered…. Nevertheless, they are mentally quite able to appreciate what they are doing and quite able to appreciate the threatened punishment of the law and the wrongness of their acts, and they are held in check by the prospect of punishment. It would be very absurd if the law were to withdraw that check on the ground that they were somewhat different from their fellow creatures in mental make-up or texture at the very moment when the check is most needed.

His Honour went on to point out:

(The criminal law) attempt[s] to define what are the classes of people who should not be punished although they have done actual things which in others would amount to crime. It is quite a different object to that which the medical profession has in view or other departments of the law have in view in defining insanity for the purpose of the custody of a person’s property, capacity to make a will, and the like.


	
	As I say, the standard of proof is less exacting, but the necessary elements of the defence are not easily satisfied. The legal requirements of the defence have been established since 1843 (R v McNaughten (1843) 8 ER 718) in the following terms:
	


… to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and the nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.

It is necessary for me to focus on that short period of time during which Mr Webber attacked and killed Mr Robins. Even so, his past and subsequent medical history relevantly shed light on his condition at the time.


	
	The evidence in the present case refines the issue somewhat. Any question of whether Mr Webber knew the quality and nature of the act of stabbing Mr Robins can be ignored. Neither psychiatrist suggests his condition was such. I accept the evidence of Dr Allnutt that Mr Webber maintained the capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions (76.10 - .32T).
	
	
	The evidence is also “all one way” that Mr Webber, at the time he killed Mr Robins, was suffering from a disease of the mind, namely paranoid schizophrenia (69.15 - .40T). In truth, the expert witnesses, Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst, were also in agreement that Mr Webber’s disease was of such a severity giving rise to “such a defect of reason … that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong”. Both experts considered, adapting the language of Dixon J (Porter at 189 – 190), that by reason of his disease Mr Webber “could not reason about” his actions, “with a moderate degree of sense and composure” such as to say “he could not know that what he was doing was wrong” (Dr Allnut at 76.43T, 77.35T and 86.25T; Dr Furst at 97.30T).
	
	
	As can be seen, the psychiatric evidence, in terms of the opinion of each expert on the facts assumed, favours me finding the mental illness defence has been established, and the Crown does not argue otherwise.
	
	
	However, I bear in mind that the value of expert opinions is very much dependent upon whether the facts assumed for the purpose of expressing the opinion are sufficiently like the facts as I find them to be. I am not obliged to accept the opinion of any expert. I may reject the evidence, especially where the facts upon which the opinion is based does not accord with the facts as I find them to be.
	
	
	It is very important to bear in mind that the expert evidence was not challenged by Crown. Indeed, Dr Allnutt’s evidence was propounded by the learned Crown Prosecutor. Even so, given that the sanctity of human life is a fundamental community value upheld and bolstered by the criminal law, it remains important for me to review the evidence to consider whether it actually persuades me, on the balance of probabilities, that the defence has been established. The wrongful taking of a life requires retribution, denunciation and vindication of the injuries suffered by the victim’s family. These objects can only be achieved when offenders suffer punishment. The taking of Mr Robins’ life is beyond this principle only if the mental illness defence is made out.
	
	
	In undertaking the review of the evidence I will bear in mind that if it is shown that the two doctors not only come to the same conclusion, but provide like reasons for it which “clearly lead to that conclusion … the right decision … must be that the defence has been made out” (R v Jenkins (1963) 64 SR (NSW) 20 at 31 by Walsh J).
	
	
	Before proceeding further, I record that if I am not satisfied that the mental illness defence has been made out, it will be necessary to go on to consider the question of whether Mr Webber intended to kill Mr Robins when he stabbed him. The answer to that question will be informed by his mental illness, even if it does not rise to such a level as to support the mental illness defence. If I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had that necessary intent, a final question will be whether his mental illness supports the partial defence of substantial impairment provided by s 23A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) reducing murder to manslaughter.
	


Issue 1 – Voluntary Act


	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act of stabbing Mr Robins was a deliberate act by Mr Webber, and that that act caused Mr Robins death.
	
	
	The circumstances established by the evidence are that Mr Robins was at the date of his death aged 22. He was a student studying popular music. Earlier in the evening of Wednesday 2nd May 2012 he had rehearsed or practised with some friends. He then intended to travel to the city to meet-up with another young musician. The other musician had performed with his band in a hotel and they were meeting for a friendly drink afterwards. Mr Robins was waiting for a city-bound bus at the bus stop on the eastern side of Pittwater Rd, Brookvale, opposite Warringah Mall. He was sitting in a bus-shelter seat listening to music through headphones and, as young people are apt to do, playing on his mobile phone.
	
	
	Mr Webber was then aged 25. From a telephone call to his mother at about 10:45pm it is known he had been at Warringah Mall and was intending to return to her home by bus. When first seen by an eyewitness, Ms Tereza Kratka, Mr Webber too was sitting in the same bus shelter as Mr Robins. Mr Webber was sitting in the southern most of three groups of three seats and Mr Robins in the middle group.
	
	
	When Ms Kratka entered the bus shelter she walked passed Mr Webber and Mr Robins and took a seat in the northern most group of seats. She was then 25 years of age and she commenced playing on her phone waiting for the bus. She remembers looking at her phone and noticing it was 11:36pm. She then happened to look up and saw Mr Webber standing directly in front of Mr Robins holding a long bladed kitchen knife in his right hand. The knife was later recovered. It was a black handled Wiltshire carving knife with a long blade, with an overall length of about 30cm. Understandably, Ms Kratka assumed she was witnessing a robbery and ran away in the direction of the Brookvale Bus Depot, north of the shelter. As she did so she heard a male voice yelling “help”. The voice was that of Mr Robins.
	
	
	Ms Vicky Thorpe, a visitor from South Australia, had been at the movies at Warringah Mall with one of her sons. They were waiting for a bus back to their accommodation at the bus stop on the western side of Pittwater Rd, opposite where Mr Robins was sitting. She noticed the three young people in the bus stop opposite, but paid them no particular attention. When she heard the call of “help”, which she described as a loud yell, she looked across again, seeing Ms Kratka running north and Mr Webber and Mr Robins (of course who she did not know) wrestling. She realised something serious was happening. She described a struggle between Mr Robins and Mr Webber – “their arms were above their heads and [Mr Webber] had the knife up and [Mr Robins] was holding his hands up … trying to stop the knife from coming down” (9.10 - .20T). She could see the light of the bus shelter reflecting off the blade of the knife. She described it as a carving knife. She could see from the movement of his jaw, that Mr Webber was saying something and she could hear Mr Robins calling out “someone help me”. She shouted out, “hey”, I infer to let Mr Webber know he was being watched in an attempt to discourage him from persisting with his actions. She asked her son to telephone 000 while she took her own phone across to the median strip. The lanes of traffic are separated by a fence mounted on the median strip to prevent pedestrians from crossing Pittwater Rd, other than at the lights. She was yelling out “we’ve called 000, we’re taking photos” to try to get Mr Webber’s attention “to make him see what he was doing so that he would stop” (10.15 - .20T). But Mr Webber paid no heed and Mr Robins continued to struggle and call for help.
	
	
	Ms Thorpe who remained in the centre of the road at fence because she “couldn’t get past it” (10.45T) had her attention distracted by a north bound bus momentarily, and when she looked back she saw the young males on the ground, Mr Webber on top of Mr Robins. Despite his position of great disadvantage, Mr Robins was still resisting valiantly and holding Mr Webber’s wrist away from him. She saw Mr Webber punch Mr Robins in an attempt to get the better of him. She then saw Mr Webber stab Mr Robins with the knife in his left hand through the centre of his chest, pushing the hilt of the knife down with his right hand. Mr Webber removed the knife with his left hand and stabbed Mr Robins again in the same manner. Mr Robins continued to call for help, but his voice was weaker.
	
	
	What Ms Thorpe saw is confirmed by the results of the post mortem examination carried out by forensic pathologist, Rebecca Irvine. Dr Irvine summarised her findings as follows (Exhibit H):
	


Autopsy revealed a pale young adult man with a single stab wound on the left upper chest. The wound was distinctly “squared off”, suggesting a single edged knife, and there were associated abrasions suggestive of a hilt/guard mark. There were two distinct incisions of the cartilage subjacent to the stab wound, indicating at least two passes of the blade through this area. The wound perforated both lobes of the left lung; there were 1750 mL of blood within the chest cavity, and the left lung was collapsed. There was evidence of haemoaspiration within the right lung. The wound tract penetrated the left lateral chest wall within the 5th intercoastal space, and very likely incised the intercostal artery (given the large amount of blood accumulated within the pleural cavity, the reported blood loss outside the body and the rapidity of his collapse). The wound tract travelled front to back, right to left (leftward) and slightly downward.

The cause of the death was a stab wound of the chest.


	
	The doctor also found a number of blunt force injuries to Mr Robins face and trunk, probably from the punching. I infer he fought back as he held the knife away with his right hand because there were blunt force injuries found on his left hand. There were also knife injuries to both hands which Dr Irvine said were “consistent with “defence injuries”” (Exhibit H, p 3).
	


Immediate aftermath


	
	Sergeant Alan Le Surf, of Dee Why Police Station, was on duty as the mobile supervisor of his patrol in a fully marked police car. His partner was Constable Nicole Townsend. They received the call over the radio. The sergeant immediately activated the lights and sirens on his vehicle and responded “code red” to the incident (31.45T). Upon arrival they overshot the bus shelter somewhat, u-turned and parked in the kerbside lane next to the bus shelter but facing north. As they pulled up Const Townsend saw Mr Webber “still holding the long black handled [knife] against [Mr Robins’] chest (Exhibit T[7]). As they hurried from the police car, a southbound bus, driven by Mr Lawrence Ess pulled up at the bus stop. Unaware of events, Mr Ess, as he always did, opened the bus doors to allow any passengers waiting at this major stop to board. When this occurred, Mr Webber ran on to the bus. As he commenced this movement, Const Townsend saw he was still holding the knife.
	
	
	When he boarded the bus, otherwise reliable witnesses thought they saw Mr Webber threaten Mr Ess with the knife. They were mistaken in this. Mr Ess, understandably, was very alarmed by the appearance of Mr Webber who attempted to enter the driver’s cubicle. The driver saw nothing in Mr Webber’s hands (28.25T). Mr Ess grabbed his metallic torch, which he waved around to ward off Mr Webber. Although he did not know that Mr Webber was unarmed at the time he boarded the bus in pursuit of him, Sgt Le Surf saw when Mr Webber turned to confront him “that he had nothing in his hands” (32.15T). I think that the witnesses who believed they saw the knife when Mr Webber was on the bus were mistaken. They may have mistaken Mr Ess’ torch for the knife.
	
	
	Const Townsend believed that Mr Webber remained armed because she drew her firearm, ready to use it, fearing for the immediate safety of herself and those on the bus. Sgt Le Surf who is a very tall, strong-looking, experienced police officer had difficulty bringing Mr Webber under control as he “flailed around with his arms in a whirling motion” (32.15T). The police officer got the better of him and was able to drag him off the bus. The Sgt observed that during all this time Mr Webber had said nothing “and only seemed to grunt (32.15T). Const Townsend made a similar observation (Exhibit T[13]).
	
	
	As Sgt Le Surf dragged Mr Webber off the bus he continued to resist and Const Townsend and other arriving police officers were required to get him to the ground. He continued to struggle and was handcuffed only with considerable difficulty. The Sgt then found the knife, completely covered in blood, lying in the gutter. Obviously, Mr Webber discarded it as he made for the bus.
	
	
	By coincidence Ms Kratka, after reporting Mr Webber’s attack on Mr Robins at the bus depot, and requesting they contact the police, joined Mr Ess’ bus at the next bus stop north. She was on the bus when Mr Webber boarded it. She said (Exhibit B[22]):
	


[When Mr Webber boarded the bus] the Police had already arrived and they got him off the bus. There were 3 Police and he was fighting with them. [Mr Webber] appeared insane. He was punching the police.


	
	When Mr Webber was removed from the bus, Mr Ess closed the doors and continued with his duty for the sake of his passengers.
	
	
	As Sgt Le Surf and his colleagues were capturing and subduing Mr Webber, other police including Snr Const Tanya Megahey (nee Orchard) were attempting to sustain Mr Robins’ life by undertaking cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Sgt Matthew Lehmann returning to his home in the northern beaches after completing his shift in the eastern suburbs stopped to render assistance taking over from Const Megahey. Attempts were also made to stem Mr Robins’ blood loss whilst awaiting the arrival of an ambulance. When it arrived, Const Megahey drove the ambulance to Royal North Shore Hospital so that paramedics could continue their attempts to save Mr Robins during the journey. Despite their efforts, tragically Mr Robins was pronounced dead just after midnight.
	
	
	Detective Snr Const Adam Vickery is the officer in charge of the investigation. His statement is Exhibit E. He was also the arresting officer. He was present when Mr Webber was handcuffed and heard him laughing and grunting during the process. When cautioned Mr Webber did not reply. At the police station, Mr Webber apparently asked for legal advice. The police unsuccessfully attempted to contact legal aid. He was provided with a phone book to enable him to contact a solicitor in private practice, but was seen to simply look off into the middle distance (Exhibit E[32]). Both Sgt Le Surf and Det Snr Const Vickery regarded Mr Webber’s non-verbal responses as abnormal. Both had experienced this type of thing when arresting persons known to be mentally ill in the past.
	


Issue 2 – Mr Webber’s history of mental illness


	
	As I have already commented Mr Webber undoubtedly suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. The question is whether, at the time he stabbed Mr Robins, his condition gave rise to such a defect of reason that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. It remains relevant to consider the nature of the history of his condition.
	
	
	He had a strong genetic predisposition to the development of paranoid schizophrenia, his father who left the family when Mr Webber was 5 years old was schizophrenic, and his mother suffered from bipolar disorder. After his parents separated, his mother, because of her own health problems, was unable to care for her children and he became a ward of the State living in various refuges from about the age of 15. In the opinion of Dr Grant Sara, a psychiatrist involved with Northern Beaches Early Intervention Centre of the North Sydney Local Health District (Exhibit U), these circumstances amount to a “complex and traumatic developmental history” relevant to the onset of the disease.
	
	
	Mr Webber first came to the attention of Mental Health Services after he became a ward of the State. He was treated between the ages of 15 and 18 for a dysthymic disorder, a depressive condition. Whilst under treatment his therapist described him as “isolated, reclusive, avoidant, ruminates excessively, strongly opinionated, having a tendency to procrastinate and avoid risks, detached”. Drs Allnutt and Furst, with the benefit of hindsight, considered this depressive condition may have been part of the prodromal phase of the development of his schizophrenia.
	
	
	Mr Webber seems to have suffered his first documented psychotic episode in about December 2008. He was admitted to Manly Hospital for a medical condition and medical staff became concerned at his obvious anxiety. He complained of unusual symptoms such as hypersensitivity to noise in the ward including beeping machines and crying babies. He seemed to consider that these noises were directed at him. These complaints seem to represent the emergence of “referential thoughts”, common symptoms of the disease. Dr Allnutt defined these as “inferring meaning in things that one might perceive to have some meaning to oneself” (59.15T; 66.15T). Mr Webber complained of a spy plane outside the hospital ward (Exhibit V2, p 5) and his thoughts were disordered in as much as he was described as “vague and guarded, staring out window, delayed responses”. But those assessing him felt he had no formal thought disorder. He was admitted to the psychiatric unit, was found difficult to assess and was discharged by the visiting Magistrate. Dr Sara said:
	


Our impression was of an ultra-high risk young man with strong genetic and developmental vulnerability and gradual increase in longstanding dysthymia and anxiety. At that assessment his focus on noise appeared consistent with an anxiety state rather than being frankly psychotic. However, his affect, behaviour, interpersonal manner and sticky, perseverative cognitive style suggested emerging psychosis or vulnerability to psychosis. Provisional diagnosis was of Dysthymia, an atypical Anxiety Disorder and possible evolving psychosis.


	
	His mother told police (Exhibit M) that he had been treated by his GP with Zoloft, for depression. However, that doctor died sometime before December 2010. He was in contact with the Beaches Mental Health Service again in December 2010 after an incident of aggressive behaviour in a dispute with a neighbour about water dripping from the neighbour’s balcony onto his washing. Dr Sara was struck by his degree of depression. Dr Sara did not think him “unambiguously psychotic”, but there were clearly aspects of the examination raising concern about that topic including his continued hypersensitivity to noise, anxiety and hyper-vigilance. However, he was dismissive of questions about persecutory ideas. He appeared depressed, psycho-motor retarded, with restricted, sad, weary and resigned affect. He was not, however, thought disordered. He was then 21.
	
	
	A strange incident occurred on 2nd April 2011 when his behaviour came to the attention of police. This is documented in the statement of Const Adam Goodhand of 5th May 2011 (Exhibit P). Police attended at Mr Webber’s home in response to a report that he “had been having a psychotic episode for the past two days” (Exhibit P[4]). Upon his arrival, Const Goodhand noticed a web camera protruding between the door and the doorframe of Mr Webber’s unit. A neighbour reported to police that the previous day he had come upon Mr Webber crouching in a corner of the stairwell crying and saying “they are after me”. The neighbour questioned him, but Mr Webber would only say things like “they are coming for me”. Later Mr Webber knocked on the neighbour’s door. When asked what was wrong, Mr Webber replied “they are coming for me”. The neighbour then noticed the web camera on the morning of 2nd April and contacted police. When police knocked on his door and identified themselves, Mr Webber did not move, but was seen to be continually looking at his computer screen. The police officer pushed the door open further and attempted to talk to him, but Mr Webber did not answer questions. Const Goodhand was able to, with some cajoling, persuade Mr Webber to attend Manly Hospital voluntarily, as the police officer had formed the view “he may be suffering from some form of mental illness such as schizophrenia”.
	
	
	At the hospital he was apparently able to speak to doctors, but he could not explain his conduct “saying only that “it was an odd thing to do”” (Exhibit U, p 3). I interpolate that Dr Allnutt defined catatonia as being mute and not engaging in any behaviours. He counted it among the symptoms of thought process disturbance associated with schizophrenia. These also included perseveration and delayed or slowed thought processes (70.35 - .45T). As he presented to Const Goodhand, I infer he was exhibiting this sign of catatonia.
	
	
	Dr Furst said at (92.25T):
	


Catatonia is the most severe form of mental illness, in the sense that when the person is basically unresponsive and … frozen in their posture, can't move, can't eat, can't think [its] … a marker of …. a severe schizophrenia.

Mr Webber was catatonic when Dr Furst first assessed him on 15th June 2012. The features of his presentation to Dr Sara, and also to the layman, Const Goodhand, seem characteristic of some forms of schizophrenia.


	
	Despite attempts by the Mental Health Service to follow up with Mr Webber, he failed to respond to them.
	
	
	His condition seemed to worsen in 2012 to the extent that there were a series of very worrying incidents leading up to him killing Mr Robins. On 24th April 2012, he assaulted an elderly resident of his unit block repeatedly asking him “who am I?”. Following this incident, perhaps ironically, he became anxious that his neighbours were after him. He seems to have been living on the streets or, at times, staying with his mother. He told Dr Allnutt in March 2013 that he felt the Government and the police were reading his mind “and for this reason he tried to sleep on the rocks at Queenscliff because he thought doing so would “stop the brain waves by having the rocks in-between [him] and them” (60.30T).
	
	
	Two strange incidents occurred on 25th April 2012. He travelled by bus to Mona Vale in the late evening. When he alighted from the bus he followed an elderly man home walking right into his backyard. He was not violent or dangerous but behaved strangely telling the elderly man and his wife that he was looking for a friend and asking him whether they would be his friend. They gave him a cup of tea and arranged for him to be escorted from the premises by the night manager. The night manager returned him to the bus stop, but Mr Webber did not leave the vicinity. He was next seen following a young woman who was pushing her child in a stroller around Coles and then followed her home, walking very closely behind her. A good Samaritan intervened and Mr Webber absconded.
	
	
	Mr Webber seems to have been staying with his mother on 30th April, 1st May and for part of 2nd May 2012. On 30th April his mother was extremely worried about his condition and contacted the Mental Health Crisis Team at the Manly Hospital. She felt that in the weeks leading up to 2nd May 2012, he had not been “normal”. He seemed to have distanced himself from his family (Exhibit M[13] – [14]).
	
	
	Two registered nurses from the Mental Health Service contacted her on 1st May 2012, being Anthony Kemp (Exhibit N) and Helen Dunne (Exhibit O). They made a home visit in an attempt to assess Mr Webber’s mental state. Mr Webber refused to have anything to do with them and walked out on them. Mr Kemp formed the view that Mr Webber needed to be assessed by a doctor. He did not feel threatened, but the situation was tense and Mr Webber was agitated. He encouraged Mrs Webber to attempt to persuade her son to attend the hospital. Mr Kemp was sufficiently concerned about what he had seen to make inquiries about Mr Webber on the Mental Health Services’ computerised system. He also rang Dee Why police and relayed his concerns to the constable who answered the phone. The constable suggested that a car would call at Mr Webber’s flat in Manly Vale. However, Mr Webber would not have been there between that report and his attack on Mr Robins.
	
	
	Mr Webber returned to his mother’s home later on the evening of 1st May saying he went to Palm Beach on the bus.
	
	
	On the morning of 2nd May 2012, the mental health team rang Mrs Webber to speak about Mr Webber’s situation. At that time, he was at home and asleep. Mrs Webber had already decided with the assistance of one of her daughter’s, to attempt to talk Mr Webber into going with them to Manly Hospital. When her daughter arrived, Mrs Webber told her that “Geoffrey needs help”. When Mr Webber woke up and saw his sister there, he seems to have become very suspicious. Mrs Webber and her daughter could not muster the gumption to broach the subject about going to the hospital with them as she could see he would have been “really upset with [them]” (Exhibit M[16]).
	
	
	Mr Webber spent part of that day with his mother. They had lunch at a family restaurant and attended his unit because he said he wanted to get a t-shirt and his bible. When they arrived there Mrs Webber said he looked anxious like he was afraid and told her he was confused. He obtained the things he had come for and they left. He then sat down on a neighbouring fence “took out his bible and started to look around” (Exhibit M[17]). She told him he could read it at her place. He would not listen. He went back to his unit and put the bible on the table. She said once he put the bible down he was happy to leave the unit. They did some shopping on the way home. Mrs Webber left Mr Webber sitting at a table while she went to a supermarket. When she returned he was hanging his head. They returned to her home at about 4 pm. She tried to encourage him to rest because she knew he had been anxious and had not slept much in the past week, but he insisted on going out.
	
	
	From the police investigation, it seems Mr Webber went into the city. CCTV footage investigated by the police depicted him in the vicinity of the Carrington Street entrance to Wynyard Railway Station at about 7pm, (wrongly recorded as 7 am). Other footage showed him in the Coles supermarket at the station. He later seems to have gone to Warringah Mall from where he phoned his mother at about 10:45 pm. His mother said “[he] sounded quite anxious”.
	
	
	Although no diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was made during this period, all of this evidence, which I accept, paints a compelling picture when examined through the lens of the expert evidence, of a genetically predisposed, socially and emotionally deprived young man, descending into the grip of a serious mental illness at an ever quickening pace just prior to 2nd May 2012. The bizarre nature of his behaviour over the week leading up to him killing Mr Robins and the contemporaneous concerns of his mother, and Mr Kemp, an experienced nurse in the field, persuades me that he was certainly mentally ill at the time he attacked Mr Robins.
	


The expert evidence


	
	The reliability of the expert psychiatric evidence depends upon the validity of the assumptions they have made about Mr Webber’s medical history, and the reliability of the accounts he gave them. Their interpretation of Mr Webber’s past medical history from the documents they were asked to inspect substantially accord with the findings I have made.
	
	
	Mr Webber eventually offered an account of what happened to each of them. As he has not given evidence, it is appropriate that I bear in mind that hearsay evidence is often unreliable especially when it consists of out of court statements by a person accused of a serious crime, who may therefore have a motive for proffering self-serving statements of an exculpatory type. That he cannot be cross-examined on them affects the weight which might be accorded to them. Nonetheless the statements made are admissible because they are the foundation or part of the foundation of the opinions expressed by Drs Allnutt and Furst. Being admissible for that purpose, I am entitled to rely upon them, if I am otherwise persuaded as to their reliability, as evidence of the truth as an exception to the hearsay rule under s 60 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	It is not without significance that upon being taken into custody Mr Webber was admitted into the Long Bay Hospital and he has been under the care of Justice Health with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and under treatment by appropriate anti-psychotic medications of gradually increasing strength.
	
	
	The first of the experts to examine him was Dr Furst. Mr Webber did not answer any questions during that consultation. Dr Furst formed the impression that he was catatonic, as I have said, a significant marker of schizophrenia. His inspection of the Justice Health file revealed that doctors treating him thought him to be depressed and psychotic. They were treating him with “potent antipsychotic” medication. Dr Furst diagnosed severe paranoid or catatonic schizophrenia.
	
	
	When Dr Furst next saw him in October 2012, his condition was improved and he was able to answer questions, but he remained slow in his manner and “paranoid”. Dr Furst maintained his diagnosis of severe paranoid or catatonic schizophrenia.
	
	
	Mr Webber told Dr Furst:
	


He was depressed and felt hopeless from about March 2012, spending a lot of time by himself at home. Mr Webber felt as though he was being followed and monitored, believing that various people were behind this. He believed that people could “listen to his thoughts” which made him feel more anxious, depressed and paranoid. He also described beliefs in “a battle between good and evil” believing that he was on the evil side that was “losing”.

Dr Furst regarded the history as being consistent with Mr Webber suffering from paranoid delusions when he stabbed Mr Robins. He was also experiencing delusional beliefs that he was going to be killed and needed to capture soles in order to increase his power. He considered the delusions represented a defect in reason stemming from his schizophrenia and that he was unaware of the wrongfulness of his action at the time of the alleged offence. Dr Furst is of the view that Mr Webber has a most severe cases of schizophrenia (93.20T).


	
	From his notes of the consultation in October 2012, Dr Furst said that Mr Webber expanded on his delusional beliefs about the battle between good and evil. He perceived that Mr Robins was “the ultimate enemy” and that fighting him was part of the battle. Mr Webber “thought it was the right thing to do at the time … and he had no choice” (94.15 - .45T). If he did not defeat Mr Robins, Mr Webber thought he would lose the battle and die. This, of course, is a bizarre delusion. On the basis of these contemporaneous delusional beliefs stemming from his schizophrenia, the doctor was of the opinion that he was unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions “at the time of the alleged offence” (Exhibit 1C, p 4).
	
	
	Dr Allnutt’s first evaluation was conducted over two days on 22nd and 28th March 2013 at E Ward, Long Bay Hospital. By then he was able to give an account of himself. He told Dr Allnutt (Exhibit V2, p 2):
	


Prior to his incarceration he had thought that he was being followed by Government cars, helicopters and planes; he thought he was in a war; he was not sure what it was about; he thought this, because of all the helicopters that heard; he was the one being fought over; he was not sure they were fighting over him, the [sic] said possibly – he was not sure that they were fighting; his mind [was being] read by Government and Police and for this reason he tried to sleep on the rocks at Queenscliff because he thought that in doing so “stopped the brain waves by having rocks in between me and them”; he was reading the Bible a lot because he thought it was relevant to what was going on, but when I inquired why he could not explain.

I have recited this passage, which in part repeats evidence I have set out above because to my mind it demonstrates that in large measure, the history received by Dr Allnutt is consistent with the type of delusional history received by Dr Furst. This suggests to me that it was not concocted. Given the past medical history and the consideration that Mr Webber has partly responded to anti-psychotic medication whilst detained, I consider this to be an accurate reflection of his deluded state of mind at the time he attacked Mr Robins. Of the attack he told Dr Allnutt (Exhibit V2, p 3):

He believed that [Mr Robins] was trying to kill his family and believed that [Mr Robins] had been part of a conspiracy; he continued to believe that some sort of conspiracy persisted; he continued to believe that he was being watched by everybody including the guards, other inmates, doctors and nurses; he continued to feel fearful for his life at the hands of the authorities.


	
	In another report prepared for the purpose of the case following his first consultation (Exhibit V1 26 March 2013) Dr Allnutt explained his opinion that Mr Webber was unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure (a reference to the analysis of Dixon J in Porter) in the following way:
	


[Mr Webber] had for a number of years laboured under the persistent belief that people were conspiring against him…

These people involved authorities such as the Government and the police (the types of people that most members of the population would go to if they thought their rights would be breached) and thus his options with regard to dealing with his misperceived circumstances were limited.

He easily incorporated other members of the community into his delusional belief system such as his neighbour” (in 2010) and when he incorporated other people into his delusional system he would have been impaired in his capacity to make rational decisions in relation to his proposed behaviour with regard to those people.

In oral evidence, Dr Allnutt added (77.10T):

“What happens when that happens is … because the person is now incorporated into an irrational belief system, what the sufferer infers about that persons intentions towards him becomes irrational as well”.

At the material time of the alleged offence he rapidly incorporated [Mr Robins] into his delusional system; he found justification for acting in the manner he did as a consequence of a sudden thought that occurred to him, that a) he had to kill the victim to stop the people from following him; and b) that the victim might be conspiring to kill his family.

His decision to attack the victim appeared to be a relatively impulsive act driven by an immediate thought that occurred to him, but derived from long term underlying persecutory beliefs derived from a mental illness.

He believed at the time that he was justified in doing this and the impression I gained when I interviewed him in the hospital was that he continued to hold the belief that he was justified in his actions at the material time the alleged offence occurred; This justification and strong sense of conviction is a fundamental characteristic of a delusional belief.

The expert concluded:

In my view, therefore, as a consequence of his delusional beliefs, his attribution of those beliefs to the victim, he would have been incapable of reasoning about the matter of wrongfulness with a moderate degree of sense (and) composure and would have available to him a defence of mental illness.


	
	Both Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst have concluded that Mr Webber has the mental illness defence available to him. Trained psychiatrists often express themselves in this way, although in reality that conclusion is not a matter for them, but a matter for me as the “tribunal of fact”.
	


Determination


	
	This body of evidence, including the opinion of the experts actually persuades me on the balance of probabilities that, at the time he attacked and killed Mr Robins, Mr Webber was suffering from a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia. This is undoubtedly a disease of the mind. In my view, reviewing the evidence with the benefit of the expert evidence, he was probably suffering from that disease at least since his admission to Manly Hospital in December 2008. As the disease went untreated it probably steadily worsened over the years. From Const Goodhand’s evidence I find that by April 2011 he was exhibiting the signs of the catatonia which characterised his presentation to Dr Furst in June 2012. By April and May of 2012 his behaviour had become more obviously bizarre; and episodes of strange, inexplicable behaviour more frequent. His apparent restlessness, travelling up and down the northern beaches region of Sydney by bus probably evinces his delusional belief that his mind was being read by the Government and police as part of a war between good and evil in which he was caught up. His attack on Mr Robins was completely random, impulsively spontaneous and brutal. That he persisted with it when an ordinary person would realise he was being watched and that many people were around is evidence of his defective reasoning. His attempted flight is explicable by his delusional beliefs about the police and their part in his “war”; so too his frenzied resistance, which Ms Kratka thought insane. His laughing was probably psychotic, and what was observed of him at the police station catatonic.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of the experts that his stated justifications are the manifestations of a delusional belief system which is symptomatic of paranoid schizophrenia. I am satisfied that at the time he killed Mr Robins, Mr Webber suffered from a disease of the mind giving rise to a defect of reason such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong according to the accepted standards of ordinary members of the community.
	
	
	It follows from this finding that I will, in due course, deliver a special verdict of not guilty of the murder of Luke Aaron Robins by reason of mental illness. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the issue of intention or the alternative defence of substantial impairment.
	
	
	Before proceeding to pronouncing orders, I wish to make some additional comments.
	
	
	I fully appreciate that Mr Robins was an entirely innocent victim of a brutal and frenzied attacked born of a diseased and deluded mind. He did not deserve to die. Although entirely unsuspecting of the danger until he was attacked, he fought his attacker bravely and with great spirit. He was obviously a young man of character. I offer my sincere condolences to his father and other family members who have been in court throughout the trial. I appreciate that my words cannot salve their sorrow, grief and sense of loss.
	
	
	As I said at the outset, a special verdict is not the same as a verdict of not guilty. Mr Webber may not walk free from this court. It is apparent to me from the evidence I have heard that his disease is far from cured, indeed it seems to have been somewhat treatment-resistant given the evidence about the escalation of the treatment he is receiving in his present place of detention.
	
	
	In these circumstances there is not the slightest question of it being appropriate to release Mr Webber into the community. I am not satisfied that he does not present a danger to himself or to others. Accordingly the effect of my verdict will be that Mr Webber will be committed to the long-term supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Pursuant to s 43(a) of the Act, the Tribunal may not release Mr Webber into the community unless and until it is satisfied that he will not seriously endanger any person including himself.

2767317,Mohareb v Palmer (No. 2) [2015] NSWDC 141,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	These are proceedings for defamation commenced by statement of claim filed on 19 August 2014. The procedural history since that time is set out in my judgment Mohareb v Palmer [2015] NSWDC 134.
	
	
	After that judgment was handed down, the parties entered into settlement negotiations which resulted in the execution of a deed of settlement and release as set out below. That deed principally provided for the publication by the defendants of an apology on the Facebook website in which certain of the publications had appeared, in return for which the plaintiff was to discontinue the proceedings and all costs orders would be discharged.
	
	
	As is set out in more detail below, controversy about the publication of that apology led to the plaintiff refusing to discontinue these proceedings and to the defendants filing a notice of motion on 19 May 2015 seeking orders as follows:
	



	
	Declaration that, pursuant to s 73 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), the proceedings 2014/243522 (Proceedings) were compromised or settled between the plaintiff and defendants on the terms contained within a written deed of settlement and release.
	
	
	Order that the Proceedings are dismissed with no order as to costs.
	
	
	Order that all previous costs orders in the Proceedings are vacated.
	
	
	Order that the plaintiff pay the defendants’ costs on an indemnity basis of and occasioned by the motion.
	
	
	Any other such order as the court considers appropriate.
	



	
	The defendants’ application before the court is for orders to give effect to the agreement between the parties arising from the deed and the asserted publication of the apology. The plaintiff says that there is no settlement and he wants to continue the proceedings, although principally in the hope of obtaining a better apology.
	
	
	At the hearing before me on 5 June 2015, the plaintiff cross-examined the first defendant and the defendants’ solicitor, Mr Blundell, as well as calling evidence from the administrator of the website on which the apology was to be published. As a result, proceedings took a whole day and it was necessary for me to obtain the transcript, no transcript of the oral evidence having been ordered by the parties. This has occasioned delay in the handing down of this judgment, but was necessary to ensure that the issues raised by the parties, which were dealt with in a discursive manner by the plaintiff at the hearing, are dealt with in full.
	


The relevant legislation


	
	This court’s jurisdiction to determine disputed issues between the parties as to whether (and on what terms) proceedings have been compromised or settled is set out in s 73 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), which provides:
	


“73 Power of court to determine questions about compromises and settlements

(1) In any proceedings, the court:

(a) has and may exercise jurisdiction to determine any question in dispute between the parties to the proceedings as to whether, and on what terms, the proceedings have been compromised or settled between them, and

(b) may make such orders as it considers appropriate to give effect to any such determination.

(2) This section does not limit the jurisdiction that the court may otherwise have in relation to the determination of any such question.”


	
	In Saltearn v Saltearn [2015] NSWSC 582, McCallum J notes at [7]-[8]:
	


“[7] … There is evidently a schism as between the jurisprudence in England and in this country as to whether, in order to enforce an alleged settlement agreement, new proceedings must be commenced seeking specific performance or whether a settlement agreement may be enforced by an application in the original proceedings. In Australia, the latter course has been approved.

[8] Having regard to the overriding purpose of the Civil Procedure Act and my duty under s 56(2) of the Act to give effect to that purpose when exercising any power under the Act, and having regard to the nature of the claim in these proceedings, I consider it expedient to entertain the defendant's application in the proceedings and to determine the matter in this List.”


	
	I have taken the same approach. I shall first set out the relevant clauses from the deed signed by the parties.
	


The deed signed by the parties


	
	The relevant clauses are:
	


“2 Settlement of the Dispute

2.1 Apology

(a) Within 14 days of the Defendants’ Solicitors, Kennedys, receiving a signed copy of this Deed from the Plaintiff, the Defendants will use their best endeavours to publish an apology on the Scotland Island Community webpage on Facebook in the following terms:

“Apology to Nader Mohareb

Mr and Mrs Palmer understand that Mr Mohareb has suffered hurt and harm as a result of Facebook posts about him, which included a poster which had been displayed around Scotland Island.

Whilst they deny that they posted the original poster, they are very sorry for any harm that the Facebook posts caused him.

It is very regrettable that Mr Mohareb says that he has experienced some vandalism as a result of the above publications and we in no way condone this.”

2.2 Discontinuance of Proceedings

The Plaintiff must effect the discontinuance of the Proceedings within 7 days of the apology referred to at 2.1(a) above first being published by filing a Notice of Discontinuance effecting the discontinuance of the Proceedings with no order as to costs save that all prior costs orders are vacated.

2.3 Costs

The Defendants acknowledge and agree that they will not enforce any costs orders in the Proceedings in their favour against the Plaintiff.

2.4 Consent

The Defendants consents to the discontinuance of the Proceedings and the parties must take all reasonable and necessary steps to effect the discontinuance of the Proceedings against the Defendants as indicated in Clause 2.2.”


	
	The plaintiff in these proceedings was compromising his claim in exchange, in effect, for the vacating of a costs order against him and publication of an apology. Given the serious nature of the imputations, the number of publications and the existence of an assault claim, the publication of this apology was an essential part of any settlement. It should have been a straightforward matter to do so, but it took four attempts to have the apology published over a six week period, four weeks longer than the 14 day period provided for by the deed.
	
	
	A brief outline of those attempts is as follows. The defendants, whose obligation it was to publish the apology, did not have the forethought to contact the administrators of the Scotland Island Community Facebook page beforehand. Without any prior explanation or warning, they simply posted the apology to the Facebook page as a publication to be included on the site. Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances of publication of the matters complained of, the Scotland Island Community Facebook administrators took this apology down, in the same prompt way that they had previously removed the matters complained of.
	
	
	The plaintiff, equally unsurprisingly, complained that the apology has not been published. It was posted a second time, but on this occasion was removed by someone other than the administrators, in circumstances where the relevant administrator, Mr Van Mierlo, has pointed the finger squarely at Mr Palmer.
	
	
	A third attempt was made, but the plaintiff’s name was misspelled and it had to be removed.
	
	
	Despite the absence of the apology on the site, on 15 April 2015 the solicitors for the plaintiff write requiring the plaintiff to sign and file a Notice of Discontinuance by 5 p.m. on 20 April 2015, failing which enforcement proceedings would be commenced. The plaintiff replied that the apology was not published on the Scotland Island Community Facebook page. The defendants’ legal representatives relisted the matter for 23 April 2015 before me. Mr Palmer swore an affidavit on 23 April 2015 which was relied upon at the directions hearing to demonstrate that the reason was the Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderators’ refusal to publish the apology (see Exhibit MP7).
	
	
	On 4 May 2015 the solicitor for the defendants wrote to the plaintiff to advise that the apology had now been lodged. In his written submissions (MFI 1) the plaintiff describes this letter as indicating that Mr Van Mierlo had done this “after having had some persuasion exerted on him” (paragraph 9). That is certainly the impression that I was given in relation to this application. In fact, as Mr Van Mierlo’s correspondence below demonstrates, he was not only willing (after an explanation as to why it had to be posted) to post it, but did so, and the only reason the apology was not on the Facebook page was because someone (identified by Mr Van Mierlo as Mr Palmer, the first defendant) took it down the same day, after being advised of the apology being posted.
	
	
	Next, there was a problem with the spelling of the plaintiff’s name. An apology was not finally lodged until 15 May 2015, but by that stage both parties had retreated to the combative positions which they took in their respective applications. Although lodged after that time, these applications were infected by the mistrust engendered by the putting up and taking down of the apology on these four occasions. A hearing date of 21 May 2015 (later changed by agreement to 5 June 2015) had been allocated on 23 April 2015, at which time the apology in question was not on the Facebook page.
	
	
	The circumstances in which this comedy of errors occurred may be gleaned from the correspondence exchanged between the parties and the Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderators and administrators, which I now set out in detail. I do so because, given the level of indignation about these events on both sides of the bar table, it is important for the full story to be told.
	


The relevant correspondence


	
	The first removal of the apology was made by the Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderators, who had no forewarning that the parties had agreed to this course, and who thought (given the nature of the matters complained of previously posted on their site) that the apology was another case of Mr Palmer, the first defendant, “having a go” at the plaintiff.
	
	
	Mr Palmer wrote to the Facebook page moderators as follows:
	


“Matt Palmer

Mod,

Just for your info. The post I had attempted to post to your wall was part of a court order agreed to by Mr Mohareb, Annette and I.

The order is subject to a confidentiality agreement between the parties, however, I can say that the case hinged upon a poster which we were falsely accused of publishing and which was subsequently posted by a Moderator to the Scotland Island Community Facebook page. (Pixilated)

Mr Mohareb incorrectly accussed Annette and I of posting a copy of the poster to your Facebook wall.

It was because of this that the order was to post the ""Apology"" (drafted by our Barrister and Mr Mohareb) to the Scotland Island Community Facebook page.

Please understand that no one is having a go at anyone with this post and the only reason why it has been ordered to be posted to your wall is because Mr Mohareb argued it was the arena in which he allegedly suffered hurt.

I completely appreciate that you do not wish the page to become a forum for personal attacks or vendettas, however, please understand that the attempts to post the ""Apology"" were not of our initiative or preference.

Annette and I wish nothing more than to put the entire sordid and incredibly expensive experience behind us.

I understand your desire to moderate the site the way that you do, however, I have had to confirm with our Barrister today that I was unsuccessful in my attempts to comply with the order.

At this stage I do not know what the consequences of that may be. It may be necessary to formally serve some order upon you but I'm not sure how this would be possible. It would help if you could advise on whom and to where that order can be served if necessary.

Again please understand that Annette and I were not having a go at anyone, Mr Mohareb requested, and approved the text and regretfully we were required to attempt to post it on your wall - only because this is where Mr Mohareb claimed to be offended.

Yours Sincerely,

Matt Palmer”


	
	The reply from the Scotland Island Community Facebook moderators was as follows:
	


“Scotland Island Community

01/04/2015 20:49

It would have been better if you had contacted us first and informed us about your intention to post this. To a third party this post could read as you having a dig at another person. We are not sure how that can be avoided but perhaps the post could have a preamble that explains this is as a result of a court order. We would allow the post (reluctantly) in that case as there would be no doubt about the intention.”


	
	Mr Palmer’s explanation for failing to notify the Scotland Island Community Facebook moderators was as follows:
	


“Matt Palmer

01/04/2015 23:31

The Deed of Release between the parties specifically precludes any public disclosure of anything other than the apology I am afraid.

The text, and specifically what is included and not included, was carefully worded and phrased by far more expensive and legally qualified minds than either of ours and was strictly regulated by the District Court.

The text and language were deliberately written to ensure that the intent and meaning were not inflammatory - that was the whole point. Similar apologies (without preamble) are printed in the press all the time. I will pass your concerns onto the barristers and the Court involved though.

Sorry if you are offended by not being consulted or briefed, however, as Judge Gibson pointed out your Page is not a closed page, it is in the public domain, It is a ""community"" page and it does allow posts from the public without notice.

In hindsight what would have been less inflammatory and less legally risky would have been to not have uploaded the offending poster on your Facebook Page (thereby broadening the sting to the offended party) or to have passed judgement in a public forum - just saying. It was certainly a concern my barrister had in terms of assigning culpability.

As I have said previously, great pains were taken not to offend, the parties involved agreed to the wording and Mr Mohareb insisted on using your forum.

Regards,

Matt Palmer”


	
	Mr Palmer’s assertion that he was prevented from prior notification because of confidentiality is misconceived. Nor was the content of the apology “strictly regulated by the District Court”; it was agreed to by the parties without any contribution from the court. The implication that the Court and the legal system were responsible for the wording is without basis, and Mr Palmer’s assertion that he would pass on the moderators’ “concerns” to “the barristers and the Court involved” (the inference being that they were responsible for the wording) must have been known by him to be without substance. The Court had no say in the wording and Mr Mohareb was unrepresented at all relevant times.
	
	
	The Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderators were unconvinced:
	


“Scotland Island Community

02/04/2015 07:30

Sorry, we won't allow the post and you will be banned from the page if you attempt to post it again. The page is not public domain, we control who and what we allow on it. If your barrister wants to know more, message his contact details so we can contact him”


	
	Mr Palmer then supplied his legal representatives’ details:
	


“Matt Palmer

02/04/2015 08:39

My Barrister's name is Matthew Lewis, however would you please contact his Associate - Natalie Buck of Kennedy Lawyers on 8215 5999. Natalie leaves on Maternity Leave after today so if you intend on contacting her please do so today.

To be frank I really don't care if you post the apology or not. I have fulfilled my requirement which was to make fair and reasonable attempt to do so.

I've relayed your objection to my counsel, who will in turn advise the court and plaintiff.

I'm advised that I have no further obligation.

Whether the plaintiff seeks to pursue the issue is completely up to him.

Matt Palmer [italics added]”


	
	I have italicised portions of the above letter because this reveals Mr Palmer’s true intentions. He did not care whether the apology was posted or not; he considered that all he had to do was send it to the Scotland Island Community Facebook page, as this was sufficient to comply with his obligations. I infer that, if it was not then published, that was fine with him.
	
	
	However, the Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderators were by now convinced that they should publish, and sent Mr Palmer the following email:
	


“Scotland Island Community

02/04/2015 08:48

In that case we will reinstate your post.”


	
	This appears not to have been welcome news to Mr Palmer because some time between 8:48 a.m. and 10:26 p.m. the post was removed. The Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderators immediately notified Mr Palmer of this and asked if he had done this:
	


“Scotland Island Community

02/04/2015 10:26

We reinstated your second attempt to post. It was visible on the page and it is now gone. We did not remove it, so perhaps you did that. If that is the case, this doesn't make sense in light of what you said above. If someone else reported the post to Facebook and had it removed, we cannot do anything about it.”


	
	The plaintiff also discovered that the apology had been removed, and refused to agree to discontinuance of the proceedings.
	
	
	The defendants’ solicitors continued to press the plaintiff to sign the Notice of Discontinuance. On 15 April 2015, Kennedys sent the following letter to Mr Mohareb:
	


“1. We refer to the above matter, and to the executed deed of settlement signed by you on 31 March 2015.

2. We note that we have tried to contact you by telephone on 13, 14 and 15 April 2015 and left a number of messages for you to contact us. We have received no reply from you as yet.

3. Pursuant to clause 2.1 of the deed, our clients published the apology on 1 April 2015, as evidenced by the documents attached to our email dated 1 April 2015.

4. Pursuant to clause 2.2 of the deed, you must file a Notice of Discontinuance within 7 days of our client’s [sic] publication of the apology, that is, by 8 April 2015. We are informed by the registry that no discontinuance has as yet been filed.

5. We note that the matter is listed for directions before DCJ Gibson on 23 April 2015.

6. We have again enclosed a Notice of Discontinuance for your signature. Please complete the notice and send it back to us by 5:00pm on Monday 20 April 2015 for us to file.

7. If you do not comply with your obligations as set out in clause 2.2 of deed [sic], we anticipate instructions to take steps to enforce compliance with the deed without further notice to you.

8. Should we need to take any such steps, we reserve our clients’ position in relation to relying on this letter on the question of indemnity costs.”


	
	Mr Mohareb replied as follows on 20 April 2015:
	


“Dear Sir,

This is further to your email and letter below and to indicate that up to writing of this email, your clients had not fulfilled their obligation to provide an apology as per the Deed.

Accordingly and until this happens, I am under no obligation to sign or issue any discontinuance notices.

In the mean time, I look forward to seeing you in Court at 2pm on Thursday 23rd April 2015.

Regards,

Nader Mohareb”


	
	The defendants’ solicitors raised this letter with their client. On 23 April 2015, Mr Palmer sent the following email to his solicitor, Mr Blundell:
	


“Jake,

The general consensus seems to be that a gentleman by the name of Hubert Van Mierlo is the moderator of the Scotland Island Community page.

By coincidence the solicitor who was initially acting for me, Rachel Carter of GP Legal, sits on a Residents community with Mr Van Mierlo.

Rachel is also of the belief that Mr Mierlo is the moderator of the Scotland Island Community Facebook page, and has agreed to approach Mr Van Mierlo with a view to asking him to contact you.

Mr Van Mierlo has denied in the past being the moderator, I do not know why, however Rachel and I hope that if he is made to understand the seriousness of the situation he will substantiate to you the facts surrounding the posting of the apology, as I have related them to you.

Rachel Carter of GP Legal or Mr Van Mierlo may contact you shortly.

Regards

Matter Palmer”


	
	The contents of this letter are clearly at odds with the emails sent by the Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderator (now identified as Mr Van Mierlo). In fact the moderator had agreed to publish, but the apology had been mysteriously removed the same day, and the moderator had not only notified Mr Palmer, but suggested that Mr Palmer was responsible for the removal.
	
	
	Mr Palmer never replied to the moderator’s email suggesting he was the culprit but, following his correspondence with Mr Blundell, sent the following Facebook message to Mr Van Mierlo:
	


“Matt Palmer

23/04/2015 19:50

Hubert, would you please contact my Solicitor, Jake Blundell, of Kennedys Law on (02) 8215 5967(02) 8215 5967. Thank You”


	
	Mr Palmer’s explanation of these events in his affidavit is that the administrators of the website wanted to remain anonymous:
	


“11. At or around 11:50 am on 28 April 2015 I had a further telephone conversation with Ms Carter in which Ms Carter said words to the following effect:

I have spoken to the person who identified himself as the administrator of the Facebook page, but they don’t want to be identified. They said they are aware of this matter. They want someone to write to them via Facebook Private Message, explaining that the apology is necessary as part of the settlement and giving the words of the apology, and then they’ll allow it.”

(Paragraph 11 of the Affidavit of William Jake Blundell affirmed 21 May 2015)


	
	I am satisfied that at all relevant times the moderator was in fact Mr Van Mierlo and that he had never sought to cloak himself with anonymity or refused to communicate with any party in this litigation.
	
	
	Mr Van Mierlo was called as a witness. He produced additional communications between himself and Mr Blundell to the court (Exhibit 2), for the period from 28 April 2015 to 14 May 2015, which give greater insight into when and in what circumstances the apology was taken off the website:

CONFIDENTIAL

To the administrator of the Scotland Island Community Facebook page.

My name is Jake Blundell, I am a lawyer with Kennedys.

We act for Matthew and Annette Palmer in relation to the District Court of NSW defamation proceedings commenced by Nader Mohareb (case no. 2014/243522).

These proceedings have settled on terms satisfactory to both parties. For those reasons an apology was published by Mr Palmer on the Scotland Island Community Facebook page on 1 and 2 April 2015. Both apologies were deleted by the administrator of the Facebook page.

By reason of the abovementioned settlement the parties require the apology to be published on your website.

Please advise in writing as to:

a) whether you will allow that apology to be published on the Scotland Island Community Facebook page by Matthew Palmer;

b) If not why not; and

c) if so, the proposed length of time you would allow the apology to be published?

Whilst we cannot currently communicate to you the form of the apology because [sic] do so may breach the settlement deed. we [sic] note that it has previously been published on the Scotland Island Community Facebook page twice and will be in the same form.

If the form of the apology breaches any policy of the Scotland Island Community Facebook page and/or Facebook, and the post has to be deleted for some currently unknown reason, we would be grateful if you would please inform us as soon as practicable or possible, setting out the reasons for the deletion.

If you would like us to provide the form of the apology to you again, this will require the plaintiff’s written consent, which may take some time to obtain.

Unfortunately, these proceedings have obviously been costly to both parties in more ways than one. It is therefore hoped that no further steps will have to be taken by either party, which will further increase that cost and inconvenience for all involved. Subject to any objection by the Scotland Island Community Facebook page administrator, the best way forward for all involved would be to allow the apology to be published.

Please do not hesitate to contact me on 02 8215 5967 if you have any queries or if you would like to discuss further.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Jake Blundell

As we know the reasons behind it, we will not remove an apology by MrPalmer posted on this page, with the understanding that this apology willbe in the same form as the messages posted on 1 and 2 April as peryour confirmation above. We know the form (The first post is still intact and is hidden from public view) as it can be accessed via the administration panel.

However, it is important to understand that we do not control what is posted or removed. Removal can be done by Mr Palmer without our consent. The post can also be reported to Facebook and removed by Facebook.

We have no view on the length of time the apology can be displayed, it would be good to understand whether there is a requirement as part of the settlement.

For the record, on 2 April, we re-instated the second post with the apology made by Mr Palmer. We did this after Mr Palmer explained the reasons. The post was subsequently removed. There is no way for us to know who deleted it, but it is likely Mr Palmer who did so. We informed Mr Palmer via Facebook message.

Regards,

SIC Admins”


	
	I have italicised the three last paragraphs as these contain information about which this witness was not cross-examined, namely his explanation as to who could remove the post without the administrators’ consent (namely Facebook itself, if a request was made) and Mr Palmer himself. There is no evidence that any request was made to Facebook to remove the post. The plaintiff’s case is that the person who did so must, therefore, be Mr Palmer.
	
	
	The next email produces by Mr Van Mierlo explains why, having been lodged a third time, the apology had to be removed because the plaintiff’s name (obviously an important part of the apology) had been misspelled:
	


“Jake Blundell

Dear SIC Admins

As you know my firm Kennedys act for Mr and Mrs Palmer. I refer to the apology to Mr Mohareb posted by Mr Matthew Palmer on the SIC page on 1 May 2015.

It has been brought to our attention that Mr Palmer inadvertently misspelt Mr Mohareb’s name in that post, and appears unable to correct the spelling.

We respectfully request, if you have the ability to amend such posts, that you amend the spelling of Mr Mohareb’s name from “Nador” to “Nader”.

Alternatively, if you cannot make such amendments, we request that you please allow Mr Palmer to remove the original apology and replace it an apology in the same terms, but with Mr Mohareb’s name correctly spelt.

Please contact me if you have any queries or would like to discuss further.

Hi Jake,

Facebook restrictions do not allow us to edit posts of others, only to remove them. Mr Palmer, however, may be able to make edits and if not, he can delete the post and post a new one.”


	
	Mr Van Mierlo, in his evidence, further explained his reasons for the apology having been taken down when initially posted. First of all, the matters complained of had been taken down from the site because of their content and this had created concern:
	


“Q. The post was taken down, you said, ""Sorry, we won't allow the post and you will be banned from the page if you attempt to post it again"". Can you explain to me what your policies are about posts? Have you had trouble before in general or in particular?

A. Yeah, well it's, it's a community page and it's, you know, people, people post there if their cat is lost or, you know, they look for a babysitter, that kind of stuff, and sometimes there are, you know, some issues of the community that are posted. Yeah, that's - the policy is it's by the community, for the community, and we just don't want any personal conflicts or any vexatious or any, you know, nasty stuff on there. So that's the policy. And when we say that page of, or the post of Mr Palmer with the apology, without any information given to us about it, it looked like another, you know, some kind of personal conflict and that's why we removed it.

Q. I see. I think you also took down some posters or some information about Mr Mohareb sometime beforehand didn't you, or was that you personally?

A. That was a year before, yeah.

Q. Were you involved in that?

A. Well I know about it, yes, and yeah those were taken off quite quickly I think, within minutes of them being posted.

Q. Was there a reason for that?

A. They were personal attacks on Mr Mohareb.” (T 61-62)


	
	Not having been contacted about the publication of any proposed apology, Mr Van Mierlo and his colleagues took the view that this apology was “having a dig” at Mr Mohareb as he told the plaintiff during his examination in chief:
	


“WITNESS: I meant you, it was a dig at you. That's why I took it off. We thought it was a dig at you.” (T 63)


	
	It was Mr Van Mierlo who reinstated the post after communication from the defendants’ legal representatives (T 59). He was asked at T 60:
	


“Q. Mr Palmer has put an affidavit on 23 April indicating to Court that you had refused to allow him to, to, to post that apology on the Facebook page. How, how, you know, based on what you answered the question before, I'm assuming that you disagree with, with, with that statement from -

A. I, I don't have any opinion about that. I only know that I have communicated with Mr Palmer and I've got it in writing here if you want to see it. It's all I really can contribute to you.”


	
	Mr Van Mierlo was not asked, in the course of Mr Lewis’ brief cross-examination (T 67-68), about whether he, or any other administrator to his knowledge, had removed the post on the second occasion, this second time being the crucial issue in the chronology of events. As is clear from Mr Van Mierlo’s emails, the only other person who could have taken this posting down would be Facebook itself, which I am not satisfied occurred, or Mr Palmer. All of the evidence points to Mr Palmer having done this, although he denied it when cross-examined by the plaintiff.
	


Subsequent correspondence between the parties


	
	On 4 May 2015, Kennedys sent the following email to Mr Mohareb:
	


“1. We refer to the above matter, and to the executed deed of settlement signed by you on 31 March 2015.

2. Following the directions hearing on 23 April 2015, we have communicated to the administrator of the Scotland Island Community Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/ScotlandIslandCommunity (SIC Facebook page) that the apology, in the form set out in the deed of settlement (Apology), should be published.

3. Based on that communication, the administrator has allowed the Apology to be published on the SIC Facebook page.

4. Matthew Palmer has subsequently published the Apology on the SIC Facebook page on 1 May 2015 on behalf of the defendants. As at the date of this letter the Apology remains visible on the SIC Facebook page. See the attached screenshots of the SIC Facebook page dated 1 and 4 May 2015.

5. The defendants have unequivocally satisfied their obligations under the settlement deed, and did so in any event on 1 April 2015.

6. You should now file the Notice of Discontinuance in the form attached to this letter.

7. Should you fail to file the notice of discontinuance within 7 days of the date of this letter, please communicate in writing your reasons for not doing so at your earliest convenience.

8. In the event that our clients have to appear again before her Honour, our clients will seek their costs of the last occasion (currently reserved) and of the hearing on 21 May 2015.”


	
	The plaintiff responded with four objections, one of which was the wrong spelling of his name, which the solicitor for the defendants accepted should be corrected (the other three objections were about the paragraphing, a request to include his photo and for an apology from Mrs Palmer, the other defendant. The defendants did not agree with these three objections). He also challenged the claim that Mr Van Mierlo’s refusal to publish had been the problem and accused Mr Palmer of making false statements on oath.
	
	
	This triggered the filing of the defendant’s notice of motion, which was served on 20 May 2015. On 21 May 2015, I set the matter down for hearing.
	


The hearing on 5 June 2015


	
	The hearing lasted for the whole day and included extensive oral evidence and cross-examination. The plaintiff cross-examined the first defendant and Mr Blundell. Mr Van Mierlo was called by the plaintiff to give evidence. The plaintiff’s oral submissions occupied the whole of the afternoon.
	
	
	The principal difficulty with the plaintiff’s application is that he remained coy about what he said should happen to the application if he was successful. It emerged that an additional purpose to the obtaining of a better apology was not to continue with the defamation but to seek to have the first defendant prosecuted for perjury. That application is dealt with at the end of this judgment.
	


The relevant principles


	
	The defendants submit that the Deed of Release falls within the second class of case foreshadowed in Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353 at [360]. That is, all parties completely agreed upon the terms of their bargain and intended no departure from, or in addition to, that which their agreed terms set out in the Deed of Release express or imply, but nevertheless have made performance of clause 2 of the Deed of Release (the resolution of the proceedings, conditional upon the Apology being published fourteen days thereafter). This was not “an agreement in principle” case. The preamble to the Deed of Release uses the following express language:
	


“The Plaintiff and the Defendants have agreed without any admissions to settle the Dispute on the terms set out in this Deed.”


	
	The defendants submit that the surrounding circumstances of the parties’ agreement are directly probative of their contractual intention. In particular, consistent with clause 2 of the Deed of Release, the defendants claim that they published the Apology on the same day as the plaintiff executed his counterpart copy of the Deed of Release. Likewise, on the same day it became apparent that the first Apology had been deleted, the defendants published the second Apology. The defendants do not, however, assert that the third or fourth apologies amount to compliance with the 14-day publication clause.
	
	
	The plaintiff does not deny that he was obliged to file a Notice of Discontinuance after the Apology has been published. He says that he signed the Deed of Release expecting the apology to be published, and that this did not occur. Although Mr Van Mierlo was blamed by the defendants, it was clear to him that the Apology had been reposted by Mr Van Mierlo and shortly afterwards removed from the site. The plaintiff submits that I should accept Mr Van Mierlo’s evidence that this was not done by anyone connected with the Scotland Island Community Facebook page, and that the only other person who could have done so was Mr Palmer.
	


Conclusions concerning the evidence


	
	It is clear that:
	



	
	The parties reached a concluded agreement arising out of the Deed of Release which provided, as its central feature, for the publication of an apology and the vacating of costs orders;
	
	
	The parties considered themselves bound by the terms of that deed, in which the terms were conditional upon the Apology being published “within 14 days of the Defendants’ Solicitors, Kennedys, receiving a signed copy of the Deed from the Plaintiff” (paragraph 2.1);
	
	
	The plaintiff signed the Deed and returned it, but the Apology was taken down by the Scotland Island Community Facebook page moderator, Mr Van Mierlo who, after explanatory emails from Mr Palmer, republished it and told Mr Palmer he had done so. However, later that same day, the Apology was removed a second time, in circumstances where I am comfortably satisfied that this was done by Mr Palmer;
	
	
	At the time of this application being listed for hearing (23 April 2015) the Apology was still not on the website, and the 14 day period referred to in the deed had expired without the Apology being published.
	



	
	However, it is also clear from the parties’ submissions that they wish to achieve some form of settlement which includes the vacating of costs orders and a very similar apology (the sticking points for the plaintiff seem to be his photograph, the paragraphing and a second apology from Mrs Palmer).
	
	
	The issue is whether, in these circumstances, there is in fact a concluded agreement pursuant to s 73 and, if not, whether this litigation can be resolved on some other basis, given that the apology in question has now been published.
	


Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353


	
	The decision of Young J in Summertime Holdings Pty Ltd v Environmental Defender’s Office Ltd [1998] 45 NSWLR 291 helpfully sets out the classes of contracts, and the case is of particular assistance here, as Young J was considering a very similar set of facts, namely an agreement to settle defamation proceedings where one party had subsequently refused to publish the agreed apology. Young J summarised the relevant principles as follows:
	


“As is well known, the seminal case of Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353, as augmented by the decision of McLelland J in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v GR Securities Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 622 and the Court of Appeal in GR Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631, shows that there are four classes of cases where parties have apparently agreed on all the terms of their bargain, but contemplate some further document. The first class is where the parties intend to be immediately bound despite that their terms will be restated in a fuller or more precise form. Secondly, they may have made a final agreement but made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document. Thirdly, they may have intended that there was no contract at all between them until the formal contract was entered into. Fourthly, they may have intended to be bound immediately whilst expecting to make a further contract in substitution for the first contract containing, by consent, additional terms.

It is always a very difficult question of fact to work out in any given set of circumstances into which of these four classes the parties intended their deal to fall. Most of the cases in this area are vendor and purchaser situations in which the courts have evolved a series of guidelines. One of the principal guidelines is that contracts for the sale of land are usually expected to be by formal document duly exchanged and that courts have difficulty in accepting that a person who is about to buy or sell valuable real estate for a large sum of money would wish to be bound unless there was a formal contract. The amount of money involved is also relevant as is the fact that one or other party may be a statutory authority. However, none of these guidelines can be used in the instant case to define the parties' intentions.”


	
	The first issue is whether publication of the apology, when restored to the site but taken down later that same day by Mr Palmer, is sufficient to trigger compliance with the Deed.
	
	
	It is common for terms of settlement to provide for an apology to be published over a specific time frame, and that time frame is generally a vital part of the settlement. The attraction of a prompt apology in defamation is often referred to in discussion of damages awards. In the present case, I am satisfied that the apology in question had to be published on the Facebook page within 14 days and that, in common with other Facebook pages, would remain there, slowly being overtaken by more recent postings, but nevertheless there if searched for. An apology placed on the site for a few hours could not comply with such requirements. That means that no apology was published within 14 days of the signed deed of release being received, as the later attempts to lodge an apology fall outside that period.
	
	
	In those circumstances, whether or not the defendants are correct in asserting that this is agreement falls within the second class, there has been non-compliance with the principal condition upon which this clause in the deed was predicated, namely publication of the apology within 14 days of the signed deed being forwarded. In those circumstances, the defendants have failed to discharge their obligations under the settlement.
	
	
	Mr Lewis did not address me on whether, in terms of the deed, the publication of the apology on or about 15 May in its current form (about 6 weeks after the signed deed was sent) amounted to compliance with the deed’s 14-day period. In the absence of submissions on this point, I cannot determine this question, particularly in circumstances where the plaintiff is a litigant in person and has not been given an opportunity to reply.
	
	
	Are there, however, other bases upon which these proceedings may be dismissed? If the parties are simply arguing about the satisfactory nature of an apology which has, albeit belatedly, been published, what is the utility of these proceedings continuing? Are there other provisions under the Civil Procedure Act 2015 (NSW) which, in the event of s 73 not being applicable, can resolve this situation and release the parties from this expensive and (given the publication of the apology) largely resolved proceedings? 
	


Other bases for the dismissal of the proceedings


	
	The question of what alternatives a party may have where defamation proceedings are settled but the opponent has failed to publish the apology as part of that settlement was first considered by Young J in Summertime Holdings Pty Ltd v Environmental Defender’s Office Ltd :
	


“A court hearing an action in defamation cannot order a defendant to give an apology. All that the court can do is to order damages if it finds the defendant liable, though it can take into account the fact that an apology has been given when assessing the damages. The general pattern of the law is that an action for damages for defamation is the only remedy available to a person who has been defamed; see eg Sattin v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1996) 39 NSWLR 32.

Both Mr Blackburn and I looked to see if there was any precedent in the Court of Star Chamber, where our law of defamation originated, which Court had power to punish and grant injunctions and, although it denied that it had this power, on many occasions granted damages. I have not been able to find any case where the Star Chamber granted an injunction against a defamation or made an order akin to specific performance to compel someone to say something in atonement of the defamatory statement. Indeed, it would seem that the Court of Star Chamber only granted injunctions like common injunctions to restrain proceedings at law; see Holdsworth, History of English Law (1937, Methuen & Co, London) 2nd ed Volume 5 p205 and following. It would appear from Fifoot's History and Sources of the Common Law Tort and Contract (1949, Stevens & Co, London) p126 and following, that the spiritual courts were only interested in defamations which dealt with spiritual matters such as where the defendant was called a heretic or adulterer and did not concern themselves with any other case. Essentially, the Star Chamber and the spiritual courts would punish defamations in appropriate cases and the common law courts would give damages, but neither granted injunctions nor made orders in the nature of specific performance.”


	
	Young J went on to note the absence of authority on this issue:
	


“Mr Wheelhouse's closest attempt to find a case analogous to the present was to refer me to the decision in Barrow v Chapel & Company Ltd [1976] RPC 355. There, the parties agreed to publish a musical work and the Publisher then reneged. Danckwerts J granted an order that the musical work be published on the basis that damages for failure to publish would be difficult to assess and not be an adequate remedy. The case is of some assistance, but obviously it is in a completely different area of the law.

Even though there is no Australian law which governs freedom of speech in the same way as the Constitution of the United States of America, I consider that it needs to be an exceptional case before the courts should exercise their discretion to grant an order like specific performance to compel a person to give an apology. I appreciate that in the instant case the form of the apology had, with slight exception, been settled, and that the first three defendants were contractually obliged to give it, but it still seems to me that I should not, in the absence of some special reason, compel the defendants to utter the words.”


	
	Young J resolved the issue by awarding a small sum for damages instead:
	


“What are the damages for failing to do so? Mr Wheelhouse, of course, says that it is virtually impossible to compute these and that is why he wanted a mandatory order. However, if a court has to try a case of damages, then it just has to do the best it can so far as quantum is concerned on the material before it.

Mr Blackburn says that there is no evidence of any damage suffered by the plaintiffs and there is no evidence of their reputation. There is just insufficient material to be able to assess damages and so any damages should be nominal. Mr Wheelhouse says that people come into defamation proceedings with their reputation intact and it is a matter of forensic choice for the defendant to either attack that reputation and so perhaps exacerbate the damages or concede it. Here he says there has been no attack on the plaintiffs' character at all and I must assume that their reputations are solid. I believe I should approach the matter on this basis.

My view is that as a tribunal of fact in assessing the damages I am virtually my own jury and can take into account that the plaintiffs have given up what they consider to be a valid claim for defamation about an upsetting incident in which the defendants have promised an apology and then reneged. I do not think, however, that I should take into account factors that may well exacerbate a jury verdict in a defamation case such as the fact that the plaintiff should have been able to rely on the fact that the second and third defendants were solicitors of this court and hence people whose word should have been able to be trusted and that the first defendant is also a body which purports to be highly principled. The damages must be the value of the apology or the lack of it.”


	
	Young J quantified the sum as follows:
	


“I do not really see how any comparable damages cases could assist me nor have I looked at any, assuming they exist. I believe that the damages are more than nominal, but they are certainly not in the high range. Doing the best I can, I find that the first, second and third defendants should jointly and severally pay the plaintiffs $10,000.

If this were a common law claim, there should be no order for costs because the damages are too low for this court's ordinary jurisdiction. However, in view of the fact that the case was properly brought for an order for specific performance, the defendants, other than the fourth defendant which submitted, should pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings.”


	
	Although I drew this decision to the attention of the plaintiff, and he acknowledges it in his written submissions (MFI 1), he did not make any submissions to the effect that a sum of damages representing an apology could be awarded. I cannot therefore resolve the issue of additional loss from the inadequate and/or late publication of the apology by any award of damages.
	
	
	The plaintiff is the party who insisted on publication of the apology on the Facebook page. His submission was that the whole point of this apology was that it would be made to the members of the Scotland Island Community who participated in the Facebook page to which publications made by Mr and Mrs Palmer had been made. Social media is an evanescent medium, and one in which time is of the essence. This was why the agreement would not be final if the apology in question was not published within the time framework envisaged by the deed.
	
	
	The fact of the matter remains that the apology has now been on the website for some months, in circumstances where the opportunity of Facebook page readers to see its contents has now occurred. What is the point of the continued prosecution of this defamation claim by the plaintiff? He has finally obtained what he wanted, namely publication of an apology on the Scotland Island Community Facebook page, and while he may not be satisfied with the paragraphing or visibility of that apology, these are matters to which he should have given attention prior to entering into the agreement, and not at this late stage.
	
	
	It was for this reason that I drew the attention of the parties to the proportionality principle, most recently helpfully discussed in Saltearn v Saltearn at [16], a case very similar to the present in terms of factual matters. Faced with a litigant in person who submitted that there was no concluded agreement of his defamation proceedings, McCallum J took into account, when determining whether to exercise her discretion in relation to s 73 issues, the principles considered by her Honour in Bleyer v Google Inc (2014) 311 ALR 529. Although the publication in those proceedings was entirely different in nature, the same principles would be applied here because the parties have agreed upon an apology capable of finalising the whole litigation, in circumstances not dissimilar to Freeburn v Cake Decorators Association (NSW) Inc (No 2) (2014) 19 DCLR (NSW) 232.
	
	
	Accordingly, in those circumstances, it would be appropriate to have regard to those principles when considering whether or not the proceedings had in fact settled, and whether or not the proceedings should be dismissed. Although in Saltearn v Saltearn her Honour was satisfied that there was a concluded agreement, whereas I am not satisfied that the defendants complied with their end of the bargain in the timeframe allotted, the result is the same: the nature of the issues of reputation loss is so reduced by the publication of the apology as to warrant the exercise of discretion to dismiss the proceedings under s 73 (as McCallum J did) or under the proportionality principle as encapsulated in s 61 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	In those circumstances, despite the defendants having failed to publish the apology within the time frame envisaged by the deed, their subsequent publication of the apology is, taking the proportionality principles into account, sufficient basis to warrant the proceedings being dismissed.
	


Costs of the motion


	
	The defendants seek a lump sum costs order pursuant to s 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and rely upon the affidavit of Mr William Jake Blundell of 4 June 2015 identifying those costs as $14,721, 90% of which it is asserted would be recovered on an indemnity basis (affidavit, paragraph 14 – in oral submissions, it was put that this figure would be more likely to be 80%). That figure represents costs up to the date of swearing the affidavit (4 June 2015), as well as counsel’s fees for the same period, but does not include hearing costs.
	
	
	It is not necessary for me to review the circumstances in which lump sum costs are awarded, as I am satisfied that the defendants are not entitled to claim costs at all. The circumstances in which the moderators removed the apology on the first occasion of its being taken down because of lack of prior notice were entirely foreseeable by the defendants. I agree with Mr Van Mierlo’s comments that the Scotland Island Community Facebook page administrators should have been contacted by the defendants to ensure that the apology in question was published. Additionally, I am comfortably satisfied that the apology was removed the second time by Mr Palmer himself and that his failure to reinstate the apology when the plaintiff complained is a relevant factor to take into account when determining costs issues. The apology had to be removed a third time because the plaintiff’s name was misspelled.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that the defendants should not be awarded costs on an indemnity (or on any other) basis, up to the hearing of this application on 5 June 2015. The defendants’ failure to perform their part of the bargain made the plaintiff justifiably suspicious. Unfortunately as a result, the plaintiff began to seek to impose conditions of his own which fell outside of the agreement, such as a request to publish his photograph and his complaint about the paragraphing of the apology, but in the context of the defendants’ conduct, this is an understandable reaction.
	
	
	I have additionally had regard to the decision of Sanders v Constantine [2006] NSWSC 534 where White J stated:
	


“[6] The prospect that the parties would incur further substantial costs in order to resolve a question of costs is appalling. It is contrary to the obligations of the parties to further the overriding purpose of the Act of ensuring that issues in the proceedings are resolved justly, quickly and cheaply. By this time the issue in the proceedings had been resolved as a result of the mediation.

[7] The principles in relation to the exercise of the court's power to order costs where the proceeding has not been determined on its merits and there has been no capitulation by one party or the other is well established. As McHugh J said in Re The Minister For Immigration And Ethnic Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Lai Qin (1987) 186 CLR 621 at 624–625:

“Ordinarily, the power is exercised after a hearing on the merits and as a general rule the successful party is entitled to his or her costs. Success in the action or on particular issues is the fact that usually controls the exercise of the discretion… when there has been no hearing on the merits, however, a court is necessarily deprived of the factor that usually determines whether or how it will make a costs order.

In an appropriate case, a court will make an order for costs even when there has been no hearing on the merits and the moving party no longer wishes to proceed with the action. The court cannot try a hypothetical action between the parties. To do so would burden the parties with the costs … they had avoided. In some cases, however, the court may be able to conclude that one of the parties has acted so unreasonably that the other party should obtain the costs of the action…

Moreover, in some cases a judge may feel confident that, although both parties have acted reasonably, one party was almost certain to have succeeded if the matter had been fully tried … But such cases are likely to be rare.

If it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties continued to be reasonable … will usually mean that the court will make no order as to the cost of the proceedings. This approach has been adopted in a large number of cases.””


	
	Those factors are relevant here. These were serious defamations and I am satisfied, from the content of the Facebook page, that the Facebook publications were made by the defendants in circumstances where they appear to condone or authorise the earlier posters, whether they were the authors of those posters or not. The settlement of these proceedings on the basis of publication of an apology and vacating of the costs orders was an outstandingly good one from their point of view and is no doubt due to the considerable ability of their legal advisers. That makes the defendants’ failure to ensure that they kept to the terms of this wise settlement so much the more regrettable.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that notwithstanding the fact that I have made the orders similar to those sought by the defendants in relation to their application under s 73, the belated and unsatisfactory compliance by the defendants with their obligations under the deed and the less than frank correspondence between Mr Palmer and Mr Van Mierlo mean that the defendants should be deprived of any entitlement to costs of their motion.
	
	
	It is unclear whether the plaintiff is seeking reimbursement of any of the expenses he incurred (such as expenses relating to the calling of Mr Van Mierlo to give evidence). His submissions were discursive and at times difficult to follow.
	
	
	I do not consider that he is entitled to these costs. Mr Van Mierlo’s oral evidence was consistent with his emails and added little to these proceedings. I have accordingly included, in my orders, my finding that no provision for any disbursements of this nature should be made.
	
	
	However, the defendants should be entitled to their costs in relation to one part of the proceedings, namely the plaintiff’s notice of motion for leave to prosecute the first defendant for perjury which was filed on 29 May 2015.
	


The plaintiff’s notice of motion


	
	On 29 May 2015 the plaintiff filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the court grant him leave to prosecute the first defendant for perjury pursuant to s 338(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The precise acts of perjury are identified by the plaintiff as follows:
	


“I have firm and irrefutable evidence that in his affidavit of 23 April 2015, Mr Matthew Palmer made false statement(s) on oath concerning a matter which is material to the proceedings, knowing the statement(s) to be false as well as not believing it to be true.”


	
	The plaintiff has complained in correspondence about perjury. In his letter of 15 May 2015, the plaintiff stated that the administrator denied having initially refused to allow publication of the apology, and that the first defendant’s statements to the contrary were “false assertions under oath”, which was “a criminal offence”.
	
	
	In fact this is what occurred and this allegation is without foundation.
	
	
	Mr Mohareb was unable to identify with precision what evidence given by the first defendant today was perjury.
	
	
	It is hard to imagine circumstances in which a judicial officer would grant leave to a plaintiff to prosecute a defendant for perjury. Prosecutions of this kind, even by the appropriate prosecuting authority, are confined to the clearest of cases. In Moss v McIlveen [2011] NSWCA 77, Whealy JA, with whom Handley AJA agreed, explained the requisite elements a plaintiff must prove in prosecuting a claim for perjury:
	


“18. In my opinion, however, the primary judge examined each of the areas of contention very carefully and concisely. He was not satisfied that there was a real prospect of any of the alleged lies being established as such beyond reasonable doubt. It needs to be borne in mind that in a prosecution for perjury, a very serious criminal charge, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following ingredients. First, that a statement has been made on oath. Secondly, that it has been made on oath in judicial proceedings. Thirdly, that the statement is false and fourthly, that it was made by the person to be charged, knowing that the statement was false or not believing it to be true.

19. Finally, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the false statement concerned a matter that was material to the proceedings, that is, it must be practically relevant to the proceedings. Matters going to credit can, of course, in certain situations be practically relevant to the proceedings. In addition to the proof of each of these essential ingredients beyond reasonable doubt, there needs to be corroboration. This means that to support a conviction of perjury there must be evidence which proves the falsity of the statement by at least two witnesses or by one witness who is corroborated. Thus it can be seen that a prosecution for perjury is not only a serious matter, it is quite difficult to prove the charge to the requisite standard. When regard is had to the need to prove each of the ingredients I have mentioned to sustain a conviction for perjury, it is clear that the applicant has failed to demonstrate in the present application that he has any reasonable prospects of success in the proposed prosecution.”


	
	In the present case, the sole piece of evidence identified in correspondence is not perjured evidence, but a correct statement of the facts.
	
	
	Applications of this kind by litigants in civil proceedings are intimidatory in nature and have the potential to create injustice. I have forwarded a copy of this judgment to the NSW Attorney-General, with a recommendation that s 338(1)(c) be amended to remove or limit the right of a litigant to seek the leave of the court to prosecute his or her opponent for perjury. These are matters best left to the appropriate prosecuting authority.
	
	
	Given the lack of evidence in the supporting affidavit and the plaintiff’s failure to delineate additional “perjury” in this application, the motion should be dismissed with costs. Those costs should be assessable on an indemnity basis, to reflect the hopelessness of such an application.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant to s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), these proceedings are dismissed and all previous costs orders are vacated.
	
	
	Defendants’ notice of motion filed on 19 May 2015 (for orders pursuant to s 73 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)) dismissed with no order as to costs.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s notice of motion of 29 May 2015 (seeking leave to prosecute the first defendant for perjury pursuant to s 338(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) is dismissed.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to pay the defendants’ costs in relation to his notice of motion of 29 May 2015 on an indemnity basis.
	
	
	The defendants’ application for a lump sum costs order (pursuant to s 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)) is dismissed, as is any application by the plaintiff for reimbursement of any disbursement to which he may be entitled as a litigant in person.

		10 August 2015",2015-07-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767326,AG v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWCA 218,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 15 November 2013, Magistrate Denes, at Lismore Local Court, found the applicant guilty of four counts of aggravated indecency; three involving his step-daughter, GL and one involving his step-granddaughter, SD. The magistrate’s determination turned entirely upon acceptance beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of the complainants. The applicant was sentenced on 24 January 2014; on that day he appealed from the convictions and the severity of the sentence. On 25 September 2014, the District Court judge, Whitford DCJ, set aside the conviction on one charge (in relation to which the applicant provided alibi evidence) but dismissed the appeal with respect to the other three charges. (The sentence appeal remains outstanding.) On 13 November 2014, the applicant sought to review the judgment of the District Court and have the remaining convictions quashed pursuant to the supervisory jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). The applicant alleged that the primary judge misapprehended the extent of his jurisdiction under s 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“Appeal and Review Act”) and failed to form his own view of the matter; the judge thus fell into jurisdictional error.

The Court (Basten JA, Simpson JA and Sackville AJA) held, dismissing the summons.

(per Basten JA; Simpson JA and Sackville AJA agreeing)

1.   The conviction appeal from the Local Court to the District Court is by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings unless fresh evidence is adduced in circumstances provided by the Appeal and Review Act. Further, the District Court judge is bound to observe the “natural limitations” where the appeal is conducted by reference to a documentary record: [5].

Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), ss 11, 18, 19.

2.   The primary judge, after setting out the background of the charges and convictions, proceeded to address errors which the applicant alleged were committed by the magistrate: [42], [104]. Having identified error in the manner the magistrate dealt with the charge in relation to which the applicant offered alibi evidence, the primary judge set aside that conviction: [44], [70]-[71]. As for the other challenges, the primary judge considered the material before him, conscious of the “natural limitations” resulting from not seeing or hearing the witnesses including the complainants (being cross-examined) and the applicant: [46], [105]. Nothing in this approach was indicative of any failure to carry out appellate function. To the contrary, the approach adopted demonstrated that the primary judge understood what was required of him by s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act and the relevant authorities: [47], [106].

Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 referred to.

3.   The applicant’s specific submission that the primary judge failed to consider or overlooked the fact that the magistrate did not properly consider the applicant’s evidence and thus fell into jurisdictional error cannot be accepted. The primary judge made a specific finding that, despite the lack of express observations justifying the rejection of the applicant’s evidence, the entirety of the magistrate’s approach demonstrated consciousness that she had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainants’ evidence, otherwise she would have to acquit the applicant: [114]-[115].

Comments by two members of the Court as to the nature of the appeal by way of rehearing under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act:

(per Basten JA)

4.   The statement in Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137; 65 NSWLR 539 at [39] that the powers of the District Court on an appeal under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act are “not dependent upon finding of error at the original trial” is not consistent with recent authorities of this and other courts suggesting that appellant must demonstrate some legal, factual or discretionary error for the appeal to succeed: [9], [12].

Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40, 203 CLR 172; Dyason v Butterworth [2015] NSWCA 52; Mulder v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2015] NSWCA 92 referred to.

5.   The term “error”, however, has no precise meaning; it requires the appellate judge to be satisfied that the judgement under appeal is wrong and should be corrected. How that satisfaction is achieved will depend on a range of factors relevant to specific cases: [34].

Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833; 117 FCR 424; Costa v The Public Trustee of NSW [2008] NSWCA 223; 1 ASTLR 56 referred to.

(per Simpson JA)

6.   Despite the recent statements of the Court of Appeal that it is necessary for the appellant on appeal from the Local Court to the District Court to demonstrate “legal, factual or discretionary error”: Mulder v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2015] NSWCA 92, other authorities, and also the manner in which the Court of Appeal in Mulder dealt with the applications for judicial review of the District Court decisions, support the view that the appeal under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act does not depend on a finding of any error by the magistrate: [76], [81], [85]; [87], [97].

Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 4 April 2012 the applicant was arrested and charged with four counts of aggravated indecency, three involving his stepdaughter, GL, and one involving his step-granddaughter, SD. (The applicant and the complainants are anonymous in keeping with the statutory prohibition on publication of material identifying the complainants. [1] ) The charges were heard over seven days at Lismore Local Court, before Magistrate Denes. The applicant was found guilty on each count, judgment being delivered on 15 November 2013. The matter was adjourned to 24 January 2014 for sentence.
	
	
	The applicant appealed, pursuant to s 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”), against both convictions and sentences. According to the judgment on appeal given in the District Court on 25 September 2014, the notice of appeal was dated 24 January 2014 which was described as the day on which he was convicted of the offences. However, the Local Court transcript clearly records the magistrate convicting him on 15 November 2013. [2] 
	
	
	On the appeal, the primary judge (Whitford DCJ) set aside the conviction on one charge but dismissed the appeal with respect to the other three charges. The magistrate imposed custodial sentences which were stayed by the lodging of the appeal; the judge continued bail. Although the appeal extended to the severity of the sentences imposed, nothing before this Court identified the sentences, nor was that part of the appeal disposed of in the District Court, [3]  the outstanding matters being stood over to a date to be fixed.
	
	
	There is no right of appeal from the judgment of the District Court. In that circumstance, the applicant filed a summons on 13 November 2014 seeking to have this Court quash his convictions pursuant to the supervisory jurisdiction conferred by s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). An amended summons was filed on 6 February 2015, although the nature of the amendments is not apparent.
	


Appellate jurisdiction of District Court


	
	Although the point was inadequately addressed in the submissions of the parties, this case raised in stark form a difficulty inherent in the statutory scheme for appeals in criminal jurisdiction from the Local Court to the District Court. That is, how is the District Court to approach an appeal against conviction where the outcome depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainants, on the one hand, and of the defendant, on the other? On the basis of the statutory provisions and authorities referred to below, three propositions are well established, namely:
	



	
	the appeal, described as “by way of rehearing”, does not involve a hearing de novo (or fresh trial) as if the original trial had not occurred;
	
	
	the appeal is not an appeal “in the strict sense”, so as to be limited to the evidence before the magistrate, to be determined on the law as it then applied; and
	
	
	the judge on appeal is bound to observe the “natural limitations” which arise where the appeal is conducted by reference to a documentary record.
	



	
	In circumstances where neither party seeks to call oral evidence on the appeal, the following outcomes must be considered:
	



	
	if the appellant fails to demonstrate error on the part of the magistrate, the appeal must be dismissed;
	
	
	if the prosecutor (respondent) is unable to persuade the judge that the charges have been made out beyond reasonable doubt, the appeal must be upheld;
	
	
	the judge, being unable to determine the matter in the absence of oral evidence, must require the parties to call witnesses; or
	
	
	the judge, being unable to determine the matter, must set aside the conviction and remit the matter to the magistrate.
	



	
	For reasons which will be explained, there are difficulties attending the adoption of any one of these solutions. To understand why that is so, it is necessary to have regard to the statutory scheme encompassed by the key provisions of the Appeal and Review Act.
	


11   Appeals as of right

(1)   Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence (or both).

…

14   Lodgment of appeals and applications for leave to appeal

(2)   A notice of appeal must state the general grounds of appeal.

…

18   Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the evidence

(1)   An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19.

(2)   Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.

(3)   The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence.

19   Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person

(1)   The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:

(a)   in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or

(b)   in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence.

(2)   An application for such a direction may be made by a party to the proceedings in relation to a particular person only if notice of the party’s intention to make such an application has been served on each other party to the proceedings within such period as the District Court may direct.

(3)   If an application for such a direction is refused, the District Court must give reasons for the refusal.

(4)   A direction may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the appellant.

(5)   The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special or substantial reasons for the purposes of subsection (1).

(6)   Without limiting subsection (5), in determining whether special or substantial reasons exist, the District Court must have regard to whether or not the appellant was legally represented for the whole or any part of the original Local Court proceedings.

20   Determination of appeals

(1)   The District Court may determine an appeal against conviction:

(a)   by setting aside the conviction, or

(b)   by dismissing the appeal, or

(c)   in the case of an appeal made with leave under section 12(1) – by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the original Local Court for redetermination in accordance with any directions of the District Court.

(2)   The District Court may determine an appeal against sentence:

(a)   by setting aside the sentence, or

(b)   by varying the sentence, or

(c)   by dismissing the appeal.


	
	Because the determination of the charges depended entirely upon accepting the evidence of the complainants and rejecting the evidence of the defendant as not raising a reasonable doubt, all the judge could say was that it was open to the magistrate to accept the evidence of the complainants and reject that of the defendant, so as to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty as charged. Put negatively, the judge could not be satisfied on the material before him beyond reasonable doubt, because he had neither seen nor heard the complainants cross-examined, nor had he seen or heard the defendant give evidence. (He had seen and heard a video recording of the complainants’ evidence-in-chief.) This raises starkly a question as to which of the possibilities noted above should follow.
	
	
	There are statements which appear to contradict the first possibility, namely that for an appeal to succeed, the appellant must persuade the judge that the magistrate erred. The primary support for that negative proposition is to be found in Gianoutsos v Glykis. [4]  It is necessary to set out the statements from the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Hislop JJ expressed agreement):
	


“[37]   In Allesch v Maunz [5]  the High Court considered the appeal provisions under the Family Court Act. In the course of the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ their [Honours] said at 180: [6] 

‘For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error (see CDJ v VAJ [7] ), whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error. At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised regardless of error.’ (emphasis added)

[38]   In the present case, the legislation does indicate that the District Court’s appellate powers may be exercised regardless of error. Section 20 of the [Appeal and Review Act] provides that on an appeal from a magistrate the District Court may either set aside a conviction (or in this case an APVO), or it may dismiss the appeal. The District Court is not limited to ordering fresh proceedings in the court below. Indeed, unlike the Supreme Court (see s 55(1)(b) of the [Appeal and Review Act]), the District Court is given no express power to remit the matter back to the Local Court for redetermination in accordance with its directions. In R v Kurtic [8] , Hunt CJ at CL noted that the power to determine an appeal otherwise than by ordering fresh proceedings would indicate that a court with such a power is not a court of error. [9] 

[39]   The District Court has power to rehear issues at trial but does not have power to remit the matter back to the Local Court. It follows that the District Court’s powers under s 18 of the [Appeal and Review Act] are not dependent upon a finding of error at the original trial.

[40]   An appeal under s 18 of the [Appeal and Review Act] is an appeal of this nature.”


	
	The critical element in this reasoning is that the absence of a power to remit means that the powers exercised by the District Court are not dependent upon a finding of error. (Contrary to the reference at [39], the powers are not found in s 18, but in s 20.) However, there is an elision in the reasoning: if the District Court sets the conviction aside, what is the consequence? There are three possible consequences, namely:
	


(a)   the charge is dismissed;

(b)   the defendant is convicted of a lesser offence; or

(c)   there is a charge which remains to be determined.


	
	If s 20(1) is to be read as limited to the powers expressly conferred, there is no power to do either of (a) or (b). In that (somewhat unsatisfactory) state of affairs, (c) is the most plausible consequence, because an undetermined charge does not need to be remitted – the function of the Local Court remains unperformed.
	
	
	Assuming for present purposes that the District Court does not have a power of remitter, there is no doubt that it has power to “rehear” the charges subject to appeal. However, it is difficult to understand why a power to set aside a conviction is, in the absence of a power to remit, not dependent upon a finding of error. In considering the statutory scheme, it appears that insufficient weight was given to the fact that the District Court was conducting “an appeal”; that with respect to “an appeal by way of rehearing” the usual understanding is that the appellant must demonstrate some form of legal, factual or discretionary error, but that error may be identified from evidence which was not before the magistrate. This view is consistent with recent authority in this Court. [10] 
	
	
	Two other matters were relied upon in Gianoutsos. The first was the distinction drawn, by contrast with an appeal to the Supreme Court against conviction, between an order setting aside the conviction and an order “setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the Local Court … for redetermination in accordance with the Supreme Court’s directions”. [11]  There are two reasons for doubting the value of the comparison. First, appeals from the Local Court to the Supreme Court against conviction or sentence can only be made as of right “on a ground that involves a question of law alone.” [12]  Where an appeal is brought on a ground that involves a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact, leave is required. [13]  The different functions of the Supreme Court provide a basis for the statement of powers in a different form. Secondly, and consequentially upon the first point, it is understandable that, where there is an appeal on a question of law, the statute should expressly provide for the Supreme Court to give directions as to how the matter is to be redetermined.
	
	
	The final aspect of Gianoutsos to be noted is the reference to the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kurtic. [14]  In that passage, Hunt CJ at CL stated that the Court of Criminal Appeal, exercising functions under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), “acts as a court of error.” If error were established, and subject to the proviso to s 6(1), the power of the Court was to order a new trial: there was no power to make a finding that could have been made by the trial court. The point being made was that similar limitations applied where the trial was by judge alone, rather than before a jury. The contrary proposition, namely that the power to act otherwise than by ordering fresh proceedings would indicate that the court was not a court of error, is not to be found in the judgment. What is more, such a proposition would be inconsistent with the reasoning in Allesch v Maunz set out by the Chief Judge in Gianoutsos in the preceding paragraph. It is not in doubt that the District Court (a) does not conduct a hearing de novo, (b) is not limited to an appeal in the strict sense, but (c) is to conduct a rehearing. Kurtic may be put to one side.
	
	
	Finally, with respect to Gianoutsos, it is important to note the context in which the reasoning appears. The judge in the District Court had dealt with the appeal as if it were a hearing de novo. In response to questions stated for the Court of Criminal Appeal, it was held (uncontroversially) that this approach was in error. It was clearly an error of law. The comments set out above were made in discussing whether it was an error of law (which could hardly be doubted), although that was also said not to be material to the resolution of the matter. [15]  Most of the arguments set out above were therefore unnecessary for the conclusion reached and, except quite indirectly, did not support it.
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions v Emanuel, [16]  Spigelman CJ (Tobias JA agreeing) noted that it was “common ground” that the District Court had no power to order a remitter to the Local Court. I suggested the following analysis: [17] 
	


“[59]   The second resolution is that a power of remittal exists on an appeal to the District Court. In Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45; 168 CLR 1 Dawson J explained that a magistrates’ court, although an inferior court with limited jurisdiction, ‘undoubtedly possesses jurisdiction arising by implication upon the principle that a grant of power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise’: at 16. These principles were adopted and applied in Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) [1999] HCA 19; 198 CLR 435 at [50]-[51] (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ), their Honours noting that reference to ‘necessary implication’ was to be understood as identifying a power to make orders ‘which are reasonably required or legally ancillary to the accomplishment of the specific remedies’ provided in the statute.

[60]   The District Court had undoubted power to set aside the conviction and sentence: Appeal and Review Act, s 20. If the charges were to be pursued, that could only properly take place in the Local Court. There may be doubt as to whether an order of remittal were necessary. Assuming it was, it was arguably an order necessary to give effect to the judgment setting aside the conviction and was therefore within the implied powers of that Court, in the particular circumstances of the case.”


	
	This issue was also addressed in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Burns. [18]  The issue in Burns was whether the District Court judge, having identified error of a kind relevant in the exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction, rather than an appeal on the merits, erred in “quashing” the conviction. The Court was unanimous in dismissing the Director’s application for judicial review. After referring to the clear statement to similar effect in Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Cavanough, [19]  Beazley JA said: [20] 
	


“The setting aside of a conviction is not equivalent to dismissing a charge or to finding a person not guilty, although on a successful appeal under s 11 that would be the intention behind setting aside the conviction.”


	
	Beazley JA (with whom Campbell JA agreed) considered whether there was an implied power to remit in circumstances where the intention was that the charge should be dismissed. The suggestion raised by me in Emanuel was rejected as not expressing a concluded view and as dealing with a different case. [21]  Beazley JA was ultimately persuaded that the matter could be resolved by reference to s 73 of the Appeal and Review Act which states:
	


73   Evidence of setting aside of conviction or sentence

(1)   If a conviction or sentence is set aside on an appeal, the registrar of the appeal court must cause a memorandum to that effect to be endorsed on the conviction or on the order by which the sentence was imposed.

(2)   A copy of the memorandum is sufficient evidence that the conviction or sentence has been set aside.


	
	What was not explained was how a recording that a conviction had been set aside amounted to the dismissal of a charge, in circumstances where the setting aside of the conviction did not have that effect.
	
	
	I referred in Burns to the reasoning in Emanuel and Cavanough; I further noted that, on an appeal by way of rehearing, the appellate court will usually be entitled to intervene where it finds a material error. [22] 
	
	
	Before reaching any conclusion with respect to the options available to the District Court, it is convenient to return to the language in the statutory provisions. First, as has been noted, s 11(1) confers a right to “appeal” against a conviction. Although the term “appeal” is not always used in a technically correct sense, its use in combination with the provision in s 18(1) that the appeal “is to be by way of rehearing” is to adopt language which conventionally invokes appellate jurisdiction and not original jurisdiction, as would be the case with a fresh hearing. Yet to identify the function of the District Court as one in which the prosecution bears the onus of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt, in the absence of any demonstrated error on the part of the magistrate, is to import into the appeal a critical feature of a fresh hearing.
	
	
	Secondly, although it is common for a statutory appeal by way of rehearing to permit the adducing of fresh or further evidence, there are always limits on that power. [23]  The powers in ss 18 and 19 are broader. Section 18(1) provides the norm, namely that the appeal will be reheard “on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings”. That proposition is said to be subject to s 19, but it is also, by necessary implication, subject to s 18(2). The latter provision permits “fresh evidence” to be given by leave of the District Court and only if the Court is satisfied that it is “in the interests of justice”. The term “fresh evidence” is defined to mean “evidence in addition to or in substitution for” the evidence given in the Local Court. [24] 
	
	
	The concept of evidence in substitution for evidence given at trial is somewhat ambiguous. There may be an inference that either party can withdraw evidence given before the magistrate, in the sense of excluding it from the record. There does not appear to be any discussion of such an approach in the cases, although there have been cases dealing with additional evidence, such as an attempt by the prosecution to rely on post-conviction admissions by the defendant. [25]  The need to satisfy the Court that adducing such evidence would be “in the interests of justice” may make the tender of fresh evidence unusual.
	
	
	The circumstances referred to in s 19 fall into a different category. Although the provision refers generally to persons being required to attend and give evidence, it appears to set its own criteria and thus does not operate by way of qualification to s 18(2). On that basis, it should be understood as referring to persons who gave evidence before the magistrate. Two categories are envisaged, namely evidence from persons who have been the victims of violence and other cases. The complainants in the present case would fall within the first category. Accordingly, the court could only direct that they attend to give evidence if satisfied that “there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice” that course should be taken. (It is not necessary to consider for present purposes the nature of the difference between “special reasons” – in par (a) – and “substantial reasons” – in par (b).) The critical issue, which again appears not to have been addressed in the cases, is whether the fact that the conviction depended upon the credibility of the victim would constitute a “special reason”, making it in the interests of justice for her to be required to attend and give evidence. On one view, that must be a common occurrence, in which case it would be contrary to the plain intention of the provision, namely to protect victims of violence from repetitive court appearances, [26]  because it would permit that to happen routinely.
	
	
	The operation of the provision was not addressed in argument, there having been no application by either party to call any person who gave evidence before the magistrate. That raises two questions. First, does the District Court judge have a power to make a direction on his or her own motion? Secondly, if not, how is the judge to dispose of the appeal?
	
	
	Again, the first question is largely theoretical in this case: there was no challenge to the failure of the judge to give such a direction. Accordingly, it should be accepted that the judge acted within power by seeking to dispose of the matter without hearing the complainants’ cross-examined and without hearing the defendant give evidence.
	
	
	The second question, however, becomes critical: if the onus were on the appellant to demonstrate some error on the part of the magistrate in order to have the convictions set aside, he did not do so and, for reasons given below, the judge did not fail to exercise his jurisdiction in concluding that there was no such error. On the other hand, if the onus on the appeal were, despite the lack of demonstrable error, on the prosecution to prove to the satisfaction of the judge that the defendant was properly convicted, it could not do so without the judge hearing the relevant evidence.
	
	
	There is no authority which supports the latter conclusion. Adopting that conclusion would, to a large extent, make the appeal a de novo hearing where the case is one of oath against oath. That is entirely inconsistent with the conventional understanding of an appeal by way of rehearing; it is also inconsistent with the common statements that the appeal judge should be conscious of the “natural limitations” on his or her power to assess the record of evidence given before the magistrate. Those comments have never been accompanied by a suggestion that the judge should have the witnesses recalled; rather, at least implicitly, they assume that the judge should accept the credibility findings of the magistrate in the absence of some demonstrated reason to doubt them.
	
	
	In Charara v The Queen [27]  Mason P, having referred to the terms of s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act, stated: [28] 
	


“The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The Judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court”.


	
	Mason P noted, referring to the civil case of Fox v Percy, [29]  that the court must of necessity observe the “natural limitations” that exist where a review is undertaken on the record. [30]  In Fox v Percy, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated: [31] 
	


“These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.”


	
	On the present application, counsel for the Director took the concept of limitations noted in Fox v Percy a step further. She identified the power of the appellate court to review factual findings based on credibility as available only where error is demonstrated by “incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony” [32]  or else, in quite rare cases, where the decision at trial is “glaringly improbable” or “contrary to compelling inferences”. [33] 
	
	
	There are two reasons to approach such language with caution. First, where the court has a written judgment from the trial judge, as opposed to an opaque verdict of a jury, it may be possible to identify error in an assessment of credibility without demanding satisfaction of phrases expressed at a high level of generality and with a degree of hyperbole. Secondly, the exercise being undertaken in the criminal jurisdiction imposes a different frame of reference. Where, on an appeal from a conviction on indictment, it is alleged that a jury verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or where error is otherwise established and the court is required to consider whether no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred (the proviso [34] ), a somewhat similar exercise is required. Thus, in considering the application of the proviso, the High Court stated in Weiss v The Queen: [35] 
	


“Three fundamental propositions must not be obscured. First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Secondly, the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks. It is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial; it is not an exercise in speculation or prediction. Thirdly, the standard of proof of criminal guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	In identifying the scope of the statutory task, the Court in Weiss then noted that, in making its own independent assessment of the evidence, and determining whether the guilt of the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt, the appellate court will make “due allowance for the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record”. [36]  The reference to “natural limitations” picked up the language of Fox v Percy at [23], [37]  but did not adopt the emphatic language at [28] and [29].
	
	
	Although the cases dealing with appeals (as distinct from further hearings) frequently refer to discernment of “error”, that term has no precise meaning. It refers broadly to the satisfaction of the appellate judge that the trial judge was “wrong and should be corrected.” [38]  Put negatively, it means that the judgment of the trial judge will not be set aside unless the appellate judge is satisfied that the judgment is wrong. How that state of satisfaction is achieved will depend upon a range of factors. [39]  Indeed, a miscarriage of justice warranting intervention may occur in the absence of “error” in the ordinary meaning of that term. [40] 
	
	
	In considering the nature of the exercise to be undertaken by this Court, it is permissible to have regard to the errors sought to be identified in the District Court and the issues thereby raised for consideration by the primary judge. In short, with possible exceptions which need not be considered, it is not open to the applicant to allege a failure on the part of the District Court to exercise its jurisdiction by reference to challenges to the Local Court judgment which were not raised in the District Court.
	
	
	Two further matters, one of principle and one of practice, should be noted. With respect to principle, in circumstances where the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to consider for itself whether the evidence supported a verdict of guilty, SKA v The Queen, [41]  Simpson J declined to view a video of the complainant’s evidence-in-chief on the basis that to do so might create an imbalanced impression as the court would not be viewing the evidence of other witnesses, nor indeed the cross-examination of the complainant. [42]  In the High Court, a ground alleging error in that constrained approach was rejected. [43]  Although the District Court judge did watch the videos, that exercise did not assist him in identifying error on the part of the magistrate. [44] 
	
	
	The issue of practice concerns the standard notice used to commence an appeal to the District Court from the Local Court. No standard form is prescribed, but one is supplied by the Court. For an appeal against conviction, the notice effectively requires that the appellant mark a box giving as the reason, “I am not guilty”. That would be appropriate for a fresh hearing, but not for an appeal by way of rehearing. Arguably, the form itself does not comply with s 14(2) of the Appeal and Review Act which requires the notice to state “the general grounds of appeal.” That statutory language implies the need to state, at least in general terms, some basis upon which the magistrate is thought to have erred.
	


Application of principles


	
	Neither the summons nor the applicant’s written submissions identified specific grounds upon which the relief was sought. Given the limited nature of this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction, that omission resulted in the written submissions filed on behalf of the respondent Director dealing with the supposed errors on the part of the judge in a confined way, without addressing all the issues raised by the applicant’s submissions.
	
	
	As the case was presented, the primary ground of challenge was that the judge misapprehended the extent of his statutory jurisdiction under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act and thereby dealt with the appeal on a more limited basis than was required by law. Such a challenge may be described as a constructive failure on the part of the judge hearing the appeal to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court. That is a permissible ground of review and constitutes jurisdictional error, if made good. No other form of legal or factual error is reviewable by this Court. [45]  That means that this Court cannot (and was not invited to) review any aspect of the decision in the Local Court. Indeed, that course would no longer be appropriate, the judgment of the Local Court having been superseded by the judgment in the District Court. [46]  That is not to say that the evidence before the Local Court and the magistrate’s reasons were not relevant and admissible to allow an understanding of the course of the District Court proceedings
	
	
	The primary material available to this Court to assess a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction is the judgment of the District Court. Usually it would be necessary to have regard to the initiating process in that Court in order to understand the scope of the appeal. That document was not available, but it appears from material which was tendered that the parties proceeded on the basis that it was, in colloquial terms, an “all grounds appeal”. [47]  That, it may be accepted, was intended to invoke the full extent of the statutory jurisdiction. However, like many colloquialisms, the phrase, implying a fresh hearing, is inaccurate. No part of either s 18 or s 19 was invoked: the evidence before the District Court was limited to the transcript of proceedings in the Local Court, together with both audio-visual recordings and transcripts of the police interviews with the two complainants. Other than the evidence-in-chief of the complainants, the District Court judge therefore neither heard nor saw any of the witnesses called over seven days in the Local Court. He did not see or hear the cross-examination of the complainants.
	
	
	The function able to be performed by the appeal court in those circumstances is constrained. Particularly is that so where, as in the present case, the convictions were almost entirely dependent upon acceptance beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence of the two complainants, who were approximately 10 or 11 years of age at the date of the alleged offences and a year or so older at the date of the trial.
	
	
	Having set out the background to the charges and convictions, the primary judge noted [48]  that the appellant had filed “extensive written submissions” and had “addressed orally, in considerable detail, on the various matters raised in those written submissions.” He then sought to identify two categories of challenge, the first being specified errors committed by the magistrate; the second being aspects of the evidence which were said to cause “such disquiet in respect of the result as to warrant allowing the appeal and setting aside the convictions.” [49] 
	
	
	The judge addressed the errors by reference to the following categories, namely:
	



	
	various errors said to indicate prejudgment;
	
	
	misuse of evidence that the appellant’s wife left home suddenly with her daughter and
	
	
	evidence of an alibi with respect to the first offence involving GL (referred to as the sequence 3 offence).
	



	
	The judge dealt in an orderly manner with the particulars said to give rise to prejudgment and rejected the various complaints. He dealt separately with complaints concerning the departure of the applicant’s wife, [50]  and the issue involving the alibi. [51]  With respect to the alibi, the judge noted that the magistrate had accepted as a real possibility that the applicant was not in Ballina (where the offence was alleged to have occurred) at the time in question. That should have been sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt in circumstances where the prosecution had amended the particular charge so as to specify the day on which the events took place. The judge treated the magistrate as having determined that issue on the basis that the charge alleged an offence “on or around” the specified date, which he held to be incorrect. He therefore set aside the conviction on that charge.
	
	
	None of this material reveals any failure to exercise the jurisdiction of the Court. Further, the approach adopted by the judge followed the submissions in the District Court in identifying particular deficiencies in the prosecution case. However, beyond addressing the specific challenges, the judge felt unable to carry out a conclusive assessment of the whole of the evidence, which was described by the appellant in his submissions as involving “oath against oath”. Thus, the judge stated: [52] 
	


“Frankly, having seen the interviews of the girls, I see no reason why the matters that her Honour took into account are not available to her Honour as matters persuasive of the credibility and reliability of the complainants.

Contrary to the submission put on behalf of the appellant, it seems to me that this was a case which was well capable of being determined by reference to the complainants’ evidence, provided they were accepted to the requisite standard and nothing intervened which necessarily disturbed or precluded such a conclusion.

It is true there was no forensic evidence, nor was there anything in the way of corroboration of either of the complainants. That is not an infrequent feature of cases of this kind. It seems to me that the Magistrate adequately directed herself in respect of the care and scrutiny with which her task had to be approached, having regard to the Prosecution’s reliance in each case on the evidence of a single witness.”


	
	Having assessed the second issue noted above, the judge returned to the theme just outlined, stating: [53] 
	


“In adjudicating on this appeal, I am acutely conscious of the natural limitations that exist in approaching an appeal based substantially on the record below. These limitations are well reflected in judgments of superior courts concerning appeals from the Local Court to this court. Those limitations of course include the disadvantage which I have, relative to the Magistrate, in respect of the evaluation of witnesses and in respect of the opportunity she had over quite a lengthy interval, to reflect upon the evidence and draw conclusions from it. The submission was made that the Magistrate’s advantage is mitigated on the appeal because I have had access to and viewed the evidence in chief of the two complainants.

I have seen the interviews of each of the complainants. I have not, however, had the advantage of seeing or hearing any of the other witnesses including the appellant (other than through viewing his recorded interview), nor of seeing or hearing the cross-examinations of the complainants.

Her Honour plainly gave careful consideration to the evidence of all of the witnesses and dealt expressly with the matters raised in argument on behalf of the appellant. Many of the criticisms that are made of her Honour’s findings and the process by which she reached them are not capable of sensible resolution by me, having resort only to the transcript of most of that evidence. The resolution of most of those matters, in particular in connection with the various identified deficiencies in the evidence of [GL and SD], depends upon the unique benefit the Magistrate had of seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence and making corresponding assessments of what and whom to believe. Those assessments frequently depend on subtleties which simply cannot adequately be taken account of by resort only to a transcript, even when it is partially supplemented by some recorded evidence. Those assessments require an understanding of the dynamics of the hearing, and the close observation of the witnesses. Her Honour, at least in respect of exposing why she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence of the complainants, went to considerable lengths to expose those matters that informed her assessment.

It seems to me that the Magistrate appropriately directed herself, and she considered carefully the various matters which addressed the question of whether she could accept beyond reasonable doubt the accounts of the complainants. With one exception, which I will come to shortly, there is nothing in the material, nor in the arguments advanced, which objectively points to any failing on her Honour’s part in the adjudication of the matter or which calls for any different result on this appeal by way of rehearing.”


	
	There is nothing in this passage which demonstrates a failure on the part of the judge to carry out his function under s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act. On the contrary, he clearly understood that the appeal was by way of rehearing, using language reminiscent of that used in Fox v Percy and other cases, such as Weiss, reflecting the function of the court conducting a rehearing, subject to identifiable limitations.
	
	
	In these circumstances, a legitimate basis of challenge in the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court, which may be identified as a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction, has not been established.
	
	
	The summons should be dismissed with costs.
	
	
	SIMPSON JA: The circumstances in which this application comes before the Court are set out in [1]-[4] of the judgment of Basten JA, which I have read in draft. Pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), the applicant seeks review of the decision of Whitford DCJ on an appeal brought before him, under s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”), against the applicant’s conviction of four offences by a magistrate in the Local Court. Such an appeal is expressed, in s 18 of the Appeal and Review Act, to be “by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings”. The applicant claims in this proceeding that Whitford DCJ failed to discharge his function, which required him to make an independent assessment of whether the prosecution had proved, to the criminal standard, the applicant’s guilt of the offences.
	


Background


	
	In August 2013 the applicant was charged in the Local Court in Lismore with four counts of sexual offences allegedly committed over a period in 2010 and 2012. Three of the charges named his step-daughter (to whom I will refer as “G”) as complainant; the fourth named G’s niece (the applicant’s step-granddaughter, to whom I will refer as “S”) as complainant. Notwithstanding their familial relationship, G and S are of similar age, G having been born in February 2002, S in October 2001.
	
	
	Evidence and submissions in the proceedings in the Local Court took place over six non-consecutive days between August and November 2013. The evidence in chief of the complainants was given, pursuant to s 306S of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), by way of video recordings of interviews they gave to police during the course of the investigation that took place following their disclosure of the offences. The complainants were cross-examined. In the course of the cross-examination, it was suggested that the complainants had been motivated to fabricate their evidence because the applicant’s relationship with his wife (G’s mother and S’s grandmother) had broken down and there were financial issues.
	
	
	In a preliminary hearing the magistrate ruled that tendency evidence would be admitted in accordance with s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). However, she later reversed that ruling, and did not allow the prosecution to rely on tendency reasoning.
	
	
	The applicant was legally represented in the proceedings. He gave evidence in the hearing.
	
	
	One issue that needs to be noted here arose during the course of the proceedings. This related to one of the counts in respect of which G was the complainant. On the first day of the hearing the Crown amended the charge (which had initially stated a range of dates between which the offence was alleged to have been committed) to allege that the offence was committed on 4 February 2012 (which was pinpointed by reference to its relationship to G’s birthday). The applicant produced documentary evidence that, he claimed, established that he had been interstate on that date.
	


The judgment of the Local Court


	
	After hearing evidence and the submissions of the parties, the magistrate convicted the applicant on all four counts. She gave lengthy reasons for doing so. With respect to the count as to which the applicant had raised an alibi defence, she held:
	


“Was it the Friday, was it the Saturday, my view [is] it does not matter, it really does not matter. I do not consider time to be of the essence and in this circumstance a misstatement of the date in these circumstances will not in my view vitiate the finding of guilt …”


	
	Her Honour placed considerable emphasis on her observations of G’s video recorded interview, which, she said, she had watched a number of times. With respect to G, she said (inter alia):
	


“Having watched her on the video and I have watched that video a number of times in chambers as I was considering this matter, she struck me as a charming, outgoing, vivacious, endearing child.

That alone does not mean that I believe her …

…

I will say at the outset that I believed her without hesitation, I will explain my reasons for that and I think it is very important for me to set out very clearly why I believed her, clearly that is part of my obligation as a finder of fact … She was speaking with body language in the interview and demeanour. The words she used merely corroborated the way she was expressing herself both with her hands, with her legs, with her face.

…

I have watched the video a number of times and each time I am firmed in my view as to her reliability and credit …”

She referred at length to the cross-examination of G, but her previously expressed view of G’s reliability was not altered.


	
	She gave different reasons for accepting the evidence of S, referring extensively to defence submissions that S was confused and her evidence inconsistent; essentially, her Honour rejected these submissions. She expressly rejected the motive to fabricate evidence advanced on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	She referred to the applicant’s evidence, noting that he had denied all allegations, and observed:
	


“True it is an accused in these circumstances can do little more than simply deny the allegations. I agree that it is incredibly difficult for an accused to defend these sorts of allegations particularly where they are fairly general in nature other than to say but I did not do it.”

Although she plainly rejected the applicant’s evidence, her Honour did not make any demeanour based findings. Her assessment was on the basis of a balancing of competing evidence and submissions.

The appeal to the District Court


	
	Pursuant to s 11 of the Appeal and Review Act, the applicant appealed to the District Court. The appeal came before Whitford DCJ on 23 and 24 September 2014. Although s 18(2) and s 19(1) of the Appeal and Review Act make provision, respectively, for fresh evidence to be given (by leave), and for the District Court (in specified and limited circumstances) to direct a person to attend and give evidence, no application under either provision was made, and the appeal proceeded on the basis of the evidence given in the Local Court.
	
	
	Lengthy written and oral submissions were made. The written submissions included a list of 12 asserted errors in the judgment of the magistrate. These can be refined to:
	


(i)  the admission of the tendency evidence in the Local Court (even though that reasoning process was subsequently excluded. The ruling was relied upon to support a contention that the magistrate had made a favourable assessment of the complainants’ evidence and its probity before she heard their testimony);

(ii)  that the magistrate formed an opinion favourable to the complainants without considering the evidence of the applicant;

(iii)  the manner in which the magistrate treated the alibi defence;

(iv)  the manner in which her Honour dealt with evidence adduced on behalf of the applicant concerning the alleged motive for the complainants to make false allegations;

(v)  prejudgment by the magistrate;

(vi)  undue allowance allegedly made for the youth of the complainants;

(vii)  exclusion of cross-examination under s 293(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act.


	
	A further submission was made under the heading “Deficiencies in the evidence [in the Local Court]”, under which a lengthy list of such asserted deficiencies was made.
	
	
	Senior counsel who represented the applicant spoke at some length, in oral submissions, to the submissions already made in writing. A significant part of the address was directed to the argument that the magistrate had “pre-judged” the issues, because of the favourable view she had formed of the complainants, particularly G. He invited the judge to view the video recordings of the interviews with the complainants. He reminded the judge that:
	


“… your Honour will have to make your Honour’s judicial mind up in relation to the evidence as a whole anyway.”

During his oral address, senior counsel made the following submissions:

“… your Honour has the denial of the appellant in circumstances where his evidence wasn’t suggested as evidence to be unpersuasive, to have within it the problems that one often associates with the assessment of evidence, conflicts, contradictions, hesitations, non-responsive answers, all those sorts of things.

So you have a case where at the end of the day and the prosecution hasn’t discharged the alibi evidence, hasn’t discharged its onus with respect to alibi and your Honour has the problems in relation to the changing of the dates and matters of that kind.

So at the end of the day, taking a broad approach to this your Honour would be left with a reasonable doubt in relation to the allegations.”

The judgment of the District Court


	
	With respect to the written submissions, Whitford DCJ is recorded as saying:
	


“Without wishing to do them any injustice or discourtesy by describing them in the following summary way, they were divided into two primary categories or aspects. The first aspect concerned the identification of what was submitted to be errors of the Magistrate in the conduct of the hearing or, more particularly, in her reasons and the exposure of her reasoning processes. Some 12 discreet [sic - discrete] errors were nominated, but there was a high degree of duplication and repetition among them, such that many of them might be described as alternate particularisations of the same errors.

The second aspect of the submissions was directed to identifying parts of the evidence, in particular the evidence of the two complainants, which it was submitted would cause such disquiet in respect of the result as to warrant allowing the appeal and setting aside the convictions.”


	
	His Honour then discerned “three principal categories” of the applicant’s submissions, as follows:
	


“The first category of error might loosely be described as errors of prejudgment - which embraces a number of corresponding particulars and concerns relating both to the asserted inadequacy of her Honour’s fact finding or the expression of her reasons for her findings and the inadequacy of the evidence, particularly the evidence of the complainants, to serve as a foundation for her findings;

The second category of error, closely related to the first, concerns the evidence of [G’s mother] leaving home suddenly and the use which it is asserted her Honour made of that evidence;

The third category relates to some evidence adduced by the appellant concerning an alibi for the [4 February] offence and her Honour’s treatment of that evidence, particularly in light of the amended charge.”

His Honour then proceeded to deal at length with each of the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant.


	
	He rejected the contention that the magistrate had prejudged the issue, finding that she had “gone to great lengths to expose the matters that persuaded her to her ultimate acceptance of the complainants beyond reasonable doubt”. With respect to the argument concerning her assessment of G’s credibility, he said:
	


“Again, I cannot accept that this criticism of her Honour’s approach is fairly made … Frankly, having seen the interviews of the girls, I see no reason why the matters that her Honour took into account were not available to her Honour as matters persuasive of the credibility and reliability of the complainants.”


	
	He found that the magistrate had adequately directed herself with respect to the task of fact finding.
	
	
	He turned to a submission that her Honour did not “expose any reasoning process for rejection of [the applicant’s] evidence”. As to that, he said:
	


“Certainly, with the benefit of hindsight, it may have been preferable if the magistrate had made some express observations concerning the basis for the rejection of [the applicant’s] evidence. It is implicit, however, in the way her Honour approached the task that she was acutely conscious that she must acquit unless she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the complainant’s evidence. And it follows from an assessment of the whole of her reasons that there was nothing arising from the evidence of [the applicant], either in its content, or the way it was given, which gives rise to reasonable doubt.”


	
	He then said:
	


“In adjudicating on this appeal, I am acutely conscious of the natural limitations that exist in approaching an appeal based substantially on the record below … Those limitations of course include the disadvantage which I have, relative to the Magistrate, in respect of the evaluation of witnesses and in respect of the opportunity she had over quite a lengthy interval, to reflect upon the evidence and draw conclusions from it. The submission was made that the Magistrate’s advantage is mitigated on the appeal because I have had access to and viewed the evidence in chief of the two complainants.

I have seen the interviews of each of the complainants. I have not, however, had the advantage of seeing or hearing any of the other witnesses including the appellant (other than through viewing his recorded interview), nor of seeing or hearing the crossexaminations of the complainants.

…

The resolution of most of those matters, in particular in connection with the various identified deficiencies of the evidence of [G] and [S], depends upon the unique benefit the Magistrate had of seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence and making corresponding assessments of what and whom to believe. Those assessments frequently depend on subtleties which simply cannot adequately be taken into account of [sic] by resort only to a transcript, even when it is partially supplemented by some recorded evidence. Those assessments require an understanding of the dynamics of the hearing, and the close observation of witnesses. Her Honour, at least in respect of exposing why she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence of the complainants, went to considerable lengths to expose those matters that informed her assessment.”


	
	His Honour then turned to the 4 February count, in respect of which the applicant raised an alibi defence. He considered that the magistrate’s conclusion that “I do not consider time to be of the essence” was contrary to the effect of the amendment by the Crown to the charge, in which it specified 4 February as the date of the offence. He said that the magistrate “read and determined the charge as though it read ‘on or around’ 4 February”. He considered that the reasonable possibility that the applicant had been interstate on 4 February 2012:
	


“… gives rise to sufficient doubt that the appropriate verdict on [that] charge, in the absence of any evidence displacing that possibility, was not guilty.”

He then rejected the proposition that that conclusion would have an impact upon the assessment of the credibility of the complainants with respect to the other counts. He concluded:

“Approaching each charge separately, as one must, it flows from everything her Honour said concerning her reasons for accepting that complainant that the nomination of the 4th of February by the complainant would not have been attributed by the Magistrate to deliberate dishonesty on the part of the complainant. That accords with my assessment of the whole of the evidence too, appreciating all the limitations I have referred to in an appeal of this character. Accordingly, for the reasons I have outlined earlier, extending to the appellant the benefit of the doubt in respect of [the 4 February count], does not justify any disturbance of her Honour’s findings in respect of the other counts or any different result on this appeal in respect of the other charges.” (italics added)


	
	He set aside the conviction with respect to the 4 February 2012 count, and confirmed the convictions on the remaining three counts.
	


The application to this Court


	
	The application to this Court is for judicial review of the decision of the District Court. The grounds advanced are:
	


“1.  His Honour erred in that he misconceived his jurisdiction and acted contrary to the provisions of s 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act NSW 2001 in that he failed to treat the appeal as a rehearing and limited his judgment to identifying error on the part of the Magistrate.

2.  His Honour erred in failing to undertake his own independent assessment and analysis of the evidence presented in the Local Court and thereby failing to form his own judgment of the facts.

3.  His Honour failed to give any or sufficient consideration or analysis of the evidence of the two complainants [G] and [S], which he acknowledged from the [applicant’s] submissions if accepted, would cause such disquiet as to warrant setting aside the conviction.

4.  His Honour erred in finding that the error in the Magistrate’s reasoning in respect of alibi did not cast doubt on the evidence of the complainant [G], even though he dismissed [that charge].”


	
	Written submissions filed in support of the application followed the tenor of the grounds. They included:
	


“24  The District Court failed to apply the relevant principles governing a conviction appeal from the Local Court pursuant to s 18(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act NSW (2001).

25  The Court did not embark on its fundamental duty of ‘rehearing’ the case on the Local Court transcripts, supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court.

…

27  The District Court did not form its own judgment of the facts so far as it was able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the Magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court …

28  The approach taken by the District court was essentially an adoption and defence of the Magistrate’s finding without considering for itself the relevant issues raised in the Local Court hearing …”

The balance of the written submissions (and the oral submissions) was, essentially, an explication of these assertions.


	
	Section 18(1) of the Appeal and Review Act is explicit that an appeal under s 11 is to be by way of rehearing; and (unless leave is granted under sub-s (2) to adduce fresh evidence, or the District Court directs, in accordance with s 19(1), that oral evidence be given) is to be conducted on the basis of evidence given in the Local Court proceedings. What s 18(1) is not explicit about is the precise nature of the rehearing, and the task of the District Court judge hearing the appeal.
	
	
	The central legal proposition in the applicant’s submissions is that s 11 (read with s 18) confers powers that may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance. The obligation of the District Court judge is to bring to bear an independent judgment on the question of whether the prosecution has proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the guilt of the person accused. An appeal under s 11 is therefore not limited to the identification of error in the Local Court, and is not determined simply by concluding that no error has been demonstrated on the part of the Local Court magistrate. (Nor is the exercise of the powers granted by s 20(1)(b) of the Appeal and Review Act dependent upon the identification of error.)
	
	
	The submissions of both parties proceeded on this basis. No argument was directed to the proposition that, because the appeal is by way of rehearing, it is necessary that the appellant demonstrate error at first instance. However, since Basten JA (if I understand his Honour’s judgment correctly) has taken the view that error must be demonstrated, and since I have (tentatively, as the question was not argued) come to a contrary view, it is appropriate that I explain my reasons, conscious that they must be tentative.
	


The legislation and relevant authority


	
	In order to explain the issues, it is necessary to set out some provisions of the Appeal and Review Act:
	


“11  Appeals as of right

(1)  Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the conviction or sentence (or both).

(1A)  …

(1B)  …

(2)  …

18  Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the evidence

(1)  An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19.

(2)  Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.

(3)  …

19  Circumstances in which evidence to be given in person

(1)  The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:

(a)  in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or

(b)  in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence.

(2)  …

(3)  …

(4)  …

(5)  …

(6)  …

20  Determination of appeals

(1)  The District Court may determine an appeal against conviction:

(a)  by setting aside the conviction, or

(b)  by dismissing the appeal, or

(c)  in the case of an appeal made with leave under section 12 (1)—by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the original Local Court for redetermination in accordance with any directions of the District Court.

(2)  …”

(Section 12(1) concerns convictions entered in the absence of the defendant, and convictions entered following pleas of guilty, and is not here relevant.)


	
	It is to be observed that the powers of the District Court specified in s 20 do not include a power to remit the proceedings, for further hearing, to the Local Court. That is, in my opinion, of some significance.
	
	
	In Allesch v Maunz [2000] HCA 40; 203 CLR 172, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in a joint judgment identified three kinds of appeal:
	


(i)  appeals “in the strict sense”;

(ii)  appeals by way of rehearing;

(iii)  appeals by way of hearing de novo.

(Their Honours identified “appeals in the strict sense” as those in which the appellate court is empowered only to give the decision which should have been given at first instance. Appeals of that kind are of no present relevance.)

Their Honours distinguished appeals of the second and third kind in the following passage:

“23  For present purposes, the critical difference between an appeal by way of rehearing and a hearing de novo is that, in the former case, the powers of the appellate court are exercisable only where the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to all the evidence now before the appellate court, the order that is the subject of the appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error, whereas, in the latter case, those powers may be exercised regardless of error.” (internal citation omitted)

But, immediately after that characterisation, they went on to say:

“At least that is so unless, in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, there is some statutory provision which indicates that the powers may be exercised whether or not there was error at first instance.”


	
	It is clear that appeals under s 11 are not “appeals in the strict sense”; it is equally clear that they are not appeals by way of hearing de novo. The present question is whether these are appeals that require the identification of error, as defined in Allesch, or whether the terms of the Appeal and Review Act indicate that the powers conferred on the District Court may be exercised regardless of error.
	
	
	The authority cited for the proposition that an appeal by way of rehearing might not be confined to identification of error was Re Coldham; Ex parte Brideson (No 2) [1990] HCA 36; 170 CLR 267. The relevant statute in that case was s 88F of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) which provided for appeals from a Registrar of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to the Commission. Leave was required to appeal; where leave was granted, by sub-s (3) the Commission was empowered to take further evidence. The statute did not otherwise specify the nature of the appeal. By sub-s (4) the Commission was empowered to confirm, quash or vary a decision against which an appeal was brought. The High Court (constituted by Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) considered that the provisions of sub-s (3) and sub-s (4) were strong indications that the appeal was to be by way of rehearing. Nevertheless, the Court did not find that the appellate jurisdiction could be exercised only after the identification of error. Rather, the Court held:
	


“17  … upon the correct construction of s 88F, the Commission was bound to make its own decision on the evidence before it …”

Their Honours cited Federated Carters’ and Drivers’ Industrial Union of Australia v Motor Transport and Chauffeurs’ Association of Australia (1912) 6 CAR 122, in which Higgins J said of the same appeal provision:

“The appellant is entitled to have ... a re-hearing, a ‘review’ of the decision ... He is entitled to such judgment as I can bring to bear upon the question, independently of the Registrar, although, of course, I should attach a good deal of weight to the Registrar’s view.”

The Court went on:

“But once leave was granted, the Commission was bound to make its own decision on the evidence before it, including any further evidence admitted pursuant to s 88F(3).”


	
	The citation in Allesch of Brideson (No 2) denotes acceptance that the power to take further evidence and the power to confirm, quash or vary a decision are indicators that the appeal (although said to be by way of rehearing) did not depend upon identification of error.
	
	
	The conclusion in Brideson (No 2) is also consistent with what was said by Windeyer J in Da Costa v Cockburn Salvage and Trading Pty Ltd [1970] HCA 43; 124 CLR 192 at 208-9 as follows:
	


“The rule referred to … provides that all appeals shall be ‘by way of rehearing’. This does not mean that the appeal is a complete rehearing as a new trial is. It means that the case is to be determined by the Full Court, its members considering for themselves the issues the trial judge had to determine and the effect of the evidence he heard as appearing in the record of the proceedings before him, but applying the law as it is when the appeal is heard not as it was when the trial occurred … [The relevant rule] provides too that the Full Court shall have power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and to make any order that ought to have been made. This is more or less standard form. It confers a wide power. But it does not I think curtail the recognition or respect that an appeal court should accord to the decision of a trial judge.”


	
	There is nothing in either Brideson (No 2) or in the Federated Carters’ and Drivers’ case that calls for the identification of specific error before the obligation for the appellate court to exercise independent judgment arises.
	
	
	On these authorities, I would conclude that it is not necessary, before the appellate power of the District Court is exercised, that error of law, fact or discretion be shown.
	
	
	Authorities in this Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal are, however, not so easy to reconcile.
	
	
	In Gianoutsos v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137; 65 NSWLR 539 the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that the Appeal and Review Act did indicate that the powers of the District Court could be exercised regardless of error. At least part of the reason for this was the absence of any statutory power to remit the proceedings to the Local Court.
	
	
	But, in Mulder v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2015] NSWCA 92, Gleeson JA, with whom Ward JA and Johnson J agreed, said:
	


“28  As the appeal to the District Court is by way of rehearing, it is necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that the order the subject of the appeal is the result of a legal, factual or discretionary error in which event the District Court can substitute its own decision based on the facts and law as they then stand. Accordingly, it was the duty of [the District Court judges] to form their own judgment of the facts and, in particular, to determine whether the evidence before the Magistrates was sufficient to demonstrate Mr Mulder’s guilt on the charges beyond reasonable doubt.” (italics added, internal citations omitted)

Allesch and Dyason v Butterworth [2015] NSWCA 52 were cited as authority for the proposition contained in the first sentence. On one reading of this passage (see the words italicised), the obligation, and, indeed, the power, of the District Court to form its own view of the facts and law depends upon an anterior finding of error. However, closer analysis of what was decided in that case suggests that this was not the approach actually taken. It is necessary to examine the relevant facts.


	
	Mr Mulder faced two separate prosecutions of federal offences in the Local Court. On each occasion, he was convicted, and on each occasion, he appealed under s 11 of the Appeal and Review Act to the District Court. Each appeal was dismissed. Mr Mulder applied to this Court for judicial review of the decisions.
	
	
	Mr Mulder’s first appeal came before Hock DCJ. As recorded in the judgment of this Court ([62]-[68]) her Honour independently considered the evidence in the Local Court, and declared herself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the charges had been proved.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that, before proceeding to make that assessment, Hock DCJ had identified any error in the judgment of the magistrate from whom the appeal was brought. Nor was there any suggestion in the judgment of this Court that it was either wrong or unnecessary, in the absence of identified error, for Hock DCJ to have embarked on her independent judgment.
	
	
	Mr Mulder’s second appeal came before Toner DCJ. Again, the judgment of this Court shows that, like Hock DCJ, his Honour made an independent and comprehensive analysis of the evidence in the Local Court, and reached the same conclusion as the magistrate - that is, that Mr Mulder was guilty of the offences with which he was charged. Again, there was no suggestion that, before embarking on that exercise his Honour found any error of law, fact or discretion, and no suggestion in this Court that it was therefore wrong or unnecessary for Toner DCJ to take that course.
	
	
	I should note here that it makes no difference that, in each case, the District Court upheld the decision of the magistrate. It is the process - of decision-making by the appellate judge - that is relevant. If it were correct that a s 11 appeal depended upon identification of error in the Local Court, then, absent some identification of error, it would have been inappropriate for Hock DCJ and Toner DCJ to have proceeded to the final exercise of determination of guilt. The appropriate order in each case would, in that circumstance, have been dismissal of the appeal, without engagement with the facts, or the inferences to be drawn from them.
	
	
	In Dyason, judicial review was sought and granted in respect of an appeal under s 11 against the making, in the Local Court, of an Apprehended Personal Violence Order under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). The matter was remitted to the District Court for hearing and determination according to law, on the basis that:
	


“70  It is apparent from the primary judgment that the primary judge did not, with respect, form her own judgment as to the facts and whether they warranted the conclusion that the elements of s 19(1)(b)(i) of the DPV Act (relating to intimidation) had been established … Nor did her Honour address the sufficiency issue s 19(1) directed the decision-maker to consider once a prima facie s 19(1)(b) finding had been made. Finally her Honour did not consider whether, in all the circumstances, and taking into account the matters raised in s 20, an APVO was warranted.

71  Further, in determining that the Magistrate’s orders should be confirmed, the primary judge did not examine the evidence before the Magistrate, nor did she consider whether his Honour had adequately identified and dealt with the matters with which he was required to deal …”


	
	I read the second of these paragraphs as a clear statement that the jurisdictional error of the District Court judge was to fail to consider whether error on the part of the magistrate had been established. The first, however, is consistent with that contrary proposition, that the powers of the District Court are exercisable regardless of error, and on the basis of the District Court judge’s own assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	In an earlier decision, in the Court of Criminal Appeal, (Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244; 164 A Crim R 39) Mason P reached the conclusion that, on a rehearing, the appellate court is, essentially, to undertake the exercise that was required of the first instance tribunal. That suggests to me that exercise of the appellate power does not depend on a finding of error. Additional comments made by Mason P highlight the difficulties that are inherent in the discharge of that jurisdiction when the task is to be undertaken on the record of the first instance hearing, without the appellate judge having the benefit of observing the witnesses. That, however, did not alter the role of the appellate court; it called for recognition that respect is to be paid to, for example, the original court’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses (see the last sentence in the passage from Da Costa extracted above, the whole of which was quoted in Charara). Mason P said:
	


“17  The appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcripts (s 18(1)), obviously supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Fresh evidence may be given by leave, subject to the District Court being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this should occur (s 18(2)).

18  The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The Judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, ie recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court [citations omitted].

19  The nature of an appeal ‘by way of rehearing’ has been discussed in many cases. The procedure to be adopted, powers to be exercised and function to be performed must first be sought in the language of the particular statute. One thing, however, is clear. ‘The ‘rehearing’ does not involve a completely fresh hearing by the appellate court of all the evidence.  That court proceeds on the basis of the record and any fresh evidence that, exceptionally, it admits’ … Referring to the ‘requirements, and limitations, of such an appeal’, their Honours continued (at [23], footnotes omitted):

… On the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to ‘give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance’.  On the other, it must, of necessity, observe the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record.  These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share.  Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.” (italics in original)

The quotations in italics are taken from the decision of the High Court in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118.


	
	Confirmation of the view I have expressed is to be found in the following circumstance. At the time Charara was decided, s 18(1) was in a different form. It then provided:
	


“(1)  An appeal against conviction is to be way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by s 19.” (italics added)


	
	Of s 18 as it then stood, Mason P said:
	


“23  District Court judges traditionally and understandably refrained from reading the reasons of the Local Court when the appeal was do novo. But the nature of an appeal by way of rehearing on the transcript indicates to me that this approach is no longer justified. The magistrate’s reasons are not part of the ‘certified transcripts of evidence’ referred to in s 18(1) any more than the exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Nevertheless, as I see it, the District Court is impliedly directed to consider the reasons because the stated appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them.

24  The Local Court reasons will doubtless include an explanation why the conviction was entered at first instance, including an assessment of the credibility issues touching any factual dispute. Without reference to the reasons the District Court would be driven to speculation or deciding the issue entirely afresh. Neither such course would be consonant with the statutory scheme …”


	
	These observations were considered by the Attorney General’s Department of the NSW Government in a “Report on the Statutory Review of the [Appeal and Review] Act” in August 2008. The authors of the Report wrote:
	


“The requirement that appeals be dealt with by way of a rehearing on transcripts of evidence limits the material from the original hearing that may be before the District Court. If narrowly construed, it suggests that the District Court is unable to rely on exhibits before the magistrate in the Local Court without giving leave. Similarly, other material such as the reasons given by the magistrate, that does not constitute evidence, are not included in the transcripts of evidence.

The District Court is at a disadvantage rehearing the proceedings without the benefit of seeing or hearing the witnesses.

…

Assessments by the magistrate on issues of credibility would provide the District Court with a greater understanding of the conduct of the case and the decision made in the original proceedings. The comments by Mason J [sic – Mason P] in Charara recognise that it is consistent with the nature of an appeal by way of rehearing that the reasons given by the magistrate be available to reduce these ‘natural limitations’.”

It was, accordingly, recommended that the Parliament:

“Amend the Act to provide that an appeal to the District Court … against conviction and sentence is to be a rehearing on the basis of the transcript of the proceedings and other material before the original Local Court.”


	
	It was after that that s 18 was amended to its present form.
	
	
	It is implicit in the Report and the recommendation (and the enactment in conformity with the recommendation) that the intention was that the District Court judge would exercise an independent judgment of the guilt of the accused, aided (in the absence of the opportunity to observe witnesses and make his or her own credibility assessment) by the credibility findings of the magistrate.
	


Resolution


	
	I therefore proceed to consider the matters raised on behalf of the applicant on the basis that the obligation of Whitford DCJ was to form his own judgment as to the facts and whether they warranted the conclusion - his conclusion - that the applicant was guilty of the charges of which he had been convicted. It was not necessary that legal, factual or discretionary error be established.
	
	
	The fundamental task of a court is to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it, with the important proviso that that task is to be undertaken on the basis of the issues presented to the court for determination. That is precisely what Whitford DCJ did.
	
	
	He first dealt with and disposed of the many errors it was asserted characterised the decision of the magistrate. The assertion of error had occupied the vast bulk of the written submissions, as well as of the oral submissions. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the vast bulk of the judgment also was devoted to those matters. The grounds of the application to this Court did not challenge any of the findings that resulted from that exercise. The complaints contained in Grounds 1 to 3 of the application to this Court are, essentially, that his Honour did not undertake the necessary task of evaluating the evidence for himself. (Ground 4 is an assertion of error in his Honour’s approach to the consequences of his finding error in the magistrate’s treatment of the alibi evidence. Such a complaint is not available under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act.)
	
	
	In respect of the credibility findings concerning the complainants, his Honour was necessarily limited to reliance on the findings of the magistrate, supplemented by the advantage he had in viewing the video recorded interviews, and his analysis of asserted deficiencies in their evidence. He was necessarily so limited by the provisions of s 18 and s 19, confining the circumstances in which fresh or additional evidence may be given. It is a necessary consequence of those provisions that credibility findings of a Local Court are an important resource in the exercise of the s 11 jurisdiction. The last sentence in the passage extracted above from Da Costa confirms that, on an appeal by way of rehearing, credibility assessments by the first instance tribunal are to be accorded due weight. That is made explicit in the passage from Fox v Percy quoted in Charara.
	
	
	Within those limits, Whitford DCJ undertook the task of making his own judgment of the facts, and of whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the applicant. His decision to set aside the conviction on one count is a particularly strong indication, if more were needed, that he exercised the independent judgment that was required of him. The exercise of that judgment culminated in his endorsement of the assessment of the evidence by the magistrate.
	
	
	For these reasons, I agree with Basten JA that the summons should be dismissed with costs.
	
	
	SACKVILLE AJA: I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Basten JA and Simpson JA.
	
	
	It is surprising that the precise nature of the rehearing on an appeal to the District Court pursuant to s 11(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (Appeal and Review Act) is apparently not yet settled. The judgments of Basten JA and Simpson JA show that the statutory scheme for appeals to the District Court against convictions in the Local Court presents a number of inter-related questions of construction. Among these is the question of whether the District Court has an implied power to remit a matter to the Local Court and, if not, whether the omission suggests that an appeal to that Court is not limited to the identification of error.
	
	
	The issues of construction canvassed in the judgments of Basten JA and Simpson JA were not the subject of full argument on the application for judicial review. Their Honours’ judgments indicate that regardless of which of the competing constructions (assuming they are the only alternatives) is correct, the application must be dismissed. I prefer not to express an opinion on the question of construction until it is necessary to do so.
	
	
	I add the following observations on what I understood to be the principal argument advanced on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions in this Court were not closely tailored to the requirement that jurisdictional error must be established in order for the Court to intervene. Nonetheless, I understood Mr Bellanto QC, who appeared with Mr Hodgson for the applicant, to submit that the District Court Judge failed to address an argument put to him and thus fell into jurisdictional error. The particular argument that was not addressed, so Mr Bellanto submitted, was that the Magistrate considered only the veracity of the complainants’ evidence and did not give proper consideration to the applicant’s evidence in determining whether the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It is true that an argument was advanced in the District Court that the Magistrate made no findings as to the applicant’s demeanour and provided no explanation as to why the applicant’s denial of wrongdoing did not create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. If the District Court Judge overlooked this argument on the appeal, his Honour may well have constructively failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by ss 11 and 20 of the Appeal and Review Act.
	
	
	The District Court Judge expressly referred to the submissions that the Magistrate did not expose any reasoning process for rejecting the applicant’s evidence. His Honour rejected the submission for these reasons: [54] 
	


“Certainly, with the benefit of hindsight, it may have been preferable if the Magistrate had made some express observations concerning the basis for the rejection of the appellant’s evidence. It is implicit, however, in the way her Honour approached the task that she was acutely conscious that she must acquit unless she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the complainant’s evidence. And it follows from an assessment of the whole of her reasons that there was nothing arising from the evidence of the appellant, either in its content, or the way it was given, which gives rise to reasonable doubt.”

In the passage set out in Basten JA’s judgment, [55]  the District Court Judge went on to explain why he did not think a basis had been established for overturning the findings made by the Magistrate.


	
	In my view, the District Court Judge did not overlook or fail to consider the argument identified by Mr Bellanto. Whether his Honour was correct in rejecting the argument is not a matter that arises on the present application. It follows that his Honour did not fall into jurisdictional error in the manner contended for by Mr Bellanto.
	
	
	I agree with Basten JA and Simpson JA that the appellant has not established any other jurisdictional error on the part of the District Court Judge.

		30 July 2015",2015-07-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2767327,R v Murray [2015] NSWSC 1034,"Judgment


	
	On 11 June 2015, David Robert Francis Murray entered a plea of guilty to the murder in November 2013 of his de facto partner of some 3 years, Ms Keeli Antoinette Dutton, who he had stabbed 7 times in the back and allowed to bleed to death from her wounds. That plea was entered shortly before his trial, which was fixed to commence on 6 July 2015.
	
	
	He now stands for sentence for his offence.
	


This Court’s sentencing task


	
	I begin by dealing with the submission advanced for Mr Murray that there has been a large amount of recent publicity concerning the level of domestic violence in the community, which ought not to give rise to a consideration that his case falls into a special category, calling for increased sentences reflecting the need for denunciation of such offending and deterrence. Support for this submission was submitted to be found in observations made in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120, in relation to one punch offences.
	
	
	Offences involving domestic violence, of which very often, but not always, women and children are the victims, are particularly abhorred in our civil society, because they are committed by the very people who should be interested in protecting, rather than harming, those who they have injured. That is why the Parliament enacted the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW), under which the apprehended violence order by which Mr Murray was bound when he killed Ms Dutton, was made. As was explained in the Second Reading Speech, that legislation was enacted in order to better address domestic and family violence (see New South Wales, Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 16 November 2007 at 4327).
	
	
	When any offender is being sentenced for an offence involving domestic violence, that fact, together with the particular acts which constitute the offence must be considered in assessing not only the objective gravity of the offence, but also in determining what role specific and general deterrence, as well as the other objectives of sentencing, must play in the particular sentence which is imposed on the offender. That exercise must be undertaken in accordance with what the legislation which the Parliament has enacted and binding case law requires, in the particular sentencing exercise.
	
	
	In Loveridge, it was observed at [103] that the earlier authorities there referred to had established that “violence on the streets, especially by young men in company and under the influence of alcohol and drugs, is all too common and needs to be addressed by sentences that carry a very significant degree of general deterrence …”. It was also considered that specific deterrence had to feature in the sentence imposed in that case. In a similar way, domestic violence offences, of which there can be no more serious example than murder, remain all too common and also need to be addressed by sentences that carry necessary degrees of general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	As was observed in Hiron v R [2007] NSWCCA 336 at [32], there in the context of the less serious offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm:
	


“Offences for violent attacks in domestic settings, this Court has emphasised, must be treated with real seriousness. Important factors in sentencing a domestic violence offender are specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the offending conduct and protection of the community: see for example R v Edigarov (2001) 125 A Crim R 551, R v Dunn (2004) 144 A Crim R 180, R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302. As was said by Wood CJ at CL (Studdert and Bell JJ agreeing) in Edigarov at 558 [41]:

“...such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished, and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.””


	
	No different approach can be taken when the domestic violence in question involves the more serious offence of murder.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on Mr Murray must thus reflect the gravity of his offence, viewed objectively in light of the evidence led on sentencing (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354). Mr Murray does not dispute that he must receive a substantial term of imprisonment for the death he has caused, but still, the gravity of his offence is in issue.
	
	
	Disputes about factual findings must be resolved in the way discussed in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27]. That is, facts may not be taken into account in a way that is adverse to an offender, unless they have been established beyond reasonable doubt. However, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the offender, it is enough if they are proved on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	In arriving at Mr Murray’s sentence, the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) must also be borne in mind. They are:
	


“(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)    to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)    to protect the community from the offender,

(d)    to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)    to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)    to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)    to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”


	
	Mr Murray’s sentence must be determined in light of the maximum penalty imposed for the crime in question, which in the case of murder, is life imprisonment (s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).
	
	
	Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires, however, that the sentence of life imprisonment only be imposed if the Court is satisfied that the offender’s level of culpability in the commission of the murder is so extreme, that the community’s interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. The maximum sentence of life imprisonment is thus reserved for extreme offences of murder.
	
	
	It is for the Crown to establish that an offence falls within s 61(1). It did not seek to do so in this case. Having considered the evidence, I accept the parties’ common position that this is not a case which warrants the imposition of the maximum sentence, notwithstanding the obvious seriousness of Mr Murray’s offence.
	
	
	The Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment for an offence of murder, which falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences (Pt 4, Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 54A(2) and table). Such a non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender must serve in prison, before being eligible to be released on parole, for the balance of the sentence imposed for the offence. Where in the range Mr Murray’s offence falls, is also in issue.
	
	
	Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are factors which must be taken into account on sentencing, together with other relevant matters, in the way discussed by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 and as is now provided in s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Under s 22 of that Act, a plea of guilty must also be taken into account in determining the sentence.
	
	
	In accordance with s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the seriousness of an offence must be assessed by taking into account only the objective factors affecting its relative seriousness. The offender’s moral culpability for the offence must also be taken into account (see Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600).
	
	
	On sentencing, the Court must also consider identified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence, which the parties have addressed in their submissions, as well as any other objective or subjective factors revealed by the evidence, which affect the relative seriousness of the offence (see s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). Consideration must also be given to questions of general and specific deterrence, as I have explained.
	
	
	All of these relevant factors must be taken into account by way of the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]. That requires the sentencing judge to identify all of the factors that are relevant in the particular case, discussing their significance and making a value judgment as to what the appropriate sentence for that offence is. The sentence so imposed must ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]).
	
	
	Regard must also be paid to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed on an offender must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period imposed, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances which warrant a departure from that ratio.
	
	
	If there is to be any such adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve for the offence committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628 - 629). In this case, however, Mr Murray, does not press for a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	In this case, it is also necessary to mention the effect of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), which applies to “serious violence offences”, which under s 5A, includes the offence of murder.
	
	
	The effect of this Act is that the State can apply to the Supreme Court for an order that the offender continue to receive supervision or remain in detention, at the end of the sentence. If the Court is then satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that the offender would be a “high risk offender”, that is, an offender who poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision, it may make an order under s 5F for an offender’s extended supervision. An order for continuing detention may be made under s 5G, if the Court is then satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.
	


The issues


	
	In this case the issues lying between the parties are limited.
	
	
	They concern the gravity of Mr Murray’s offence; whether the fact that Mr Murray murdered Ms Dutton at their home is an aggravating matter which must be taken into account under s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; and the amount of discount which Mr Murray should receive for his plea. Whether the conditions of his custody should have any mitigating impact on Mr Murray’s sentence and whether there is evidence of remorse, also arise for consideration.
	


The seriousness of this offence


	
	As I have explained, the maximum sentence of life imprisonment is reserved for extreme offences of murder. This was explained in R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448, where it was observed at [60]:
	


""Because the life sentence provided by s.61 of that Act does not contemplate any prospect of relief in the future, no matter how distant, it should be reserved for crimes of the utmost heinousness: Chung [1999] NSWCCA 330, Ibbs v. R. (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-2, Twala NSWCCA 4/11/94, Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 553 at pars.344-4, Harris at 423.""


	
	The evidence establishes that while this was not such a case, it was nevertheless a very serious offence, in my assessment falling above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences.
	
	
	The facts which the parties agreed reveal that Mr Murray killed Ms Dutton while they were alone together at the apartment of a friend, Mr Cribb, which they shared with him. When she was killed, Ms Dutton was defenceless and without help. The offence came to light when Mr Cribb made a 000 call on 26 November 2013 and told the operator that a few hours earlier, Mr Murray had admitted the murder to him, while they were drinking together at a hotel and that Mr Murray had told him that Ms Dutton’s body was at their flat.
	
	
	The words he had used were reported to have been:
	


“I’ve knocked her, I’ve fuckin’ knocked her, I fuckin’ stabbed her seven times in the back and let her bleed to fuckin death” and that “I fuckin really got revved up … That many towels”.


	
	He also said:
	


“she bled to death in your house” and that “I’m certainly not going anywhere near my place at the moment”.


	
	At one point during this account Mr Murray started to get teary eyed. Mr Cribb also said that Mr Murray had told him that he had argued with Ms Dutton the day before about her having pills and not giving him any and giving her daughter a phone, which he wanted and had smashed.
	
	
	Mr Cribb also told the 000 operator that he was afraid that if he returned home, he would be killed.
	
	
	Police then attended the apartment, where there was initially no answer. When they identified themselves, Mr Murray came to the door and when asked about Ms Dutton, said that he had not seen her for a few days. When told that police had information that she had been injured and that they needed to check on her welfare, he initially refused to permit them to enter. Eventually he let them in.
	
	
	There the police found that the apartment smelt of bleach or cleaning products and that an Otto bin was in the middle of the lounge room. There was what appeared to be a blood stain on Mr Murray’s pants, as well as bloodstains on an archway. In the bedroom they found Ms Dutton’s body next to the bed, wrapped in sheets. Mr Murray then became agitated and was arrested for her murder.
	
	
	Subsequent investigations showed that Ms Dutton had collected methadone at 9:30 am on 25 November, before she went to the pub with Mr Murray at 9:47 am. They left at 1:57 pm. Ms Dutton made and received calls on her phone until 7:30 pm, after which calls went to a message bank. It was estimated that her death must have occurred between that time and 8:30 am the next day. Mr Murray collected his methadone at 8:45 am on 26 November, before going to the pub, where he made his confession to Mr Cribb. He left at 1:30 pm. The Otto bin was taken into the apartment at 3:30 pm.
	
	
	Mr Cribb had not returned home until 5 am on 26 November and was home for only about 2 hours, in the company of a Mr Hancock, who saw Mr Murray come out of his bedroom, opening the door only wide enough to allow him to get out and then shutting it behind him.
	
	
	After his arrest, Mr Murray told police that he had drunk alcohol and smoked pot that day, but that he hadn’t seen Ms Dutton that day. He also said “we had a blow up last week. I got an AVO and haven’t seen her”. He also said he had been drinking at the hotel for 2 to 3 hours that day.
	
	
	Mr Murray agreed to an interview, in which he told police that Ms Dutton was his de facto partner. He agreed that he had been in the apartment when police arrived. He did not agree that police had found Ms Dutton’s body there, but said that he had last seen her on Sunday, 24 November. That was untrue. He also denied his confession to Mr Cribb, but then said “he’s full of shit, it [sic] strange he’s come and done that and I’m getting the blame”.
	
	
	Forensic testing on Mr Murray’s pants determined that the stain matched Ms Dutton’s DNA profile. Various items removed from the apartment, the Otto bin and a bin outside, were tested for human blood, including knives. Stains on the underside of a mattress, a plastic bag found in the Otto bin and a roll of plastic bags found in the laundry room also matched Ms Dutton’s DNA profile. Three of the fingerprints on the roll of plastic bags matched Mr Murray’s fingerprints.
	
	
	The autopsy established that the cause of Ms Dutton’s death was the 7 stab wounds inflicted to her back, with the weapon passing into both her lungs and her left deep jugular vein. There was also relatively minor blunt force injury to her neck and head. One of these wounds was fatal, one dangerous, three survivable with treatment, one going to muscle only and only one which posed no problem for survival.
	
	
	Toxicological examination established that Ms Dutton’s alcohol reading was 0.184 and she also had a reading of 1.82 mg/L for methadone. The expert opinion of Dr Farrar, a forensic pharmacologist, was that irrespective of Ms Dutton’s tolerance to drugs and alcohol, the effects of the consumption of this level of methadone and alcohol would have caused significant sedation and probably, respiratory depression. The combination would also have reduced her ability to perceive any threat to her safety and her ability to defend herself against physical attack. That was consistent with the absence of any defensive wounds on her body.
	
	
	This evidence underscores the seriousness of Mr Murray’s offence. Mr Murray later told Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, who examined him in May 2015, that he had no memory of his offence, or of the events between Ms Dutton’s death and his arrest. Dr Nielssen observed that this was consistent with Mr Murray having at the time taken a large amount of sedative, which he could not, however, then remember taking. He could, however, remember other things leading up to the murder.
	
	
	Mr Murray gave no evidence on sentencing and so what he said to Dr Nielssen has to be approached with caution, he not having been prepared to give evidence, or be cross-examined on the account he gave to Dr Nielssen.
	
	
	What Mr Murray told Dr Nielssen also has to be considered in light of what the agreed facts received on sentencing establish. They are consistent with Mr Murray knowing that he had killed Ms Dutton, at the time of his arrest. Not only had he earlier that day, told Mr Cribb what he had done, in terms consistent with what was later established when Ms Dutton’s body was found, he had also taken steps to conceal what he had done, including by acquiring cleaning products and other items, clearly intending then to dispose of her body.
	
	
	After his arrest, Mr Murray told police not only that he had consumed drugs and alcohol that day and that he had gone to the pub, he also revealed that he was bound by an AVO order and claimed that he hadn’t seen Ms Dutton. He also then denied having been found with her body. That was inconsistent with his admission to Mr Cribb. His claim that it was Mr Cribb who had killed Ms Dutton was also consistent with his then knowledge of what he had done and an attempt to deflect blame from himself.
	
	
	This was not the conduct of a person who in November 2013 had no memory of what he had done to Ms Dutton, namely, that he had killed her deliberately, by stabbing her 7 times in the back, almost all of the wounds he inflicted being serious and one of itself fatal. Even though Ms Dutton was clearly defenceless and without help, Mr Murray then callously let her to bleed to death, as he told Mr Cribb in graphic terms. That he could have summoned the help she then so desperately needed, after his violent attack, is apparent on the agreed facts.
	
	
	There is, accordingly, no question that Mr Murray intended to kill Ms Dutton, rather than merely to cause her grievous bodily harm, as he accepted on sentencing.
	
	
	There can also be no question that objectively, this was a most serious offence, involving a brutal killing of a defenceless woman, Mr Murray’s partner at the home which they shared. The parties agreed that at the time, Mr Murray was aware of the terms of the AVO which bound him, it having been served on him personally. It obliged him not to assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with Ms Dutton, nor to engage in any other conduct that intimidated her and not to stalk her. There can be no more serious breach of such an order than to kill the person it is designed to protect.
	
	
	In the result, this, I am satisfied was an offence which undoubtedly falls above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences.
	


Moral culpability


	
	There is evidence that Mr Murray suffers mental illness. The impact on his moral culpability for his offence thus arises for consideration.
	
	
	Mr Murray was examined by Dr Nielssen in 2015. His June report disclosed that Mr Murray had been living with Ms Dutton, with whom he had had an on/off relationship for some three years including a period during which he had been in custody. He told Dr Nielssen that they were both substance abusers, consuming alcohol, methamphetamine, cannabis and sedative medications. Mr Murray also told Dr Nielssen that an AVO had been taken out in favour of Ms Dutton after a previous incident at a time when they had both been intoxicated. He said the condition was “not to drink around each other because the courts knew we lived with each other”. It was, in fact, more onerous than that.
	
	
	Mr Murray told Dr Nielssen that he had no memory of the offence or the events between Ms Dutton’s death and his arrest, but he did remember going to the methadone clinic that day to collect his usual dose and consuming 80mg of methadone, as well as a hundred dollars of methamphetamine, or 0.2 grams, as well as 7 or 8 schooners of beer. Mr Murray said he could not remember taking any sedatives, but could not rule out having done so.
	
	
	Mr Murray also remembered arguing with Ms Dutton, but not what about. He said that his next memory was of police knocking on the door, asking about Ms Dutton, searching the flat and charging him with murder. He did not remember cleaning the flat, wrapping Ms Dutton’s body, or talking to Mr Cribb.
	
	
	Mr Murray said, as to his state of mind, that it was all a bit of a blur and that his use of sedatives had caused him to have large gaps in his memory; and that methamphetamines made him very paranoid, which he said was “like not knowing if someone was going to want to hurt me … hearing someone talking about someone else and thinking they are talking about me”.
	
	
	Mr Murray also told Dr Nielssen that Ms Dutton had bipolar disorder; that she had assaulted him in the past, when in a disturbed state of mind; and that he had been anxious that she might attack him again, but he had no memory of believing that she was about to attack him, or believing that she planned to kill him, on the day of his offence. He claimed, however, then to have no memory of either the offence, or why he might have committed it.
	
	
	After his arrest, Mr Murray was admitted to the Mental Health Screening Unit at the MRRC and then transferred to other wings in the mental health unit. He said there he experienced hallucinations of voices, hearing people calling out his name, seeing things, hearing her family say things, even though he did not know who they were or what they looked like. He had then received treatment and the symptoms had abated.
	
	
	Mr Murray understood that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was still taking sedating antipsychotic medications. His contact with mental health services had mainly been in the last few years, he said, after he had started using methamphetamine. He reported no family history of mental illness or treatment for any psychiatric disorder and no contact with mental health services as a child, or adolescent. He had attempted suicide in custody in 2011.
	
	
	Mr Murray also said that his general health was “not too bad”, but after his last release from custody he was referred to a psychologist, which he had found helpful. He was also being treated for active hepatitis C and reported having in the past been resuscitated, after several overdoses of heroin. He had also, in the past, woken covered in blood, in weird places, after being knocked out.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen found Mr Murray's intelligence to be within the normal range, consistent with his reported literacy and social performance. He diagnosed him to be suffering from substance use disorder; a substance induced psychotic illness and a depressive illness. This diagnosis rested on Mr Murray’s account of a pattern of regular use of hazardous quantities of alcohol, cannabis and methamphetamine; his history of long term opiate addiction; and his abuse of sedatives. Dr Nielssen said that Mr Murray had also reported complications of drug use, including the role of long term substance use in his many past offences and the probable role of intoxication in the recent offence.
	
	
	The diagnosis of a psychotic illness rested on Mr Murray’s history of typical auditory hallucination and related persecutory beliefs, following the onset of regular methamphetamine use, some five years before Ms Dutton’s murder and his treatment with antipsychotic medication after arrest, with which he is still being treated. Dr Nielssen diagnosed a psychotic illness, rather than schizophrenia, because of the late onset of Mr Murray’s symptoms; the close relationship between their onset and his methamphetamine use; and the absence of objective features of chronic mental illness during his interview, when Dr Nielssen said Mr Murray was depressed, not showing active psychotic illness and lack of elaboration in answers, consistent with depression and schizophrenia. He found Mr Murray to be alert and maintaining attention throughout the interview, in which he had also displayed knowledge of recent events.
	
	
	Mr Murray maintained that he had no memory of killing Ms Dutton and on the information available, Dr Nielssen concluded that he had no defence of mental illness available to him. His psychotic illness was not a transient state of mind, and so Dr Nielssen considered it to be an underlying condition. He concluded that it was impossible to assess whether the symptoms of that illness had affected Mr Murray’s perceptions of events, his ability to judge right from wrong and his capacity to control himself at the time he killed Ms Dutton. That he has mental health issues is supported by records tendered from NSW Health, which include relevant clinical notes.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen observed, however, that it appeared unlikely that Mr Murray would have committed the offence, but for the effect of self-induced intoxication with methamphetamine and a large quantity of alcohol. In the result, he concluded that amnesia offered him no advantage, but suggested that he had taken a relatively large dose of sedative medication, known to result in memory loss for large periods. Dr Nielssen accordingly considered him to be fit to be tried.
	
	
	That Mr Murray was fit was supported by the plea which he entered after receiving Dr Nielssen’s report, as well as legal advice, and by the statement of facts which he later accepted, was correct. As I have explained, that statement raised some questions as to the account which he gave Dr Nielssen, which were not answered because, as was his right, Mr Murray chose not to give evidence at the sentencing hearing. That means, however, that caution has to be exercised in reaching conclusions based on the report he gave Dr Nielssen.
	
	
	Mr Murray’s history is one of self-induced addiction at an age of rational choice. That has long been recognised as establishing moral culpability for the predictable consequences of such choices and that those who choose a course of addiction, must be treated as also choosing its consequences (see the discussion in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [185] - [202]).
	
	
	It is also settled, however, that an offender’s mental condition can have the effect of reducing his or her moral culpability and that matters such as general deterrence, retribution and denunciation may then have less weight to play in the sentence which is imposed on the offender (see Muldrock at [53]). Even, however, where there is a causal relationship between a mental disorder and an offence, that will not automatically result in a reduced sentence (see R v Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71. The evidence established no such causal connection in this case. It did establish, however, that Mr Murray is a considerable danger to the community when he is at large.
	
	
	As discussed in Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1998] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476, the purposes of sentencing overlap and often point in different directions. This is such a case. Mr Murray is an offender whose drug abuse has been pursued for many years and who has now developed mental disorders. Dr Nielssen’s view that it was his self-induced intoxication which was the more likely explanation for his offending on this occasion, was supported by other evidence received on sentencing. It follows that even if it be accepted that Mr Murray’s moral culpability for this offence, is somewhat less than it would have been if he did not suffer from those disorders, it is still high.
	
	
	Like in Veen [No 2], the evidence in this case thus has two countervailing effects, one which tends towards a somewhat shorter custodial sentence, the other towards a longer one. It will be necessary to return to this when discussing deterrence. It must be noted, however, that these considerations cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed on Mr Murray, had he not been suffering from the mental disorders which Dr Nielssen diagnosed.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The aggravating factors specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which the parties agreed were relevant to this sentencing exercise were firstly, that Mr Murray has a record of previous convictions, and is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence, having a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences (s 21A(2)(d)); and secondly, that his offence was committed while he was on conditional liberty in relation to another offence (s 21A(2)(j)).
	


Conditional liberty


	
	When he killed Ms Dutton, Mr Murray was subject to a good behaviour bond which had been imposed upon him on 20 June 2013 in the Local Court, for failing to appear in relation to drug and dishonesty charges. He was also subject to the AVO made in favour of Ms Dutton.
	
	
	There could be no more serious breach of a good behaviour bond than to murder the person protected by the AVO which bound Mr Murray. It follows this was a serious, aggravating factor to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise.
	


Mr Murray’s record


	
	Overall, Mr Murray’s record is one of considerable violence, committed over the course of his adult life. It began in 1982 when a sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 months was imposed upon him for assault with intent to rob with wounding. It includes a robbery while armed offence in 1989; an assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence in 1995; an assault police officer offence in 2001; a common assault in 2002; a stalk with intimidation offence, as well as a wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm offence in 2008; and an assault occasion actual bodily harm offence in 2011.
	
	
	This is a record which Mr Murray accepted disentitled him to leniency, but he submitted, it did not increase the objective seriousness of his offence. That may be accepted, it being settled that prior offending cannot result in a sentence which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence for which the sentence is being imposed (see Veen [No 2] at 477).
	
	
	This record also, however, gives rise to the need for deterrence to feature in the sentence imposed upon Mr Murray, a matter to which I will return.
	


The place of this offending


	
	The provisions of s 21A(2)(eb) need also to be mentioned. It provides that an aggravating factor is:
	


“(eb)   the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person”


	
	It became common ground between the parties that this ought not to be regarded as an aggravating feature of Mr Murray’s offence, because of the view taken in the authorities, as to the proper construction of this provision. Rather, they agreed, the fact that Mr Murray killed Ms Dutton in the home which they shared, should be taken into account in assessing the overall nature and seriousness of his offence.
	
	
	At common law, the fact that an offence is committed in the home in which both the offender and the victim reside, is not a circumstance of aggravation and so, in accordance with s 21A(4), has not been considered to be an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(eb) (see R v Gazi Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125; EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 119; (2010) 79 NSWLR 740 at [79]; Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [112]; R v BIP [2011] NSWCCA 224 at [61]; MH v R [2011] NSWCCA 230 at [34]; Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [72]).
	
	
	The correctness of that construction has been questioned, but the issue has not been resolved (see Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 at [44] Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214 at [47]; Oh Hyunwook v R [2010] NSWCCA 148 at [40] and Aktar v R [2015] NSWCCA 123 at [1], [2] and [55]).
	
	
	In the result, I accept the parties’ common position that on currently binding authority, the fact that Mr Murray murdered Ms Dutton at the home which they shared, is not a separate, aggravating factor to be taken into account under s 21A(2)(eb), but a part of the matrix of factors which must be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of his offence. I have accordingly taken this factor into account, in the conclusions I came to, as to the seriousness of this offence.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	Under s 21A(5AA) an offender’s self-induced intoxication at the time the offence was committed is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentencing.
	
	
	The parties agreed that the mitigating matter specified in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevant to take into account in this case was Mr Murray’s plea, to which I will return.
	


Remorse - s 21A(3)(i)


	
	It was also submitted for Mr Murray that it would be accepted that his confession to Mr Cribb could be considered to evidence some remorse on his part. That submission may not be accepted, s 21A(3)(i) providing as it does that a mitigating factor is:
	


“(i)   the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both),”


	
	Not only did Mr Murray not give evidence at the sentencing hearing as to his remorse, it was not a matter which he raised with Dr Nielssen, who examined him in May 2015. Earlier, when confronted by police, he not only denied his admission to Mr Cribb, but sought to attribute the blame for Ms Dutton’s death to him. I have outlined what Mr Murray agreed he had confessed to Mr Cribb. It would defy common sense to accept that this callous, dreadful account of what he did to Ms Dutton, evidenced remorse of any kind.
	
	
	I also cannot find that Mr Murray’s conduct shows either remorse, or an acceptance of his responsibility for his actions. Nor has he acknowledged the injury, loss and damage which he has caused, or made any reparation.
	
	
	The fact is that apart from the entry of the late plea in the face of what was unquestionably a very strong Crown case, Mr Murray has taken no responsibility for what he did to Ms Dutton, let alone shown that he has any remorse for his truly awful offence. It follows that remorse is not a mitigating factor which can be taken into account in his case.
	


Mr Murray’s awareness of the consequences of his actions - s 21A(3)(j)


	
	It was accepted for Mr Murray that before his underlying psychotic illness could be taken into account as a mitigating factor, a causal connection had to be established between his illness and his offence. Dr Nielssen found it impossible to come to such a view, given Mr Murray’s claimed inability to remember the circumstances of the offence.
	
	
	As I have explained, Mr Murray told Dr Nielssen that, at the time he killed Ms Dutton, he was affected by drugs and alcohol, to an unspecified degree. He had for many years been dependent on illicit substances, his addiction accounting for much of his record, being the result it was submitted, of attempts to obtain money for drugs.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen concluded that Mr Murray’s offence was more likely to have been the effects of self-induced intoxication, than his mental conditions. That conclusion is consistent with the agreed facts. In the result, it must be concluded that this mitigating factor was also not established.
	


Hardship of custody


	
	A letter provided from Justice Corrective Services after the sentencing hearing revealed that as the result of a request which Mr Murray made, he is presently held in custody, in Special Management Area Placement (“SMAP”) at his own request and for a period in October 2014, he was held in segregation. SMAP inmates are held in an area where inmates who require protection can be safely managed. There they have access to programs and services.
	
	
	It is settled that protective custody can only be taken into account on sentencing where there is evidence that the conditions of imprisonment will be more onerous as a result (see RWB v R; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147; (2010) 202 A Crim R 209 at [192] - [195]). I am not satisfied that there is such evidence.
	
	
	The submission made on sentencing was that SMAP custody precluded access to work. There was no evidence about this. The onus fell on Mr Murray to establish such matters by evidence (see Clarkson v R [2007] NSWCCA 70; (2007) 209 FCR 387 at [273]).
	
	
	On the information provided, hardship in custody cannot be taken into account as a mitigating matter in this case.
	


The offender's personal circumstances


	
	On sentence, account must also be taken of Mr Murray’s personal circumstances, about which he told Dr Nielssen.
	
	
	Mr Murray is the second of four siblings, but has had little contact with his family for some years. His father was a fitter and turner and his mother a public servant. He had four children as the result of a long term relationship, who, on his account, have all done well in life. Apart from Ms Dutton, he has had no other serious relationships. He reported no lifelong friendships.
	
	
	Mr Murray reported no learning or conduct problems at school, apart from truanting. He completed Year 10 with good marks and had been good at various sports. He began smoking cannabis at around age 14 and drinking alcohol when he left school. He said that his drug of choice during adulthood had been heroin and in the last 5 or 6 years, methamphetamine. He had used sedatives to help him come down from methamphetamines. He had also been taking methadone for some 27 years.
	
	
	Mr Murray was first imprisoned as an 18 year old and since then has spent over 17 years in custody. He is now aged 51. He tried a number of drug rehabilitation places when he was younger, without success. He was able, however, to work as a labourer in the construction industry, when not incarcerated and was also usually employed in some capacity, when in custody, in order to pass the time.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen found that Mr Murray is a person of average intelligence. He had a normal upbringing and childhood, but commenced use of cannabis at a young age and alcohol when he left school. His drug and alcohol abuse has been a factor in a number of his offences and altercations over the years. His offending commenced at age 18, with subsequent heavy, ongoing drug abuse associated with violent offending, repeated incarceration and eventually the contraction of mental disorders. Despite this, Mr Murray was able to form a long term relationship which produced children, as well as his relationship with Ms Dutton.
	
	
	This is sadly, a history of the kind discussed in R v Henry, long term offending associated with self-induced drug and alcohol abuse, which has led Mr Murray not only to the repeated pursuit of offences to fund his drug addiction, but also to the violent offending which has finally resulted in the worst conceivable outcome, the deliberate taking of a life.
	


Deterrence


	
	The circumstances of Mr Murray’s offence are such that, in my view, for a number of reasons, there can be no question that both general and specific deterrence must feature in the sentence which is imposed upon him, notwithstanding the mental disorders Dr Nielssen concluded he has developed.
	
	
	Inflicting death is the most serious offence of domestic violence which an offender can commit. On the agreed facts, this offence was committed not only at a time when Mr Murray knew he was bound by the AVO made in favour of Ms Dutton, he was also aware, he told Dr Nielssen, of the connection between his drug and alcohol abuse and his violent offending. Knowing all of this, he deliberately allowed his defenceless partner to bleed to death, rather than seeking help for her, after he had repeatedly stabbed her over, on his account to Mr Cribb, a trivial disagreement. He also then took steps to conceal what he had done and on arrest, sought to blame Mr Cribb, for his offence.
	
	
	While Mr Murray has gone beyond addiction to the point of development of mental disorders, on what he confessed to Mr Cribb, it is apparent that despite his illness and intoxication he knew what he was doing when he killed Ms Dutton. In the result, there is little room to reduce the role which general deterrence must play in this sentence (see R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 - 51).
	
	
	The evidence establishes, beyond reasonable doubt, that like the offender who arose to be considered in Veen [No 2], Mr Murray is a grave danger to society when he goes at large. On the evidence in his case, both general and specific deterrence must play a role in the sentence imposed upon him.
	


Discount on sentence for the guilty plea


	
	It was common ground that it is within my discretion to grant Mr Murray a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, in accordance with the Court of Criminal Appeal's guideline judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.
	
	
	The purpose of such a utilitarian discount was there explained by the then Chief Justice as reflecting the benefits which flow from a guilty plea, for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as to witnesses and victims who, as the result of such a plea, are spared having to give evidence and the personal rumination of traumatic events, which is inevitably involved in that process. In some cases, however, a plea may not result in any discount at all (see Thomson; Houlton at [157] - [158]).
	
	
	A trial judge must identify these benefits when sentencing, in order to provide an incentive to offenders to enter such a plea, so that such benefits will, in fact, be derived (see Thomson; Houlton at [115] - [123]).
	
	
	Mr Murray’s plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity and so the maximum discount of 25% is not available to him. It was, however, entered some time before the hearing and so benefits of the kind discussed in Thomson; Houlton have still flown from the entry of the plea.
	
	
	The parties agreed that in the circumstances a 15% discount would not involve error, but the Crown contended for 12.5%. The difference in percentage terms is not great, but in a lengthy sentence such as that which has to be imposed on Mr Murray, it is significant.
	
	
	The considerations which must be taken into account when a utilitarian discount is fixed are those discussed in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. Sentencing judges are obliged to follow that decision (see R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229; (2011) 59 MVR 356 at [3]). These considerations include that the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea will be determined largely by the timing of the plea, so that the earlier the plea, the greater discount; generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant, because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced; the amount of the discount does not depend upon the administrative arrangements or any practice in a particular court; and that there may be offences that are so serious, that no discount should be given and where the protection of the public requires a longer sentence.
	
	
	In this case, the timing of the plea was submitted to have been the result, in part, of the need to have Mr Murray’s fitness assessed by Dr Nielssen and the requirements of the Local Court as to when pleas must be entered, which, it was argued, had not been sufficiently taken into account in Borkowski.
	
	
	These submissions may not be accepted. It is settled that the utilitarian value of a plea will be determined largely by its timing, irrespective of the practices of the courts, or the reasons for the delay. Borkowski is binding on sentencing judges and may not be departed from, for the reasons here advanced for Mr Murray.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was unarguably always a strong one. The guilty plea was a belated recognition that Mr Murray’s conviction was likely, as the facts he later agreed confirmed. These facts do reveal that protection of the public is an important aspect of the sentence which must be imposed on Mr Murray, for reasons which I have discussed.
	
	
	In the result, I have concluded that, given the lateness of his plea, the seriousness of the offence and the undoubted need for community protection in the sentence which must be imposed on Mr Murray, the discount for his plea should be 12.5%.
	


Other decided cases


	
	The parties referred to various cases where sentences of various lengths have been imposed on other offenders. I have considered those submissions, but found them to be of limited assistance.
	
	
	The authorities relied on for Mr Murray at the hearing reflected sentences ranging from 29 years, with a non-parole period of 22 years, for a stabbing murder committed during a violent struggle, after a trial; to 14 years, with a non-parole period of 10 years, after a 25% discount for a plea to murder by strangling, which reflects a starting point of 18 years.
	
	
	The cases later argued for Mr Murray to be particularly relevant were:
	



	
	R v Bolt [2013] NSWSC 895, which involved an offence found to have been slightly below the mid-range, after Mr Bolt gave evidence; where there was no intention to kill; the deceased was found to have been the aggressor in part; a plea was entered at the earliest opportunity; a high level of remorse and real prospects of rehabilitation were found; and where a sentence of 18 years with a non-parole period of 12 years was imposed.
	
	
	R v Kennedy [2013] NSWCCA 1940 which involved multiple blows without a weapon; there was a plea at call over, for which a 12.5% discount was allowed; the offender had a record of violence, intoxication and a mental illness not causally connected to the offence, with uncertain prospects of rehabilitation; where a sentence of 23 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 17 years and 6 months was imposed.
	
	
	R v Lutu [2014] NSWSC 413 which involved a stabbing murder, after an argument over financial difficulties where there had been an AVO; where an intention to kill was found in a serious example of murder in a domestic relationship, where moral culpability was found to be high; but a plea was entered at the earliest opportunity; there were no psychiatric or drug and alcohol issues, but genuine remorse and an unlikelihood of reoffending found. A sentence of 18 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 14 years was imposed.
	
	
	R v Serutawake [2014] NSWSC 413 which involved a stabbing murder with conviction following a trial, at which a defence of provocation and defence of another was not accepted. The murder involved 22 wounds, 5 of which were potentially fatal, including defensive wounds. Intoxication was found to be out of character and cannabis abuse not causally connected with the offence. There were real expressions of regret and remorse and very good prospects of rehabilitation found. A sentence of 21 years with a non-parole period of 16 years was imposed.
	
	
	R v Johnson [2015] NSWSC 31 where a sentence of 21 years was imposed, with a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months. There death resulted from multiple blunt force trauma, as well as multiple superficial wounds with a sharp instrument, following a violent rage brought about by alcohol and jealousy. There was a plea on arraignment following an offer to plea in the Local Court to manslaughter, resulting in a little less than 20% discount. There were earlier assaults on the same partner, with a finding of reduced moral culpability because of childhood exposure to violence, drugs and alcohol; remorse was found, but rehabilitation was considered to be speculative.
	



	
	These were all unquestionably serious offences, but they all have relevant differences, which it is unnecessary to discuss. The position is that the sentences imposed in these and other cases, on other offenders, shed but little light on how Mr Murray must be sentenced for his offence, having regard to all of the matters revealed by the evidence and the sentencing principles which are relevant in his case, which I have earlier discussed.
	
	
	As discussed in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520, in a sentencing exercise such as this, what the Court must achieve is consistency in the application of relevant principles, not some equivalence with sentences imposed in other cases, where those principles have been applied to the different circumstances there arising to be considered, in respect of other offenders and the offences which they have committed.
	


Special circumstances


	
	Mr Murray presents a considerable risk that he will engage in further violent offending, once released. He did not seek a finding of special circumstances, accepting that he would be subjected to a lengthy period of supervision, if released on parole, when his non-parole period expires.
	
	
	On the evidence, he will certainly require the closest and most careful supervision, whenever he is released on parole, given the nature of his record, the seriousness of his offence and the obvious risks which he presents of further violent offending, once released.
	
	
	In my assessment, given the sentence necessarily to be imposed upon him, the result of the statutory ratio will provide such a period of supervision. In the result, there is no need for any finding of special circumstances.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	Two moving victim impact statements were read out in open court at the sentencing hearing, one which had been made by Ms Dutton’s parents and the other by her brother.
	
	
	Under s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act), on the application of the prosecutor and if the Court considers it appropriate to do so, those statements may be considered and taken into account on sentencing Mr Murray, on the basis that the harmful impact of Ms Dutton’s death on the members of her immediate family, is an aspect of the harm done to the community. There was no objection by Mr Murray to account being taken of those statements.
	
	
	It has long been recognised that all human life is precious and that the death of any person is a harm which an offender inflicts on the community generally. One life cannot be valued over that of another. Nevertheless, in this case, I consider that the victim impact statements should be taken into account on sentencing, shedding light as they do on the particular harm which this murder has done to Ms Dutton’s family. Accordingly, I have taken them into account in sentencing Mr Murray.
	
	
	For myself, I also wish to observe that the tragic reality is that Ms Dutton’s death was an awful and lonely one, defenceless and without help as she was when her death was so needlessly caused.
	
	
	Ms Dutton’s family and friends all have my very deepest sympathy at her terrible loss. What her family, in particular, must continue to bear, not only as the result of her death, but also as the result of the terrible way that it was brought about, is, it seems to me, very difficult for others of us to fully comprehend. Their sad plight is, however, acknowledged. What they must endure has not been overlooked by the community of which we are all members together.
	
	
	It is to be hoped that Mr Murray’s acknowledgment of his wrongdoing by the entry of his guilty plea and the sentencing proceedings which have followed, will give them some small measure of comfort, by revealing how our society and the legal system it has created, has operated to deal with the awful offence which Ms Dutton’s killing involved.
	


The sentence


	
	The parties agreed that the sentence imposed on Mr Murray must commence on the date of his arrest on 26 November 2013.
	
	
	Having considered all of the matters I have mentioned, I have concluded that after a 12.5% discount for his plea, Mr Murray must be sentenced to a term of 25 years 4 months imprisonment. The application of the statutory ratio results in a non-parole period of 19 years and a balance of term of 6 years 4 months. This reflects a starting point of 29 years for Mr Murray’s offence.
	
	
	This means that the earliest date that Mr Murray will be eligible for release is 25 November 2032. That will depend on Mr Murray convincing the Parole Authority that he should then be released on parole. His sentence will expire on 25 March 2039.
	


Orders


	
	David Robert Francis Murray you are convicted of the murder of Keeli Antoinette Dutton.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 25 years 4 months, commencing on 26 November 2013 with a non-parole period of 19 years, expiring on 25 November 2032.
	
	
	I set a balance of term of 6 years 4 months, which is to expire on 25 March 2039.

2767330,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 9) [2015] NSWSC 1056,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	On 26 May 2015 I made orders setting aside a Subpoena issued on behalf of the accused Glen Patrick McNamara (“McNamara”) and directed to the Australian Crime Commission (“the Commission”): R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 619. In circumstances where the Commission had foreshadowed that it would seek an order for costs if the Subpoena was set aside, I made further orders in relation to the provision of written submissions, which I have now received. This judgment deals with the question of whether an order for costs should be made in favour of the Commission. There is no dispute between the parties that I have the power to make such an order.
	


THE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE APPLICATION FOR COSTS


	
	The Commission’s application was supported by an affidavit of Benjamin May, solicitor, of 1 June 2015 which was read without objection. That affidavit establishes (inter alia) the following.
	
	
	On 29 April 2015, following service of the Subpoena on the Commission, Mr May wrote to Mr Lu who at that time was McNamara’s solicitor. In doing so, Mr May highlighted s. 51(3) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (“the Act”) which confers, upon the Commission, immunity from production in certain defined circumstances. The correspondence also made reference to the necessity on the part of McNamara to establish a legitimate forensic purpose for seeking the documents set out in the Subpoena. Mr May concluded by inviting Mr Lu to provide (inter alia) particulars of that purpose. Mr Lu did not reply to that letter.
	
	
	Mr May wrote to Mr Lu again on 5 May 2015, stating (inter alia) the following:
	


“2. In our letter (dated 29 April 2015) we noted that s. 51(3) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) may provide a complete answer to the subpoena.

3. We have now received instructions confirming that none of the exceptions set out in s. 51(3) apply in this matter. Accordingly, the ACC will submit that s. 51(3) provides it with an immunity from production of the requested documents in this matter.”


	
	Importantly, the letter went on to state the following:
	


“4. Please note that we propose to file a notice of motion to have the subpoena set aside on the basis of s. 51(3). In the alternative, the ACC will object to the subpoena on additional bases, including that the subpoena fails to disclose a legitimate forensic purpose and represents an impermissible fishing exercise.

5. The ACC will seek an order that your client pay its costs of the subpoena and the motion.

6. In light of the above, we invite you to consider withdrawing the subpoena.”


	
	Once again, Mr Lu did not reply.
	
	
	On 7 May 2015 a Notice of Motion was filed on behalf of the Commission seeking an order that the Subpoena be set aside, along with an order that McNamara pay the Commission’s costs. On the same day, after that Notice of Motion had been filed, Mr May again wrote to Mr Lu. In doing so he set out, in some detail, the position which would be taken by the Commission if the Notice of Motion were to proceed. Mr May explained the Commission’s position by specific reference to the provisions of s. 51(3) of the Act. He also set out the evidence upon which the Commission would rely. He also referred Mr Lu to the decision of Slattery CJ at CL in R v Micalizzi (NSWSC 13 November 1987 unreported) which, he suggested, supported the Commission’s position.
	
	
	Mr May also drew Mr Lu’s attention to the fact that the Notice of Motion sought an order for costs. He concluded by saying the following:
	


“Please note that the ACC will not press the motion (including the application for costs) if you indicate in writing prior to 2pm tomorrow, Friday 8 May 2015, that the subpoena is not pressed.”


	
	Once again, Mr Lu did not respond to Mr May’s letter.
	
	
	Finally, on 8 May 2015 Mr May again wrote to Mr Lu enclosing an affidavit of Warren Gray which, he foreshadowed, would be relied upon in support of the Notice of Motion. A copy of the decision in Micalizzi (supra) to which Mr May had referred in his letter of 7 May was also provided.
	
	
	I draw the following conclusions from Mr May’s evidence.
	
	
	Firstly, Mr Lu was on notice of the Commission’s position from an early stage.
	
	
	Secondly, in the course of numerous letters, Mr May explained that position in some detail. Not only did he outline the basis upon which that position was taken, he went so far as to refer Mr Lu to authority which he suggested supported the Commission’s position.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr May drew Mr Lu’s attention, on more than one occasion, to the fact that the Commission would seek costs in the event that the Motion proceeded and the Subpoena was set aside.
	
	
	Fourthly, before the Motion was heard, Mr May gave Mr Lu an opportunity to resolve the matter without having to pay costs. Mr Lu did respond to any of Mr May’s correspondence.
	
	
	It is also relevant to note that in setting aside the Subpoena, I accepted the position of the Commission as it had been outlined by Mr May in his correspondence. I also concluded that the decision in Micalizzi supported that position.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions of behalf of the Commission


	
	The Commission has sought an order for costs in a lump sum of $8,500.00, in circumstances where the solicitor/client costs are said to be more than $16,000.00. The Commission acknowledged the fact that McNamara has been charged with serious offences, and it did not dispute that in the defence of such charges McNamara was entitled to pursue such avenues as were reasonably open to him. However, quite apart from the fact that it was successful in having the Subpoena set aside, the Commission pointed to the evidence of Mr May in support of a submission that it had taken every possible step to avoid the need to bring any application. It was submitted that all of these matters supported the making of an order for costs, and that there was no conduct on the part of the Commission which operated to disentitle it to such an order.
	


Submissions on behalf of the accused McNamara


	
	The written submissions of counsel for McNamara expressly acknowledged that Mr Lu was on notice (inter alia) of the fact that if the Subpoena was set aside, an order for costs would be sought. However, it was submitted that this consideration was “diminished in relevance” because of “the context of the trial”. Counsel emphasised that my decision to set the Subpoena aside was not one which was made on the basis that the Subpoena was oppressive or vexatious, but was one which was made “on the question of public interest immunity”. This, it was submitted, was a distinguishing factor which weighed against the making of an order for costs in the Commission’s favour.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the necessity for McNamara to be given a fair trial carried “significant weight” because in issuing the Subpoena, his representatives were doing no more than pursuing matters that they deemed to be relevant to his defence of the charges against him. It was submitted that in these circumstances, any application for costs was to be viewed in “a different light”.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the present case was not one in which two parties were involved in a civil dispute, but was “a situation of the resources of a public entity against the resources of a private individual (who was) not the beneficiary of Government resources or support”.
	
	
	Finally, counsel made a number of submissions concerning what I understood to be the suggested interplay between the right of an accused to a fair trial and the Court’s power to award costs. In support of those submissions, counsel cited Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which makes reference to an accused’s entitlement to have material disclosed to him which is helpful, either because it weakens the prosecution case or strengthens his own.
	
	
	It was submitted that in the event that I came to the conclusion that the order sought was appropriate, the costs assessed by the Commission were “contested and should be subject to a discount in the interests of justice or should be nominal”. It was submitted in the alternative that any order for costs should be stayed until further order of the Court.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	The effect of the general rule that costs follow the event is that the exercise of the power to award costs should normally require the unsuccessful party to pay the costs of the successful party, at least to the extent that those costs have been reasonably incurred in the conduct of the litigation. In Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59; (1990) 170 CLR 534 McHugh J said (at 566-7, citations omitted):
	


“An order for costs indemnifies the successful party in litigious proceedings in respect of liability for professional fees and out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the litigation. The rationale of the order is that it is just and reasonable that the party who has caused the other party to incur the costs of litigation should reimburse that party for the liability incurred. The order is not made to punish the unsuccessful party. Its function is compensatory. Thus, in civil proceedings an order may, and usually will, be made even though the unsuccessful party has nearly succeeded or has acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings. It may, and usually will, be made even though the action has failed through no fault of the unsuccessful party. …. the object of costs is not to penalise; it is to indemnify the successful party in regard to expense to which he has been put by reason of legal proceedings.”


	
	In my view, there are a number of reasons in the present case which support the conclusion that an order for costs should be made in favour of the Commission.
	
	
	Firstly, and fundamentally, the Commission was successful in its application to set the Subpoena aside. That result prima facie attracts application of the general rule.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr May repeatedly spelled out the Commission’s position to Mr Lu. In doing so, he went to some considerable lengths to articulate the basis upon which the Commission would argue that the provisions of s. 51(3) of the Act applied.
	
	
	Thirdly, having explained the Commission’s position in detail, Mr May offered Mr Lu the opportunity to, in effect, consent to an order setting the Subpoena aside, in which case no costs order would have been sought by the Commission.
	
	
	In my view, all of those matters weigh in favour of an order for costs being made in favour of the Commission.
	
	
	As I have already outlined, counsel for McNamara submitted that an order for costs was not appropriate because I had not determined that the Subpoena should be set aside on the basis that it was oppressive or vexatious. In support of this submission counsel cited a number of authorities.
	
	
	Firstly, counsel referred me to the decision of E M Heenan J in R v Bartlett [2014] WASC 492 where his Honour, in reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australian in Carter v Managing Partner, Mallesons Stephen Jaques (1993) 11 WAR 159, said (at [35]):
	


“The Court decided (in Carter) that there was a clear distinction to be drawn between the payment of costs by an accused where a third party is caused to incur costs by the issuing of a subpoena which is later to be found oppressive, and the right of an accused to a fair trial.”


	
	His Honour was evidently referring to the judgment of Malcolm CJ in Carter where the Chief Justice had said the following (at 178):
	


“The question whether an accused who has unnecessarily caused a third party to incur costs by the issue and service of a subpoena later found to be oppressive seems, in principle, unaided by relevant authority, to have nothing to do with either the prerogative of the Crown or the right of the accused to a fair trial.”


	
	As I read that part of Malcolm CJ’s judgment, his Honour concluded that questions arising from an accused having unnecessarily caused a third party to incur costs by issuing a Subpoena found to be oppressive have nothing to do with the right of an accused to a fair trial. In my view, for that purpose there is no relevant distinction to be drawn between a Subpoena which is set aside on the grounds that it is oppressive, and one which is set aside because the organisation to which it is directed has the benefit of a statutory immunity from production. In these circumstances, the decision in Bartlett does not support McNamara’s position.
	
	
	Counsel also relied on the following passage of the judgment of Miles CJ in R v Barbaro (1992) 108 ACTR 1 at [5]:
	


“Of course it is true that a person facing a criminal charge in entitled to use the processes of the court to the full extent that is legitimately possible in order to make answer to the charge and to maintain the presumption of innocence, but even in the defending of criminal charges there is a limit to which legal practitioners can lend their professional support to the obtaining of a preemptory court order when the process is vexatious or oppressive. When a subpoena is both vexatious and oppressive, I can see no reason why, other things being equal, the party causing it to issue should not pay the costs of an application to set it aside even when that party is defending a criminal charge or charges.”


	
	Counsel’s submissions appeared to suggest that this passage of his Honour’s judgment was authority for the proposition that it is only in cases where a Subpoena issued by an accused is found to be vexatious or oppressive that costs should be awarded. I am unable to accept that submission. To so conclude would be to impermissibly fetter the discretionary power to award costs.
	
	
	I accept that the charges against McNamara are, as counsel submitted, of the utmost gravity. I similarly accept that McNamara is entitled to a fair trial. It may well be that in issuing the Subpoena, those representing him were, as counsel submitted, “pursuing evidence that they deemed relevant to their case by way of Subpoena”. However, such submissions ignore the fact that there was a statutory immunity which operated in favour of the Commission. The terms of that immunity were drawn to the attention of Mr Lu on numerous occasions. In the end result, I found that the immunity applied and that the interpretation of s. 51 of the Act which was advanced on behalf of McNamara was not open. In these circumstances, and for the reasons previously stated, I am not able to accept the submission that the circumstances of the present case “raise questions” as to the right of McNamara to a fair trial. There is nothing, in my view, which weighs against an order for costs being made in the Commission’s favour, and there is no utility in requiring that any such order, once made, be stayed.
	
	
	That leaves the question of the terms of the order. The Commission seeks an order for a specified sum, namely $8,500.00. In support of that position, Annexure F to the affidavit of Mr May comprises timesheets setting out work done in relation to the Notice of Motion. Mr May calculated the Commission’s total costs (on a solicitor/client basis) at $16,590.95.
	
	
	It is apparent that two solicitors, Mr May and Mr Markus, carried out the majority of the work in relation to the matter on the Commission’s behalf. Annexure F records that on 12 May both of them engaged in “preparation” for the hearing, incurring total costs of almost $4,500.00. In addition, costs were incurred as a result of both solicitors attending the hearing of the Notice of Motion, Mr May “instructing” Mr Markus who appeared on behalf of the Commission. The argument on the motion was confined and the hearing occupied, in total, less than two hours of court time. Whilst it is not a matter for me to determine, there appears to be some support for the conclusion that there has been a degree of duplication in the work carried out.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, and bearing in mind that this is not a case in which the assessment process is likely to be complex or lengthy, I consider that the most appropriate course is to order that McNamara pay the Commission’s costs, as agreed or assessed.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	For the reasons outlined above, I make the following order:
	



	
	The accused Glen Patrick McNamara is to pay costs of the Australian Crime Commission of, and incidental to, the Notice of Motion dated 5 May 2015, as agreed or assessed.

		15 June 2016",2015-07-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767335,R v SALEH [2015] NSWDC 319,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Bland Saleh appears today for sentence in relation to a matter for which he was committed for sentence to this Court, an offence contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The crime to which he adhered to his plea of guilty is an offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug amphetamine contrary to that section. The offence was committed on 15 October 2014 at Yarragundry near Wagga and the quantity of the amphetamine in question was 856.6 grams according to the Court Attendance Notice. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and/or 3,500 penalty units, that is a fine of $385,000. There is a standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	There is another offence contrary to s 193C Crimes Act 1900 to be dealt with pursuant to s 167 Criminal Procedure Act brought to this Court on a s 166 certificate as it is described. This arises out of the circumstances of the arrest of the prisoner at Yarragundry to which I will come in a moment. The offence is dealing with certain property to wit $2,000 that were made up of 50 and 100 dollar bills in Australian currency ""that there are reasonable grounds to suspect is (sic) the proceeds of crime"". That is a summary offence and carries a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units or imprisonment for two years or both.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on the date of the offence, 15 October 2014, and has been in continuous custody since that date and all that time in custody will be taken into account. The offender pleaded guilty to the principal matter, that is, the indictable matter, at the Local Court and will receive a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Whilst the two offences are intimately bound together they represent separate offences. Logically that is so as was revealed in the course of discussion of the matter in the course of submissions. Thus there will be some partial accumulation of the sentence for the supply of the prohibited drug upon the obviously lesser sentence for the matter on the s 166 certificate.
	
	
	The prisoner on a presumably sunny day in October 2014 at about 11.15 was driving a silver BMW sedan bearing South Australian registration plates along the Sturt Highway. He was in company with another male, I assume, of about the same age. I do not mean any disrespect to the prisoner but from my experience of sitting in Wagga he may as well have been driving along with a neon sign on top of his car saying, “drugs and proceeds of crime in this car”. Because he should understand, as he now does, the police are very alert to watch for young men driving along the Sturt Highway in motor vehicles, usually in pairs, as suspects in the clear trade in drugs that occurs between South Australia and New South Wales. If it be of any, if I could use the expression, solace as to why I should make those observations for the benefit of the prisoner, I have done cases in Sydney, in fact I did a trial a couple of years ago involving quite substantial quantities of heroin and other prohibited drug, being traded between South Australia and Sydney amongst organised crime networks.
	
	
	The prisoner was not part of those networks, I accept that, and that was totally separate offending. But it was no surprise ultimately that in this matter the prisoner’s car was pulled over. He was subject to a random breath test. That received a negative result. Police checked his licence and undertook a search of his car.
	
	
	I do not mean this unkindly of Mr Saleh, but he only has himself to blame.  He was driving with a provisional licence but did not have his P plates on.  Another false step one would have thought, in the circumstances where Highway Patrol officers are very vigilant on the Sturt Highway.
	
	
	A search of the car was undertaken and ultimately the sum of $20,000, as I would understand it in 50 and 100 dollar notes, was found in the glove box. I should say in fairness, I am told from the bar table and am prepared to accept this, the car, whilst described as a “silver BMW” it was an older model car. It is not suggested the offender was driving the latest model of BMW car which would be a very valuable commodity particularly in the context of what was claimed to be the offender’s financial difficulties.
	
	
	When the offender’s boot was searched some items were found that belonged to the passenger in the car and in the bottom of the boot area there was a thin base as it is described. This was removed. The tyre under that thin base was not anchored and ultimately police found a black, long sleeved jumper which concealed another bag that was underneath.
	
	
	The spare wheel was removed. The jumper was retained for further examination and ultimately a Coles brand plastic bag was then found isolated in the spare wheel well. A cursory look into that bag was made and police identified a number of packages that contained what appeared to be amphetamines. In other words, in the spare tyre well were found the drugs ultimately the subject of this charge.
	
	
	The offender said that he was the owner of the car and had come into possession of it about three weeks previously. He was taken to the police station by police and accorded the relevant protections under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. The car that the prisoner was driving was released to the passenger who apparently was not charged.
	
	
	When the plastic bag was examined there were found resealable plastic bags inside which were found two plastic containers. Inside one of the plastic containers was a pasty, brown substance. Inside the other container was a brown, partially liquefied substance. These items were scientifically examined and they both were found to be amphetamines. One container of amphetamine weighed 451.5 grams and had a purity of 13.5 per cent. The other container with the pasty substance, as it is described in the certificate, was amphetamine. The quantity was 405.1 grams with a purity of 12 per cent. The total weight being 856.6 grams which is clearly greater than the commercial quantity for the drug which is 250 grams and less than the large commercial quantity of this particular drug which is one kilogram.
	
	
	There were examinations undertaken of plastic bags and the plastic container. A number of fingerprints were recovered from the plastic bag or “Glad bag” containing the plastic container and these fingerprints were consistent with that of the prisoner. The plastic containers and that are described in the facts and there is no need for me to go into the detail of that.
	
	
	The prisoner, when spoken to by the police did not provide a great deal of detail about the matter. I am told, “The offender was offered participation in an electronically recorded interview and consented”, but the facts are completely silent on what, if anything, the prisoner told the investigating police.
	
	
	In fairness to the prisoner throughout the course of the police examination, it would appear, is entirely cooperative. There is no suggestion that he struggled with police or sought to divert them from what was to be the inevitable finding of the drugs.
	
	
	Mr Saleh, as I understand it, was born in August 1991. He is a comparatively young man. He will turn, as I would calculate it, 24 years of age in August. He has prior convictions; in fact, has previously served terms of imprisonment although his criminal history is not a significant criminal history in one sense. He has a conviction for possessing prohibited drugs in 2009 consistent with a history of drug usage over at least over the last four or five years. He has some driving offences: in 2010 including a special category driver PCA for which he was convicted on 2 February 2011.
	
	
	I should point out as a juvenile he was dealt with in the Children’s Court for assault with intent to rob and given nine months probation and required to attend school regularly. He was convicted also in the Local Court of the offence of affray on 30 April 2010. That offence is discussed in one of the reports and he was placed on a good behaviour bond for 12 months pursuant to s 9 of the Act.
	
	
	At Parramatta Local Court in November 2011 he was convicted of common assault and intimidation and sentenced to nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of six months. On appeal to the District Court the sentence for the intimidation matter was varied to three months imprisonment. The conviction was confirmed in relation to the common assault pursuant to s 10A.
	
	
	Also, on 1 November 2011 at the same time, he was convicted of threaten to cause injury or harm to “prevent information to police” and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. That conviction was confirmed on appeal but the sentence was varied to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three months. It would appear that non-parole period being concurrent with the sentence of three months for the intimidation matter.
	
	
	He has another conviction in 2011 for possessing a prohibited drug. He was not on probation or parole or bail at the time of the offence with which I am concerned which is by reference to the maximum penalty and by consideration of the standard non-parole period a serious offence but of itself just by its facts is to be seen as a serious offence.
	
	
	I have a report from the Community Corrections Service and it notes previous supervision by the Service. When subject to parole, as I would understand it, he was subject to urinalysis and there were no drugs detected. An attempt was to try and get the offender to focus on employment opportunity with little success, but he did complete the period of parole without re-offence. However, “It would appear that no significant gains were made”.
	
	
	Whilst in custody his performance has been impressive and I take that into account. He has not incurred any charges. He has been given the position as a wing sweeper and according to Community Corrections he attracts positive comment in relation to his work performance and overall behaviour. He “utilises the telephone system advising that he maintains regular contact with his partner and family”. But he is also managed as an ‘A2’ remand inmate and has alerts relating to “outlaw motorcycle gang affiliations” and a “behavioural management plan”. Of course, I do not propose to - and I cannot - give him extra penalty for those claimed associations. But they lie, it seems, in the background of the circumstances of the current offending to which I will refer in a moment based upon the account the prisoner has given to the psychologist.
	
	
	The offender has a family that comes from Iraq. His parents are or Kurdish background and thus come from Northern Iraq. They are refugees to Australia. The family came to Australia via Turkey in 1998. The parents clearly have impressive achievements in Australia. His father is a man of substance, his mother is involved in the education system and she wrote an eloquent letter on his behalf setting out her support and her husband’s support for him which I take into account.
	
	
	He does have a strained relationship, however, with his father. He views his father as strict and he has said to Community Corrections that he has rebelled against this and that his own conduct has caused a rift, as he would understand. I understand his parents to be entirely law abiding people and I am sure that the offender’s arrest in relation to this matter, his associations before arrest and his other offending have caused his family considerable distress. The offender, however, feels that his father was less strict with his siblings with whom he would appear to have a reasonable relationship, although he has a strong bond with his mother.
	
	
	The prisoner has been in a relationship, it is reported, with a young woman for approximately four years who gave evidence before me. She was a very impressive witness and I will deal with her evidence in a moment.
	
	
	He suffered, apparently, a very serious head injury when he was four years of age. His mother believes that it has had some adverse effect on him. He fell of the roof of a building and what he was doing on the roof of a building I have no idea, but there is nothing in the psychological report that speaks to a significant acquired brain injury as is thought by the mother. He finished Year 10 at school.
	
	
	He has primarily worked as a painter. He has had casual and “on and off” employment and he tried sometime before his arrest to start up his own business as a painter. Part of a history I had is that he borrowed $50,000 to buy himself a van and to set himself up in that business but that business was not a particular success.
	
	
	His partner appeared to be quite an intelligent, ‘switched-on’ sort of person. She said she had tried to assist him with his paperwork and other things and I can understand from the nub of the psychological report that the prisoner would have trouble organising his personal affairs.
	
	
	He started drinking in his teens and moved to the use of prohibited drugs using “ice” and cocaine, although in one part of the material his preferred drug is cocaine. He has completed a ‘Break Out’ program when in custody. He does have, however, some substantial health issues. Whether they are related to his fall or not is not established on the evidence. However he suffers panic attacks and suffers particular anxiety from the condition of claustrophobia. This is an unfortunate condition to have when you are in gaol, to be fearful of being in enclosed spaces. But gaols provide no other types of accommodation. I accept from the material available to me that the circumstances of his custody and his imprisonment will provide some degree of hardship arising out of these conditions, but inevitably a term of imprisonment must be imposed.
	
	
	He claimed that he was in a desperate financial position before he committed this offence and had sought to obtain forgiveness of debts that he had acquired. Thus, apparently he went to South Australia as his counsel concedes to pick up the drugs and bring them back to Sydney. I will come back to some concessions that his counsel made about this aspect of the matter, but it is clear that whichever view one takes of it, the offence that he committed, the principal offence, was for financial benefit even if it was for forgiving a debt.
	
	
	So far as taking responsibility for his offending, he said he does and he said that he was working for other people and he had “turned to the wrong people for help”. The Community Corrections Services said he was at medium risk of re-offending and there were particular matters that needed concentration or attention by Community Corrections including his education and his employment, his financial circumstances, his associations, his alcohol and drug problems and, of course, his attitude and orientation.
	
	
	Psychology staff at Junee Gaol are aware of his panic attacks and his concerns relating to his claustrophobia and, of course, there are in place alerts in relation to his association with what are described as “outlaw motorcycle gangs”. There is no evidence that he is actually a member of a gang. But it seems to me, based upon what he said to the psychologist and what appears from the Community Corrections Service, that he was leading something of two lives. He had a life that he presented to his parents and his girlfriend, but he had another life where he found favour in associating with people that clearly have a connection with the drug trade in a range of ways.
	
	
	So far as the assessment of his prospects is concerned it notes the positive family support, notes his recognition of his offending and his good behaviour in custody. I have taken that into account.
	
	
	The evidence of the girlfriend or partner, as I said, was quite impressive. She is a young woman who had known him and been going out with him for four years. She seemed to be largely ignorant of his criminal behaviour. She hopes to be married to him and obviously she can be a very positive influence upon him, but it must be pointed out as a matter of common sense that she has not been able to exert a positive influence upon him in relation to the current matter and other aspects of his behaviour as his criminal history makes clear.
	
	
	She is studying architecture at the University of Canberra and she has a Diploma in Architectural Technology. She struck me as an intelligent woman, as I said. She is not of the Kurdish community, she is of the Egyptian community, but it would appear, judging from my observation of her, that she is an entirely presentable, respectable young woman who is well liked by his family, it would seem, and she would wish to continue the relationship.
	
	
	She helped him with the paperwork in his business, but she understand that before he was arrested he had a number of outstanding debts, not just arising from his borrowing of monies from “the wrong people” for his business, but he had credit card debts and the like. She is not a drug user which I think was self-evident and she does not approve of drug use. One of the background facts of this matter which is a little unsavoury, if nothing else, is the fact that the offender was shot 12 months ago in the leg. I was not given much detail in relation to that. No‑one has been charged, but he was shot in the Merrylands area. Whether this was related to criminal activity or some vendetta against him or simply because of his association with criminals is not clear. This must be, of course, very distressing for his parents and his partner.
	
	
	His parents, she said, continue to support him as does she, although her visits to Junee Gaol are limited. She has tried to see him three or four times. One such occasion her car broke down. She had noted a number of changes whilst in custody and thought that he had improved his attitude and she would hope that on his release from custody he would take the opportunity to avoid using drugs. She was aware of his panic attacks and his anxiety about being in confined spaces.
	
	
	Other evidence of a personal nature comes from his mother in the reference that she wrote. It is an erudite document. She is a person of accomplishment and her husband and she have worked hard to create a better life for their children in Australia. She said that they have tried to instil “good values in our children” and that the younger children, the offender apparently being the eldest of the family, are stable and achieving well at school.
	
	
	The father is a volunteer for SES and the mother, as I say, has constructive employment within the education system. She said that Bland was different to the other children. He had poor concentration, hyperactivity and learning difficulties and this comes through in the psychological report. Being unable to engage in school, he associated with groups of boys with a negative attitude to school.
	
	
	One of the features of this matter is, I fully appreciate, that the young man that I am dealing with now has come to this country for his family to make a better life. He would have had English as a second language. I would imagine that the Kurdish language or some other language, would have been the primary language in his family’s home and he would have had difficulties assimilating into the education system and also would have had difficulties, obviously, having to deal with having to be educated in a language that was not the primary language at home. I appreciate this needs to be taken into account indicating that he has had some struggles in his education.
	
	
	But he should understand, of course, that many people have come to this country over the years, particularly since World War II, from disadvantaged backgrounds with English as the second language and have gone on to make a great contribution to the country. The offender should realise that that is not beyond him.
	
	
	The psychologist’s report dwells upon some of the background to which I have referred. It notes amongst other things that when he committed the offence the offender was not living at home because of his relationship with his father and whilst he was away from home for the year before the offence he did not have stable accommodation. This has not come out in his girlfriend’s evidence.
	
	
	He spoke of his history of being teased at school about his presentation and language and I can understand that would create difficulties for him.
	
	
	His financial circumstances at the time of the offending are referred to and I have already summarised those. So far as his history of psycho‑social matters he noted that his partner was a good person who was a positive influence upon him. With regard to his friendship network he described his associates as “rubbish factor friends” and by this it was said that he associated with “rubbish friends” because of his drug use and they helped each other out. He feels as if where his parents live is a bad thing for him because it means that he is still in contact with past bad associations.
	
	
	There have been some positives in custody. Apparently he has gone from 160 kilograms to about 120 kilograms and says he is in better health than he has been for several years. He has been shot in the leg. The bullet has apparently not been removed. He regards his appetite as healthy, but he has the difficulty of sleep apnoea which is severe. He is a chronic snorer and this, no doubt, would cause some annoyance to people with whom he had to share a cell and also have disruption to his sleep.
	
	
	He is not on any psychoactive medication. He has no history of treatment for mental illness or mood disorder. There is no family history of mental illness. Whilst he thought he was “bipolar”, he simply was referring to his change of moods and opinions, but there is no evidence that he is suffering bipolar disorder as such. His panic attacks can be very severe.
	
	
	With regard to custody he has adjusted to custody reasonably well in all of the circumstances, apart from the claustrophobia, but he has limited access to education and counselling. He claimed in relation to the offences with which he is now charged that he was in fear of being killed because of the fact that he could not repay his debts. Apparently now, however, even though he has been arrested, he has lost the $20,000 that belonged either to him or to somebody else and he has lost the drugs. “Everything is sweet now”. But he does acknowledge that he was stupid.
	
	
	According to the intelligence testing undertaken by validated psychometric testing his verbal subtests scored him at a percentile rank of five, that means 95 per cent of his age cohort would score equal or ahead of him, however his non-verbal testing was superior. He was assessed as below average, but his particular score was commensurate with a percentile rank of 16 meaning he would score equal to or ahead of 16 per cent of his age group. Part of his verbal testing, of course, would take into account perhaps his language difficulties.
	
	
	With regard to his composite IQ score he was given a percentile ranking of six. The psychologist said that his educational history and his clinical presentation and participation was essentially consistent with the test scores derived. He needed assistance to explain or understand complex words.
	
	
	So far as his severity of dependence scale testing was concerned he achieved a total score of ten. The cut-off point for a diagnostic threshold for psychological dependence and compulsive use of cocaine was three, hence his score was indicative of marked psychological dependency and impulsive use.
	
	
	He exhibited symptoms of adult ADHD, but this assessment is not intended to be a diagnostic assessment. It does indicate that he acknowledges symptoms of impulsivity that are associated with the disorder. His risk of recidivism on the psychometric test undertaken places him at the moderate to high risk of re‑offending, which is self-evident given his associations and his past conduct.
	
	
	His scale of returning to drug and alcohol abuse on the scores assessed was in the “highly significant” range. It was thought thus that treatment for him in the future should focus on helping him to control his substance misuse and that may theoretically diminish his risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The summary of the psychologist reflecting upon these matters indicates the need for him to have professional assistance on his release from custody.
	
	
	His parents have been subjected to considerable trauma in their lives. Apparently at one stage they had left Iraq and then after returning to Iraq came home to find their homes and villages had been destroyed or badly damaged. As to the prisoner, of course, having been either conceived in Iraq but born in Australia or born in Iraq and coming to Australia as a very small child, had no direct experience of trauma himself in Iraq. But it is thought that he may be ‘vicariously’ affected and it could well be that his parents’ attitudes and hopes for their children are very much influenced by their own personal experience.
	
	
	His IQ test performance indicated that his cognitive ability was not in the range that would have enabled him to achieve the type of professional qualifications and success he believes his family wanted from him. In other words, his cognitive limitations would make him a disappointment to his parents.
	
	
	It is thought by the psychologist that his offences were directly linked to his substance dependence and he has an impulsive predisposition which may be part of a wider diagnosis of adult ADHD. He has got a history of disruptive school behaviour which may be evidence of an undiagnosed ADHD. He has never been treated for that condition.
	
	
	It was said that being in the company of his chosen peers would have also had a normalising impact on his own thinking and behaviour. He perceived those he associated with as glamorous and financially successful and this may have influenced him to emulate their behaviour in the hope that he would share their image and lifestyle.
	
	
	He was not safe to make independent decisions in his own best interests and he said he felt pressured to engage in criminal activity to reduce perceived threat to his safety and welfare and possibly that of his family. It must be said if he was shot by someone in Merrylands there is clear evidence there of a real risk to him, but what relationship it has to this offending directly I do not know.
	
	
	This imprisonment has had a greater impact upon him than the earlier imprisonment, but then again it is going to be for a considerably lengthier period of time. Ms Robilliard, a very experienced psychologist, points to the need for various psychological and drug and alcohol counselling programs to be set in place.
	
	
	With regard to the evidence of his partner I have already pointed out that - giving her full credit for her presentation and her concern for him - she has not yet been able to change him. Certainly, as I have said, his record of offending in recent years has obviously occurred during the relationship but it may be now that he may pay greater heed to her.
	
	
	Having regard to all the evidence that was presented, the submissions of counsel for the prisoner concentrated on the following matters in summary. Whilst it was a serious offence which is self-evidently so the Court should not just be concerned with the quantity of the drugs. I needed to consider the role of the prisoner. It was submitted that he could be regarded as a ‘courier’ and that he committed the offence motivated to repay debts to people for whom he was beholden and people who may well have been quite sinister.
	
	
	It was put from the bar table that the prisoner candidly admitted being involved in these activities not just this once, but I appreciate by reference to that ‘concession’ it was also submitted that I should be satisfied that the prisoner was at the lower end of the scale of responsibility for the particular enterprise in which he was involved. I should take into account the quality of the drug was at the lower end of the scale given the range of purities that this Court sees. Although this is not crystal methylamphetamine I note.
	
	
	I should point out just a little while ago I was dealing with a drug supplier in possession of crystal methylamphetamine where the percentage purity was in the 70 per cent range. But, of course, this not being the crystalline substance it is more common to find it in a lower grade of purity.
	
	
	It was submitted that I should accept the hearsay account of the prisoner as to his motivation for committing the offence. The aggravations were identified as financial gain, albeit to get rid of a debt. It was conceded that the prisoner was involved in organised criminal activity but I should note, and I do, that there is no evidence that he was “the organiser”. He was a hireling. He was not the person who planned the criminal activity with which the Court is now concerned.
	
	
	It was submitted that I should give the maximum discount for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty which I do. So far as his background is concerned I should take into account the disadvantages of his upbringing in Australia, not so much the family influence - that has been positive - but other matters to which I have referred and I take that into account.
	
	
	It was submitted that he came into this criminal enterprise by setting up a business in good faith but having the wrong associates from whom he borrowed money. He had the support of family and his partner. He had the possibility of rehabilitation and he had made changes in custody which I acknowledge.
	
	
	I was also to take into account the health problems which he has which I accept are a reality. Thus, the circumstances of custody for him will be less attractive or more onerous than it would be for other offenders. It was submitted ultimately that he was not irredeemable, that he was seeing the light, that he had positive support. His criminal history was not unblemished, but it was not a bad criminal history.
	
	
	I was taken to some comparative cases to examine. There were not many submissions made about the cases but I have read those cases. Those cases include Heard [2000] NSWCCA 107, Morres George [2002] NSWCCA 419; and the case of Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135.
	
	
	I point out so far as principles are concerned, bearing in mind these cases were brought to my attention more for comparative purposes, that in the case of Shi the then Chief Judge at Common Law, Justice Wood, pointed out in upholding the Crown appeal that in sentencing for that offender:
	


“Insufficient consideration had been given to the weight and purity of the drug involved in the instance or to the well recognised principle of the culpability of those who engage at any level in drug supply networks is significant and that deterrent sentences are necessary, since absent the involvement of couriers, warehousemen and so on, these networks, whether established for the purposes of importation or subsequent distribution would simply collapse” [34].


	
	I appreciate Shi would appear to have the appearance of a case arising from the sequelae of an importation which is not the case here, but the general principle, even accepting the prisoner was acting as a courier for the drugs in question, is that he was performing a significant role bearing in mind particularly that he was taking the drugs from South Australia to Sydney. This is not a case of a man as a favour for an associate going to Villawood, picking up the drugs and driving them to Liverpool.
	
	
	With regard to these cases for comparative purposes, of course, there are many differences, even though the quantities might be similar. For example, in the case of Heard it was an appeal against a sentence of seven years imposed which, on appeal, was reduced to a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of two years in respect of the supply of 583 grams of the drug with a purity of 6.9 per cent. There was an estimated street value for that drug given in that case. I have no estimated street value here.
	
	
	The offender was part of a network of offenders, although he had a significant criminal history. Part of that appeal’s merit for the purposes of the determination of the appeal was the sentences imposed on co-offenders giving rise to parity principles.
	
	
	Morres George was also involved in the supply of methylamphetamine, 850.4 grams of the drug. However, he was an older offender sentenced to four years with a three years non-parole period pursuant to the same provision in circumstances where, as with Herd, no standard non-parole period was considered by the Court, where the offender was 60 with a criminal history of some antiquity only for minor offences, with significant health problems given his age. Thus, although the appeal was dismissed, the sentence needs to be considered in that light.
	
	
	With regard to the matter of Shi, that person was convicted of the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine being 992.2 grams which had 84.5 per cent purity to which I referred. But he performed the role of a courier apparently to forgive a debt of something like $2,000 - $3,000 and he was only 19 years of age. He had no prior criminal convictions of any type whatsoever. That was a successful Crown appeal and particularly it was a case involving consideration of a standard non-parole period in the light of the decision of Way which, of course, was effectively set aside by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen.
	
	
	I have had regard to those cases for comparative purposes but no particular case usually can provide specific guidance. In fact, there is a recent decision from memory, I think the decision is RCW (No 2) where the Court of Criminal Appeal criticised the sentencing Judge for focusing on one sentence as being a yardstick for an appropriate sentence in the instant case and, of course, each of the cases are different. But I have had regard to those cases as sought by counsel for the prisoner.
	
	
	With regard to the Crown’s submissions to the Court they were relatively brief. I was to have regard to the amount of the drug and the purity. It was submitted, I think approaching the matter from the same perspective as Mr King for the prisoner, that there was planning in the offence as an aggravating factor. I think this was the matter that Mr King sought to identify as being an offence committed within the rubric of organised crime, but with the prisoner not the organiser which I accept.
	
	
	Justice Howie in a number of judgments pointed out that drug trafficking and drug supplying usually has, by definition, an element of planning which could not be regarded as an aggravating factor because it was inherently part of the character of the crime. Likewise Mr Crown also pointed out this was an offence for financial gain. He accepted the discount submitted, as I do, for the utilitarian benefit of the plea but he submitted that there should be some partial accumulation for the s 166 certificate matter which I accept.
	
	
	Dealing with some issues that further arise, obviously I have to have regard to the purposes of sentencing and in this sentencing exercise matters of general and personal deterrence are, of course, important. The plague of drug abuse is one that this Court and other courts see all the time and those who traffic in drugs, even if they are drug users themselves, causing damage to the community must expect punishment.
	
	
	Although neither counsel referred to it, I should point out in the case of Shi that Mr King gave me that one of the aggravating factors pointed out in the sentencing of him was the fact that the case involved conduct that constituted what is described in the aggravating factors under s 21A(2) as an offence committed ‘without regard for public safety’. That is not an uncommon finding in relation to substantial drug supply. This was not a matter addressed by Mr King, it was not a matter addressed by the Crown.
	
	
	I believe I need not find it as an aggravating factor on this occasion simply because the facts eloquently speak for themselves as to the seriousness of the offending by reference as everyone says to the quantity of the drug, albeit that I have to factor in the role of the prisoner. As I say, Mr King himself produced a judgment that indicated substantial supply of this quantity at least represented an offence committed without regard for public safety.
	
	
	It is to be fairly said that those who use drugs well know the effects of them and when they supply them to other people they must well know or foresee the damage that can be done by that drug supply, even if it is supply in the character of delivering drugs to others for distribution.
	
	
	With regard to s 21A(2) I believe I have identified the relevant aggravating factors. With regard to mitigating factors ultimately I conclude that the prisoner has shown some remorse. I am prepared to accept he has taken responsibility even though he has not given evidence before me. His plea of guilty is a mitigating factor although he receives a discrete discount for that.
	
	
	Obviously I cannot find, based on his own psychological report and the presentence report and his background and the character of the offending and his associations, that he is unlikely to re-offend or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. However, I note that he has that positive family support and if he can avoid the use of drugs his prospects of rehabilitation will be enhanced. Clearly he was not a person of good character and he could not be said to not have a record or significant record of criminal convictions.
	
	
	Although I have taken into account the matters in the psychological report it is not submitted, nor is there evidence of, a relevant mental condition or disability that would warrant consideration of the principles summarised in the decision of De La Rosa [2010] NSW CCA 194, particularly in the judgment of the learned Chief Judge at Common Law at [177] - [178]. But I am required to take into account the health of the prisoner. Although it is not requiring any specific or urgent attention by the authorities at the moment as impacting upon his circumstances of custody. I have taken into account in his favour his behaviour whilst in custody.
	
	
	There is no doubt, notwithstanding s 5 of the Act, that this is a matter that requires the imposition of a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	With regard to the fixing of the term of imprisonment I am required to have regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost. I am mindful of the fact, of course, that s 54A(2) and s 54B(2) require the Court to first of all have regard to the standard non-parole period in the context of firstly the consideration of the standard non-parole period as being applicable to an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness only by regard to the objective facts in the case.
	
	
	The sections require then the Court to further have regard to the other matters, including the relevant matters that arise under s 21A and any finding of ‘special circumstances’ in determining an appropriate non-parole period. I should do this by, as the High Court held in Muldrock and Markarian, the use of the mystical powers of instinctive or intuitive synthesis.
	
	
	In relation to the offending, notwithstanding the quantity but having regard to the purity and the role of the prisoner, I am prepared to find that the offence is not within the middle range of objective seriousness. Of course, quantity is a relevant matter but it is not the only determinate of the matter otherwise clearly it would be at least in the middle range of objective seriousness given that a large commercial quantity is greater than one kilogram. But, as I say, the role of the prisoner is a relevant matter in that regard.
	
	
	I am mindful also in relation to the general principles concerning the sentencing of offenders in relation to drug trafficking that those who are substantially involved in trafficking, as clearly this prisoner was, must expect full time custodial sentences. Certainly no suggestion of ‘exceptional circumstances’ or no suggestion of a sentencing discretion permitting other than full time custody arises in this matter.
	
	
	I am also to take into account given the age of the prisoner the need to have regard to the promotion of the prisoner’s rehabilitation amongst those purposes of sentencing. I am required to consider, for example, matters such as those that were identified in cases like Blackman and Walters [2001] NSW CCA 121, adopting the South Australian authority that point to the protection of the community includes consideration of assisting offenders to avoid offending in the future because the extent that people are prevented from offending in the future or are assisted in their rehabilitation the protection of the community is enhanced. That is what I am seeking to do by fashioning the non-parole period.
	
	
	I have determined that there are ‘special circumstances’. This is the second term of imprisonment for the prisoner but it seems to me that there is a raft of matters identified in the presentence report and the psychological report that require professional guidance particularly drug and alcohol counselling, associate monitoring, education and employment guidance as well as the need to assist the prisoner to find financial stability, his financial instability contributing to his offending on this occasion. He will need an extended period of time to adjust to community living.
	
	
	Thus, having regard to all that has been put to me, including I hasten to say the statistics which were provided showing a range of penalty for 82 cases under this provision between 2007 and 2014 where imprisonment was imposed for periods between six months imprisonment and 12 years imprisonment, the mean period of imprisonment apparently being three years. There are many limitations in relation to statistics and particularly in the area of drug supply and particularly in the area of drug supply where there are limits to the character of the prosecution by reason of quantity. The statistics do not provide details of the quantity, the purity, the role of the prisoner. In the decision of Bloomfield in 1998 the Chief Justice pointed out for the purposes of deciding matters on appeal the many limitations of statistics, but they do provide some guidance.
	
	
	I understood Mr King to be telling me in his submissions that Shi might provide the better guide for comparative purposes. I am not sure that that is right. Again, there are many distinctions, both objectively and subjectively between the two cases. As I said, I have generally had regard to those comparative cases for the limited assistance they provide me as do the statistics.
	
	
	Can you stand up, thanks very much, Mr Saleh. In relation to the offence on the s 166 certificate you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months. That sentence of imprisonment includes a discount of 25 per cent. That sentence will date from 15 October 2014 and will expire on 14 October 2014 (as said) but I decline to fix a non-parole period because of the sentence I will impose for the other matter.
	
	
	I should interpose my remarks just for a moment to point out that there is no satisfactory explanation for your possession of that cash. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is your cash. In fact, I believe it is not your cash simply because of your financial difficulties, although it is clearly cash associated with drug supply. It seems to me to be cash that you were transporting in company with the drugs for the benefit of others. But it shows how much you were trusted, of course, and it does reflect in itself substantial criminality.
	
	
	Thus, I propose in accordance with Pearce principles ((1998) 194 CLR 610 particularly at [45]) and of course decisions such as Hammoud to partially accumulate the next sentence upon that sentence.
	
	
	For the principal offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years six months by way of non-parole period to date from 15 April 2015 and to expire on 14 October 2017. That means the effective non-parole period is three years.
	
	
	In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years nine months and on my calculation that sentence will expire on 14 July 2020.
	
	
	Just take a seat. Thus, the total sentence I have imposed upon you is five years nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. the non-parole period expiring, on my calculation, on 14 October 2017.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Now, Mr Crown, are there any particular errors in the orders that need to be corrected?
	
	
	THOMAS: No, your Honour, I’d just be seeking a confiscation order as well.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I have made that.
	
	
	THOMAS: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’ll have copies provided to you, Mr Crown, and to you, Mr Murnane. So those orders are made in accordance with the consent orders. Are there any other matters, like errors in calculation?
	
	
	THOMAS: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: What about you, Mr Murnane?
	
	
	MURNANE: No.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Saleh, first of all I owe you an apology - no, sit down, thank you. My normal practice is to tell people from the outset what the sentence is going to be and I didn’t do this on this occasion. It was just an oversight on my part. The total sentence imposed upon you is five years nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. You’ll be eligible for release to parole, as I said, on 14 October 2017. I’ve taken into account the time in custody. But you must understand it will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you’re released on that date. I wish you well for the future, but the truth of the matter is, you know, you know as well as I do if you want to hang around - I don’t mean this unkindly - with gangsters, you’ll just end up in gaol. And that’s a matter that you need to address.

2767341,R v Hooper [2015] NSWDC 173,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: In the guideline judgment of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R which primarily dealt with offences of armed robbery, a subsidiary issue was discussed concerning the relevance of drug addiction as a motivating factor for criminal behaviour. Attention was focused on the concept of personal choice. Those who decide to commence taking drugs, itself an illegal activity, in full knowledge of what drugs do to people, can scarcely complain when their need to satisfy their addictions prompts them to commit criminal offences. But some exceptions to this general principle were noted, based on the idea that not everyone becomes a drug addict through informed personal use. Those who develop an addiction after being treated with narcotic analgesics are an obvious example.
	
	
	Another obvious example arises in the present case. The offender, Beaudean Hooper, commenced his use of drugs at the age of only seven or eight when his father began supplying him with cannabis. Not surprisingly, his descent into drug use involving harder drugs also began at a very early age. So it could scarcely be said that it was an informed adult choice for Mr Hooper to start using drugs. He has battled with his drug addiction ever since and, as is not at all surprising, in order to fund his drug addiction he has committed offences, often and regularly. Indeed as Mr Krisenthal, who appears for him today pointed out, in the last eight years of Mr Hooper’s life he has spent six of them in custody. He has tried two residential rehabilitation facilities but, as is clearly the case, they have not been successful.
	
	
	It was to obtain money for drugs that the offender committed the crime for which I must now sentence him. He and another man broke into some commercial premises, a jewellers, which was itself within a shopping centre. They firstly broke into the shopping centre and then broke through the security shutters around the jewellery store before they began smashing their way into display cabinets, grabbing stock and leaving. This was not some quiet and subtle offence by any means. The offenders caused a great deal of damage and thus a significant loss. Fortunately the offender was not wearing gloves at the time of this offence and so his participation in the offence was easily discovered when a fingerprint belonging to him was located.
	
	
	The stock that was taken and not recovered had a wholesale value of about $12,000 and a retail value of about $60,000. On top of that, the jeweller suffered further loss, repairs to the premises cost about $25,500, stock was damaged and so was unsaleable to the value of $6,500 and the damage was so extensive that for a while the jewellers could not even trade, suffering a further loss. Although of course it has to be recognised that this was not a break, enter and steal into residential premises, with all the accompanying harm that that offence carries with it, this was a serious example of a break, enter and steal from business premises.
	
	
	The offender is a relatively young man of Aboriginal heritage. Although his immediate family were apparently not the type of people to commit criminal offences, that is not to say his upbringing was ideal. I have already mentioned that his father was the person who first supplied him with drugs. His father was also domestically violent towards his mother and physically abusive towards he himself.
	
	
	He was brought up in rural New South Wales but the family relocated to Newcastle. It was there that he became exposed to crime and drugs in the Newcastle area. At one stage the family relocated to Dubbo to live with extended family members. This was also a bad move as far as Mr Hooper was concerned because he began to be influenced by his cousins who were excessive alcohol and drug users. Mr Hooper told a psychologist that he thinks this is where he went off the rails.
	
	
	Quite clearly, and this almost goes without saying, Mr Hooper will continue to commit offences if he continues to use drugs and so the most important thing that needs to happen for the offender is that he deal with his drug addiction. He has had opportunities in the past but has failed to take advantage of them. While of course it was not an informed choice to begin drugs, it is Mr Hooper’s decision as to whether he continues to take them. Until he makes the decision that he wants to give up drugs and until he makes the decision that he will not use them, he will continue to use drugs and thus continue to offend and thus in turn continue to go to gaol.
	
	
	Of course this offence was aggravated by the circumstance that it was planned. The offenders had to obtain the equipment that they needed. He was also on bail at the time of the offence which is a serious matter of aggravation.
	
	
	He was sentenced to imprisonment for the offence for which he was on bail and so part of the time he has been in custody after being arrested for this matter has been referrable to other offending. Mr Krisenthal reminds me of course that the principle of totality applies and so I will give effect to that principle by backdating the sentence that I am to announce shortly to 30 January 2015. Effectively there will thus be some partial concurrency with other sentences.
	
	
	It is clear that there are special circumstances in this case, thus leading to the time in custody that Mr Hooper will serve being reduced. This is not done as any favour to him but in an effort to protect other members of the community from further offending by Mr Hooper. If he is rehabilitated, if his drug use is dealt with, then fewer members of the community will suffer in the future.
	
	
	There is a s 166 matter to which the offender has pleaded guilty. He was carried in a stolen conveyance at one stage. That offence pales into insignificance compared to the break, enter and steal matter and so he will receive no extra punishment for that matter.
	
	
	Mr Hooper pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I am about to announce is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	I have noted that there is a standard non-parole period attached to this offence. I have taken into account both the standard non-parole period and the maximum sentence in determining the appropriate penalty which is as follows.
	
	
	He is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 30 January 2015 with a head sentence of five years. The offender will thus be eligible to be released to parole on 29 July 2017.
	
	
	On the s 166 matter I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of two months to have commenced on 30 January 2015.

		19 August 2015",2015-07-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767358,New South Wales Crime Commission v Vu (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1064,"Judgment


	
	This is an application pursuant to s 30 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act), brought by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian (the Trustee). I was informed by counsel for the Trustee that the plaintiff in the substantive proceedings, the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission), is aware of the application and does not oppose the orders sought.
	
	
	The respondent, Ms Vu, did not appear either personally or by a lawyer. My short earlier judgment will show that I determined the threshold question of whether the motion should be heard ex parte in favour of the Trustee, because I was soundly satisfied that Ms Vu is aware of the application but has chosen to take no part in opposing it.
	
	
	To state the background very succinctly, on 28 October 2009, the Commission obtained ex parte restraining orders with regard to a number of pieces of property owned by Ms Vu. In a nutshell, it was said that Ms Vu had obtained a loan of approximately $184,000.00 from a financial institution dishonestly. She had done so by providing false documentation to the financial institution.
	
	
	In due course, the Commission sought a proceeds assessment order against Ms Vu pursuant to ss 27 and 28(3) of the Act. Although, as I have said, the sum allegedly dishonestly obtained was in the order of $184,000.00, pursuant to the rigorous regime contained in the Act, the Commission sought an order in the far greater sum of $922,738.00. Both the making of any order, and that quantum, was opposed by Ms Vu, who was represented by a solicitor.
	
	
	On 29 February 2012, Johnson J determined both issues adversely to the respondent and made a proceeds assessment in that amount: see New South Wales Crime Commission v Vu [2012] NSWSC 129 at [110].
	
	
	Ms Vu appealed to the NSW Court of Appeal. At that stage, she was represented by counsel. Various grounds were relied upon; all were dismissed: see Vu v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] NSWCA 282 at [104] (McColl JA, with whom Meagher JA and Emmett JA agreed).
	
	
	Thereafter, things were in abeyance for some time. On 17 July 2014, the Commission obtained, pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Act, final orders vesting control over a number of pieces of property of Ms Vu. They included the two pieces of property that are the subject of the motion before me; namely, real property at X XXXX XXXX, Bankstown, and a Subaru motor vehicle, registration XXXXXX.
	
	
	It is in that context that the Trustee now seeks orders that will permit it to sell both the real and personal property; to execute all necessary documents to that effect; and to have, by way of my orders, vacant possession of the property at Bankstown (I was told that Ms Vu is still residing there) and also possession and control of the motor vehicle.
	
	
	Counsel for the Trustee accepted that it is no small thing for an order for possession of land to be made against its registered proprietor. Nor is it a small thing for a registered proprietor to lose the ability to deal with his or her property as he or she sees fit.
	
	
	Having said that, counsel emphasised that the orders that I am being asked to make are, in truth, ancillary to a dispute that was resolved definitively by the Court of Appeal many months ago.
	
	
	Turning to my determination, it can be seen that many of the orders that I am being asked to make are well founded in various subsections of s 30 of the Act: proposed order one is derived from s 30(1); proposed order two is derived from s 30(2)(a); proposed order seven is derived from s 30(2)(b); and proposed order eight is derived from s 30(4)(a).
	
	
	It can be seen that proposed order five seeks, amongst other things, an occupation fee for every week that Ms Vu may be in possession of the property contrary to my order for vacant possession. I have no difficulty ordering that she pay all rates, taxes and insurance associated with the property until it is vacated. But no evidence was placed before me as to current market rental of like properties in the same suburb. Nor were oral or written submissions made in support of this part of the order. In those circumstances, I do not consider that I can rely safely upon judicial notice to make an order in the nature of the one sought. For that reason, I do not propose to make proposed order five to the extent that it speaks of an occupation fee; if the Trustee needs to, no doubt it will return to this Court and seek it separately.
	
	
	To my mind, it is appropriate that the orders sought be made by me now. It is to be recalled that Ms Vu was first placed on notice of the fact that the Commission was proceeding against her and her property six years ago. As well as that, she was personally served with notice of the current motion as long ago as 25 May 2015.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I think that the proposal that the respondent must give vacant possession four weeks from today could be inappropriately onerous. After all, the Commission has not pursued its funds with the utmost urgency. I propose to extend that order so that vacant possession must be given seven weeks from today. I also propose to give a small amount of leeway with regard to the provision by Ms Vu of her car keys.
	
	
	Finally, counsel submitted that I should order indemnity costs against Ms Vu. That was said to be on the basis that a trustee is normally entitled to such costs. It was also said to be appropriate because Ms Vu had done nothing to cooperate in the making of these orders.
	
	
	So much may be accepted. But I approach the question of indemnity costs carefully. I have not heard from a contradictor, and I know nothing of the personal circumstances of Ms Vu that may have made it difficult or impossible for her to facilitate this latest phase of the litigation. And in any event, I would not have been prepared to make the orders without having had the whole history of the matter carefully and helpfully explained to me by counsel, along with the provision of an analysis of the salient features of the Act.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I propose to order that the respondent must pay the costs of the Trustee on the ordinary basis.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 30(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian must pay to the Treasurer of New South Wales an amount sufficient to discharge the defendant’s debt arising from the proceeds assessment order made on 29 February 2009 from the net proceeds of the sale of the defendant’s interest in property restrained in these proceedings.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 30(2)(a) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian is to sell the interest of the defendant in the property specified in Schedule One of the orders made in these proceedings on 29 November 2013.
	
	
	The applicant is entitled to vacant possession of the real property situated at and known as X XXXX XXXX, Bankstown NSW, folio identifier 7/SPXXXXX (“the Bankstown unit”), at and from 5:00 pm seven weeks from today, that is, on 22 September 2015.
	
	
	The applicant has leave to issue a writ of possession in respect of the Bankstown unit, with execution of such writ stayed until 5:00 pm on 22 September 2015.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay all rates, taxes and insurance in respect of any period of occupation of the Bankstown unit after 5:00 pm on 22 September 2015, until she vacates the property.
	
	
	The defendant is to deliver the keys and control of the 2007 Subaru Tribeca vehicle, registration number XXXXXX, to the applicant by 5:00 pm on 5 August 2015.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 30(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, the Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian, and any authorised delegate appointed in accordance with s 9(2) of the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009 (NSW), are appointed to execute any deed or instrument in the name of the defendant and to do all things necessary to give validity and operation to the deed or instrument.
	
	
	The defendant must pay the costs of the Trustee as agreed or assessed.

2767360,Dicianni v R; Pintabona v R [2015] NSWCCA 201,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentences

Giuseppe Dicianni (the applicant) stood trial with Josephine Pintabona (the co-applicant) before RS Hulme AJ and a jury upon two counts of murder. The two murders related to the killing of Mario and Albert Frisoli in their home at Rozelle on 6 May 2009. The applicant was alleged to be the principal offender and the co-applicant his accomplice.


	
	It was the Crown case that the co-applicant was having an affair with the applicant, that she drove him to and from the home of the deceased and that she thereafter sought to assist him by providing a false alibi.
	
	
	The trial commenced on 29 April 2013. His Honour directed verdicts of not guilty with respect to the co-applicant upon the two murder charges at the end of the Crown case on 28 May 2013. Thereafter on Friday 7 June 2013 the jury retired to consider their verdicts with respect to the applicant upon two murder charges, and with respect to the co-applicant upon two accessory charges. The jury returned with majority verdicts of guilty on all counts on Monday 24 June 2013.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on count 1 relating to Mario Frisoli to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 years, commencing 18 August 2010 with an additional term of 4 years. On count 2 relating to Albert Frisoli he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 years commencing 18 August 2020 with an additional term of 4 years. The overall sentence comprised a non-parole period of 30 years, commencing 18 August 2020 with an additional term of 4 years.
	
	
	The co-applicant was sentenced as an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mario Frisoli to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing 13 March 2013 with a further term of 9 months. As an accessory after the fact to the murder of Albert Frisoli, she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 13 March 2014 with an additional term of 1 year. The overall sentence comprised a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 1 year, so that the co-applicant would be eligible for parole on 13 March 2016.
	
	
	The applicant has appealed against conviction on a single ground:
	


Ground 1 – The verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence.


	
	The co-applicant has appealed against conviction on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1 – His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the appellant’s statements to the police on 17 June 2009 and 20 July 2009.

Ground 2 – The verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence.

CROWN CASE


	
	The Crown case against the applicant and co-applicant was as follows.
	
	
	The murders were the culmination of longstanding acrimony arising from the breakdown of a business relationship between the applicant and Albert Frisoli that had been deteriorating since 2002 after the applicant was diagnosed with bowel cancer and his involvement in the business became more limited. Thereafter, the relationship was marred by court disputes, threats and restraining orders. Ten days before the killings, criminal proceedings instituted upon the applicant’s complaint that Albert Frisoli had forged his signature on documents were withdrawn and the prospects of success in related civil proceedings, upon which the applicant had spent almost $400,000, appeared unlikely.
	
	
	On 6 May 2009 the applicant used a disguise to gain entry to the Frisoli home and to avoid detection by security cameras which he believed to be operative, but which were not, so that he could kill Albert Frisoli. He first killed Mario Frisoli and later Albert Frisoli. Albert Frisoli was aged 57 and his brother Mario was aged 51. They lived together at 17 Goodsir Street Rozelle. Mario was a pensioner and spent most of the day at home. Albert ran a successful construction business out of premises at Wetherill Park and after May 2006 at Seven Hills.
	
	
	At about 5.15pm on Wednesday 6 May 2009 a neighbour saw what he thought to be an elderly lady wearing a cloak, hood or scarf slowly walking along Goodsir Street and cross the road towards the front door of the Frisoli home. Shortly after the neighbour heard sounds of what appeared to him to be a person being pushed against a wall, bodies coming together, breaking glass and thumping.
	
	
	At about 6.35pm CCTV showed that Albert Frisoli attended a BP Service Station at Seven Hills on his way home. He was wearing a short sleeved shirt and no scarf. At 7.15pm he spoke briefly on his mobile phone to his girlfriend, Natasha Kourea, and told her that he was just parking his truck at home and would call her back shortly. He did not do so and did not respond to an SMS message she sent him at 9.40pm. Witnesses heard thudding noises emanating from the Frisoli home and at 7.20pm a witness standing in front of 17 Goodsir Street heard a loud banging noise and a male voice scream. It was the Crown case that Albert Frisoli had been murdered shortly after he entered the house.
	
	
	The bodies of Mario and Albert were found the following day (7 May 2009) by Mr Mirko Naidofski. There was no sign of forced entry into the premises, except for the damage caused by Mr Naidofski. Mario lay on his back in the lounge-dining room next to the couch to the immediate left of the entrance from the hallway. Albert Frisoli lay face down in the same room near the dining furniture. Both had been stabbed fatally – Mario 21 times and Albert 27 times. Albert had also sustained significant injuries to the head – his jaw and nose had been broken and one of his dislodged teeth lay underneath his body. In addition to the clothing which he had been wearing in the CCTV footage taken at the BP garage, a black scarf was found partly wrapped around his right arm.
	
	
	Bloodied footprints were identified in and around the deceased bodies which Luminol revealed led up the driveway of the Frisoli home into Goodsir Street, through a park and along George Street. The footprints continued to the gutter, suggesting that the killer entered a vehicle from the passenger side and that the vehicle had been correctly parked for that side of the road.
	
	
	On 9 May 2009 the police spoke to the applicant under caution. He denied any involvement in the deaths and said that he had not been feeling well and had spent the previous days at home with his wife.
	
	
	On 11 May 2009 the applicant made arrangements to urgently obtain an Australian passport, to meet his accountants and his lawyers, to obtain a referral from his GP to a medical practitioner in Italy and to obtain tickets to Italy for himself and the co-applicant. On 12 May 2009 he collected his passport and the tickets. Police spoke to him, his son Robert and the co-applicant at Sydney International Airport on 12 May 2009 just before he and the co-applicant flew out of Australia. The applicant never voluntarily returned to Australia. He was extradited on 29 July 2011.
	
	
	Investigations were lengthy and involved forensic analysis of the crime scene and in particular, the scarf found on Albert’s body. There were fibres on each body which police believed to be consistent with coming from a cape or a wig. The scarf contained DNA consistent with that of the applicant and the co-applicant.
	
	
	The Crown case against the co-applicant was that she had driven the applicant away from the murder scene and provided him with a false alibi. She did return to Australia on a couple of occasions and when first spoken to by the police on 17 June 2009, gave an account of events on 6 May 2009 which provided the applicant with an alibi. Later she confirmed that on 6 May 2009 she alone had driven her car, a silver Hyundai, which she subsequently sold on 24 July 2009. She too was extradited and arrived in Sydney on 31 August 2012.
	


EVIDENCE IN THE CROWN CASE

Police and forensic investigations


	
	Ms Ellen Konza of the Forensic Services Group was of the opinion that the body of Mario Frisoli had been moved. She based this on various bloodied marks on the floor.
	
	
	At a later date Ms Konza examined the co-applicant’s silver Hyundai. Although numerous areas on the car seat, door trim and boot resulted in a positive reaction to Luminol spray, none of those areas produced a positive result for blood using a Hemastix test strip. An area of the fabric from the passenger seat, which had been positive to Luminol, was removed and sent for further examination. In cross-examination Ms Konza agreed that a Motorola ear-piece belonging to Albert Frisoli and a tea-towel were found to have her DNA on them, despite her having worn a protective suit to avoid such a possibility. She was not able to say how or when that contamination might have happened, or if it happened at the scene or later back at the laboratory. It was the only time in 11 years that she had deposited DNA on an evidentiary item.
	
	
	Detective Elliott gave evidence that the use of Luminol resulted in the development of an extensive trail of bloodied footwear impressions from the front door mat at 17 Goodsir Street to the northern end of George Street, a distance of approximately 284 metres. The footprints entered a park and made a trail over the grass. The footprints continued for a further 18 metres into George Street and stopped at the western kerb, about 12 metres from the northern end of the George Street and Reynolds Street intersection.
	
	
	Detective Brady, who had also followed the Luminol blood trail, gave evidence as to shoe comparisons with that blood trail. On 20 November 2009 he received and examined images of the shoe impressions in blood from the crime scene and compared them with shoes belonging to the applicant and co-applicant. He was able to rule out the co-applicant’s shoes as being similar in any way to the bloodstained impressions. In relation to the shoes belonging to the applicant, he was able to say that the particular shoes did not match the pattern of the soles found at the scene but the size, length and width of the outsole was “similar”. He explained that by “similar” he meant that the shoes did not have an “identical” pattern but were similar in length and size to the impressions at the crime scene. He thought that the impressions from the scene indicated a handmade shoe, rather than something synthetic such as a jogger.
	
	
	In cross-examination Detective Brady agreed that there were differences between the measurements of the applicant’s feet and the partial shoe impressions and that the similarities he spoke of were within the scope of variation of foot sizes for people generally of that size. He agreed that there were many people in the community who had that foot size.
	
	
	Professor van Vuuren, a forensic pathologist, gave the cause of death for Mario Frisoli as multiple stab wounds. She described 35 injuries, being either stab wounds or incisions. She distinguished between a wound and an incision in that a stab wound was caused by a stabbing motion and an incision was more likely to occur by a slashing type of motion. There were eight defensive wounds to the hands of Mario.
	
	
	For Albert Frisoli the cause of death was described as “multiple stab wounds”. He was aged 57, with a body weight of 93 kgs. Professor van Vuuren described 34 injuries. There were no obvious self-defence injuries. There were several blunt force injuries to the head and face, including a fracture of the jaw with loose teeth, bruising to the left eye, a broken nose, lacerations to the head and subarachnoid haemorrhage and contusions of the brain.
	
	
	Professor Duflou, a forensic pathologist, gave evidence in relation to an axe handle which had been found in the garage of the home of the co-applicant. He was of the opinion that the injuries to the face of Albert Frisoli, such as the broken jaw and broken nose, could have been caused by a blunt object including the axe handle. Because of the limited amount of bleeding from some of the stab wounds, Professor Duflou thought that those stab wounds were inflicted at about the time of death or a very short time before death when the heart was unable to pump blood. He thought that the blunt force injuries to the head were probably sustained before death, whereas at least some of the stab wounds were sustained after those injuries. He thought that some of the blunt force injuries could have caused unconsciousness. It was his opinion that Albert Frisoli’s death was due to stabbing and the blunt force injuries. Professor Duflou disagreed that there would necessarily have been DNA or saliva deposited on the axe handle from a single blow to the face.
	
	
	Detective Searles, a fingerprint expert, gave evidence that no fingerprints of the applicant or co-applicant were found at 17 Goodsir Street.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Crimmins commenced an examination of the co-applicant’s car on 6 August 2009. Luminol was sprayed throughout the interior of the vehicle. When using Luminol he wore a full disposable suit with boot covers, gloves, eye-mask and a breathing apparatus that fully encapsulated the face and was attached to his back. Areas that reacted to the Luminol were circled with crayon, as shown in photos taken at the time. A presumptive test for blood using a Hemastix test strip was positive for the floor mats. The floor mats, seat covers and door trim were removed and sent for further examination. Swabs were taken of the door handles and also sent for further examination. He said that protective clothing was worn because Luminol was carcinogenic and in order to prevent contamination.
	
	
	Ms Friedman from the Division of Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe was an expert on DNA. She gave evidence concerning her examination of items and DNA testing. She said that the black scarf found with Albert Frisoli tested positively for human blood. There were 13 locations on the scarf tested for DNA. Three of those areas of the scarf produced significant results. In area 6 there was a mixture of DNA types. The profiles of Albert Frisoli, the applicant and co-applicant could not be excluded as contributors to that mixture. The effect of those results was that it was approximately 13 billion times more likely that the DNA profile originated from Albert Frisoli, the applicant and co-applicant than if it originated from Albert Frisoli and two unknown, unrelated individuals in the general population.
	
	
	The result for area 9 was the same. There was a mixture of DNA types. Albert Frisoli was the major contributor. The applicant and co-applicant could not be excluded as minor contributors to that mixture. It was approximately 13 billion times more likely that this mixed profile originated from Albert Frisoli, the applicant and co-applicant than if it originated from Albert Frisoli and two unknown, unrelated individuals in the general population.
	
	
	In area 11 there was a mixture of DNA types. Once again it appeared to be a mixture of Albert Frisoli, the applicant and co-applicant. On this sample it was approximately 1.2 billion times more likely that the DNA profile originated from Albert Frisoli, the applicant and the co-applicant than if it originated from Albert Frisoli and two unknown, unrelated individuals in the general population.
	
	
	Ms Friedman said that she tried to test areas on the scarf where there appeared to be minimal staining from blood. In two of those areas the major contributor was the co-applicant. She thought that the most likely way for someone’s DNA to get onto an object like a scarf would be through wearing it and it would also depend on how the scarf were worn. If the scarf were worn around the neck, talking, coughing or sneezing could also deposit DNA onto the scarf.
	
	
	Ms Friedman used another system in addition to Profiler Plus to test the scarf for DNA. This was the Y-STR system. This system targeted only male DNA. Ms Friedman explained the results of using that system as follows:
	


“Q. In relation to your major report, which you did before you received Ms Pintabona's buccal swab with her DNA, what were the results of the Y filer testing?

A. The Y-STR profile recovered from area 6 of the scarf, which is item 214, is a mixture that appears to originate from two male individuals. One of them could be Albert Frisoli. Assuming Albert Frisoli is the one contributor then Giuseppe Dicianni has the same Y filer profile as the second contributor. This result provides additional support for the hypothesis that Giuseppe Dicianni is one of the male contributors.” (T.345.25)


	
	Ms Friedman also examined the trim near the front passenger seat of the co-applicant’s silver Hyundai motor vehicle. Her evidence in relation to that testing was:
	


“Q. What I'd like you to do is to go to the areas that you examined in your findings?

A. We examined four separate areas on the trim. In area (i) the screen test for blood gave a positive result, although we did know it was a fairly weak result and we attached the caveat that, just explaining as the test is not specific for human blood. The result indicates only the blood may be present and if so, is not necessarily human blood; it doesn't distinguish between animal blood and human blood. Although we got a positive result we subjected that area to DNA testing and we recovered a DNA mixture originating from more than one individual. However, we could not determine the profiles of the individual contributors.

In area (ii) we recovered, we got a positive result of the screen test for blood and the DNA testing recovered a DNA mixture originating for more than one individual. One of the contributors to that mixture has a combination of DNA types possessed only by Albert Frisoli, Holden Frisoli and Atlanta Frisoli among the individuals who provided reference samples for this case. The profile of this one contributor is expected to occur in approximately 1 in 20 unrelated individuals in the general population.” (T.247.34 – 248.2)

(Holden and Atlanta Frisoli are the children of Albert Frisoli.)


	
	Ms Friedman further explained the results of the testing of the door trim of the car as follows:
	


“Q. Just in relation to the profile we're talking about, if you go to the approximate occurrence in the general population, you gave evidence, did you not, that the profile in this one contributor, of this one contributor is expected to occur in approximately 1 in 20 unrelated individuals in the general population?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you explain what that means, particularly when you consider, say, the approximate occurrence in the general population referred to in, say, the scarf can be grossly different?

A. The problem with the result that we obtained for the swab from the vehicle was, number one, as his Honour pointed out, there's only a small amount of DNA there. There also is a contribution of DNA from more than one individual and it appears that there's DNA from at least three people to this particular mixture. We have been extremely conservative in our working out who the possible contributors are. And it makes it extremely difficult, for the very reason I have given, because the low levels of DNA and the number of contributors, however, what cannot be contested is that one of the contributors to this mixture has that 7.3 at D7, because it comes up; it's there. It has to have come from somebody. Somebody has to possess that 7.3.

The difficulty, then, is trying to link that 7.3 with what's occurred at the other areas, and the only result that we are particularly confident with is the result at VWA which is on the top line in the middle where you can see there's quite a large contribution of 16. And in my opinion and my experience from dealing with thousands upon thousands of mixtures, I believe it is irrefutable that whoever possesses that 7.3 at D7 has to possess a 16 at VWA. I'm not saying they have to be 16, 16. I'm just saying they have to at least have a 16 at VWA, and the figures for one in 20 simply refer to the combination of somebody in the population who is both a 7.3 at D7 and 16 at VWA. That is all. I have used nothing else because I'm unable to, with confidence, determine what their profiles are at the other areas because there are a number of contributors and I can't be sure that what I'm seeing of those other areas doesn't come from the other contributors.

So I am looking at, first of all, my determinations that he can't be excluded as a contributor to the mixture. I know whoever has contributed to this mixture has to possess a 7.3 at that last area at D7 and possess a 16 at VWA. And looking at the figures of what percentage of people in the population have that combination, just that combination of those two results, is why the figures are not as significant as for a full profile.

Q. In relation to a full profile, and indeed in your report, let's say in relation to the scarf where there are far greater figures mentioned, can you indicate to the jury why that is?

A. When we look at the results from the scarf there's a lot more DNA, there is a lot more information and we're looking at a full profile because I know that with the amounts of DNA that I have recovered, I'm seeing all the information at all the nine areas from all the contributors. It appears that there is a mixture of three people in the mixtures where I have reported statistics. And we're looking at the likelihood of finding, first of all, an individual who fits that mixture and it would, there would be quite a few people in the population that would fit into that mixture because there is a mixture of three people.

To go at random and find a second person who in combination with the first person and then the third person, who in combination with the other two, gives you that mixture that we have seen from the scarf and nothing else. So you first have to find somebody who fits in. Not that difficult. Then a second person who fits in, and then a third person who, the three in combination will give you that particular mixture that we are recovering from the car. That's why the figures are that much more, that much greater than just looking at two particular areas because you're working with limited information. But within the scarf we got a lot more information.” (T.252.28 – 253.39)


	
	Ms Friedman carried out testing on the axe handle found in the co-applicant’s garage. The results of her testing were:
	


“Q. Item 246 is the axe handle. In relation to the screening test for blood firstly, what was the result of that?

A. The results for that are positive. However once again we stated due to the weakness of the result and where it was from that as the test is not specific for blood this result indicates only that blood may be present and if so it's not necessarily human blood.

…

A. After carrying out some further testing, we tested three areas of the axe handle. The DNA testing in two of those areas was unsuccessful. However, DNA from the third area we recovered DNA that was a mixture that originated from more than one individual. Due to the low levels the DNA the profiles of

the individual contributors could not be determined. We also received some swabs said to have been taken from an axe handle and we recovered a DNA profile from those swabs. It was a partial DNA profile, but what was recovered was a partial profile that had the same profile as Giuseppe Dicianni. We conducted statistics on the DNA that we did recover and determined that that partial profile is expected to occur in approximately 1 in 1.3 million individuals in the general population.” (T.255.34-T.256.7)


	
	Ms Friedman was cross-examined on three research papers regarding the secondary transfer of DNA. She agreed that DNA could be conveyed to an item via an intermediary but only under “very specific circumstances”. She agreed that she was well aware of the risk of contamination in the laboratory. They had the profiles of all their current staff and all their past staff as well. She was aware that in this case there had been contamination of a tea-towel and a mobile phone earpiece by Crime Scene Officer Konza.
	
	
	Dr Susan Bennett gave evidence concerning fibres which were found at 17 Goodsir Street and on the bodies of the deceased. She was not able to draw any useful conclusions from those fibres other than there was a possibility that the fibres came from something like a wig.
	


Civilian witnesses


	
	Mr Moss lived at 19 Goodsir Street. At about 5.15pm he saw what he described as an elderly lady walking down the street on the opposite footpath. She was walking down the hill from his left. He observed her to walk diagonally across the road towards number 17, which was next to his house. His evidence was:
	


“Q. What did you see her do then, or that person do then?

A. As she was diagonally walking across the road, I noticed her turn and gaze to, what appeared to be towards me, just momentarily, and directed her attention back towards number 17; continued to walk to number 17, through the gate. I lost sight of her momentarily because of the trees. And then I am able to see again once she walked passed the trees as she walked towards the front door of the house.

Q. You described this person as an elderly lady. Can you remember what it was about her, or the clothing, that you can recall?

A. Yes. She had what I would describe as a cloak, a cloak on, something that came forward and covered the face. Plus her - I guess the way she walked, just the demeanour of the person appeared to be an old, elderly lady to me, yep.” (T.313.30” (T.313.30)


	
	Mr Moss described the cloak as a “red riding hood” cloak of a dark colour. Initially the old woman appeared to be walking slowly but when she crossed the road, she did so more purposefully. It was a “steady purposeful pace”. He had never seen her before.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter he heard noises from number 17. Mr Moss described those noises as follows:
	


“A.   … They were sort of muffled, like very muffled. Sounded a bit to me like, at the time I thought it sounded like bodies against a wall, perhaps being hit against a wall. But it was quite muffled. And after a short amount of time I heard, to me it sounded like glass breaking, maybe a bar or something of that dimension breaking. I heard a little bit more of a muffled, muffled noise. And then I heard another object break again. It sounded like glass. The noise wasn't as loud as the previous one. A little bit more muffled noise and then silence.” (T.315.29)


	
	Mr McDougall lived in Goodsir Street, a few houses down and across the street from the Frisolis. On the evening of 6 May 2009 he went outside to pick up his fiancée. His evidence was:
	


“Q. What time, are you able to say? This particular incident, what time was it?

A. About 20 past 7.

Q. Did you go outside your place to go and get into your car; is that right?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. Can you indicate what you heard or what you saw?

A. Well, as I was putting my key into the car door I heard like a loud banging sound. And right on top of it, around about the same time, a male voice screaming. It was a loud thumping bang and a male voice screaming.

Q. The noise that you heard, are you able to describe that more?

A. Well, it was like a startled scream, a startled scream, a surprise. And I've never heard a scream like that before, so it was a new experience to me.

Q. The bang, the loud bang you heard, what was that like?

A. It was like two bits of heavy material coming together, like yeah. I work a lot at sea and we do a lot of banging and it was like that, yeah.

Q. How long did this scream go on for?

A. It would have been about five seconds at the most.

Q. What was your reaction to that?

A. Well I thought, crikey. It startled me. It actually startled me and scared me a little bit, because it was out of the blue. I didn't expect that. I thought, crikey, what was that? And I waited for about 10 seconds to see if there was anything. I turned straight to where I thought I heard the sound.” (T.339.20)


	
	He was able to say that the incident happened at 20 past 7 because he had been trained in the military to look at his watch when anything startled him.
	
	
	Mr Naidofski was a builder by trade and worked for Albert Frisoli. On 7 May 2009 at about 7.40am he tried ringing Albert but there was no response. He was not able to contact either Albert or Mario. He spoke to Albert’s partner, Natasha, and decided to go over to Rozelle. When he rang the doorbell and tried to ring the phone there was no answer. He went down the passageway between the houses and looked in the window. He could see a person lying face down on the ground. He told Natasha to call for an ambulance and he would dial 000. He asked a handyman nearby for his crowbar and forced the front door open. He found Mario lying on his back with his eyes open and Albert was lying face down. Both of them felt cold to the touch. He observed several pools of blood and a knife lying on the floor about a metre away. He went back outside without touching anything.
	


The business relationship between the applicant and Albert Frisoli


	
	Ms Natasha Kourea was the de facto partner of Albert Frisoli. Their romantic relationship had commenced in 2000. Albert Frisoli and the applicant entered into a business relationship in 1997. The partnership performed building and concrete work. Ms Kourea met Albert when she was employed in the business.
	
	
	In about 1999 the applicant was diagnosed with bowel cancer and had surgery and chemotherapy. The applicant stopped working at that time and never returned to fulltime work. She said that although the applicant was cleared of cancer by about 2002, he continued to suffer from pain in the stomach from the surgery which he had undergone.
	
	
	In 2002 the relationship between the applicant and Albert Frisoli changed for the worse. The issue was a claim by the applicant that Albert Frisoli owed him money and that having sold a unit which he received from a client, he had not properly accounted to the applicant for the proceeds of sale. Ms Kourea described a particular incident in February 2006 when the applicant came to Albert’s office and she could hear raised voices. She observed the applicant pushing Albert against the wall with Albert saying “stop pushing me, I’ve got a sore neck, stop pushing me”.
	
	
	A further confrontation occurred in March 2006 which resulted in Ms Kourea calling the police. After that incident, Ms Kourea and Albert Frisoli applied for an AVO against the applicant and his son Robert. The relations between the applicant and Albert Frisoli continued to be hostile during 2006 and 2007. At one point the applicant was charged with breaching the AVO. In 2006 Albert and his company commenced a civil action against the applicant’s company.
	
	
	In October 2008 the police spoke to Albert Frisoli and Ms Kourea concerning an alleged fraud. The applicant alleged that Albert had forged his signature on a share transfer and that Ms Kourea had witnessed the forged signature. On 27 April 2009 the criminal proceedings came on for hearing at the Downing Centre Local Court. Discussions took place between Ms Kourea, Albert Frisoli and the police prosecutor concerning the opinion of the handwriting experts about the forged document. Following those discussions, the police prosecutor withdrew all of the charges against Albert Frisoli and herself. The applicant, his son Robert and the co-applicant were present at the court on that day.
	
	
	Ms Kourea gave evidence that during the time that she had known Albert Frisoli she had not known him to wear a scarf, except when he went skiing. He always wore the same one which was grey and white with black stripes. She did the washing for Albert and Mario and that was the only scarf she had ever seen. She had not known Mario to wear a scarf. When she was shown the black scarf found on Albert’s body she said that she had never seen Albert or Mario wearing a scarf like that.
	
	
	She said that for a period of time before the falling out between the applicant and Albert Frisoli, the co-applicant had been doing the cleaning of the office at Wetherill Park which the partnership used. During that time she could not recall Albert Frisoli wearing a scarf. She said that it had to be very cold for him to even wear a jumper or a jacket. She did not remember the co-applicant doing the cleaning after the dispute between the applicant and Albert Frisoli commenced.
	
	
	In cross-examination she agreed that Robert did become involved in the concrete business until about 2002. She said that the applicant was worried about Robert, who had a problem with drugs, and that there was a fair bit of tension between him and Robert. They had become estranged for a period of time in 1999 or 2000. She agreed that Robert was a very volatile character and was quite irrational on occasions. She denied that she had exaggerated the level of the dispute between Albert Frisoli and the applicant, particularly as to what happened in February and March 2009.
	
	
	Evidence was given by Mr Aloisi, who worked as a concreter, for a company that Albert Frisoli partly owned. He described an incident in early March 2006 when he arrived at work and found that the applicant was in Albert Frisoli’s office. He said that the applicant took him into Albert’s office and was holding a diary and a briefcase. The applicant said in a very loud voice “This diary’s going to give me all the proof I need and I’m going to kill the bastard and his kids”. He adhered to this testimony under cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Banks operated a business from an office next to that being used by Albert Frisoli and the applicant. He said that in February 2006 he was at work when he heard a commotion coming from the kitchen. Ms Kourea came in and said that there was some real trouble in the kitchen and could he come. When he entered the kitchen, he saw that the applicant was pushing Albert Frisoli into the corner and they were pretty much face to face. The applicant was saying that there was money missing from their business partnership and he was holding Albert Frisoli responsible for it. Mr Banks got between them and pushed them apart. He said that he had to intervene on two more occasions and he was aware that the police had attended the office in relation to some of the arguments. Mr Banks said that when he left work at 6.10pm on 6 May 2009 Albert Frisoli and Ms Kourea were still there working.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Winter from the Fraud Squad laid charges against Albert Frisoli and Ms Kourea after the applicant alleged that they had forged his signature on a change of company detail form and on a transfer of shares form. He was at court on 27 April 2009 when the matter was fixed for hearing. It was on that day that the applicant disclosed certain information to the police in relation to the signature used for comparison purposes by the handwriting experts. In particular, the applicant was not sure whether he had signed certain documents which the handwriting experts relied on for their opinion. He said that the applicant became very angry on a number of occasions after the police informed him that the prosecution case was now weak. Later that day, the prosecution was discontinued with the police withdrawing the charges against Albert Frisoli and Ms Kourea.
	
	
	In cross-examination Detective Winter agreed that Robert was quite volatile with the police and appeared to be a hot headed young man. He agreed that Robert was the one trying to push for the prosecution to proceed.
	
	
	Mr Moio, solicitor, was acting for the applicant in his civil proceedings against Albert Frisoli. He was present at the Downing Centre on 27 April 2009 when the criminal proceedings were withdrawn. It was on that occasion that he informed the applicant that the civil proceedings which he had brought against Albert Frisoli were also unlikely to be successful.
	


Location of Robert Dicianni on night of 6 May 2009


	
	Mr Hogan was the manager of the Breakfree Motel in Bankstown. He gave evidence that on 6 May 2009 Robert Dicianni booked into room 232 at 4.03pm using his driver’s licence as photo ID. Information from the door lock showed that there were five occasions when the door card was used to enter the room: 17.32, 18.09, 22.52, 22.01 and 22.09. There were two entries for room service, noted as “dinner”, at 18.12 and 20.17. Robert was visible on the motel CCTV in the foyer and the basement car-park. In cross-examination he agreed that he was not sure if the times recorded allowed for daylight saving, but he could work it out if necessary.
	
	
	Ms Bacaling was in a relationship with Robert Dicianni as of 6 May 2009. She said that in July 2009 Robert and the co-applicant were going overseas to Italy. Ms Bacaling purchased the co-applicant’s silver Hyundai, which was two years old with 36,000 kms on the clock, on 24 July 2009 for $3,000. The Hyundai had been purchased by the co-applicant in July 2007 for $17,000. On 26 July 2009 she drove Robert and the co-applicant to the airport for their trip to Italy. Shortly after that date, she had the car washed at a carwash place. She said that the car was pretty clean when she bought it, but she wanted it to be clean and shiny. She said that no-one asked her to have the car washed.
	
	
	In cross-examination when she met Robert he told her about a legal case that he had against a business partner, who owed him something like a million dollars. He later told her that he had lost the case and he was upset about it. She said that because her flatmate did not like Robert coming back to her place, they decided to stay at a motel on the night of 6 May 2009. He was driving his green Monaro that day. They arrived at the Breakfree Motel in Bankstown at about 4pm, checked in and watched some TV. She said that Robert left the room at 7pm to buy a bottle of wine from Woolworths down the road and returned shortly before 7.30pm. She was able to remember those times because the TV show “Home and Away” was just starting when he left, and he returned shortly before it finished.
	
	
	Detective Whitehouse attended the Breakfree Motel and viewed the CCTV footage for 6 May 2009. Detective Whitehouse was able to establish that Robert Dicianni arrived at the motel at 3.52pm in a lime green Holden Monaro and at 7.20pm he could be seen speaking with staff at the front counter.
	


The applicant’s state of health


	
	Dr Fulham was a colorectal surgeon who performed a low anterior resection for carcinoma of the rectum of the applicant on 5 September 2000. Afterwards, the applicant was referred to an oncologist for chemotherapy. Dr Fulham saw the applicant on various occasions, between 29 August 2000 and 6 March 2009. The applicant presented with lower abdominal pain, but investigations showed no evidence of any recurrence of his colorectal cancer. Dr Fulham referred him to Dr Salmon for management of his chronic abdominal pain. On 23 February 2009 Dr Fulham performed a gastroscopy and colonoscopy. The results were normal and there was no evidence of any recurrence of his tumour. Dr Fulham was of the opinion that by February 2009 the applicant had made a full recovery from his bowel cancer.
	
	
	Dr Fulham examined the medical records for the applicant from a hospital in Calabria Italy. These showed that he was admitted on 4 February 2011 and discharged himself on 9 February 2011. He was admitted for generalised weakness with low level malnutrition and asthenia. The medical history was recorded as a right hemi-colectomy which was incorrect. Dr Fulham said that the medical records from the hospital admission in 2011 indicated a number of tests had been performed, but there was no evidence that he was suffering from cancer.
	
	
	Dr Romeo was a specialist in pain management. He treated the applicant for chronic abdominal pain from 23 June 2003 until 2009. He said that the applicant experienced pain after the resection of his bowel in 2000. In 2007 the applicant had expressed frustration regarding the ongoing pain and asked Dr Romeo to write him a referral letter to a professor in Medina Italy. Succeeding consultations with Dr Romeo included acute episodes of renal colic due to kidney stones. Dr Romeo saw the applicant on 4 May 2009 and gave him a prescription for Tremal for pain management, and Normacol Plus granules for constipation. On 11 May 2009 the applicant attended his medical centre between 7.18 and 7.44pm and advised that he was going back to Italy for pain management and requested an updated letter of referral to the same specialist in Italy as in the 2007 referral. Dr Romeo agreed in cross-examination that no matter what he said, the applicant had a fear that the cancer was in him and eating him.
	


The co-applicant’s actions on 6 May 2009


	
	Ms Baker had known the co-applicant since high school. In 2009 they were “good friends” and she had arranged for a furniture maker in her building to make two bedside tables for the co-applicant. On 6 May 2009 she was trying to contact the co-applicant to tell her that they were ready. She rang the co-applicant several times in the morning and again throughout the day. She had never had trouble getting through to the co-applicant previously and became worried about her. Ms Baker’s husband tried to call the co-applicant as well, but could not get an answer.
	
	
	Ms Baker went bowling that evening and finished at about 8.30pm. She decided to go to the co-applicant’s residence in Fairfield and thought that she arrived at about 8.40pm. There was no answer at the doorbell. Eventually, another occupant let her into the building, and she and her husband went to the co-applicant’s front door together. They knocked on her door but there was no answer. After about 10 minutes, Ms Baker gave up waiting and left. Just as she got outside the building, the co-applicant pulled up in her silver Hyundai. Ms Baker said “Where have you been?” to which the co-applicant replied “out”. Ms Baker described this response as “Said it in an angry way, in an abrupt way like you know why did I ask”. Ms Baker said “What do you mean “out”, where out?”. The co-applicant did not reply. Ms Baker told the co-applicant that now that she knew that she was safe, she would go home to which the co-applicant replied “Aren’t you coming in for coffee?”.
	
	
	They went inside and Ms Baker asked the co-applicant where her phone was to which she responded that she must have left it at home. The co-applicant went to her bedroom and asked Ms Baker to ring her phone. The next minute the co-applicant came out and said “Oh, here it is” and she had her phone in her hand. Ms Baker remembered this particular day because she used to bowl every Wednesday night and this was the first Wednesday night after the co-applicant told her that their court case was adjourned. Ms Baker said it was probably about 9pm when the co-applicant arrived home.
	
	
	The following Monday the co-applicant rang and asked Ms Baker to meet her downstairs. The co-applicant was crying and said that she had to go to Italy. When Ms Baker asked “why”, she said “I need to get away”. The co-applicant said she was going with the applicant, who had an appointment in Italy with a specialist for cancer. The co-applicant said that they were leaving the next day and that she would be away for three or four weeks, but she did not know. Ms Baker said “Why are you going in such a hurry?” to which the co-applicant responded “I just need to get away”. Ms Baker observed that the co-applicant was upset.
	
	
	Phone records showed that on 6 May 2009 Ms Baker made eighteen unanswered calls to the co-applicant between 16:06:50 and 20:52:31.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Baker agreed that she had not checked the times on her phone records when she made her statement to the police on 31 July 2009. The times which she had given in the statement had been a “rough estimate”. Ms Baker disagreed that she did not start to call the co-applicant until 16:06:50. Ms Baker worked in a call centre and had tried to call the co-applicant from her work phone a couple of times that day.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Baker agreed that she “probably” left the co-applicant’s unit before the telephone records showed that the co-applicant had made a call to the applicant at 20:55:18 for 31 seconds. Ms Baker agreed that the two calls recorded as coming from her phone to the co-applicant’s phone at 20:52:25 and 20:52:31 were probably the call or two calls that she made to the co-applicant’s phone when she was in the unit and the co-applicant was looking for her phone. Ms Baker also agreed that two later attempted phoned calls by her to the co-applicant’s phone at 20:56:15 and 20:56:21 were probably made when she was on her way home in her car. Ms Baker said that she was not in the co-applicant’s unit for very long (T.551.45 – 552.44). On the basis of that material, the following was put to Ms Baker:
	


“Q. You see, what I want to suggest to you is that Ms Pintabona was home, was at the unit in the driveway no later than 8.45 pm?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you agree that's possible?

A. Possible.” (T.554.30)


	
	Ms Baker agreed that the co-applicant had said that she had her nails done that day, but said that she had not noticed whether they had been freshly done or not. When asked about the later conversation with the co-applicant before she went to Italy, Ms Baker gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. In any event, she told you that Giuseppe needed medical attention for his cancer?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that she was going to go and assist him?

A. No, she didn't say she was going to assist him. She said she needed to get away and they needed a break and they were going away and he had a doctor's appointment in Italy because he had cancer.” (T.559.45)


	
	Detective Sergeant Hollows said that he and Detective Ogilvy attended the apartment building where the co-applicant lived on 17 June 2009. Detective Hollows identified himself and the co-applicant buzzed them into the building. When he asked if they could enter and speak to her, the co-applicant said “no” because her house was too messy. She agreed to provide a statement but wanted to speak to her solicitor first. Detective Hollows’ statement continued:
	


“I said, 'Yes that's fine. Do you mind if I ask you some questions now and I will record them in my notebook as we go'. Pintabona said, 'Yes, that's fine'. I said, 'We are investigating a murder of Albert and Mario Frisoli that happened on 6 May 2009. How do you know Giuseppe Dicianni?' Pintabona said, 'He's just a friend and I've known him for about 10 years. I was his support person when I went to Italy with him on 12 May 2009'.

I said, 'Those happened on Wednesday 6 May 2009, do you know what you were doing on that day?' Pintabona said, 'Yes I remember'.” (T.813.9)


	
	Detective Hollows then read out what he had written in his notebook at that time:
	


“Stated that Giuseppe came past her place in the morning at Fairfield by himself. He wasn't well when he came. Dropped off some food, some green vegetables that he grows then from his yard. Didn't stay long at all. About 10 to 15 minutes. It was between 8 to 8.30am. Left before 9am. I have known him for about 10 years. He was too sick that day and he went home. Then about 6.30pm I went past his house in Edensor Park by myself and he brought some sauce he made to me in a car. I did not go down to his house. I then left. I came back from Italy last Monday night at 8pm with Thai Airways.

He is very sick over there. Has prostate cancer, I think. Live by myself and if you want a statement I am happy to supply one, but I have to speak with my solicitor, Vince Macri. I will get back to you. I work part time at Bossley Park Deli. I remember that it was a Wednesday morning that he came over and dropped off the greens. In any case I keep a diary and when I get permission from my solicitor I will bring it with me when I give a statement. The Wednesday was the week before I left for Italy on the 12th of the 5th 2009. It was a Tuesday. And signed by Josephine Pintabona. Dated the 17th of the 6th, 2009."" (T.814.39)


	
	On 18 January 2010 Detectives Hollows, Doueihi and Bradley attended Sydney International Airport for the arrival from Italy of the co-applicant. Detective Hollows advised her that she was required by law to provide the name and address of the driver and passengers for her car between 4pm and 9pm on 6 May 2009. She said “Yes, I was driving on 6 May 2009, no-one was in my car as far as I know”. She indicated that she was willing to take part in an interview but wanted to speak to her solicitor first. The co-applicant said that she had a 2009 diary, but she could not remember where it was.
	
	
	Detective Bradley gave evidence that she attended the co-applicant’s place of work on 20 July 2009 and spoke to her. The co-applicant said that the reason the applicant left Australia for Italy was because he was very ill with cancer. She said that she was his support person when she travelled to Italy with him on 12 May 2009.
	
	
	Senior Constable Button gave evidence concerning the telephone records of various individuals which had been compiled into several spread-sheets covering the period 1 April 2009 – 10 May 2009. Those phone records showed that the applicant and the co-applicant were in regular contact with each other, making several calls a day leading up to 6 May 2009. On 6 May 2009 the co-applicant had her phone turned off, or not in use, between 1.26pm – 8.49pm. On 6 May 2009 the applicant made only one call at 8.49pm when he called the co-applicant.
	
	
	In cross-examination Constable Button agreed that the co-applicant’s phone could have been switched on but simply not answered. This answer was qualified when he said that usually when a phone was turned on but not answered, the call was forwarded to another number. Accordingly, from what records were available it appeared that the phone was off and not answered.
	
	
	Detective Inspector Doueihi provided a chronology setting out the Apprehended Violence Orders between Albert Frisoli and the applicant. He agreed that on 9 March and 24 May 2006, the applicant had made threats to harm Albert Frisoli and Natasha Kourea. The AVO’s granted to Albert Frisoli and Ms Kourea were against both the applicant and his son, Robert.
	
	
	Detective Doueihi attended the applicant’s residence on 14 July 2009 with a search warrant. Because the applicant was not home, he spoke to the applicant’s wife, Carolina, and agreed to wait until Robert arrived. He made a note as to what happened thereafter as follows:
	


“Whilst waiting arrival of Robert speak to Carolina regarding Josephine Pintabona travel to Italy with her husband. Carolina claims not to know Pintabona and that her husband travelled overseas to seek treatment. Further claim that Pintabona may have travelled with her husband as a support person as she could not travel due to her illness. Ask about her movements and her husband's movements on 6/5/09. Could not confirm her husband's movements, but indicated she was home all day"". (T.958.26)

In cross-examination Detective Doueihi strongly disagreed with the proposition that the applicant’s wife might have said “we” were home all day.


	
	Ms Danz gave evidence, through a Vietnamese interpreter, that she worked at the Wakeley Perfect Nail Salon. She examined the salon’s appointment book and there was no appointment entered for Josephine Pintabona on 6 May 2009. Ms Danz did not remember if the co-applicant telephoned or attended that day. There was an entry for “Josephine” on 9 July 2009 with a tick next to it, which meant that the person attended. There was also an entry for “Jo” on Monday 11 May 2009, but Ms Danz did not know whether that referred to Josephine.
	
	
	Ms Tat gave evidence, through a Vietnamese interpreter, that she also worked at the Wakely Perfect Nail Salon. She knew the co-applicant, who had been a customer for a few years. She could not remember if the co-applicant came to the shop on 6 May 2009. She could not remember if the co-applicant had telephoned the shop that morning.
	


The applicant’s note during trial


	
	Court Officer Cassidy was standing near the dock on 6 May 2013 at 9.55am when the applicant and the co-applicant entered the dock. She saw the applicant pass a piece of folded up paper with some lines on it to the co-applicant. The co-applicant took it with her hand and immediately put the folded up paper with some other papers she was holding.
	
	
	Corrections Officer Hammerton was in court when Ms Cassidy told him what she had seen. At 10.35am he asked the co-applicant whether the applicant had passed her some paper to which she replied “yes”. The co-applicant handed over a piece of notepaper that had been folded over at least four times. Mr Hammerton unfolded the paper and saw that it was written in a foreign language.
	
	
	Senior Corrections Officer Beguely received the notepaper and spoke to the applicant while he was alone in his cell asking whether he knew that it was an offence to pass or receive anything from the outside while in custody. The applicant responded “Can I have it back, I’m sorry”. Mr Beguely took the note to the Sheriff’s office where a photocopy was made. The original was handed to Detective Whitehouse.
	
	
	Mr Stevanoni, an accredited translator in the Italian language, translated the note from Italian to English. Its content was as follows:
	


“You must tell your lawyer that in addition to cleaning the office each week you used to take home towels, napkins, rugs and other rags from the office in order to wash them in your own washing machine.

Moreover, you always parked your car in front of the office, along the footpath in front of the entrance to the office.

And when Mr Frisoli Alberte (sic) used to light up a cigarette, he did not smoke inside the office, but rather went outside and sat or leaned against your car as it was always parked in front of the office.

When you came to clean the office on many occasions you would pick up Mr Frisoli’s black scarf from the kitchen table or chairs and take it to his office”

   (Exhibit UU).

The scarf


	
	In cross-examination Ms Kourea disagreed that people left clothes lying around the office area. She “supposed” somebody might put their coat down in the open area but she could not remember any occasion when, after his surgery, the applicant came into the office and put down a coat, or similar garment, on a chair or table in the general office area. She agreed that the co-applicant would come and clean the office when the office was at Wetherill Park but disagreed that the co-applicant took home tea-towels or other items that might be lying around, to be cleaned. She disagreed that Albert Frisoli had scarves other than the one she had described. She disagreed that a black scarf, like the one found on Albert Frisoli’s body, was left in the house when they all worked there together.
	
	
	Detective Whitehouse obtained the CCTV footage from the BP Service Station at Seven Hills and extracted still images at 6.33pm and 6.36pm from it. These showed Albert Frisoli entering and leaving the service station shop wearing a short sleeved shirt and no scarf. The clothing he was wearing was exactly the same as when he was found murdered, except for the addition of a black scarf draped over his body.
	
	
	He said that of the 16 people that can be seen on the CCTV footage, 13 of them were wearing either short sleeves or light clothing. None were wearing scarves, beanies, gloves or clothes consistent with cold weather. On 6 May 2009 the temperature was recorded by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology at Seven Hills as 16.7 degrees Celsius at 6.30pm and by Sydney Observatory at 19.3 degrees Celsius at 6.30pm (Exhibit WW).
	
	
	In cross-examination Detective Whitehouse agreed that he had spoken to Atlanta Frisoli who said that her father was not a person who wore scarves. She said that her father had scarves but was simply not in the habit of wearing them. She had seen him wearing a scarf, but only in very cold weather and only very rarely. Detective Whitehouse had also spoken to Holden Frisoli who said that as far as he was concerned, his father did not wear scarves.
	


Applicant’s travel plans


	
	Mr Labozetta was the manager of Marconi Travel Agents in Fairfield. He gave evidence that just after 9am on Monday 11 May 2009 the applicant and co-applicant booked two tickets to Italy. The applicant said that he needed to travel to Italy urgently because he needed an operation for cancer. Mr Labozetta was able to arrange a flight on Thai Airways for them, leaving the next day. He then assisted the applicant to apply for an urgent renewal of his passport.
	
	
	Later that day, the co-applicant came to the shop at about 6pm and paid for one of the tickets. She paid $2000 cash and $1233 by EFTPOS. The next morning, 12 May 2009, the applicant and his son Robert came to the travel agency and paid the outstanding amount of $2840. The applicant collected his ticket and the co-applicant’s ticket. The tickets were for departure from Sydney on 12 May 2009 and departure from Rome on 13 July 2009. At some point before 13 July 2009 the co-applicant changed the return ticket for the applicant to 14 September 2009.
	
	
	There was independent evidence that the applicant collected his Australian passport on 12 May 2009 at 11.45am. Thai Airways confirmed that the applicant failed to board the Thai Airways aircraft on 14 September 2009 and in doing so, forfeited his ticket.
	
	
	Mr Antoniou, a solicitor, had been acting on behalf of the applicant since September 2007 in a civil dispute he had with his ex business partner. It related to an alleged fraudulent transfer of company shares while the applicant was ill. He said that in early 2009 the applicant came to his office and collected all the files relating to those proceedings. He said that on 11 May 2009 he was working in his office when Gino Cassaniti, an accountant in his building, asked if he would witness a General Power of Attorney document that he had prepared for the applicant and his son Robert. After Mr Antoniou explained the consequences of the Power of Attorney document to the applicant and Robert, he witnessed their signatures.
	
	
	Mr Joubert was the principal of a corporate insolvency business. On 11 May 2009 he received a call from Gino Cassaniti about an urgent potential insolvency matter for Aian Investments. Mr Joubert drafted the documents necessary for a director of Aian Investments to appoint a voluntary administrator. Later that day, he met with Mr Cassaniti and the applicant who told him that the company owned a block of land at Wetherill Park and was owed debts by various people. The applicant appeared in a hurry to get the paperwork completed. When the property was sold on 23 February 2010, the proceeds were distributed to creditors and shareholders. It was a 60/40 split between a company associated with the applicant and his family, and 40% to a company associated with Albert Frisoli. The money payable to Albert Frisoli was still in his trust account at the time of the trial.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Chambers attended the applicant’s home at 10am on 9 May 2009. He observed that the applicant was wearing dress shoes of a size considerably smaller than his own size. Detective Chambers read into evidence his statement as to what happened on that occasion. The statement included:
	


“…. Did you kill Albert or Mario Frisoli?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Were you involved in the murder?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Did you arrange these murders?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Do you know who murdered them?"" He said, ""No, but Albert had a great many enemies."" I said, ""What were your movements this week?"" He said, ""I was home all week from Monday to Friday. I'm sick. I have cancer and take a high dosage of medication."" I said, ""Did you go anywhere at all this week?"" He said, ""I only go out once a week to take my wife to the club for lunch."" Detective Sergeant Furia said, ""Are you referring to the Marconi Club?"" …

Detective Sergeant Furia said, ""Did you take your wife to the club for lunch this week?"" He said, ""No, we are both sick. We just stayed home this week."" Detective Sergeant Furia said, ""Can anyone verify your story?"" He said, ""Just my wife. We were home alone all week."" Detective Sergeant Furia said, ""Did you have any visitors?"" He said, ""No.""” (T.679.14)


	
	On 12 May 2009 Detective Chambers received information that the applicant was planning to leave the country. At about 2pm he and Detective Sergeant Furia drove to the international airport. The applicant and the co-applicant had checked in and were sitting in a café. Detective Chambers’ evidence about what happened next was:
	


““I said, ""Why are you going to Italy?"" Josephine Pintabona said, ""He is a sick man and going for cancer treatment."" She opened her carry on bag and showed me some tablets. I said, ""When will you be back?"" Dicianni said, ""In a month."" Detective Sergeant Furia said, ""Where are you going?"" Dicianni said, ""Turin. I am seeing a doctor who has been treating me for years.""” (T.682.16)


	
	Detective Sergeant Furia gave evidence that on Tuesday 12 May 2009 he attended the international airport with Detective Chambers. They located the applicant and co-applicant and spoke to them. Detective Furia spoke to the applicant in Italian:
	


“Hi, I’m Fabio Furia from the police again. You never told me that you were going to Italy. Why didn’t you call me. Giuseppe Dicianni said “Don’t be sly with me, I know you made inquiries with the travel agent …

Detective Sergeant Chambers said: “When will you be back?” Giuseppe Dicianni said “in a month”. I said “Where are you going?” Giuseppe Dicianni said “Turin, I’m seeing a doctor who has been treating me for years”. I said in Italian “Why should we believe you, you never told us you were leaving Australia?” Giuseppe Dicianni said in Italian “Listen, I know what game you guys play. I was once in the Carabinieri in Italy. If you think I killed Albert and his brother, prove it.” I directed a comment to Josephine, I said “Did you get my card with a message to call me?” She said “Yeah, I was going to call you when I got back”. I said “Giuseppe are you going to come and see me when you come back?” Giuseppe Dicianni said, “I’ll be back in a month and I will come and see you”. Giuseppe Dicianni shook my hand with a promise gesture. There continued to be some more general talk between the four of us before Detective Chambers and I left Josephine Pintabona and Giuseppe Dicianni at the airport.”

The route from the crime scene


	
	Detective Sergeant Hollows with Detective Doueihi drove an unmarked police vehicle on 9 December 2009 from 1 George Street, Rozelle to the applicant’s home in Edensor Park and then to the co-applicant’s home in Fairfield. They left George Street at 7.30pm and arrived at Fairfield at 9pm. They did not travel on any toll roads. Detective Hollows read onto the transcript the following from his police notebook (Exhibit QQ).
	


“At 7.30pm on Wednesday 9 December 2009, with Detective Doueihi and I drove an unmarked police vehicle from outside 1 George Street, Rozelle, to xx xxxxxx xxxx Edensor Park, the home residence of Giuseppe Dicianni. Detective Doueihi being the driver and I was the passenger. From this location Detective Doueihi and I drove to xxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx Fairfield. I recorded the exact route we took being the following from 1 George Street, Rozelle.” (T.815.40)


	
	Detective Doueihi said inquiries made with the M4 Tollway showed that no Etag activations were recorded against the applicant’s or co-applicant’s vehicle. In May 2009 the tolls were still taking cash or coins. If someone paid by cash, there would be no record of the vehicle having used the tollway. The only detection would be if the driver violated the toll then a camera image would be taken of the vehicle.
	
	
	In cross-examination Detective Doueihi agreed that the route which he took on 9 December 2009 was from George Street, left into Reynolds Street, left into Evans Street and then down to Victoria Road. He took what he thought was the most direct route, without going through any tolls and sticking to the speed limit. He took 90 minutes to go from George Street to Edensor Park and then to Fairfield. He agreed that he did not check what traffic conditions were like on 6 May 2009 and that is why he maintained that there could be variations in time. He was aware of the CCTV camera outside 33 Ewell Street which showed a vision of cars as they turned from Reynolds Street into Evans Street. He had viewed the footage, but considered the quality very poor. A similar vehicle, or a dark vehicle may be seen, but it was not possible to make out any registration numbers.
	
	
	It was established that the Ewell Street camera was motion activated and could be activated by light, headlight, car movement, pedestrians or even shaking the camera. Detective Doueihi agreed that there were other CCTV cameras in the vicinity but that the majority of them were for the protection of businesses and not all of them recorded vehicles on the road. He was questioned as to the most “logical” way to travel towards Victoria Road:
	


“Q. I want to put to you the most logical way out for an offender parked in George Street as you postulated was the way you travelled when you did your re-creation?

A. No I don't agree with that. The offender could have taken any route, any other different route. As I said there are different, there are a lot of variables to the route I took. The offender could have driven down to Victoria Road and turned right, gone all the way up Victoria road and hooked on to the M4 that way. The offender could have jumped straight on to the M4 freeway and that could have knocked fifteen minutes off the time. I did an estimation of what I believed to be the most direct route and it is purely suggestive of what my opinion is.

Q. You just said it might have knocked ten or fifteen minutes off the trip?

A. If the offender accessed the M4 from the beginning of the M4 at Concord that would certainly speed things up. I don't know how long, I did not try that route.

Q. You are just guessing?

A. I am not guessing, it is common sense if you hit the

M4 freeway at Concord some ten kilometres before I joined the M4 it certainly would reduce the time that I would have arrived at Edensor Park.” (T.992.8)


	
	Detective Doueihi agreed that the footage from the Ewell Street camera had portions of footage missing, due to it being motion activated. There was one long gap from 19:11:42 through to 20:39:44. It was put to him that the camera times shown on the footage were an hour fast, meaning the gap was from 6.11pm through to 7.39pm, but he did not agree. It was put to him that on either view of the times, and for whatever reason, the co-applicant’s car was not captured by the Ewell Street camera leaving the area. Detective Doueihi maintained that there were two other possible ways of exiting the area without turning down Evans Street.
	


Evidence as to cars parked around Goodsir Street


	
	Mrs Sinclair lived at the top end of Goodsir Street near Evans Street and knew Mario and Albert Frisoli. About 10am on Saturday 2 May 2009 she noticed an iridescent bright green coloured sedan parked outside the hardware store near where she lived. She noticed that the licence plates started with “BAZ”. The car was there on Sunday and Monday as well. The car was there when she left for work on the morning of Monday 4 May 2009 but was gone when she arrived home. She did not see anyone inside the car. It was common ground that the number plate on Robert Dicianni’s green Monaro started with the letters “BAZ”.
	
	
	Mr Sinclair on the Sunday before 6 May 2009 saw a metallic greenish-yellowish type of small late model car parked on the street. He recalled the licence plate began with “BAZ”. The car was there Sunday and Monday. He did not go out on Monday, but when his wife came home she said “That little car has gone”. He particularly noticed the car because of the colour. He had never seen that car in the street before.
	
	
	Statements were taken from local residents of Goodsir Street. One of those was Helen Tilly. Her statement was dated 12 May 2009. Relevant parts of that statement were:
	


““On Monday 4 May or Tuesday 5 May 2009 …As I was locking the screen security grill I noticed a mulberry/red coloured late 80s or early 90s coupe style sports car travelling towards Evans Street in Goodsir Street.

… As the car went past it would have been less than five metres from where I was standing. It was travelling slowly, even given that it was only a small narrow street. It was travelling much slower than normal traffic in the street. It was not a car that I have seen before in the street and seemed uncharacteristic for the street.

…

I think the driver was the only person in the vehicle. I couldn't be 100 per cent of that. I could see the driver was intensively observing both sides of the street. The driver had dark hair. His hair was about two inches long and appeared to be thick and full. He had dark features. I remember the dark eyes and eyebrows. He had a light olive coloured skin, which made the dark eye features prominent. I think he would have been in his mid to late 20's. I am not sure if I would recognise this person if I saw them again.” (T.925.19)


	
	It was common ground that the applicant owned a red Honda Prelude coupe at that time.
	


THE DEFENCE CASE


	
	It was the applicant’s case that Albert and Mario Frisoli had plenty of other enemies and that the Crown had not ruled out other people seen around the vicinity of Goodsir Street. He was at home all afternoon and on the evening of the murders, as attested by both his wife and the co-applicant. He was a weak, sick man and could not have committed the murders. He went to Italy for urgent medical treatment.
	
	
	The co-applicant’s case was that she was not involved in any way. She was having her nails done that afternoon and she spoke to her friend. She drove past the applicant’s house at 6.30pm, saw him at home and collected some cooked food he had prepared for her.
	


The applicant’s evidence


	
	The applicant said that he had been born in Italy, had never been to school and had taught himself to write. He came to Australia in 1972 when he was aged 26 with his first wife and three year old son Robert. He started working for himself in about 1983/84 doing concreting, formwork and steel work. He met Albert Frisoli in about 1984/85 when he was the general manager of Wintertons, which was a construction company for whom the applicant did some jobs. They first discussed starting a business together in about 1996 or 1997. By then he had known Albert for 12 years. In about 1997/98 they formed a company called Rostsun Civil. The applicant and Albert were 40% shareholders and his son Robert had a 20% share. The company did concrete formwork and steel. They purchased a block of land at Wetherill Park and built an office on it.
	
	
	In September 2000 he was diagnosed with bowel cancer. After he was operated on, the cancer was gone but pain and going to the toilet remained a continuing problem. He was taking six Tramadol a day for the pain. After the operation, his relationship with Albert was not very good. From the end of 2005 he asked him a few times to show the paperwork for where the money went. Albert would reply “maybe next week” or “maybe next month”. The applicant said that he never got to see the books and he was suspicious that Albert was hiding something. The longer the delay, the more suspicious he became. He said that the language between them became more heated over time. The applicant said that he came from Calabria and it was just a normal part of the Italian culture to talk more with his hands and sometimes push a little bit and touch. He might have said things to Albert like “I’ll kill you”, but in Italian culture that can be used at any time. He said that even his wife said that to him in conversations.
	
	
	The applicant said that after 2005 he had suspicions that Albert was keeping information from him. He never had any proof that he was keeping money, assets or information from him but the information he wanted related to State Concrete which was operated by Robert and Albert. He said that the pumps used by State Concrete were owned by Robert and that the two concrete pumps were worth $500,000 and $800,000. They were used on large construction jobs and earned a lot of money, sometimes $100,000 a week. He had invested about $800,000 in the pumps from his own assets. On the day that he was at the Wetherill Park office and spoke to Mr Aloisi, he had just found the book with the addresses to where the pumps had been sent. He had then said to Mr Aloisi “I got the proof where the pump be located every day. Now I can fight with Albert to show work not listed”. That conversation took place towards the end of 2005.
	
	
	The applicant said that State Concrete started operating in about 2000-2001 and that at that time Robert was mixing with the wrong people and was a heavy drug user. Robert stopped working in 2005 and he lost everything – his house, his family and his pumps. After Robert’s marriage broke down in 2005, he lived in the front section of the applicant’s house. The applicant bought the $800,000 pump for Robert and tried to get him jobs and find labour. Despite this, Robert abandoned the business and the applicant had no contact with him for six or seven months.
	
	
	The applicant said that the incident with Albert Frisoli on 23 February 2006 did not involve him threatening Albert with a syringe. He went to the kitchen area and brought with him a lease agreement for the yard and a document to remove Albert from the company. He had a 60% shareholding and he could do that. The applicant said that when he gave Albert the papers, he became agitated and went to get up from his chair causing him (the applicant) to hold him by the arm and tell him to sit down. They started talking loudly and screaming at each other. Chris Banks came in and the three of them talked and that was the end of it.
	
	
	After that incident, Albert and Natasha Kourea took an AVO out against him. A couple of weeks later, the applicant took out an AVO against Albert. When the applicant breached the AVO, he did not think he was doing anything wrong by going to his own office. He did not understand the implications of the AVO. The applicant admitted going to Wetherill Park and cutting the padlocks after the AVO orders had been made final on 16 May 2006 at a time when he knew that he was in breach of the AVO orders.
	
	
	After his operation in 2000, the applicant met the co-applicant and became intimately involved some six or seven months later. The co-applicant would help him visit doctors and specialists and would help him with his English. They saw each other every day. The applicant’s wife did not know about them until they went to Italy together. The applicant went to the Wetherill Park office from 1998 to 2005 and was very familiar with it. Although he had never seen Albert Frisoli with a scarf on his neck, he had seen that black scarf (Exhibit D) in the office. When they got to the office in the morning, they would take off their jackets, coats and things and put them on the table. When clients came, one of them would pick up everything and move it to a chair or somewhere else.
	
	
	The applicant said that Albert Frisoli had forged some signatures and the matter went to the Supreme Court. Separate criminal charges were also brought against him over the forged signatures. Both these cases collapsed in 2009. The applicant was not happy about it but when he found that it was not true that the signatures were forged, he accepted it and said okay. The forensic experts said that they believed the signatures were not forged and were in fact, his. He had a recollection of signing the documents in question but did not recognise the signature as his. At the time he was on six Tramadol a day and had over $5 million or $6 million dollars in assets, without including three properties in Italy worth $1.5 million each.
	
	
	The applicant did not know how much Albert might have been keeping from him. He wanted Albert to show him the paperwork and to be fair. The applicant had his wages paid by the company for two years when he was sick. He said that he thought that he might have owed the company money and wanted to give money back if that were the case.
	
	
	The applicant’s health was very poor in 2009. He could not do physical work and he could not bend because of two herniated discs in his back. He denied killing Albert and Mario Frisoli – “absolutely not”. He did not arrange for either of them to be killed. He said that he had not set one foot in Rozelle after his cancer surgery. He denied using the sledge hammer handle to hit anybody. He said that he had given the handle, to the co-applicant for her protection and that was why it was found in her garage with his DNA on it.
	
	
	The applicant said that in early 2009, some friends made an appointment for him to see a doctor in Moderna, Italy. He could not remember the date of the appointment but it was arranged three or four months before. Some police came to his house and spoke to him on Saturday 9 May 2009. His wife was in bed at the time but after a while she joined them. He told Detective Chambers that on 6 May 2009 he was at home with his wife. He told the police that he was in bed at about 1pm on 7 May 2009 when his son Robert came and told him about the deaths of Albert and Mario Frisoli. He told the police that he had been at home and that he and his wife had been home all week. He said that his wife was sick and that he was not well that week either. He told them that he had cancer but that was an expression which he used. He did not specify that it was the problem of living caused by the cancer to which he was referring. He used the word “cancer” as a shortcut to avoid talking about the related problems.
	
	
	The applicant said that he did go out on Wednesday morning, 6 May 2009, to buy some vegetables and the Italian Forum newspaper. He was back at home by 10am. He did not leave the house again that day.
	
	
	The applicant said that he had originally planned to travel to Italy with his wife but she was too sick. She had bone marrow cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, so he went to Italy with the co-applicant. He went to his house in his home town. While he was in Italy he sought medical treatment for his pain and problems with the toilet. He told the police that he would be back in a month. When he did not come back as planned, he got a solicitor in Italy to send a letter to Vince Macri, his Australian solicitor, with his contact details in case the police needed to speak to him. In Italy he was at his home address at 9 Via Poneicello, San Marco, Argenagino, Cosenza. He said that it was not a secret address and that everyone knew that he was living there.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that he had written a note which he handed to the co-applicant in the courtroom. He said that he only wrote the note to remind her not to forget things. All the things he reminded her about were true things. He explained himself as follows:
	


“Q. Why did you write that note?

A. I write this one here to remember Josephine make sure not forget what job she do in the office, which staff put on the card from the office and she, because was lady cleaning office and remove stuff from the table on the chair, she know black scarf will come from the office some time and so she's know, I just remember, that was my intention but because I never go to school no Italian and no in Australia that is the way I write.

Q. In that note in the first part?

A. Yes.

Q. I don't know what the Italian words are but the translation is said to be in part ""Each week used to take home towels, napkins, rugs and other rags from the office in order to wash them in your own washing machine"" was that a reflection of the truth that Josephine used to do those things?

A. Yes.

Q. In the next bit you say you always parked, according to the translation, you always parked your car in front of the office. Was that a reflection of the truth?

A. Yes.

Q. The next section is Frisoli Albert, used to light up a cigarette and sat or leaned against your car. It was always park in front of the office?

A. Yes.

Q. Was that a reflection of what the truth was?

A. Yes. My son and Albert used to go from office on the car, sit there and talking, because Josephine parked the car in front of the office.

Q. Picking up of Frisoli's black scarf from table or chairs and take it to his office, was that a reflection of the truth?

A. Yes.” (T.1105.7)


	
	In 2007 Dr Romeo wrote the applicant a referral to take to Dr Silvestri in Italy because of the terrible pain he was in. He did not go to see Dr Silvestri in 2007, but he saw him in May 2009. The applicant said that he suffered from terrible pain and constipation. His medications included using a small plastic tube to insert liquid into his anus to provoke a bowel movement. He bought the tubes from the chemist and would always have one or two in his pocket.
	
	
	In cross-examination by the co-applicant the applicant agreed that the co-applicant did not ask him to write the note which he handed to her during the trial. He agreed that she never took clothes or rugs home to wash. He disagreed that he mentioned anything about washing scarves in the note. He agreed with the proposition that the co-applicant did not own the silver Hyundai in 2006 and only acquired that car in the second half of 2007. He maintained that he saw scarves in the office and that Albert was in the habit of wearing a scarf. His evidence was:
	


“Q. Mr Dicianni, Ms Pintabona, when she used to clean the premises, used to also tidy item of clothes from various areas?

A. Yes.

Q. Not specifically a black scarf?

A. No, no.

Q. What were you trying to say when you put that in the note?

A. I tried to say make sure you remember if you move this thing from the chair on the table, because few times this scarf was on the table.” (T.1115.17)


	
	The applicant agreed that he was a keen cook and used to provide the co-applicant with his cooking on a regular basis. He said that he went to the co-applicant’s apartment on the morning of 6 May 2009 and that they made arrangements for later in the day:
	


“Q. You have given evidence that you attended Ms Pintabona's apartment on the morning of 6 May 2009, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. You said you were there for half an hour?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you make any arrangements at that time with her for later in the day?

A. Yes. I say to Josephine, I leave you some sauce on the same spot on the side of my garden where is the gate and on the Wednesday night, I take the sauce on this stand and you go there to leave in that spot. A lot time I leave this stuff, I want to go in and Josephine come through and I just see her. It was about a quarter, 20 past 6, on Wednesday 6 May.

Q. You told her to come around about 6.30, didn't you?

A. Yes, but she comes a bit earlier.

Q. You said to my learned friend you didn't go outside of your house that day?

A. Yes.

Q. Or that afternoon, I should say?

A. Yes.

Q. I suggest to you that you did come outside the house to her car that evening?

A. Sorry? No just before the gate. That's the gate and that's my garden in the front because I got the automatic gate and just on my property. I never go out from the gate, never.

Q. But you went out of the house?

A. On the garden, yes.

Q. To give her the sauce?

A. Yes.” (T.1116.18)


	
	The applicant said that at about 7 or 8pm on Sunday 10 May 2009 he spoke to the co-applicant about joining him on a trip to Italy. He asked her if she would go with him to help him and she agreed. She stayed with him at his house in San Marco and some of the time at his sister’s house, less than a kilometre away. The co-applicant had trouble opening a bank account so the funds she had transferred from Australia were put into his account.
	
	
	In cross-examination by the Crown, the applicant agreed that when he left to go to Italy in May 2009 he knew that he did not have a recurrence of cancer. He said that he knew this because Dr Fulham had performed a gastroscopy and a colonoscopy on 23 February 2009. Dr Fulham had advised him in February 2009 that he did not have cancer.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that when police came to his home on 9 May 2009 he told them that he was home all week from Monday to Friday, that he was sick with cancer and took a high dosage of medication. He agreed that the next day he contacted his friend, Mick Labozetta from Marconi Travel, and told him that he needed to travel to Italy urgently for an operation because he had cancer. The applicant agreed that he lied to them both. He was somewhat vague about the date of the appointment with Dr Silvestri in Italy.
	
	
	The applicant disagreed that he was bitterly angry and disappointed when the criminal proceedings for forgery were withdrawn. He said he was a “little bit disappointed”. He agreed that he gave information to the police on 27 April 2009 that it may well have been his signature on the documents. He disagreed that he would have been more than a little upset after he had expended such an enormous amount of money.
	
	
	He said that when the police spoke to him at the airport, Detective Furia asked him “Where are you going?” and he said “Turin. I’m seeing a doctor who has been treating me for years”. The applicant agreed that although Dr Silvestri was in Modena, that is not what he said. He said “Turin” by mistake because it was where he used to live with his wife before. He agreed that Modena and Turin were a long way from each other. The applicant agreed that he did not fly to either Turin or Modena, but to the south of Italy to his home in Calabria.
	
	
	The applicant cancelled the appointment with Dr Silvestri because he was sick, but arranged to go the next day. He had a receipt for seeing the doctor. His wife put the money in an account in Australia because Dr Silvestri had an account in Australia. He was not able to give a date when he in fact saw Dr Silvestri. He disagreed that he went to Italy in a rush because the police wanted to talk to him about the Frisoli murders. He said that his court cases were all finished and he was in a rush to help his wife. He wanted to get to Dr Silvestri to see if he could help his wife find a compatible donor. In the end, there was no time because his wife needed a transplant as soon as possible.
	
	
	The applicant denied that he had to be extradited back to Australia. He said that he wanted to come back but just did not make it. He sent a letter to his solicitor in Australia with his contact details. He said that after his arrest on 18 August 2010 he was admitted to the prison hospital because he was malnourished. The reason he was not eating was because he was in a cell with eight other people. He needed to use the toilet 20 times a day and was embarrassed. He agreed that his health had improved since he had been back in Australia but that was because Dr Silvestri had given him a cure. He said that over eight months his pain went from eight or nine and a half to four or four and a half.
	
	
	It was put to the applicant that the day that he wrote the note to the co-applicant was the day that Ms Friedman, the DNA analyst, was to give further evidence. He disagreed that the note related directly to Ms Friedman’s evidence and the DNA on the car and the scarf. His explanation was:
	


“Q. Why would you bother with the note; why would you bother?

A. I was just to remember Josephine because she's very, is a simple woman, make sure was telling the solicitor what's she's done in the office. What was job of, which stuff to move, which stuff, touch all this thing. I was just, something to give it to her, like this (indicated.) That's why I give in front of table and front of everybody. I was thinking nothing was it the truth.” (T.1136.44)

The applicant said that Ms Friedman gave evidence that his DNA and that of the co-applicant were on the scarf because from 1996 to 2006 the scarf was in the same office.


	
	The applicant denied that he had ever said to Mr Aloisi “I got all the evidence I need against Albert Frisoli. I’m going to kill the bastard and his kids”. He denied that he had ever threatened Albert with a syringe during an argument in early 2006. He said it was a plastic plunger. “It was the plastic thing in front of the syringe. Not the syringe. It was plastic” (T.1143). He denied that he had an arrangement to meet the co-applicant in George Street Rozelle after the murders. He agreed that he owned all leather shoes, but said that he had never used the type of shoe shown in the footprints. He had never been in that little park. He had only been in Rozelle three times in his life and not since 2000. He did not get into the co-applicant’s car. He denied taking the axe handle to Goodsir Street in order to bludgeon Albert Frisoli and subdue him. The handle had his DNA on it because he put it in the co-applicant’s garage himself. He had given it to the co-applicant because young men were hanging around the back of the garages where she lived and she was afraid. The applicant agreed that the co-applicant did not report the problem to the police and nor did he.
	
	
	The applicant said that he did not “go outside” his home on the afternoon of 6 May 2008. He said that he gave the sauce to the co-applicant inside the fence line to his property. He did not take the sauce to her car on that day. When asked to explain the evidence of the co-applicant that he had brought some sauce which he had made to her in the car, he said:
	


“Q. Did you pick up the sauce and take it out to her in the car?

A. No I put it just there, just there. Josephine just jumped from the car like this and take it.”


	
	The applicant denied that at 6.30pm that day he was waiting inside the Frisoli house, having killed Mario. He agreed that he knew from the committal proceedings what the DNA evidence from Ms Friedman would be. He denied that he was trying to influence the co-applicant to give a false story.
	
	
	Mr Macri, the solicitor who was retained by the applicant and Robert, said that it was well known where the applicant was living in Italy. In August 2009 he received a letter and a medical certificate relating to the applicant, from a lawyer in Italy. Those documents confirmed where the applicant was and why he was there. Following the receipt of that letter, Mr Macri remained in contact with the police right up to the extradition process and the applicant’s return to Australia. He ceased to act for the applicant in about April 2012.
	
	
	The applicant’s wife was aged 66 and lived with him at Edensor Park. His son, Robert, lived there in separate accommodation within the house and sometimes came and went without them knowing. She said that in 2000 the applicant was diagnosed with bowel cancer and had surgery. Afterwards he was in constant pain and could not empty his bowels. She was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2003. In May 2009 she was very sick. She was taking Thalidomide tablets for the cancer treatment and was undergoing chemotherapy. In September 2009 she was admitted to Liverpool Hospital for a stem-cell transplant.
	
	
	She said that she became aware that Albert and Mario were dead on 7 May 2009. The police came to the house two days later. She recalled being in the kitchen when the police talked to her husband. She remembered being sick during the week before and at home all week. The applicant was sick too, and was looking after her. She said that the applicant had left the house on the morning of 6 May 2009 for one or two hours, but had then returned home and was with her for the rest of the day.
	
	
	She planned to go to Italy in 2009 to see Dr Silvestri but she was not well enough to travel. She subsequently learned that the applicant had gone to Italy with the co-applicant. She knew the co-applicant from the Marconi Club, but she did not know that she was “going with him, you know what I mean”.
	
	
	She denied that she had ever spoken to Detective Doueihi about the whereabouts of her husband on 6 May 2009. Her evidence was:
	


“Q. Do you remember that in about mid July 2009 police came to your house to do a search?

A. Yep.

Q. And Mr Doueihi was one of the police officers; do you remember that?

A. I don't remember that.

Q. Putting names aside, do you remember talking to police officers?

A. No.

Q. Was there an occasion where you were asked what your husband's movements were on the 6th of May 2009?

A. No.

Q. Did you tell police on any occasion where you and your husband were on the 6th May 2009?

A. No.” (T.1182.31)


	
	In cross-examination by the Crown the applicant’s wife agreed that on 14 July 2009 police came to search her house but agreed to wait until her stepson, Robert, came home. She did not remember the police speaking to her about the co-applicant. She did not say that the co-applicant travelled with her husband as a support person because she was too ill. That was not true. She agreed that the police asked her about her husband’s movements on 6 May 2009. She denied that she told the police she could not confirm his movements on that day. She said that on 6 May 2009 her husband went out shopping in the morning for three-quarters of an hour to one hour, that was all, for the rest day they stayed home together. (T.1196) She gave this evidence:
	


“Q. What did you do actually at home?

A. I was sick and he was sick. He was look after me. He cook for me. He look after me and we then stay home together.

Q. Were you in bed, were you asleep?

A. I lay down, yes, on the lounge, on the couch.

Q. In the afternoon do you remember your husband leaving?

A. No.

Q. I suggest that he did leave in the afternoon, did he not?

A. No.

Q. He didn't come home until much later that night, did he?

A. He didn't leave the house. He was with me.

Q. You have been in contact with your husband in Australia, in Sydney, whilst he has been in gaol, haven't you?

A. Here?

Q. Yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you go out or did he telephone you? Does he telephone you every few days?

A. Every day.

Q. Do you go out to see him sometimes?

A. Every Monday.” (T.1197.1)


	
	The co-applicant gave evidence. She met her husband in 1979 and they had two children. They separated in 1999. She met the applicant just after this separation in 2000. They became close friends and then more intimately involved. She used to go with him to the doctors and she would put the appointment times in her diary.
	
	
	At some point she started doing the cleaning work at the Wetherill Park offices and she came to know Albert Frisoli. She recalled seeing Albert wearing scarves during that time when it was really cold. As part of the cleaning, she used to take home the tea-towels, cleaning cloths and towels from the bathroom and wash them. There were a number of men working at the offices and they used to leave clothes lying around everywhere. She would collect them when she was cleaning and either put them in the corner or in a cupboard. She was shown Exhibit D (the black scarf) and she recalled seeing similar scarves at the office, although she could not identify exactly that scarf. She did not ever own that scarf. She did not own a scarf like it.
	
	
	She said that she first told her solicitor about there being similar scarves at the Wetherill Park office late the year before. She did not need to be reminded about seeing scarves at the office so the note which the applicant passed her during the trial was “a bit silly”. She went with the applicant to the office in February 2006. The applicant did not push Albert Frisoli against the wall. He took a plunger out of his pocket, not a hypodermic needle. It was the plastic part in a wrapper, not the actual metal needle.
	
	
	The co-applicant was living in a block of ten units in Fairfield in 2009. The garages were at the rear and after leaving the garage, she had to walk through an open area to the backdoor. In early 2009 when she came home, there were three young men there who came close to her, just before she closed the garage door. She wanted to try to scare them away but she did not have anything with her. When she told the applicant about it, he gave her the axe handle to use. It was to use for her own protection so that no-one would touch her. She used to keep it downstairs so that once she drove in, she would carry it up with her and then in the morning, she would carry it back down.
	
	
	The applicant was involved in two court cases against Albert Frisoli. When the cases stopped, the applicant was not too happy about it “but it was just another court case that he lost”. In about the first week of April the applicant told her about his plans to travel to Italy for an appointment with the specialist. She made a booking at a Blacktown travel agent in the company of a girlfriend. When the applicant said he was going with his wife, she cancelled.
	
	
	She said that Wednesday 6 May 2009 was her day off. The applicant came to her place in the morning and dropped off some greens, but did not stay long. He went home because he was not feeling well. On that morning she made an appointment to get her nails done. The appointment was for 4pm, but she had to wait. She gave this evidence:
	


“Q. Do you recall what you did after you left the nail place?

A. It was about 20 past 6 or quarter past whatever it was I went past Dicianni's place, it was around that time.

Q. Was there an arrangement made for you to go there at that time?

A. Yes in the morning.

Q. Why did you go there?

A. I picked up some food he'd cooked for me, he usually cooked for me all the time on a regular basis, he'd cook for me and I go and pick it up.

Q. Why make an arrangement for a time to go over then and pick it up?

A. Because said to me he was not well but if he was feeling okay to come and he would do it for me.

Q. Were you in the habit of driving past any way?

A. Yes I would drive past after work if I had a bit of spare time I would go in my car and if he was in the garden I would sort of wave.

Q. Can you explain why you would randomly just go over there?

A. Because he was sick all the time and I was worried.

Q. What did you do other than that, like before I get there, did you see him when you went over there to his place?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. How far approximately was your place from his place?

A. Drive wise?

Q. Yes?

A. About fifteen minute drive, fifteen or twenty minute drive if you get the lights.

Q. What sort of driver are you?

A. Just a normal driver. No offences until now touch wood.


	
	On 7 May 2009 the co-applicant learned of the deaths of Mario and Albert in the late afternoon or evening. She could not remember whether it was the applicant or Robert who rang her. She was very shocked. She remembered that Sunday was Mothers Day and that her daughter came to visit with her family. The co-applicant said that she had had her nails done for Mothers Day and that is why she remembered it. When her daughter left, she rang the applicant. It was in that call that he spoke to her about going to Italy. Her evidence was:
	


“Q. What did he say?

A. Well, he said that his wife is not well, she's not going to go overseas now, and he asked me if I'd like to go.

Q. What did you say?

A. I said, ""Well, if she's not coming"", I said, ""I will come over and I can assist you.""

Q. And he told you before that he was planning to go there?

A. With his wife.

Q. In relation to?

A. His sickness.

Q. Seeking treatment?

A. That's right.

Q. Did you agree to go with him?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. The next day did you make arrangements to go to Italy for the Tuesday?

A. Yes, we did.

Q. Did you consider that a rush?

A. No, not really.

Q. Did you pay for your own ticket?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, on the Monday did you have your nails done?

A. Definitely not. I had them done on Wednesday so I wouldn't have gone again on Monday of course; too short of a period.

Q. What name did they call you?

A. She used to call me Josephine. They never used to call me Jo.” (T.1215.49)


	
	The co-applicant explained the blood found on the passenger seat of her car. She said that just before Easter in 2009, she had bought some rump steak. She was driving home and had to slam on the brakes. The meat “landed in the front” and the plastic split. When she picked it up and put it on the seat, she found that it was leaking blood. She also said that she was a normal driver who did not speed and that it would take her between 15 – 20 minutes to drive from her place to the applicant’s.
	
	
	In cross-examination the co-applicant disagreed that she had told Ms Baker that the applicant was going to Italy because he had cancer. What she said was that he was going to Italy for medical reasons. She agreed that at the airport she told Sergeant Chambers “He’s a sick man and going for cancer treatment” and opened her bag and showed him tablets. She agreed that in February 2009 the applicant had a colonoscopy and that everything went okay and that there was no recurrence of the cancer. She said that it was not that he had cancer, but that he kept worrying about his cancer and whether it had recurred.
	
	
	The co-applicant was cross-examined as to the positive presumptive test for blood in her car.
	


“Q. Two of the possibilities for that presumptive test were human blood or animal blood, two of other possibilities, you remember that, don't you?

A. Yes.

Q. What you're saying to this Court is that a piece of rump steak leaked on to that seat, are you?

A. There's more than one piece that I bought that day, it was two pieces.”

Q. Two pieces?

A. That's right, but they weren't small pieces. They were nice big pieces.” (T.1227.20)


	
	The co-applicant was cross-examined as to the results of the DNA analysis by Ms Friedman.
	


“Q. Given that's the evidence of Virginia Friedman, the DNA analyst, that they got,?

“A positive result for a screen test for blood and the DNA recovered a DNA mixture originating from a combination of DNA types possessed only by Albert Frisoli, Holden Frisoli and Atlanta Frisoli, among the individuals who provided reference samples for this case and that that contributor is expected to occur in approximately 1 in 20 unrelated individuals in the general population.""

If we say that was the DNA of as described by Virginia Friedman, how did that - that your car?

A. I don't know.

Q. What explanation have you got for that?

A. There is no explanation. I can't give you an explanation.” (T.1231.43 – T.1232.6)


	
	The co-applicant denied being in Rozelle on 6 May 2009. She denied giving the applicant a scarf to aid in his disguise. She denied waiting for him in Rozelle and driving him home. She agreed that police came to her home and spoke to her on 17 June 2009. She agreed that Detective Hollows made notes in his police notebook and that she initialled each page and signed it at the end. She disagreed that she told Detective Hollows that the applicant had prostate cancer. She said “He has a lump near his prostate”. She disagreed that she did not mention a lump but said that the police just did not write it down correctly. She denied that on 17 June 2009 she gave the applicant a false alibi to protect him and that she was still lying on his behalf when giving this evidence at the trial. She responded “definitely not”.
	
	
	Ms Zvetanka Raskov (aka Zoov) gave evidence. She used to regularly see the co-applicant outside her house. She was not able to say where she (Raskov) was on 6 May 2009 or if she saw the co-applicant. She was not able to say what she did that day. She remembered going with the co-applicant to a travel agent when the co-applicant booked a ticket to Italy. The co-applicant did not pay for the ticket at the time.
	
	
	Ms Francesca di Vola was the sister of the co-applicant. She knew about the co-applicant’s relationship with the applicant and was not happy about it. She did not know that the co-applicant was going overseas until she saw her on television going overseas. The co-applicant lived in a block of units owned by the family. She knew about the trouble at the back of the block of units with young people taking drugs. She remembered the co-applicant telling her about a time that meat had leaked in her car. She thought it was a time before she saw the co-applicant on television. She said that the co-applicant did not like violence or blood. She said that the co-applicant was a slow driver. In cross-examination she agreed that she did not communicate with her sister all that regularly after she was with the applicant. The usual reason for them communicating was to do with their mother or the family property.
	
	
	Mrs Lisa De Filippi was the daughter of the co-applicant. She recalled her mother telling her about the trouble she was having at the back of the block of units with young people and drugs. She had never seen her mother wear a scarf like the black scarf found near Albert’s body. She said that her mother had told her about having some meat leaking onto the passenger seat of her car but could not remember whether she had told her about that before or after the murders. She said that the co-applicant used to keep to the speed limit when driving. She said that there were occasions when the co-applicant did not answer the phone or when she had forgotten her phone and left it at home. In cross-examination she agreed that she had discussed the case with the co-applicant before she came back from Italy. She agreed that her mother could have had a black scarf with tassels on it like the one found next to Albert.
	


Application to adduce new evidence


	
	Both the applicant and co-applicant sought to rely upon new evidence in the appeal. This evidence was set out in an affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor, sworn 18 June 2015. It comprised the results of inquiries which he had made of Transport for NSW as to traffic incidents which had occurred on 6 May 2009 between midday and 8pm on the following roads:
	



	
	City West Link, westerly direction.
	
	
	Parramatta Road, West of Ashfield.
	
	
	M4 heading West.
	
	
	Cumberland Highway, westerly direction.
	



	
	The results of those inquiries were that at 8.27pm one lane in Parramatta Road heading west was blocked because of a gas leak in Bland Street Ashfield. That was the only incident which could have had any relevance to the driving of the co-applicant’s vehicle between 7.30pm and 9pm. The other traffic incidents recorded in the data attached to the affidavit occurred at times or in locations which were irrelevant to the issue relied upon by the co-applicant, i.e. that road conditions were such as to make it impossible, or highly unlikely, that she would have been able to drive between Rozelle and her home via Edensor Park between 7.30pm and 8.45pm on 6 May 2009. Even the relevance of the lane closure in Parramatta Road at Ashfield is problematic, given the time at which it occurred and its location which is not on the most direct route from Rozelle to Edensor Park..
	
	
	The Crown objected to the applicants relying upon the information in the affidavit on the basis that such inquiries could have been made before trial and relied upon at the trial and that the material in the affidavit was not of such cogency as would affect the deliberation of this Court. Given the contents of the affidavit, as set out above, the Crown’s objection must be upheld. The information in the affidavit is of peripheral relevance and of only slight probative value. The application to rely upon this evidence should be rejected.
	


THE DICIANNI APPEAL

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that it was a fundamental part of the Crown case against him that the co-applicant drove him from George Street following the murders. He acknowledged that in the case against him, that matter only had to be established on the balance of probabilities but submitted that for the co-applicant to have been convicted of the accessorial offence, the jury had to be satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that the jury could not have been so satisfied on either test.
	
	
	He further submitted that if it were not open to the jury to find that the co-applicant drove him from the murder scene, then credence should have been given to her evidence that she saw him at his home at 6.30pm on 6 May 2009 so that he could not have committed the murders.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the applicant noted that in the sentencing judgment (R v Dicianni and Pintabona [2013] NSWSC 1328) the trial judge found:
	


“18   … In the way the case was put to the jury, their guilty verdicts against her carry with them the conclusion that Ms Pintabona did pick up Mr Dicianni.”


	
	This was despite the fact that in the written direction to the jury, the actions constituting the accessorial offending were identified as:
	


“(ii)   That Ms Pintabona intentionally assisted Mr Dicianni by –


	
	On 6 May 2009 meeting him and providing transport from George Street Rozelle.
	


OR


	
	On 17 June 2009 informing Detectives Hollows and Ogilvy that on 6 May 2009 at about 6.30pm Mr Dicianni was at his house in Edensor Park …”
	


The applicant noted that at [22] of the sentencing judgment, the trial judge found as a fact that at the time the co-applicant drove him from the murder scene, she did not know that he had committed that offence but by 17 June when she provided the “alibi” for him she was so aware.


	
	The applicant submitted that a reasonable jury could not have found beyond reasonable doubt that the co-applicant’s car was in Rozelle at the relevant time so as to be able to pick him up, nor indeed that she had enough time to be in Rozelle at the time of the death of Albert Frisoli at approximately 7.20pm and be home in the driveway of her apartment block no later than at 8.45pm. He submitted that the evidence was not sufficient to find beyond reasonable doubt that she had driven him away from George Street following the murders. He submitted that if the jury could not have been so satisfied, this removed an important link in the case against him between him and the murders.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was not enough time to enable the co-applicant to pick him up from George Street, take him to his home in Edensor Park and then drive to her apartment block in Fairfield. He submitted that the evidence of Mr McDougall should be accepted as to the timing of Albert Frisoli’s death, i.e. about 7.20pm. That was consistent with Albert Frisoli talking on the phone to Ms Kourea at about 7.15pm while he was parking his car outside his home. He submitted that an analysis of the telephone records in Exhibit BB, together with the evidence of Ms Baker, made it clear that the co-applicant had arrived at her apartment in Fairfield at about 8.45pm, give or take a couple of minutes. This was because she had spoken to him at 8.49pm when Ms Baker was not present, and probably after she had left.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that when one had regard to the evidence of Detectives Hollows and Doueihi that on 9 December 2009 it took Detective Doueihi 90 minutes (7.30pm to 9pm) to drive from George Street, where the car was suggested to have been, via his home at Edensor Park, to the co-applicant’s apartment, there was not enough time for her to have completed that journey in one hour and fifteen minutes. The test drive conducted by Detectives Hollows and Doueihi was carried out taking the most direct non-tollway route, adhering to speed limits and other traffic restrictions. This was done because the co-applicant’s car was not identified as paying a toll on any of the available tollways between those destinations and received no infringement notices from relevant speed or red light cameras.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon the following:
	



	
	The co-applicant was not known to be a fast driver.
	
	
	For her to have completed the journey in one hour and fifteen minutes, she would have to have exceeded the speed limit and if so there was a reasonable probability that she would have received an infringement notice or have been recorded by a red light camera.
	
	
	It was speculative to suggest that she might have been able to use a different route, which was faster than that taken by the detectives. It was not suggested by the detectives that there was a quicker, non-tollway route.
	
	
	It was speculative to suggest that the co-applicant may have dropped him at a location other than at his home.
	
	
	There was no evidence of traffic conditions on the night of 6 May 2009 such as would indicate that they would have been any better than they were on 9 December 2009.
	


It followed that on the available evidence, ninety minutes was the minimum time available for this journey and that this was not capable of being achieved by the co-applicant within the parameters set out by the detectives in the time available on the night of 6 May 2009.


	
	The applicant submitted that the DNA evidence found on the passenger side of the co-applicant’s vehicle did not exclude that conclusion. This was because there was a serious risk of contamination of the area tested in the motor vehicle and because the DNA result suggested a commonly available profile expected to occur in approximately one in twenty unrelated individuals in the general population. The applicant submitted that this evidence was of little weight when one had regard to the timing evidence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was another body of evidence which made it unlikely that the co-applicant’s vehicle had been involved in the offence in the way alleged by the Crown. This evidence was the available CCTV footage of Evans Street Rozelle and the independent witness evidence as to vehicles in the proximity of where the blood trail ended on the night of 6 May 2009. The available CCTV footage did not show the co-applicant’s vehicle. CCTV footage from other cameras in the area had not been checked. The CCTV camera directed to traffic in Evans Street, covered the most logical exit route for a vehicle parked at the location where the blood trail ceased. In summary, there was no evidence of a vehicle consistent with that of the co-applicant’s observed in the vicinity of the murders, including George Street, at the relevant time. Most significantly a vehicle or vehicles quite inconsistent with that of the co-applicant were observed before and after 5pm on 6 May in the approximate position in George Street where the blood trail ended. The observations were of a male sitting in the driver’s seat of that vehicle.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the overwhelming inference to be drawn from all of the evidence relating to this issue was that it could not establish that the co-applicant drove the murderer away from 1 George Street on 6 May 2009 so that a jury properly instructed should have had a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The applicant challenged other aspects of the Crown’s circumstantial case against him. He submitted that there was no real evidence of him having carried out any kind of reconnaissance of the victims’ home in Goodsir Street. He submitted that while the statement of Ms Tilly described a vehicle, which in some general features was similar to his red Honda Prelude, there was no identification in this regard. He noted that she described the driver as a male in his twenties, whereas he was aged 63 at the time.
	
	
	He submitted that the evidence of Mr and Mrs Sinclair of seeing a vehicle which was very like his son’s car, parked near the victims’ house on the weekend before the murders, could not give rise to an inference of his involvement. He submitted that it was never part of the Crown case that his son, Robert, was an accomplice. He was not responsible for what his son did. He acknowledged, however, that the Crown did suggest that without having any responsibility for the murders, Robert may have been involved in some observations of Goodsir Street on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that, on the contrary, one of the hypotheses consistent with his innocence which the Crown had not negated was that his son, Robert, may have independently arranged for the murder of the Frisolis. He noted that Robert had his own grievances with Albert Frisoli and had threatened to kill him. The applicant submitted that it may well have been the case that his son Robert had deliberately put himself in front of a security camera at the Break Free Hotel at the time Albert Frisoli was killed in order to provide himself with an alibi. The applicant noted that Robert had done so after a series of unidentified phone calls. The applicant submitted that the possible presence of his son’s vehicle in Goodsir Street on the weekend before the murders could not implicate him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that both he and the co-applicant had provided a reasonable explanation for how their DNA came to be on the scarf found with Albert Frisoli. He submitted that the leaving of the scarf with their DNA upon the body of Albert Frisoli (if it were not the deceased’s scarf) was more consistent with it being left there deliberately by an offender seeking to implicate him [the applicant] and divert attention from the true identities of those responsible for the murders. He submitted that contrary to the evidence of Ms Kourea, there was evidence that Albert Frisoli owned scarves and that at the time of the killing, the weather was cold enough for Mario to be wearing a sweater.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was no evidence that the axe handle was involved in the incident. No axe handle was seen to be carried into the house by the old woman, or a person disguised as an old woman. There was no evidence that the handle had been cleaned and no DNA consistent with that of the deceased was found on it.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his wife [who had no reason to be favourably disposed to him] gave evidence that on 6 May 2009 he was at home with her in the afternoon and the evening. He noted that the evidence by police that she could not account for her husband’s movements when spoken to on 9 May 2009 was not tape recorded nor the subject of a signed statement and was a conversation that had occurred without an interpreter. He submitted that as a result, little weight should have been given to it.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence with respect to flight was equivocal in that there was ample evidence to indicate that he was suffering health problems at the time. Even though he did not have cancer, he had a genuine fear that it might recur and was suffering pain and disability related to the treatment he had received for cancer. He submitted that the note which he had passed to the co-applicant had been adequately explained by him in his evidence and was simply intended as a reminder, to jog her memory as to what had occurred.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the trial judge’s entry of a verdict by direction in favour of the co-applicant, taken with her apparent attendance at the nail salon to have her nails in-filled at around 4pm meant that she could not have driven him to the vicinity of Goodsir Street before the murders. This was because the old woman was observed to approach the victims’ house at around 5.15pm. The applicant submitted that if the co-applicant did not drive him there, it was much less likely that she would have come afterwards to pick him up. The applicant submitted that this should be taken with the failure of any of the CCTV cameras in the surrounding streets to show a vehicle of the kind driven by the co-applicant.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that upon the whole of the evidence, a jury properly instructed should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to his guilt and should have acquitted him upon both counts.
	


Consideration


	
	On this ground the question for the Court is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of murder. This is a question of fact. In considering this ground, the Court must undertake its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. In M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 the plurality (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
	


“7   Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. …”


	
	This test has been re-stated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58]. McHugh, Kirby and Gummow JJ said that the reference to “unsafe or unsatisfactory” in M v R is to be taken as “equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as “unreasonable” or such as “cannot be supported having regard to the evidence”. These principles were more recently re-affirmed by the majority of the High Court in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	While this ground of appeal requires the Court to consider for itself the sufficiency of all the evidence led at trial, the burden of persuading the Court that the jury verdict is wrong lies on the applicant: McKenzie v R [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at [370].
	
	
	As a starting point it needs to be kept in mind that a circumstantial case such as this must be evaluated in its entirety not considered on a piecemeal basis when assessing whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence. That is, in effect, what the applicant has done in this case. He has sought to identify various aspects of the Crown case and to demonstrate that on each of these issues, there was a reasonable hypothesis open which was consistent with innocence. That, of course, is not the correct way to approach a circumstantial case. The features of a circumstantial case brought against an accused should not be looked at in isolation from the evidence as a whole. In particular, it is wrong to examine each piece of circumstantial evidence, as a stand-alone issue, to see whether there exists an explanation which is inconsistent with guilt.
	
	
	The correct approach to a circumstantial was considered by the High Court in R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 where the plurality (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ and with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) said:
	


“46   The case against Mr Hillier was a circumstantial case. It has often been said that a jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances. It is of critical importance to recognise, however, that in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence.

…

48   Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither at trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial case to be considered piecemeal. As Gibbs CJ and Mason J said in Chamberlain [No 2]:

""At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of identification may be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness 'separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment'; they should consider the accumulation of the evidence: cf Weeder v The Queen.

Similarly, in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it. It is well established that the jury must consider 'the weight which is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together': per Lord Cairns, in Belhaven and Stenton Peerage, cited in R v Van Beelen; and see Thomas v The Queen and cases there cited.""

And as Dixon CJ said in Plomp:

""All the circumstances of the case must be weighed in judging whether there is evidence upon which a jury may reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of the crime charged. There may be many cases where it is extremely dangerous to rely heavily on the existence of a motive, where an unexplained death or disappearance of a person is not otherwise proved to be attributable to the accused; but all such considerations must be dealt with on the facts of the particular case. I cannot think, however, that in a case where the prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence any part of the circumstances can be put on one side as relating to motive only and therefore not to be weighed as part of the proofs of what was done."" (emphasis added)””


	
	It is necessary therefore that the applicant’s submissions and the verdict of the jury be assessed on the basis of the whole of the evidence adduced at trial. For example, for a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence to exist, the hypothesis must possess some degree of acceptability or credibility and not be fanciful, impossible or incredible. By way of illustration, the applicant’s submission at trial and again on appeal that the scarf was planted by an unknown killer to falsely implicate him and presumably the co-applicant, is a submission which can only be regarded as fanciful and incredible.
	
	
	An important part of the applicant’s submissions was the proposition that if the jury could not be satisfied that it was the co-applicant who had driven the applicant away from the murder scene, then not only was the case against him substantially weakened the defence case was also substantially strengthened because the co-applicant’s evidence of having seen the applicant at his home at 6.30pm on 6 May should be accepted. That reasoning is incorrect.
	
	
	Moreover, it does not follow as a matter of logic that because the jury may not have been satisfied on the balance of probabilities (in the case against the applicant) or beyond reasonable doubt (in the case against the co-applicant) that she drove the applicant from the murder scene, her evidence on other issues should automatically have been accepted. All that such a finding means is that the jury may not have been satisfied that the Crown had proved that part of its case to the requisite standard. It does not mean that the jury were positively satisfied as to the honesty or reliability of the co-applicant on other issues.
	
	
	In any event, as was properly conceded on the appeal as against the applicant, the jury only had to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the co-applicant drove him from the crime scene.
	
	
	At trial the Crown relied upon the following circumstances when taken together as establishing the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Some circumstances are more persuasive than others but it is their total effect which has to be considered.
	



	
	The applicant and Albert Frisoli were in a business partnership.
	
	
	There was a history of threats by the applicant towards Albert Frisoli. Albert Frisoli and the applicant had an acrimonious relationship.
	
	
	Albert Frisoli and Natasha Kourea were granted AVOs against the applicant. The applicant breached these AVOs and continued to approach and threaten Albert Frisoli and Natasha Kourea.
	
	
	The applicant was convinced that Albert Frisoli was defrauding him. Civil proceedings were instituted in 2006. On 18 June 2008 Albert Frisoli was charged with fraud offences as a result of allegations by the applicant. In October 2008 Natasha Kourea was charged.
	
	
	The applicant spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceedings against Albert Frisoli.
	
	
	The criminal charges against Albert Frisoli were withdrawn on 27 April 2009. The applicant was advised shortly after by his solicitor that due to the withdrawal of criminal charges, the civil proceedings had little chance of success.
	
	
	The applicant conducted surveillance of the area around 17 Goodsir Street Rozelle in the days leading up to 6 May 2009. That was the evidence of Ms Sinclair in relation to the bright green coloured sedan with the registration number BAZ. The applicant’s son, Robert, owned a bright green Holden Monaro with number plate BAZ. Helen Tilly at 8.20am on 4 or 5 May 2009 noticed a mulberry/red coloured late 80’s or early 90’s coupe style sports car travelling slowly along Evans Street into Goodsir Street. The driver had dark hair about two inches long which was thick and full. The person had dark features with dark eyes and eyebrows. He had light coloured olive skin. The applicant owned a red Honda Prelude coupe.
	
	
	There were CCTV cameras outside the residence of 17 Goodsir Street, later determined to be dummy cameras. There was also a video intercom system at the front door.
	
	
	On 6 May 2009 Anthony Moss saw what appeared to be an elderly female walk into 17 Goodsir Street just after 5pm. He thought it was an old lady due to the person’s slow walk and clothing. He could not see the person’s face due to something covering the person’s head and face.
	
	
	Anthony Moss heard muffled noises and breaking noises at approximately 5.15pm.
	
	
	Darren McDougall heard a loud bang “like two bits of heavy material coming together” and a male screaming at 7.20pm.
	
	
	Albert and Mario Frisoli were found dead at about 9am on Thursday 7 May 2009 by Mirko Naidofski, who forced entry. Apart from the forced entry by Naidofski, there was no other damage to the premises and nothing outside the living area and the kitchen was disturbed.
	
	
	Fibres were found on the bodies of Albert and Mario Frisoli, as well as the scarf, which were consistent with wig fibres.
	
	
	The DNA of both the applicant and co-applicant was found on the scarf lying on Albert Frisoli’s body.
	
	
	CCTV from the BP Service Station at Abbot Road Seven Hills at approximately 6.30-6.35pm showed Albert Frisoli not wearing a scarf. Natasha Kourea said that Albert Frisoli very rarely wore scarves. The CCTV footage showed him to be wearing a short-sleeved shirt at the time.
	
	
	The footprints inside the premises at 17 Goodsir Street were consistent with the foot size of the applicant.
	
	
	The footprints were likely made by hand-made leather shoes. The applicant owned many pairs of leather shoes.
	
	
	The Luminol trail of bloodied footprints revealed a deliberate, planned route leading up to a point just north of 1 George Street. The strong Luminol impression on the kerb suggested that the murderer entered the passenger seat of a vehicle.
	
	
	DNA consistent with Albert Frisoli’s DNA was found on the trim near the foot well on the passenger side of the co-applicant’s vehicle where his bloodied shoes would have come into contact with the car.
	


That DNA was weak DNA.


	
	The post-mortem revealed that Albert Frisoli suffered from blunt force trauma from a long cylindrical object, resulting in tramline bruises to his back. A blunt instrument was also used to break his jaw and his nose. He had suffered a blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
	
	
	The applicant’s DNA was found on the axe handle, which was located in the co-applicant’s garage.
	
	
	On 6 May 2009 Ms Baker tried to contact the co-applicant on the telephone during the day. None of her calls were answered. She witnessed the co-applicant arrive home at her unit at Fairlight Avenue, Fairfield at around 9pm. When Ms Baker questioned the co-applicant as to her whereabouts, she replied “out”.
	
	
	The drive from Rozelle to Fairlight Avenue Fairfield, via Kalang Road Endensor Park, took approximately 90 minutes give or take 10 to 15 minutes.
	
	
	The co-applicant and applicant did not contact each other at all by telephone on 6 May 2009 until 8.49pm when the applicant made a short call to the co-applicant for 31 seconds. This was unusual as call charge records revealed the applicant and co-applicant generally contacted each other several times a day.
	
	
	On 9 May 2009 the applicant indicated to Detectives Chambers and Furia that he was at home for the entire day on 6 May 2009. On 14 July 2009 the applicant’s wife indicated to Detective Doueihi that she was at home all day on 6 May 2009, but she could not account for her husband’s movements. These accounts are inconsistent.
	
	
	The applicant made urgent arrangements to leave the country under the guise of obtaining treatment for cancer in Italy. On 11 May 2009:
	



	
	He at 7.18 – 7.44am saw Dr Romeo at Edensor Park Medical Centre to seek a referral to Dr Silvestri in Italy for pain management.
	
	
	He at 9am attended a meeting with Cassinitis, Macri, Gerondis and Joubert to organise the liquidation of his companies. He also arranged a power of attorney to be given to his son Robert. That document was witnessed by Peter Antoniou.
	
	
	He attended with the co-applicant Marconi Travel and booked tickets for Italy.
	
	
	He lodged an application for an urgent passport.
	
	
	At 6pm the co-applicant attended Marconi Travel to pay for one of the tickets.
	
	
	The co-applicant crying, told Ms Baker that she was going to Italy the following day because she needed to get away and that the applicant had an appointment in Italy with a specialist for cancer. She said she was unsure how long she was going to Italy for.
	


On 12 May 2009:


	
	He attended Marconi Travel to pick up his tickets.
	
	
	He picked up his expedited passport from the Passport Office.
	
	
	The co-applicant informed her employer she was going to Italy that same day.
	
	
	He at 3.30pm departed with the co-applicant on a flight for Italy.
	



	
	The applicant indicated to Mick Labozetta that he was travelling to Italy to have an operation for his cancer. The co-applicant indicated to police at the airport that the applicant was travelling to Italy for cancer treatment.
	


These statements were untrue.


	
	As at February 2009 the applicant was no longer suffering from cancer. Italian medical records from 2011 did not disclose any evidence of treatment for cancer or that he was suffering from cancer.
	
	
	On 12 May 2009 the applicant spoke to Detectives Furia and Chambers at the airport and indicated that he would return to Australia in a month. He failed to return and was ultimately extradited.
	
	
	On 17 June 2009 the co-applicant spoke to Detective Hollows and Ogilvy at her unit. She indicated that on 6 May 2009 between 8am and 8.30am the applicant came past her place at Fairlight Avenue Fairfield and dropped off some green vegetables. She said that at 6.30pm she drove to the applicant’s house and he brought some sauce to her car and that she did not go down to his house. This is consistent with the applicant’s account of his movements on this day.
	
	
	On 24 July 2009 the co-applicant sold her vehicle to Ms Bacaling for $6000 but only received $3000. She had purchased the car two years earlier for approximately $17000.
	
	
	On 18 January 2010 the co-applicant spoke to police at the airport in response to a s14 LEPRA form of demand. The co-applicant said she was driving her car on 6 May 2009 and no-one else was in the car.
	
	
	On 16 April 2010 the co-applicant travelled to Italy again. She did not return and was ultimately extradited.
	
	
	On 6 May 2013 the applicant passed a note to the co-applicant in court when Ms Friedman was about to be called to give further DNA evidence. The note provided the co-applicant with a version of events to explain away her DNA on the scarf found on Albert Frisoli’s body and to explain away the DNA consistent with Albert Frisoli in her car.
	



	
	I have concluded that the matters relied upon by the applicant to challenge the Crown’s contention that the co-applicant drove his him from the crime scene, while important, are not decisive.
	
	
	It can be accepted that the time available to the co-applicant to drive from Rozelle via Edensor Park to Fairfield was between 1 hour and 15 minutes and 1 hour and 20 minutes. The evidence of Mr McDougall and the telephone call from the applicant to her at 8.49pm fix those parameters. Within those parameters, however, there are a number of variables. Firstly, the time taken of 1½ hours by Detective Doueihi to complete that journey on 9 December 2009 should not be taken as some kind of immutable standard. There are a number of reasons why this is so. His Honour identified some in his summing up. Although there was evidence that the co-applicant was not a fast driver under normal circumstances, these were not normal circumstances. If she were the driver, this was a highly emotional not to mention dangerous activity, which might well have led to her driving at faster speeds than was her norm. Traffic conditions may well have been different on the two nights. Since we do not know what means was used by the murderer to reach Rozelle, it should not be assumed that if the co-applicant did drive him away from the crime scene, that she drove him to his home at Edensor Park, rather than to some other place or vehicle closer to Rozelle.
	
	
	There were routes other than those taken by Detective Doueihi. Most particularly, as Detective Doueihi said in his evidence, had the co-applicant used the tollway and paid in cash, not only would there be no record of her having used the tollway, but the journey would have been significantly shortened. That, it seems to me, is a significant alternative for the journey taking less than 1½ which was hours relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	Little support is provided for the applicant’s hypothesis by the observations of cars in George Street before and at the time of the murders. The timing of the observation made is well before 7.30pm and assumes that the pick up vehicle for the murderer must have remained in the assumed location in George Street for some considerable time. That is not necessarily so. Because parking in that area was difficult, the pick up vehicle could have been moving and not parked at all or some timing for the pick up could have been previously agreed.
	
	
	Similar considerations apply to the CCTV footage. It is put on behalf of the applicant that the CCTV cameras from the Welcome Hotel and Ewell Street failed to show a vehicle of the kind owned by the co-applicant. The coverage by those cameras, however, was not comprehensive. They would have recorded one means of exit from where the murderer was apparently picked up, but there were at least two others which were reasonable and which were identified by Detective Doueihi in evidence. Neither would have been recorded by the Ewell Street camera. Moreover, the Ewell Street camera was motion activated, which meant that its coverage was not continuous. According to the timings recorded on the film there was one long gap from 7.11pm until 8.39pm. This encompassed the very period when one would have expected the vehicle carrying the murderer to have departed.
	
	
	There was an issue as to the correctness of the timing recorded on the Ewell Street CCTV film. It was put to Detective Doueihi that the timings were 1 hour fast. He did not agree with that proposition and it remained an unresolved matter of controversy in the trial. However, as his Honour pointed out in his summing up, it mattered not whether the timing on the CCTV film was an hour fast or not. Even if it were an hour fast, the gap in time would have extended from 6.11pm to 7.39pm which again would have encompassed the very time one would have expected the vehicle carrying the murderer to have departed from George Street.
	
	
	There is nothing in the evidence concerning the co-applicant’s attendance at the beautician’s to have her nails done which impacts on that issue. While there is evidence of a telephone call from her to the salon at 10am, if she did in fact attend the salon to have her nails done that day, there is no evidence other than her own testimony that she did so at 4pm. There is no notation to that effect in the records of the salon and the two persons from the salon who gave evidence at trial had no independent recollection of whether she attended on 6 May 2009 or not.
	
	
	The conclusion I have reached is that the Crown theory that the co-applicant picked up the applicant in the vicinity of the intersection of George Street and Reynolds Street Rozelle at about 7.30pm was not undermined by the matters to which the applicant has referred. It is largely irrelevant that there were other CCTV cameras in the area, which could have been checked by the police but which were not. This is particularly so when the majority of those cameras were intended to protect businesses, rather than provide coverage of roads.
	
	
	The DNA evidence and the evidence of blood found in the co-applicant’s car are in a location where one would have expected there to have been some blood had the car been used to take the murderer from Rozelle. It is true that had the DNA profile been less common, it would have made the Crown case stronger but it remained as a link, albeit not a particularly strong one, between Albert Frisoli and the car. That connection was strengthened because of the positive presumptive test for blood, even though the blood was not proved to be human. As to whether the co-applicant’s explanation that at some time before the murders blood from meat had dripped onto that part of her car was accepted, was very much a jury matter. While there was a potential for contamination in that the handprint of one of the investigating police officers was found on the outside of the car, this would not have affected the positive result for blood. In relation to the DNA testing of the car, this was carried out by Ms Friedman who set out the precautions taken by her and by her organisation to prevent contamination. There was no evidence of any contamination having occurred in relation to the DNA testing in this case.
	
	
	The evidence of the co-applicant that Albert Frisoli would lean against her car when smoking in the car park outside the office premises when the relationship between him and the applicant still existed, did not explain the possible presence of Albert Frisoli’s DNA in her motor vehicle. This was because the co-applicant’s vehicle was purchased in July 2007 and could not have been the vehicle with which Albert Frisoli was said to have come in contact.
	
	
	Accordingly, that DNA evidence remained available as a circumstance which could be taken into account by the jury in linking the co-applicant to the departure of the murderer from George Street.
	
	
	The absence of any contact by telephone between the applicant and the co-applicant until 8.49pm is significant because they normally contacted each other by telephone several times a day. There was, of course, no issue that Ms Baker had tried to contact the co-applicant by telephone throughout much of the day but had been unsuccessful. Whether that was because the co-applicant had left her phone at home or had turned it off was a jury question.
	
	
	Even though it was not necessary to the Crown case against the applicant that the jury be satisfied on balance that the co-applicant had driven him from George Street following the murders, there was ample evidence to enable them to do so and I am myself satisfied on balance, on the whole of the evidence, that such was the case.
	
	
	As was appreciated by the parties, the most important piece of evidence against the applicant was the scarf found wrapped underneath Albert Fisoli’s arm. The photographs of the BP service station in which most people were in shirt sleeves or light clothing and which clearly showed Albert Frisoli so dressed and not wearing a scarf, were powerful evidence that he was still dressed in the same way when he entered his home and was murdered, i.e. he was not wearing a scarf. Inferentially, therefore, the scarf came from the murderer. An available inference is that the scarf was part of the disguise used by the murderer. The scarf presented a major problem for the applicant given the DNA findings by Ms Friedman.
	
	
	There was no challenge to the findings of Ms Friedman insofar as the scarf was concerned. There were strong indicia connecting the scarf to both the applicant and co-applicant. To the suggestion that the DNA could have been placed there by an intermediary, Ms Friedman said that while she could not rule it out, the chances were less, given the number of areas and the amount of DNA recovered. Ms Friedman conceded that DNA could persist on an item for months or years under certain conditions, but the conditions to which she referred were never explored in evidence.
	
	
	The hypothesis put forward on behalf of the applicant was that the scarf was owned by Albert Frisoli and had been worn by him at the time he was murdered. The explanation for the presence of both the applicant’s DNA and that of the co-applicant was that they may have come in contact with the scarf at the office some four to seven years previously when the scarf was placed with other items of clothing and had been moved from time to time by the co-applicant when she was cleaning those premises. Both the applicant and co-applicant gave evidence that they had seen the scarf at the office and that it had been handled in that way.
	
	
	As to whether they accepted that evidence by the applicant and co-applicant was a matter quintessentially for the jury. There was another dimension to the evidence, however, given the large quantities of the co-applicant’s DNA on the scarf. A real issue was before the jury as to whether this hypothesis was reasonable or as I believe, borders on the incredible.
	
	
	The effect of Ms Friedman’s evidence was that in two areas, 1 and 10, the major contributor to the DNA was the co-applicant. In four areas, 2, 3, 4 and 11, she made a minor contribution. In three areas, 6, 7 and 9, the applicant was a minor contributor. I find this to be persuasive evidence that the scarf belonged to the co-applicant, rather than belonging to someone else, and which she only used from time to time and had given to the applicant.
	
	
	I agree with the applicant that some of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown are weak and can be ignored. The presence of the applicant’s DNA on the axe handle goes nowhere. Similarly, the evidence of Ms Tilly as to the presence of a mulberry/red coloured sports car in Goodsir Street before the killing is also problematic. The same, however, cannot be said about the other circumstances relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	I have already referred to the evidence connecting the co-applicant to driving the applicant from the murder scene and to the scarf. In addition, there was a clear and obvious motive. The enmity between the applicant and Albert was of long standing and had involved some violence. The applicant believed he had been wronged and matters had been brought to a head with the dismissal of the criminal proceedings and probable abandonment of the civil proceedings some 10 days before. The observation of a vehicle belonging to the applicant’s son on the weekend before the murders would appear to be more than coincidence. The combination of the vehicle’s unusual colour and the letters BAZ satisfy me that this was Robert’s vehicle. Even though it is not known who was driving the vehicle, it seems apparent that Goodsir Street was under observation if not by the applicant by someone having a connection to him.
	
	
	There is the applicant’s hurried departure from Australia and the passing of a note to the co-applicant during the trial. It may be true that the applicant told people that he still had cancer because it saved him the trouble of going into more detail about the pain he was suffering. Whether that was a truthful explanation, however, was a matter for the jury. Certainly, nothing was identified as having occurred in either late April or early May 2009 which indicated that the pain from the effects of his cancer was any worse at that time than it had been during the preceding four years. There was no proper explanation to explain his precipitate departure from Australia. The strong inference is, as the Crown submitted, that it was directly connected to the murders. The sudden settling of his business affairs supports that and also that he was intending to stay in Italy for some time.
	
	
	The evidence of the applicant’s wife at trial is significantly undermined by what she told Detective Doueihi when he attended her residence on 14 July 2009 with a search warrant. At that time she said that she was home all day but could not confirm the applicant’s movements. It was a matter for the jury as to which version they accepted.
	
	
	Having read and examined all of the evidence, I have concluded that the Crown case against the applicant was strong and that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the two murders. I have no doubt myself that such is the case. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	


THE PINTABONA APPEAL

Ground 1: His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the applicant’s statements to the police on 17 June 2009 and 20 July 2009.


	
	Evidence on this issue was taken on 22 – 24 April 2013 and his Honour delivered judgment allowing the admission of the evidence on 24 April 2013. The basis for the co-applicant’s objection was s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In raising this ground, the co-applicant accepted that the principles in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 applied. The co-applicant submitted that his Honour had mistaken the facts, did not take into account relevant considerations and his decision was unreasonable and plainly unjust.
	
	
	Section 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 relevantly provides:
	


“281(1)   This section applies to an admission:

(a)    that was made by an accused person who, at the time when the

admission was made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and

(b)    that was made in the course of official questioning, and

(c)    that relates to an indictable offence, other than an indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person.

(2)    Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless:

(a)    there is available to the court:

(i)    a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or

…”


	
	It was common ground that no such recording had been made of what the co-applicant said on those occasions. The issue before his Honour was whether in terms of s 281(1)(a) at the time when the statements were made Ms Pintabona “was or could reasonably have been suspected” by the police of having committed an offence. Although there was an issue as to whether the statements made by the co-applicant were “admissions”, the matter proceeded on the basis that they were.
	
	
	The factual background was briefly set out as follows by his Honour:
	


“On 17 June 2009 Detectives Hollows and Ogilvy attended at Ms

Pintabona's residence. They sought entry. This was refused on the alleged

ground that the premises were too messy. They asked Ms Pintabona to make

a statement; she said she would but wanted to talk to her solicitor first.

Detective Hollows then said to her, ""Do you mind if I ask you some questions

now and I will record them in my notebook as we go."" Ms Pintabona said,

""That's fine."" And the conversation recorded in the notebook then occurred.

Ms Pintabona was asked to sign the notebook after the conversation finished

and did so.

On 17 July 2009 police conducted a search of Ms Pintabona’s apartment pursuant to a warrant and a number of items were seized. On 20 July 2009 Detectives Bradley and O’Brien spoke to Ms Pintabona at her place of work. Again, she was asked to participate in a formal interview or make a formal statement and again she declined, except in the presence of her solicitor. Detectives Bradley and O’Brien continued to converse with Ms Pintabona. In the course of that conversation she made a number of statements.

The Crown wishes to adduce in evidence the conversation of 17 June 2009 as recorded in Detective Hollows’ notebook and of Ms Pintabona’s remarks made to Detectives Bradley and O’Brien on 20 July. On neither of the occasions were the conversations tape recorded, nor has the Crown suggested that there was a reasonable excuse why a tape recording could not have been made. On neither occasion did the police give Ms Pintabona a formal caution or recite to her the terms of the jurat, invariably to be found at the beginning of formal statements taken by the police.”


	
	At trial no attention was paid to what was said on 20 July 2009. There was, however, a focus on what the co-applicant said to police when she was alone at her apartment two days after her return from Italy on 17 June 2009. Notes of that conversation were recorded by Detective Hollows in his official notebook. Relevantly, his statement read as follows:
	


“At 7.15am on Wednesday 17 June 2009 Detective Sean Ogilvy and I attended unit xxxxxx Fairlight Avenue, Fairfield, being the residence of Josephine Pintabona. At this location I pressed the unit xx doorbell at the front of the building, which was answered by a female voice. I said “Hi, I’m after Josephine Pintabona”, the female said “Yes, that’s me”. I said “My name is Robert Hollows, I am from the police. I just want to speak to you about a matter can you let me in please?” The female voice said “Yes” and she buzzed me in.

Detective Ogilvy and I entered the building and walked up a couple of flights of stairs and approached Unit xx. I knocked on the door before it was opened by a female who identified herself as Josephine Pintabona.

At this point in time Detective Ogilvy was standing next to me and I said “Josephine my name is Detective Robert Hollows and this is Detective Sean Ogilvy from the police. We would like to talk to you about the death of Mario and Albert Frisoli. Can we come in and have a chat?” Pintabona said “No, my house is too messy at the moment”. I said “Okay that’s fine”.

What I propose to do is obtain a statement from you regarding your relationship with Giuseppe Dicianni and why you travelled overseas with him”. Pintabona said “I will give you a statement but I will have to speak with my solicitor first to see if it’s all right to do that”. I said “Yes that’s fine. Do you mind if I ask you some questions now and I will record them in my notebook as we go”. Pintabona said “Yes, that’s fine”.

I said “The murder happened on 6 May 2009, do you know what you were doing that day?” Pintabona said “Yes I remember”.

As a result of my conversation with Pintabona I commenced to make some contemporaneous notes in my official police notebook and recorded most of what Pintabona was saying. The notes are as follows:

“7.15am 7.6.2009 location xx Fairlight Avenue, Fairfield re: Josephine Pintabona stated Giuseppe came past her place in the morning at Fairfield by himself. He wasn’t well when he came, dropped off some food, some green vegetables, grows them from his garden. He didn’t stay long at all, about 10 to 15 minutes. It was between 8 to 8.30am left before 9am. I have known him for about 10 years. He was too sick that day and he went home.

Then about 6.30pm I went past his house in Endensor Park by myself and he brought some sauce he made for me in the car. I did not go down to his house. I then left. I came back from Italy on last Monday night 8pm with Thai Airways. He was very sick over there. Has prostate cancer I think. I live by myself and if you want a statement I am happy to supply one but I have to speak with my solicitor Vince Macri. I will get back to you.

I work part time at Bossley Park Deli. I remember that it was a Wednesday morning and he came over and dropped off the greens. In any case, I keep a diary and when I get permission from my solicitor I will bring it with me when I give the statement. On Wednesday, it was the week before, I left to Italy on 12.5.2009. It was a Tuesday.”

“How do you known Giuseppe Dicianni?” Pintabona said “He’s just a friend and I have known him for about ten years. I was his support person when I went to Italy with him on 12 May 2009’.”


	
	The co-applicant challenged the following findings by the trial judge at pp 3.5-6.3 of his judgment:
	


“In cross-examination they were challenged on that evidence and taken through a variety of events which had occurred during the course of the police investigation prior to the conversations with which I am presently concerned. They adhered to their position.

It was submitted that Detective Hollows, in particular, was evasive in his responses. That is not my impression though I would add that even if he was, that does not, of itself, convert his denial into a positive.

It is also, I think, appropriate in any consideration of the evidence that the police gave to recognise the, in some respects, fine but significant distinction between suspicion on the one hand and a request on the other.

Counsel for Ms Pintabona referred me to a number of previous decisions of judges including R v JG (No 2) [2009] NSWSC 105 and R v Frangulis [2006] NSWCCA 363 but there being no issue as to the relevant operation of the terms of s 281, I do not think I need canvas those decisions.

Benefit is, however, to be obtained by having regard to remarks made by Justice Kitto in Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Reece (1966) 115 CLR p 266, quoted in George v Rocket (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 115:

“A suspicion that something exists is more than a mere idle wondering whether it exists or not. It is a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust amounting to a “slight opinion but without sufficient evidence” as Chambers Dictionary express it. Consequently, a reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence.”

Lest it be thought I have overlooked the fact I should expressly acknowledge a recognition that s 281 differs from some earlier similar sections in its use of the term “could reasonably have been suspected”.

Returning to the evidence before me I am satisfied that at the relevant time that the police involved in the investigation, I include all who gave evidence, not merely the four police officers who spoke to Ms Pintabona, did not suspect Ms Pintabona of having committed an offence.

The next question which arises is whether, whatever the police subjective views may have been, Ms Pintabona ""could reasonably have been suspected"" of having committed an offence.

Mr Dicianni was undoubtedly, at the times with which I am concerned, suspected of having been involved in the murders. Ms Pintabona was, as I have said, a close friend. She also accompanied him to Italy a few days after the murders, though as I have indicated, a month or so later she returned.

Of themselves the matters to which I have just referred would clearly raise a question whether Ms Pintabona was involved. There was evidence which would justify the conclusion that the principal offender was at least driven from the scene by a second person, though Ms Pintabona was by no means the only person who could have fulfilled that accessorial role.

However, the mere raising of a possibility that Ms Pintabona, as Mr Dicianni's girlfriend, or another person such as his son, is not, as Justice Kitto pointed out, the same as suspicion.

Emphasis was placed on Ms Pintabona's failure to cooperate with police requests in a number of respects. She did not respond to a card having been left for her asking her to call police. She went overseas with Mr Dicianni and, as the police believed at the time, though I understand mistakenly, she may have paid for his fare.

That said, such inferences adverse to her, as might have been raised by her leaving Australia, at least to a significant degree, were logically weakened by her return. She refused the police admission to her premises. She would not consent to a formal interview or statement until after she had spoken to her solicitor. However, in any consideration of what inferences should be drawn from her conduct, one must bear in mind her relationship with Mr Dicianni. There are many people who, faced with a possible conflict between police and someone with whom they are very friendly, take the view that they will not take the side of the police, adversely to their friend or relative.

I have referred to what I think are the more salient, or more important matters on which counsel have relied, but I am conscious that a number of others were canvassed, particularly during the course of cross-examination. In my view, when regard is had to all of the matters upon which counsel for Ms Pintabona has, - the conclusion should not be drawn that at the relevant time Ms Pintabona could reasonably have been suspected of having committed an offence. Accordingly, on the material canvassed in this voir dire application, I see no basis for excluding the evidence the subject of the action.”

Co-applicant’s submissions


	
	The co-applicant submitted that his Honour erred in his the assessment of the facts and did not refer to the evidence of Detectives Ogilvy, Bradley and Furia. She submitted that this evidence supported the proposition that the investigating police suspected that she had available to her information regarding the murders. She submitted that any failure to volunteer such information would have constituted the charge of concealing a serious offence at the very least.
	
	
	The co-applicant submitted that the objective grounds for suspicion relating to the offences of being an accessory after the fact and/or concealing a serious offence were as follows:
	



	
	She was one of the principal suspects and she was considered to be his girlfriend and supporter.
	
	
	Within two days of the applicant being spoken to by police and questioned as to whether he was involved in the murders, he and she made arrangements on 11 May 2009 to leave the country on 12 May 2009.
	
	
	By a note left at her apartment, the police requested that she contact them but she did not do so. She was confronted by the police at the airport with the applicant when leaving for Italy.
	
	
	The applicant made it clear in her presence that he understood that the police suspected he was responsible for the murders. She sought to maintain the trip was made at such short notice because of the co-accused’s health and when questioned as to why she had not contacted the police, she asserted that she would do so on her return.
	
	
	The police believed as of 15 – 17 June 2009 that she had paid for the applicant’s sudden trip to Italy.
	
	
	An immigration alert was put on her movements and an intelligence report with respect to her was commenced.
	
	
	She did not contact the police upon her return.
	
	
	The police were directed to interview her, not just about the co-accused’s movements on 6 May 2009, but also her movements that day and her association with the co-accused.
	
	
	It was directed that she should be investigated and all her known associates and family members interviewed.
	
	
	When spoken to by the police on 17 June 2009 she said she did not want them to come inside because the unit was too messy. Detective Hollows made the assumption that she had something to hide.
	
	
	When told that Detective Hollows proposed to take a statement from her, she said “I will give you a statement but I’ll have to speak to my solicitor first to see if it’s all right to do that”.
	



	
	The co-applicant submitted that it was clear in the course of this investigation that suspects were being spoken to by police without recording devices being used as required by s 281, e.g. the evidence of Detective Furia regarding the conversation with the applicant on 10 May 2009 and the evidence of Detective Doueihi regarding the conversation with her at the airport on 18 January 2010.
	
	
	The co-applicant submitted that Detective Hollows was evasive regarding the affidavit in support of the search warrant dated 16 July 2009. She submitted that the contents thereof further demonstrated the escalating suspicions which he and the other investigating officers had regarding her involvement, at least after the offence.
	


Consideration


	
	In order to assess the co-applicant’s submissions, it is necessary to summarise the evidence given on the voir dire. Detective Hollows started with the task force investigating the murders on 1 June 2009. On 17 June 2009 he was tasked by Detective Doueihi to locate and interview Josephine Pintabona and obtain an account of her and Dicianni’s movements on 6 May 2009. On 17 June 2009 he attended at her apartment with Detective Ogilvy and events occurred as set out above at [218] – [219] above.
	
	
	He said that as of 17 June 2009 he believed Pintabona to be a witness. He was aware that Pintabona had left Sydney with Dicianni on 12 May 2009 and had returned a few days before 17 June 2009. He regarded her as a witness that might be able to assist in their inquiries. He was not aware of any information or intelligence that could have elevated her position from a witness to that of a suspect. It was too early in the investigation.
	
	
	He was not sure if he knew all the details relating to the telephone calls between Pintabona and Dicianni, as outlined in his affidavit of 16 July 2009, when he spoke to Pintabona on 17 June 2009. On 17 June 2009 he believed her when she said that she had seen Dicianni outside his house at 6.30pm on 6 May 2009. He knew when he was typing his affidavit on 16 July 2009, but not when speaking to Pintabona, that the account she gave on 17 June that she had seen Dicianni at 6.30pm on 7 May, was contradictory to the phone records but he did not realise that she was providing an alibi for Dicianni. He could not recall if he thought she was lying when he created his affidavit on 16 July 2009 – she may have got her times wrong. When preparing his affidavit, his thinking was that items of clothing worn in the offence may be stored in her unit unknown to her. He did not consider when he was typing his affidavit that it was possible that Pintabona was knowingly hiding items. It was his experience that boyfriends stored items involved in the commission of offences in girlfriends’ homes without their knowing of their existence or fabricated a story to keep the items there. He said that if he thought she was a suspect, he would have administered a caution or jurat.
	
	
	Sean Ogilvy gave evidence that he was involved in the investigation from its outset and was the Exhibits Officer at the crime scene. He was also involved in the execution of a search warrant at Pintabona’s home on 17 July 2009. He was tasked with Detective Hollows to speak with Pintabona and attended her home at Fairfield on 17 June 2009, as has been set out. At the time he considered her to be a person of interest, but not a suspect. He was not aware of any information that police had that could have implicated her in either of the murders. At that time, however, Dicianni was considered to be a suspect.
	
	
	He knew and it was not a concern, that she had gone overseas with Dicianni shortly after the murders, as it was well known that she was his support person. The police kept an open mind. There was a possibility that she assisted him to leave after he was involved in the murders. His knowledge of the times of death were such that when they spoke to her on 17 June, he appreciated that she was potentially providing an alibi to Dicianni and that it was a possibility that she may have been untruthful in that regard.
	
	
	Detective Furia gave evidence. He spoke to Dicianni and his son on Saturday 10 May 2009 and each denied that they had any involvement in the murders. He spoke to them again at the airport, together with Pintabona, shortly before they left for Italy. He said that from the outset Dicianni was a suspect. When first spoken to, Dicianni said he was home sick and when he attended the police station, he gave a ‘no comment’ interview after the caution. Detective Furia agreed that his initial conversation with Dicianni was not electronically recorded and that in hindsight it should have been.
	
	
	When he learned that Dicianni and Pintabona were preparing to travel overseas together, he was of the belief that Dicianni wanted to take their relationship overseas and leave everything behind. He saw her as the applicant’s girlfriend. When he learned that she had paid for the tickets, it prompted him to speak to her but she did not answer the door or call him after he left his card asking her to do so. His suspicions in relation to Dicianni heightened when he learned that he was leaving Australia so he went and spoke to him at the airport. There Pintabona told him that Dicianni was a sick man and was going for cancer treatment. He did not suspect that she was covering for him as a ruse but simply saw her as Dicianni’s girlfriend. At that stage he knew that Dicianni had had cancer a number of years before and had no medical records to prove otherwise. His belief was that Dicianni may be using his health as a ruse.
	
	
	He had a suspicion that Pintabona understood that Dicianni was a suspect in relation to the deaths of the Frisoli brothers since Dicianni had challenged him to prove the allegations in front of her at the airport. That line of inquiry had to wait until they returned. He left the investigation on 1 June 2009 and handed over the investigation to Detective Doueihi. He suspected that Pintabona may have information in relation to Dicianni’s involvement in the Frisolis’ deaths and that he told that to Detective Doueihi.
	
	
	Detective Doueihi became the officer in charge (OIC) of the investigation after 1 June 2009. He was responsible for allocating various tasks to the investigators. He had been told that Pintabona was Dicianni’s girlfriend and he tasked his investigators with carrying out some background checks on her and to obtain some information from her in relation to her association with him and about their movements on 6 May 2009. As of that date, he had no evidence, information or intelligence indicating that she was a suspect in the murders.
	
	
	Police became aware of her intended return from Italy from records of the Department of Immigration. There was no pressing need to speak to her at the airport and no attempt was made to do so. There was no information that would suggest that she was involved in the murders. He regarded her as purely an associate of Dicianni who was the suspect at the time. The police did wish to speak to her and obtain a version from her as to her association with him and whether she could provide any information as to his movements on 6 May. On or about 17 June 2009 he learned that Detectives Hollows and Ogilvy had spoken to her.
	
	
	One of the tasks he allocated was that a search be organised of Pintabona’s residence and that occurred on 17 July 2009. The task stated “suspect that she is in possession of documentation and possible clothing in regard to Giuseppe Dicianni”. As at the date of that search as the OIC, he had no suspicions that she was involved in any way in the murders. The search warrant was purely to locate clothing and items belonging to Dicianni. She did become a suspect after Detective Bradley obtained a statement from Tony Aloisi on 23 July 2009. That statement raised the issue that her vehicle may have been involved in either driving the applicant to or from the murder scene.
	
	
	He said that the task allocated to the detectives on 17 June 2009 was not to obtain a statement on the doorstep of her home. It was to arrange to obtain a statement from her. When the record was made of the conversation, it was not intended that this would be used against her. He said that statements were not obtained from suspects. At that stage he was interested in her movements on 6 May and tasked that she be spoken to as she was closely associated with Dicianni as his girlfriend. The further inquiries and background checks were a matter of being thorough.
	
	
	Detective Doueihi appreciated that she had facilitated their departure to Italy. He said that such things were quite common and happened all the time. When a person committed a crime his de facto or wife or partner was often oblivious to what has happened. When he learned that she had paid for the trip at short notice, it crossed his mind that she might have been involved “but I didn’t put too much weight on it at all”.
	
	
	As Pintabona appreciated, for her to succeed on this ground she needed to demonstrate something more than that the decision of the trial judge was arguably wrong. She had to establish that his Honour made an error of legal principle and/or a material error of fact, took into account an irrelevant consideration, failed to take into account or give sufficient weight to a relevant consideration or arrived at a result so unreasonable or unjust as to bespeak error.
	
	
	The relevant test is not in doubt. In R v Taouk [2005] NSWCCA 155; 154 A Crim R 69 Hall J (with whom James and Hislop JJ agreed) said:
	


“158   The “trigger” for the application of the protections afforded by s 281 is the moment when a police officer to whom a confession or admission has been made, suspected or could reasonably have suspected the appellant to have committed an offence. Accordingly the legislation excludes from protection confessional statements made before that level of suspicion is reached.”

Hall J went on to say:

“160    It is also necessary to identify the subject matter of suspicion. The basis of the suspicion referred to in s 281(1)(a) is the state of mind of an investigating official. That state of mind is more than mere surmise. … it is one arrived at on the basis of material that is capable of supporting the formation of an opinion, even if only a slight opinion, that the person in question (the accused) could have committed an offence. …

161    In summary, the suspicion must be one which could reasonably have been held by an investigating officer at the relevant point in time, namely, the time when the admission was made. Whether the suspicion satisfies the specified requirement as to reasonableness, is to be determined by the existence of grounds for the suspicion, which grounds must be based on or sourced in facts that do or tend to implicate the accused in possible criminal conduct of the relevant kind, an indictable offence, and that therefore are capable of giving rise to or supporting the requisite state of mind. It follows that a mere possibility that a person referred to in s 281(1)(a) could have committed an offence is insufficient.”


	
	In essence, what has to be shown is some reasonable factual basis for the suspicion. In this case, each officer who was a party to the conversation and those who had tasked them to attend at the co-applicant’s premises gave evidence that they did not suspect her of having committed an offence. There was nothing irrational or objectively unbelievable in that evidence. His Honour was entitled to accept it as true.
	
	
	Moreover, the evidence was that the co-applicant became a suspect after the statement was obtained from Mr Aloisi on 23 July 2009 which suggested she may have driven her vehicle to the murder scene with the applicant. As of that date, as far as Detective Doueihi was concerned and despite the fact that the information was unverified, the position of the co-applicant had been elevated to that of a suspect. The distinction between his state of knowledge at that time and the state of knowledge of police as of 17 June 2009 is clear.
	
	
	The effect of the submissions made to the trial judge and in the appeal is that the factual basis for the suspicion with respect to the co-applicant arose because she was the girlfriend of a suspect. Absent other evidence, that could never be sufficient. There must be something pertaining to that individual to form the factual basis for the relevant suspicion. As of 17 June 2009 nothing had occurred which could provide a basis for the police to reasonably suspect that the co-applicant had committed an offence. The indicia and the evidence show that she was being treated as a witness as at 17 June and 20 July 2009. At no time was she the subject of police detention nor was she required to attend the police station to make a statement.
	
	
	While his Honour did not analyse the evidence in detail, he was not required to do so. His summary of the effect of the evidence was accurate and he applied legal principle in accordance with the authorities. The co-applicant has failed to demonstrate that his Honour acted upon a wrong principle in the House v R sense, or otherwise fell into error. His Honour did not err in admitting the evidence. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2: The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

Co-applicant’s submissions


	
	It was fundamental to the co-applicant’s submissions in support of this ground that for her to be convicted of the accessorial offences, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she drove the applicant from the murder scene on the evening of 6 May 2009. This was contrasted with what had to be proved in the Crown case against the applicant. There, the co-applicant accepted that the standard of proof in relation to whether or not she drove him from the murder scene, was on the balance of probabilities. The basis for this proposition seems to be that the only way the Crown could prove her knowledge that the applicant had committed the murders was if she had driven him from the scene.
	
	
	She relied upon the same submissions which had been put in the applicant’s appeal to the effect that she could not have driven him from the murder scene – i.e. insufficient time for the journey, the weakness in the connection between the murder and her car and the other evidence, including her own, as to what she was doing on that day. Implicit in her case on appeal was that even if (which was not conceded) it was open to the jury to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she had so driven the applicant, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that matter.
	


Consideration


	
	I do not agree that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the co-applicant drove the applicant from the murder scene. It was sufficient that they be satisfied on the balance of probabilities. My reasoning is as follows.
	
	
	Although this Court is not bound by remarks or observations made by a trial judge when sentencing (SKA v The Queen, Crennan J at [110] – [115], with whom the plurality agreed) I find the analysis of RS Hulme AJ at [19] and [22] of the sentence judgment to be persuasive. I agree with his Honour that the finding of the jury of the accessory offence is more likely to have been that on 17 June 2009 the co-applicant informed Detectives Hollows and Ogilvy that on 6 May 2009 at 6.30pm the applicant was at his house in Edensor Park and at the time of providing that information, she was aware that he had murdered the deceased. For the reasons set out by the trial judge, the evidence did not establish that at the time she drove the applicant from the murder scene, she knew that he had committed the murders.
	
	
	When one has regard to the elements of the offence of accessory to murder which have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, on the facts of this case they do not include that the co-applicant drove the applicant from the scene of the murders. The only element of the offence to which that finding was relevant was her state of knowledge at the time she sought to mislead the police and give the applicant an alibi on 17 June 2009. The fact that she drove him from the murder scene, but did not at that time realise that he had committed the murders, was a circumstance to be taken into account with other circumstances, to establish beyond reasonable doubt the element of knowledge on 17 June 2009. Those other circumstances include her knowledge that he no longer had cancer, his precipitate departure for Italy when he realised he was a suspect, his settling of his affairs before so departing and that she was not telling the truth when she said he was at home at 6.30pm on 6 May 2009. By reference to that latter circumstance, it must follow from the jury verdicts that they rejected both the evidence of the applicant and co-applicant as to what happened on 6 May 2009. It was the total effect of those circumstances which allowed the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that as of 17 June 2009 when she spoke to the police, the co-applicant was aware that the applicant had committed the murders.
	
	
	In carrying out that analysis, I am mindful that the trial judge in his summing up (SU p 11) told the jury that the two things that the co-applicant was asserted to have done (driving him away and lying to the police on 17 June) were to be seen cumulatively because of the way the Crown put the case. That is confirmed when one looks at the way in which the Crown addressed the jury (T.1277.43 – 1278.3, 1299.39, 1307.2 and 1316.41 - .46). The effect of the address and the trial judge’s summing up is that what was put to the jury (at least implicitly, if not expressly) was that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on both issues, i.e. the driving him away and lying to the police on 17 June, before the co-applicant could be convicted. All that means is that the Crown was imposing on itself a requirement to prove beyond reasonable doubt something which as a matter of law, was not necessary. It is clear from their verdict that the jury was satisfied of those matters to the higher standard.
	
	
	For those reasons and the reasons set out in relation to the application for leave to appeal by the applicant, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the co-applicant deliberately sought to mislead the police on 17 June 2009 so as to provide the applicant with an alibi and that she was aware that he had committed the murders at that time.
	
	
	Should I be incorrect in my finding that it was only necessary for the jury to decide whether the co-applicant drove the applicant from the scene of the murders on the balance of probabilities, and that this circumstance needed to be established beyond reasonable doubt, I am so satisfied.
	
	
	As already indicated, implicit in the jury verdicts was their rejection of the evidence of the applicant and co-applicant, at least as to the events of 6 May 2009 and in the case of the co-applicant, the spillage of blood from meat in her car. The assessment of that evidence was very much a jury question in which the jury had the considerable advantage of both seeing and hearing the applicant and co-applicant which this Court did not have.
	
	
	Apart from that advantage, the evidence of the applicant and co-applicant was objectively improbable. The suggestion that the DNA of Albert Frisoli could have been found on the trim on the passenger side of the co-applicant’s vehicle as a result of him leaning against it some time before 2006 was not only fanciful, it was established to be false. The evidence of the Roads and Traffic Authority was that the co-applicant acquired her vehicle in July 2007, well after she had ceased attending the offices of the partnership. The evidence as to the ownership of the scarf and what may have happened to it at those offices in the years 2002 – 2006 while not being capable of specific disproof, was highly unlikely and verged on the fanciful insofar as it sought to explain the high level of the co-applicant’s DNA on it.
	
	
	It follows that I have concluded that not only was it open to the jury to substantially reject the evidence of the applicant and co-applicant because of their position of advantage, but there were other factors which pointed strongly to such an outcome.
	
	
	Once the explanations put forward by the applicant and co-applicant are taken out of the equation, the circumstantial evidence linking the co-applicant to the departure of the murderer from the scene of the murders becomes compelling and in that regard it was open to the jury to find such a connection beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out and should be dismissed.
	
	
	I have read the judgment of Davies J in the applications for leave to appeal against sentence. I agree with his Honour’s conclusions and the orders which he proposes.
	


Proposed Orders


	
	In the application by Giuseppe Dicianni for leave to appeal against conviction, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.
	
	
	In the application by Giuseppe Dicianni for leave to appeal against sentence, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.
	
	
	In the application by Josephine Pintabona for leave to appeal against conviction, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.
	
	
	In the application by Josephine Pintabona for leave to appeal against sentence, leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on 13 September 2013 is quashed and in lieu thereof Ms Pintabona is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	(a)   For the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mario Frisoli sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing 13 March 2013 and expiring 12 March 2015 with an additional term of 12 months expiring 12 March 2016;
	
	
	(b)   For the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Albert Frisoli sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing 13 June 2013 and expiring 12 June 2015 with an additional term of 12 months expiring 12 June 2016.
	
	
	(c)   Direct that the co-applicant be released to parole forthwith.
	



	
	PRICE J: I have read the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL. Having made my own independent assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied that the applicant and co-applicant were rightly convicted.
	
	
	However, I find myself in respectful disagreement with the Chief Judge’s assessment of the standard of proof required in the case of the co-applicant, to establish that she drove the applicant from the scene of the murders. The Chief Judge is of the opinion that the Crown was not obliged to prove that the co-applicant did so beyond reasonable doubt (see [249] above).
	
	
	At trial and in this Court, the Crown accepted that the prosecution was obliged to prove this matter of fact beyond reasonable doubt. The reason for the Crown’s acceptance of the high criminal onus, was that the co-applicant’s driving of the applicant from the scene was the sole evidence upon which the Crown relied to prove that she was aware of all the essential facts and circumstances that gave rise to the murders. As the trial judge told the jury (SU 11):
	


“The only evidence in the case relied on by the Crown as showing relevant knowledge on the part of [the co-applicant] is the evidence that she picked [the applicant] up in George Street after the murders.”


	
	In my opinion, this was an intermediate fact which constituted an indispensable link in the jury’s chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt: Shepherd v R [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579 (Dawson J). The jury could not be satisfied that the co-applicant had the relevant knowledge unless they found beyond reasonable doubt that she drove the applicant from the scene.
	
	
	In any event, the Chief Judge is satisfied, as am I, that it was open on the evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the co-applicant did so (see [251] above).
	
	
	In the conviction appeals, I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge.
	
	
	I have also read the judgment of Davies J in the applications for leave to appeal against sentence. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders proposed.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I have read the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders his Honour proposes. Since, however, the appeals against conviction rely on the ground that the verdicts in each case were unreasonable I wish to add a few remarks of my own.
	


Conviction Appeals

(a)   Appeal by Dicianni


	
	The Crown’s case was a circumstantial one. It is necessary in those circumstances to consider the whole of the evidence even if particular weaknesses can be identified in some of the circumstances relied upon: Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573at 579-580; R v Hillier at [48].   
	
	
	A matter emphasised at the hearing of the appeal was whether the co-applicant drove the applicant from the scene on the night of 6 May 2009 and, in her appeal, the standard to which that fact had to be proved. Senior Counsel accepted that, in the applicant’s case, that fact had only to be proved on the balance of probabilities but he submitted that the jury could not have been satisfied even to that standard. For reasons that will appear when I come to deal with the appeal of the co-applicant I am entirely satisfied that it was open to the jury to have been satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In any event, there are a number of other compelling circumstances that meant that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the murders charged. The matters that pointed strongly towards such a conclusion are the prior relationship between the applicant and Albert Frisoli including the aborted criminal and civil proceedings brought against Albert, the scarf found at the scene containing DNA of the applicant, the flight and false basis stated for it and the note passed by the applicant to the co-applicant in Court shortly before the DNA expert was to give evidence.
	


(b)   Appeal by Pintabona


	
	The central matter argued in relation to this appeal was whether proof of the co-applicant’s driving the applicant from the murder scene had to be established beyond reasonable doubt or simply on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	As Hoeben CJ at CL has pointed out the only relevant element of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder was the co-applicant’s state of knowledge at 17 June 2009 when she misled the police. She might have acquired that knowledge from driving him away from the scene but that was not the necessary source of her knowledge. Inferences were available that she acquired her knowledge independently of her driving him from the scene. Certainly, her involvement in his travelling to Italy the week after the killings and the false reasons she gave to the police at the airport provided such a basis.
	
	
	The written directions given to the jury provided two alternative bases for a finding that the co-applicant was an accessory. The second of those did not require the jury to accept that she had driven the applicant from the scene. The Crown’s closing address did not make clear whether its case was that her knowledge by the time of the false alibi on 17 June 2009 was derived from her driving the applicant from the scene. However, the Crown’s address did not suggest that the jury could conclude that her knowledge by 17 June was obtained otherwise. That, no doubt, led the trial judge to tell the jury that the two matters were to be seen cumulatively.
	
	
	Hoeben CJ at CL has said at [249] that the Crown unnecessarily imposed on itself a requirement to prove the driving away from the scene beyond reasonable doubt. Price J has held at [259]-[261] that such proof was necessary. In my respectful opinion, by reason of the way the Crown put the matter to the jury and as it was clarified by the trial judge in his summing-up, the driving from the scene became (as Price J has said) an indispensable link in the chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. The jury, therefore, had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the co-applicant drove the applicant from the scene even if the Crown had placed the bar too high.
	
	
	My own assessment of the evidence satisfies me that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the co-applicant drove the applicant from the scene. The circumstances relevant to that conclusion are the blood and DNA in her car, the evidence of Ms Baker, the evidence of her phone being switched off all day, her evidence of making an appointment to have her nails done that day with the evidence from the employees at the nail salon, and Mrs Dicianni’s statement to the police that she could not account for husband’s movements on 6 May 2009.
	


Leave to appeal against sentence

Dicianni appeal


	
	The applicant was sentenced for the murder of Mario Frisoli to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 years commencing 18 August 2010 and expiring 17 August 2030 with an additional term of 4 years expiring 17 August 2034. For the murder of Albert Frisoli he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 years commencing 18 August 2020 and expiring 17 August 2040 with an additional term of 4 years expiring 18 August 2044: R v Dicianni and Pintabona [2013] NSWSC 1328.
	
	
	The sole ground of appeal is that the sentences imposed were excessive. In the written submissions filed for the applicant that was said to be based on two matters, namely:
	


(i)   The level of accumulation was excessive; and

(ii)   His Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances and impose a    longer than usual parole period.


	
	The applicant accepted that the fact that there were two murders required a significant level of accumulation. However, they occurred in the one course of criminal conduct and were closely connected in time and circumstances. There was only one entry to one house. In those circumstances an accumulation by 10 years of the second to the first was excessive and the overall result of 30 years was excessive when totality was considered.
	
	
	Further, it was submitted that while s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) did not require that the non-parole period for each of the aggregate sentences, in the absence of special circumstances, amount to three quarters of the overall sentence, the overall non-parole period should have been at least no more than three quarters of the overall term.
	
	
	It was submitted that there should have been a finding of special circumstances on the basis that it was the applicant’s first time in custody, because of the applicant’s age and ill-health and because there was a significant level of accumulation between the two offences. It was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to provide reasons why he did not find special circumstances and why he applied a higher non-parole period than the usual ratio.
	
	
	In relation to these matters Hulme AJ made the following observations in his Remarks on Sentence:
	


[38]   Having regard to the age Mr Dicianni will be when he is released from prison, three of the purposes of punishment, viz. personal deterrence, protection of the community and probably rehabilitation do not have anything like the same weight they have in the case of most murders. …

[39]   One argument that was advanced on Mr Dicianni's behalf was that the sentence otherwise appropriate should be reduced on account of his age. It was submitted that the sentence should be limited so that there remained the prospect that he would be released from custody prior to his death. I do not find the argument as so advanced persuasive. While I accept that there are cases where such an approach has been taken and the prospect of dying in custody is calculated to increase the weight of a sentence, an offender who suffers that fate does not have the continuing disadvantage that someone who emerges after a very lengthy sentence does. The ramifications of such a sentence, e.g. its impact on the prospects of, or relationship with, a family, or on the likelihood of a person suffering it obtaining the capital to acquire a home or valuable or satisfying employment, continue long after release from custody.

[40]   I of course accept that it would be proper to take into account any particular circumstances that lead to the view that Mr Dicianni's sentence would weigh more heavily upon him than is usually the case and this principle clearly invites attention to his age. However, one really has no idea whether he will become a frail old man or, at the other extreme, die relatively young and suddenly from a heart attack or stroke. In the result I see no occasion, on account of the matters referred to in this or the immediately preceding paragraph, to reduce Mr Dicianni's sentence from that otherwise appropriate.

…

[50]   Given the remarks I have made concerning Mr Dicianni, and notwithstanding the total non-parole period to be imposed, it is appropriate to reduce the balance of term of the second sentence he must serve. The balance of term of the first sentence is somewhat academic and as a matter of convenience I propose to reduce that too. These matters provide no grounds for reducing the non-parole period of either sentence.


	
	Earlier in his remarks at [6] and [27] Hulme AJ made reference to the applicant developing cancer. However, the evidence at the trial was that the applicant’s cancer was cured although he had some residual problems.
	
	
	It is significant that the applicant put nothing before, and said nothing to, the Sentencing Judge about his health. Nor was any submission made about a finding of special circumstances. In fact, all that was said to the Sentencing Judge about the applicant’s subjective matters and the issue of accumulation was this:
	


BODOR: However your Honour structures it, whether the sentences are concurrent or whether there's an element of cumulation (sic), in my submission, your Honour would recognise that whilst these are heinous crimes, there ought to be for a man who is now approaching elderly and will no doubt not be released before he is an old man, there ought to be some element of hope that he may walk one day outside the walls of prison.

I say that because it is the purpose of incarceration to punish, first of all, but also to rehabilitate and send a message out to the community that rehabilitation is also part of the punishment process.

HIS HONOUR: That becomes hard and difficult with someone who is approaching old age, if I can put it that way.

BODOR: I appreciate that.

HIS HONOUR: One can pick an age at which one can say almost any sentence is going to be a life sentence.

BODOR: I appreciate that but balanced against that is the fact Mr Dicianni (sic) will certainly, if he lives that long, will be serving 20 plus years in any event so he is going to be an old man. Obviously there is no issue of protection of the community to be considered in this case. The only focus of any criminality, from a practical point of view, is Mr Albert Frisoli.

That is one of the features that would militate against a life sentence. I recognise that anybody over 50 who commits a murder or multiple murders is

facing the prospect of dying in gaol. That is unarguable. But it should, in my submission, it is not necessary it be inevitable and the fact that there is some flicker of light remaining does augur for a productive period in gaol and for some hope. I can't put it any higher than that. It would be facile for me to put it any higher.

I don't wish to insult the court but, notwithstanding his convictions, he is a member of this community and he is entitled to the same sentencing considerations as any member of the community, I don't put it any higher than that, for the crimes he has committed. I don't think I can say anything more. Unless there is something that exercises your Honour's concern.


	
	It is difficult to see how there can be said to be error by the Sentencing Judge’s failing to take matters into account when no submissions about those matters were made. This Court has made clear in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [75] to [81] that, ordinarily, if a matter has not been put to the Sentencing Judge, this Court will be unlikely to find error by reason of the matter not being referred to in the remarks on sentence unless some serious injustice can be shown from the failure to raise the matter in the court below.
	
	
	No such injustice is shown in the present case. It is apparent from his Honour’s remarks that he considered both the applicant’s age and health. The discussion about the applicant’s age and what appears at [50] of the remarks demonstrate that his Honour was, in substance, considering the matter of special circumstances. A reduction in the balance of the term necessarily involves a consideration of whether there are special circumstances because it would be inappropriate to reduce the balance of term if special circumstances existed.
	
	
	As the applicant acknowledged by his reference to R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38, questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. The principles are set out by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 and reproduced in XX at [52].
	
	
	No error of the House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 type is demonstrated in the Sentencing Judge’s consideration of the issues of accumulation and totality. His Honour considered that both murders were marginally above the mid-range of objective seriousness, they both occurred in the victims’ homes, they were frenzied and prolonged attacks and Mario was killed simply to facilitate or at least remove an impediment to the killing of Albert Frisoli. It is not suggested that any of these considerations were not appropriate nor that there was anything else about the killings that his Honour failed to take into account. There is nothing inherently unreasonable or unjust in an accumulation period of ten years in the circumstances of these murders.
	


Pintabona appeal


	
	The Sentencing Judge sentenced the co-applicant as an accessory after the fact to murder of Mario Frisoli to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing 13 March 2013 with a further term of 9 months, and as an accessory to the murder of Albert Frisoli to a term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 13 March 2014 with an additional term of 1 year. She is eligible for parole on 12 March 2016.
	
	
	The sole ground of appeal is that the sentences imposed were excessive.
	
	
	The co-applicant submitted that a sentence of 3 years for each of the offences was excessive as was the overall sentence comprising a non-parole period of 3 years with an additional term of 1 year. She submitted that Hulme AJ d",2015-07-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767367,Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 1137,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	This is an application brought pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the AFP). Only proposed orders 1 and 2, contained in the summons dated 7 July 2015, are pressed today. In a short judgment that I delivered earlier in the proceedings, I explained why I considered it appropriate that I proceed ex parte.
	
	
	In a nutshell, the application is that approximately $77,000.00 held at a financial institution be restrained, and given into the custody of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy for safekeeping, and so that it can earn interest until the substantive application for forfeiture in proposed order 3 is resolved.
	
	
	The application is brought under s 19 of the Act, and is supported by an affidavit of Robyn Mclean of 6 July 2015.
	
	
	To state things succinctly, the position of the AFP is that a number of trading accounts were “hacked” and used without the knowledge or intention of their owners. A large number of stockmarket trades were undertaken in very cheap stocks, with the result that those stocks rose in value by way of the inherent effect of that number of purchases. Thereafter, the shares were promptly sold at a profit.
	
	
	It is said that, by way of a process of following things through electronically, the account sought to be restrained contains the proceeds of that criminal activity; or, at the least, it is the instrument of an offence pursuant to s 400.9 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (which may be very roughly equated with the well-known State offence of having “goods in custody”).
	
	
	Working through s 19 and the definitions contained in the Act, it can be seen that the Supreme Court is a court with proceeds jurisdiction: see s 335(2).
	
	
	It can also be seen that (subject to an exception to which I shall come in a moment), I must make the orders sought if a number of matters are established.
	
	
	First, if a proceeds of crime authority applies for the order: see s 19(1)(c). The AFP is defined as such an authority: see s 338.
	
	
	Secondly, if I consider that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the contents of the account is the proceeds of (amongst other things) an indictable offence: see s 19(1)(d). There is no doubt that the offence alleged against the Cybercrime Act 2001 (Cth) and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) may be prosecuted on indictment.
	
	
	Thirdly, if there is an affidavit from an authorised officer stating that he or she suspects that the property is the proceeds of the offence in question, and including the grounds upon which that suspicion is held: see s 19(1)(e). There is no doubt that the affidavit of Ms Mclean complies with all of those preconditions.
	
	
	Fourthly, I must be satisfied that Ms Mclean herself holds the suspicion on reasonable grounds: see s 19(1)(f).
	
	
	To my mind, all of those preconditions are amply demonstrated. In particular, based upon the affidavit of Ms Mclean in its entirety, including various annexures, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the contents of the account are the proceeds of an indictable offence.
	
	
	Finally, there is no basis upon which I would be satisfied that the mandatory order should not be made, in light of the public interest: see s 19(3).
	
	
	In short, I am satisfied that all of the essential preconditions of s 19 of the Act are made out.
	
	
	As well as that, I consider that the ancillary order that is proposed order 2 makes sound good sense.
	
	
	An alternative submission founded upon the contents of the account being an instrument of a serious offence does not require further analysis, in the circumstances as found by me.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 19 of the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) the property specified in schedule 1 of the order must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in these proceedings.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 38 of the Act the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy is to take custody and control of the property specified in schedule 1 to this order.
	
	
	The matter is listed for directions on 12 February 2016.
	
	
	These orders are to be entered forthwith.

2767373,Williamson v Carneys Lawyers [2015] NSWSC 1080,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Hugh Williamson, the plaintiff, seeks damages against the first and third defendants for alleged negligence and breach of retainer, as well as for breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (now repealed) (in respect of the first defendant, Carneys Lawyers (Carneys)) and the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) (in respect of the third defendant, Mr Meakes). The plaintiff also sought relief against Rabobank Australia Limited (Rabobank), the second defendant, but this aspect of the proceedings has been resolved. Accordingly, a reference in these reasons to “the defendants” is a reference to Carneys and Mr Meakes.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim is based on the allegation that Mr Meakes failed to advise him to make his own inquiries relating to activities on land in the vicinity of a rural property known as Reevesdale which he purchased in July 2007. The plaintiff contended that, had he known that a quarry development was proposed on the property next to Reevesdale, he would not have purchased it. He claims damages on the basis of the loss of value of Reevesdale (which was eventually sold in May 2013 for $805,000); the loss of value of his terrace in Paddington (which he alleges he would have sold in 2007 at a higher price but for the defendants’ negligence) and various consequential losses.
	
	
	The defendants defended the proceedings on various bases, including: that Mr Meakes did in fact advise the plaintiff to make his own inquiries about the surrounding properties; that the vendor’s real estate agent, Les Hannan, had already told him about the residents’ protest against the proposed quarry development; and that, even if such inquiries had been made, the plaintiff would still have purchased Reevesdale. The defendants also contested the calculation of damages and relied on the principle in Potts v Miller (1940) 64 CLR 282.
	


The Facts


	
	The plaintiff was a solicitor who practised principally in commercial law and litigation, both in partnership and on his own account, since he commenced his articles in the United Kingdom in 1983. He continued to practise after migrating to Australia in 1990. In 1994 the plaintiff engaged Stephen Fitzsimons as his personal accountant. Mr Fitzsimons has acted in that role ever since.
	
	
	In 2001, the plaintiff was instructed by Michael Thomson to bring proceedings for damages for unfair dismissal, against his former employer, Societe Generale (the Thomson matter). The matter continued for several years and occupied a substantial part of the plaintiff’s professional practice as a solicitor.
	
	
	On 10 January 2005 CEAL Ltd (CEAL), trading as Multiquip Quarries, lodged a development application for the construction of a quarry (the quarry development) at Ardmore Park, Bungonia, near Goulburn. Ardmore Park was adjacent to Reevesdale. On 2 August 2005 the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning refused the development application in respect of the quarry development. On 29 March 2006 CEAL appealed against the refusal.
	
	
	On 24 March 2006 judgment was delivered in the Thomson matter. The result was adverse to Mr Thomson, who instructed the plaintiff to file an appeal on his behalf to a full bench of the Industrial Relations Court. As the appeal resulted in a delay in the conclusion of the matter, the plaintiff and Mr Thomson negotiated a new basis for the plaintiff’s professional fees for acting on the matter.
	
	
	To that end, in May 2006, the plaintiff drafted a deed (without obtaining legal advice himself), which he and Mr Thomson executed on 24 May 2006, which provided for the payment of professional fees. In the deed, Mr Thomson acknowledged that he owed the plaintiff $2.475m, including GST, for fees from August 2001 to March 2006; agreed to pay the plaintiff $40,000 on account of costs by 2 July 2006; and agreed to pay a percentage of the net balance (a sliding scale, commencing at 27.5% and increasing to 32.5% for amounts over $2m) of any judgment or settlement sum obtained by Mr Thomson as a result of the proceedings.
	
	
	I understood the plaintiff to admit in his evidence in the present proceedings that he knew that the deed was unenforceable by reason of the prohibition in the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) (now repealed) against lawyers charging fees by reference to a portion of the amount recovered. He said that he believed that he would be entitled to make a quantum meruit claim against Mr Thomson for the legal work he had performed for him and sought to justify his entry into the deed by saying that Mr Thomson insisted that he would only be paid on those terms. I do not accept the plaintiff’s explanation.
	
	
	At some time prior to August 2006, Reevesdale was offered for sale by Elders Real Estate and was passed in at auction. Mr Hannan, who commenced employment at Elders Real Estate in Goulburn in August 2006, inspected the property and subsequently became the real estate agent for the vendor.
	
	
	Mr Hannan’s opinion was that Reevesdale was proving difficult to sell at a price acceptable to the vendor because the price was too high; the buildings on the property were Georgian and required costly upkeep; local residents preferred newer improvements; and its area was only 250 acres which was substantially less than was required to conduct a commercially self-sustaining farming business. Mr Hannan considered that the property might appeal to wealthy person as a weekender, but would be unlikely to appeal to a farmer. These matters led Elders Real Estate to enter into a joint agreement to market Reevesdale with Cassim Real Estate in Woollahra, Sydney.
	
	
	From time to time, in his role as the vendor’s agent, Mr Hannan travelled to Reevesdale along the Mountain Ash Road from Goulburn via Bungonia. He noticed that there were various placards tied to fences and trees near Bungonia on which was handwriting of a sufficient size to be legible from the road. The placards contained various messages, including “STOP THE QUARRY”; ‘NO QUARRY”; and “NO TRUCKS THROUGH BUNGONIA”.
	
	
	In 2007 the plaintiff was having financial difficulties. His principal lender, the National Australia Bank Ltd (the NAB), refused to increase his indebtedness beyond $1m. His sole security property was a terrace in Cascade Street, Paddington, where he lived with his wife and family. The fees he believed he was owed from the Thomson matter were disputed and were not, in any event, payable until the conclusion of the matter. He had an urgent need for cash and no apparent way of remedying the situation unless he could obtain further cash by refinancing his debt.
	
	
	In March 2007 the plaintiff saw an advertisement for Reevesdale in the Sydney Morning Herald. He contacted Michael Cassim, from Cassim Real Estate. Bill Bridges, another agent at Cassim Real Estate, rang Mr Hannan and asked him to call the plaintiff to arrange an inspection of Reevesdale.
	
	
	The plaintiff ascertained that Reevesdale had been passed in at auction for $2.2m in 2006. He believed that if he could acquire Reevesdale for $1.8m, he would have immediate equity of some hundreds of thousands of dollars, against which he could increase his borrowings. Moreover, he believed that he could transfer all of the debt, with which his Paddington terrace was charged, to Reevesdale, and thereby convert all interest payments into tax deductible expenses.
	
	
	The plaintiff accepted in cross-examination that Reevesdale was a “trophy property” in that it was aesthetically pleasing and had an historic Georgian house located on it, where the plaintiff intended to spend time with his family on weekends and on vacation.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s plan was, accordingly, to safeguard his financial future by substantially increasing his borrowings on a property, the income from which would be significantly less than the interest cost of the debt. Although it might be thought that the plaintiff could have sold his Paddington terrace to increase the availability of cash, he was reluctant to take this course, at least in part because it was where he lived with his new wife and young children (at least one of whom attended a school within walking distance) and also because he believed that there was significant development potential associated with the terrace which he wanted to be in a position to realise in due course.
	
	
	On 3 May 2007, the hearing of CEAL’s appeal against the Council’s refusal of the development application in respect of the quarry development began. Jagot J heard the appeal on 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 and 16 May 2007. At the conclusion of the hearing her Honour reserved her decision.
	
	
	Also during May 2007 the plaintiff arranged to inspect Reevesdale with Mr Hannan. The plaintiff and his wife drove from her parents’ property in Hay to Goulburn and then took the Mountain Ash Road to Bungonia Village where they parked the Porsche in which they had made the journey and got into Mr Hannan’s car (which was more suitable for the unsealed road that lay ahead) in which they were driven to Reevesdale. En route, the plaintiff saw placards posted on the side of the road which referred to a quarry. He asked Mr Hannan about them. Mr Hannan told him that he did not know much about it but that he would find out and get back to him.
	
	
	As soon as the plaintiff saw Reevesdale he “fell in love with it” and wanted to make it his own. The plaintiff asked Mr Hannan about the property, including its carrying capacity.
	
	
	After the visit, Mr Hannan visited a residence on Mountain Ash Road from which one of the placards was displayed. He was told by the owner that the placards had been erected in protest against a proposed quarry on Oallen Ford Road which would bring about a substantial increase in traffic on local roads, cause structural damage to local heritage buildings and result in nuisance associated with dust and noise. He also told Mr Hannan that there were legal proceedings in the Land and Environment Court over the development application.
	
	
	Mr Hannan rang the plaintiff and relayed the substance of the conversation. When Mr Hannan mentioned the Land and Environment Court, the plaintiff told him that he knew where it was and that he would make some enquiries.
	
	
	For reasons given below where I address the credibility of witnesses and the Jones v Dunkel inference (named after the eponymous case, (1959) 101 CLR 298), I accept Mr Hannan’s evidence (and reject the plaintiff’s denials) that there were placards on the side of the road; that they had a conversation to this effect; and that Mr Hannan reported to him the results of his inquiry about the significance of the placards.
	
	
	In late May 2007, after he had visited Reevesdale, the plaintiff applied to Rabobank for finance. Because the plaintiff’s plan was tax-driven, he was anxious to complete the sale before 30 June 2007. Chris Twyford, a rural manager at Rabobank, sent the plaintiff a letter dated 24 May 2007 to which indicative terms for a loan of $2.75m (being $1.8m for Reevesdale and $950,000 to refinance the Paddington facility) were attached.
	
	
	The plaintiff responded to Mr Twyford by email dated of 28 May 2007 in which he said, in part:
	


“I certainly wish to proceed and your indicative offer was gratefully received and helps with the negotiation.

Assuming I do go ahead (which looks highly likely) I will move my business to Rabo from NAB.

. . .

You will be interested to know that 8 months ago the property, Reevesdale, was passed in with a highest bid of $2.5m. You can confirm that with Les Hannan at Elders in Goulburn. The vendor has since regretted his bullish expectations but has retained price expectations at $1.9m . . . .

As soon as there is a price agreement on Reevesdale and I have a valuation on Paddington I will let you know. Obviously I will need to move very quickly after that.”


	
	On 31 May 2007 the plaintiff filled in a loan application with Rabobank in which he sought a total amount of $3.025m. In an email sent on the same day to Mr Twyford, he described Reevesdale as a “marvellous bargain” at $1.65m. In the email the plaintiff identified two sources of income which he expected to enhance his cash flow over the next two years: first, his claim against Mr Debney, a former partner; and second, the costs associated with the Thomson matter referred to above.
	
	
	The plaintiff reported to Mr Twyford in his email of 31 May 2007 the following with respect to the Thomson matter:
	


“We won the case but the Judge wrote a judgment with a dreadful flaw and gave them in effect what they were seeking by depressing the amount of revenues.

…

The judgment has been appealed. There is no doubt that the appeal will be successful because of the black and white nature of the matter and the fact that the judge was clearly wrong . . .

The appeal is to be heard by the full bench of the Industrial Relations Court of New South Wales on 14 and 15 November 2007. Since there is no appeal from a decision of that Full Bench the litigation will be finished.

I have a right to be paid after that. I will attach to a confidential fax extracts from the deed under which I am to be paid. They are edited to maintain confidentiality.

The appeal result will increase the current judgment amount of $2.5m to c. $6.5m (incl interest) + costs in the region of $1.5m.

That will mean that I receive under clause 5.1 $400,000, under clause 5.2c $325k and under clause 5.2d $1.14m.

Under clause 5.3 I will in addition receive that part of the half of costs which takes us to the ceiling of $2.4m.

In addition I have to date done work under clause 12.1 to the value of $350,000. I cannot collect that either until the end of the appeal.”


	
	In support of his assertion that he had a claim against Mr Thomson for a substantial sum for costs, the plaintiff forwarded, under cover of letter to Rabobank dated 1 June 2007, a copy of the deed dated 24 May 2006 (referred to above) pursuant to which the monies were said to be owing. The letter said:
	


“As mentioned in my email yesterday I attach a copy of the Deed with some deletions for the purposes of maintaining confidentiality.”


	
	In about early June 2007, at about the time the plaintiff had decided to purchase Reevesdale, he encountered Wally Meakes. Mr Meakes was also a solicitor. He had practised continuously since his admission on 12 February 1982. He and the plaintiff had become acquainted through their membership of the Tattersall’s Club in Sydney where their paths crossed from time to time on the club premises and environs.
	
	
	Once the plaintiff had confirmed Mr Meakes to be experienced in rural conveyancing, he asked him to do the conveyancing for his purchase of Reevesdale. On 4 June 2007 Mr Meakes received the sales advice notice from Mr Cassim. The sales advice notice recorded that the price at which Reevesdale was to be transferred was $1.675m. Mr Cassim sent Mr Meakes a copy of the sale contract.
	
	
	Later that day, 4 June 2007, the plaintiff sent an email to Mr Twyford and Mr Fitzsimons which was copied to Mr Meakes, in which he said in part:
	


“I thought I should let you know, the vendor has accepted my offer of $1.65m. He does not want to talk about farm equipment or furniture. He is not happy because as Billy Bridges said at about 11.45am today when conveying the acceptance, I am “stealing” this place.

I am fully confident that by month 6 or 9 at the outside I will see myself clear because of pending litigation results and an entitlement to very significant payment in litigation. Assuming full payment under the deed, I will receive $2.4m plus a further significant sum which has been incurred in relation to the appeal and assisting in the interference/ deceit action.

. . . .

The built in benefit at Reevesdale is that it is being bought cheaply. It is also a highly unusual historic property.

. . .

Although I appreciate that you will calculate my capacity to borrow on the securities differently (eg 85% on Cascade Street x $2.3m = $1.96m + 72.5% on Reevesdale @ $1.65m = $1.2m) I ask that the Reevesdale loan is set at 100% so that it is as tax effective as possible. Obviously that depends on both securities remaining in place.

On the above figures I can borrow $3.6m at those ratios.

. . .

I trust this undertaking will enable speedy consideration and approval as it would be a very great shame to miss out on this historic (and productive property) and time is now very much of the essence.

I have told the selling agent that I will sign a contract very shortly, assuming Rabo approval, but I will need to have that approval first.

Chris, could you get back to me as soon as possible as everything is in suspense until you do so and we are working on tight timetables.

You will also see that I have ccd this email to Wally Meakes, a property law specialist solicitor - with agricultural conveyancing expertise in addition.

If I run out of time before I depart for the UK (21 June) I will leave a power of attorney with Steve [Fitzsimons].

. . .”


	
	On 7 June 2007 the plaintiff sent an email to the real estate agent which was copied to Rabobank, his accountant and Mr Meakes in which he said in part:
	


“. . .

I hope this will be very quick – it needs to be – as this transaction is, of course, tax driven – apart from anything else.

. . .

Obviously Wally [Meakes] will need to move very quickly and the sooner Rabo gives the go ahead, the sooner we can all go into overdrive.

I am determined that this transaction goes ahead. I appreciate the work you have done in that regard. On this side of the fence, we intend that it will not falter.

. . .”


	
	Mr Meakes opened a file on 12 June 2007. When he received a copy of the draft contract, he reviewed it, together with the planning certificate dated 7 October 2005, and the information memorandum relating to the property. As he was going through these documents he made a file note of the matters which he wished to raise with the plaintiff including the following:
	


“We are awaiting the formal Contract from the Vendor’s solicitors in Goulburn.”


	
	He also noted in his file note:
	


17.   Schedule “E” sets out Notices to Purchasers of rural lands in the area and needs to be looked at carefully.


	
	I infer that this note was a reference to the following in Schedule E:
	


“3.   Intending purchasers are advised that legitimate rural and agricultural uses of land may include:

[list of activities including “extractive industries, mines and ancillary works”]

. . .

4.   Intending purchasers of rural land who consider they may have difficulty in living with the above practices being carried out on adjacent land should seriously consider their position with respect to purchasing in a rural area. Many rural and agricultural practices, by necessity, are carried out very early in the morning or late into the evening.”


	
	At about this time Mr Meakes delegated various matters relating to the Reevesdale transaction to Nina Spinelli, a paralegal who was working under his supervision.
	
	
	On 12 June 2007 Mr Meakes met with the plaintiff and went through the contract with him. Although the plaintiff was principally a commercial litigator and not a conveyancer, he appreciated, in 2007, the significance of exchange and completion. He also knew, that, generally, although not invariably, exchange preceded completion by a number of weeks to permit searches and inquiries to be made. He was also aware that, typically, a contract for sale of land included a certificate under s 149 of the Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) which set out information from government sources as to the zoning of the subject property and the particular uses to which it could be put.
	
	
	I accept Mr Meakes’ version of what occurred in the course of that conference on 12 June 2007. The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he needed to settle by the end of June and that he had spoken with his accountant about prepaying interest with a view to making the transaction “tax effective”. He boasted that he was buying Reevesdale at “an extremely good price”. He acknowledged that the income from the property would not be sufficient to service the loan but announced, “that’s the point”. Mr Meakes asked him whether he had made inquiries about the local area and whether he had spoken with the neighbours, the Council and those in the local area to find out what was happening. Mr Meakes advised the plaintiff that such inquiries ought be made because they could affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of Reevesdale. The plaintiff assured him that he had done his “due diligence” already.
	
	
	When the plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he would be going to the United Kingdom in late June, Mr Meakes asked him if he had sorted out the power of attorney with his accountant. The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he wanted to appoint him as his attorney. Mr Meakes expressed reservations about that course but told him that he could take a power of attorney for emergency situations.
	
	
	Mr Meakes then sat beside the plaintiff and went through the draft contract with him. He raised the time period between exchange and completion with the plaintiff and suggested that the only practical way of ensuring completion by 30 June 2007 was to have exchange coincide with completion. The plaintiff agreed to this proposal.
	
	
	Mr Meakes drew the plaintiff’s attention to the fact that Reevesdale was subject to a mortgage granted by the vendor to Elders Rural Bank Ltd which would need to be discharged on settlement.
	
	
	Mr Meakes also took the plaintiff through the planning certificate and noted that Schedule E, cl 3 set out the legitimate uses of the land, which included extractive industries and mining. I am satisfied that he also drew the plaintiff’s attention to the note to intending purchasers of rural land in Schedule 3 which is set out above.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff was untroubled by what he had learned from Mr Hannan about the possibility of a quarry being developed in the area near Reevesdale and indifferent to the warnings Mr Meakes gave him about the possibility of the permitted uses on neighbouring land. His desire to buy Reevesdale was quixotic: he was enchanted with the idea of living in a Georgian house on a rural property and attracted to the advantage of being able to claim all his interest, and much of his expenditure, as a tax deduction.
	
	
	Moreover the plaintiff enjoyed the sense that he had got the better of the vendor and had bought a property that he believed was worth $2.5m for only $1.675m. Indeed, when asked in cross-examination whether it was a “lifestyle property”, he responded that he would “categorise it as an undervalue acquisition”. Thus, he believed that he had, merely by purchasing a loss-making property that no one else seemed to want, made a profit of hundreds of thousands of dollars and thereby gained much needed equity which would permit him to increase his borrowings. His view was evident from the following exchange in cross-examination:
	


Q.  You understood that to be a property which was a lovely property to live in and to be in, and something you'd be proud to own and show off, but which was not ever going to pay its own way?

A.  Well in the sense of income, no, but in the sense of capital it already did the job.  It would ‑ it managed to cancel my worries about the immediate future.


	
	Whether the plaintiff’s infatuation with Reevesdale led him to refrain from reading the contract; whether he read it carefully or whether he merely skimmed it because it was largely in a standard form cannot be determined because the plaintiff’s evidence on the topic was not consistent (see below). I am satisfied that Mr Meakes sufficiently explained its salient features, and in particular the risks posed by the uses to which neighbouring properties could be put, and the need to make his own inquiries.
	
	
	Mr Meakes arranged for David Gal, a solicitor employed by Carneys, to prepare a general power of attorney, which the plaintiff executed, appointing Mr Meakes as his attorney.
	
	
	At some time after his conference on 12 June 2007, Mr Meakes received an updated planning certificate dated 17 January 2007 and reviewed it. It was not materially different from the one he had gone through with the plaintiff on 12 June 2007.
	
	
	On 14 June 2007 Mr Meakes received a counterpart contract for sale of Reevesdale from the vendor’s solicitors under cover of letter dated 13 June 2007. As at 19 June 2007 Mr Meakes understood that the plaintiff wanted to complete the purchase on 28 June 2007. He wrote a letter to that effect to the NAB, as outgoing mortgagee of the Paddington terrace.
	
	
	On 19 June 2007, Jagot J dismissed the developer’s appeal against the refusal of the development application in respect of the quarry development: CEAL Ltd v Minister for Planning [2007] NSWLEC 302. There is no evidence that either the plaintiff or Mr Meakes was aware at that time that the decision had been handed down or the result of the appeal.
	
	
	On about 21 June 2007 the plaintiff travelled to the United Kingdom with his wife, Lucinda to introduce her to his family and friends. He did not return until 14 July 2007. At times he was out of email and telephone contact while he was away. His solicitor, accountant and banker attempted, unsuccessfully on occasions, to communicate with him. His whereabouts while away included the “wilds of Lincolnshire”. He was also a spectator at Wimbledon.
	
	
	On 26 June 2007 Mr Fitzsimons rang Mr Meakes to suggest an alternative to a guarantee from the plaintiff’s company (which was required by Rabobank as a condition of the loan) and proposed that Mr Meakes could execute the guarantee on behalf of the company as the attorney for its sole director. Mr Meakes voiced his discomfort with the proposal and told Mr Fitzsimons that he would need to get instructions from the plaintiff. Mr Meakes attempted, without success, to contact the plaintiff by phone. He sent him an email at 8.43pm in which he expressed his concern that the matter could not settle by the end of the week (being Friday 29 June 2007) and listed the various reasons. There were difficulties with email reception to the plaintiff’s email address. On more than one occasion, Mr Meakes received a delivery status notification to say that there had been a delay in delivery.
	
	
	On 27 June 2007, Mr Twyford emailed the plaintiff and noted that he had not received a response to his email of 26 June 2007. The plaintiff, who was attending Wimbledon as a spectator at that time, did not respond.
	
	
	Eventually, the plaintiff sent an email on 28 June 2007 in which he instructed Mr Meakes to execute a guarantee on behalf of the plaintiff’s company to meet Rabobank’s requirements. He gave his father’s email address as an alternative means of communicating with him, as well as the phone number of a friend with whom he planned to stay. He also said:
	


“I’m having kittens here so can someone let me know where we are at!!!”


	
	On 28 June 2007 the plaintiff rang Ms Spinelli from the United Kingdom. They spoke about the execution of various finance documents. The plaintiff told Ms Spinelli that Mr Fitzsimons could sign the documents as a duly authorised officer. He instructed Ms Spinelli to speak with Mr Fitzsimons and return the letter of offer to Rabobank. At the end of the conversation he said:
	


“I want to settle today or tomorrow.”


	
	After this conversation Ms Spinelli spoke to Mr Fitzsimons, Mr Twyford and the vendor’s solicitors. She then sent an email to the plaintiff in part in the following terms:
	


“After speaking with Steve we decided that he should take steps to have himself appointed as an alternate director of Williams Solicitors so he can sign the Guarantee and the Letter of Offer as the Bank confirmed this morning that it could not accept the Letter of Offer as it was not signed by all parties to the transaction.

I also spoke with the Bank’s solicitors to try and have other requirements waived. Even though they were willing to accept signed documents tomorrow morning and waive some of their usual requirements, the problem is that there is no one here to sign the mortgage documents on your behalf today or tomorrow and they cannot settle without original signed mortgage documents. Accordingly, settlement cannot proceed today or tomorrow for this reason. I have confirmed this with Steve this morning.

I now need your instructions as to a new settlement date. I have had a call from the Vendor’s solicitors wanting to know the current position. If you could contact me by return email or phone me with instructions, I need to get back to the Vendor’s solicitor as quickly as possible.”

[Emphasis in the original.]


	
	On 28 June 2007 the NAB confirmed the payout figure of $995,635.12 if settlement occurred on that day and $995,846.93 if it took place on the following day. Rabobank confirmed that it could not settle until the letter of offer could be signed by all parties to the transaction.
	
	
	Early on Monday morning, 2 July 2007, the plaintiff telephoned Mr Meakes who was on his way to work. Mr Meakes expressed his concern about the difficulties in communicating with the plaintiff, who assured him that he had found another way to obtain the tax break he was seeking but that he still wanted to purchase Reevesdale. Mr Meakes explained to the plaintiff the difficulties associated with his executing the guarantee on behalf of the company, as he did not have a power of attorney from the company. The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he would try to be more available in future.
	
	
	By letter dated 11 July 2007, the solicitors for Rabobank wrote to Mr Meakes confirming the loan amount of $3.025m for the following purposes:
	



	
		
			
			Purpose
			
			
			Amount
			
		
		
			
			Purchase of Reevesdale
			
			
			$1.65
			
		
		
			
			Refinance NAB loans
			
			
			$1m
			
		
		
			
			Fund working capital
			
			
			$375,000
			
		
	



	
	The plaintiff returned to Australia from the United Kingdom on Saturday 14 July 2007. On Monday 16 July 2007 he attended the offices of Carneys. Mr Meakes took him through the transaction documents. Mr Meakes also raised with the plaintiff the circumstance that Reevesdale was subject to an exploration licence by a gold company. The plaintiff responded:
	


“Lots of rural land in New South Wales is affected by exploration licences, and nothing happens. I’m very comfortable with proceeding to settlement. I think this is a great deal and I’m keen to get it done.”


	
	The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he knew that Reevesdale had been on the market for a long time at a higher price; that he was worried about the delay; and that he did not want to miss out on getting the property. At the conclusion of the conference, the plaintiff, in the presence of Ms Spinelli, executed the transaction documents.
	
	
	On 19 July 2007 the vendor’s solicitors faxed a letter to Mr Meakes and said:
	


“We regret to advise that our client is in the circumstances not prepared to delay settlement any further.

We formally advise you that this matter will now not proceed.”


	
	On 20 July 2007 the plaintiff rang Ms Spinelli and told her that Mr Bridges had called him and told him that there were other purchasers who were interested in Reevesdale and who had offered $100,000 more. At that stage it was the plaintiff’s expectation that settlement would occur on 23 July 2007. Later that day the plaintiff rang Ms Spinelli again and told her that he would not increase his offer and that Mr Hannan was looking to see if something else was available. He told her, among other things:
	


“I need to find another property. There is one with more land near Lake Bathurst with 1,000 acres and it’s a nice farmstead. There’s also one by the lake with 650 acres but it doesn’t have historic buildings.”

“I want to go ahead with this one though.”


	
	Notwithstanding these communications, Mr Meakes telephoned the vendor’s solicitors to inform them that the transaction could be settled on Monday 23 July 2007. Contracts for the transfer of Reevesdale to the plaintiff were eventually exchanged and settled on Tuesday 24 July 2007. The purchase price was $1.675m. The Rabobank loan was secured by mortgages over the plaintiff’s terrace in Paddington and over Reevesdale. Cheques drawn on settlement included the sum of $20,137.50 to Elders Real Estate (the vendor’s co-agent) and $1,624,637.66 to Elders Rural Bank Ltd (the vendor’s mortgagee).
	
	
	In October 2007 the plaintiff came to know some of the local residents in Bungonia who told him what he had already learned from Mr Hannan in May 2007: that there had been litigation concerning the application approval for the quarry development. The plaintiff was informed by local residents that the proponents of the development still wanted to pursue the development.
	
	
	On 24 January 2008 the plaintiff wrote to Mr Twyford and purported to summarise his financial position in support of his application for a deferral of the date for repayment of $725,000 from 30 April 2008 to 30 June 2008 and an increase in borrowings from $3.025 to $3.5m. He informed Mr Twyford that the appeal in the Thomson matter would be heard on 10 March 2008 and that he would expect judgment by May 2008. He also foreshadowed an application for a 15 - 20 bedroom boutique hotel and conference centre in the coach house at Reevesdale. He summarised his position in the following sentence:
	


“You will see from the above that the current “squeeze” on my position is not one which ought to last long.”


	
	He sought to explain his relatively low work-in-progress (in his practice as a solicitor) as follows:
	


“As you know I have just got married and that took up a good deal of time so Work in Progress is not as good as it might be.”


	
	He also referred to an oral agreement whereby his neighbour in Paddington had agreed to buy his terrace for three times its market value, on the basis that it would be included in a larger development to be undertaken by his neighbour. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he understood the effect of the Statute of Frauds but considered that he could rely on the equitable doctrine of part performance as he had “done things on the property on the basis of what he [the neighbor] said”.
	
	
	The plaintiff reiterated to Mr Twyford the significance of the deed with Mr Thomson as follows:
	


“The litigation asset is encapsulated in a deed dated May 2006 between my client and myself. Basically the deed provides for payment upon the end of the litigation. The last avenue of appeal is where the matter now is. This litigation has been a drain on cashflow as it has gone from August 2001 to date and has represented perhaps 85% of my work over the period. Senior Counsel’s opinion is that we will win at the level we anticipate. That will result in an immediate entitlement to $2.4m first instance costs plus appeal costs of another $300k approximately. As stated the delay in having the appeal heard has thrown out initial calculations.”


	
	By email to Mr Twyford dated 29 February 2008, the plaintiff again sought to persuade Rabobank of his creditworthiness. He referred to the following projects:
	


I should add that since mid October I have been concentrating as well as legal work, on the job of establishing Payplan Australia P/L. I have 25% of that company. I have concluded a shareholders agreement and with the support of 5 banks it will be a success. Possibly a huge one. The large English parent (1300 employees) is bankrolling it. It is commencing ops in 1 month.

I have also commenced Abbility [sic] Australia P/L of which I have 33%. This is selling wheelchairs etc on ebay. The UK guy who has started it with me is the biggest UK seller (Arbitraging between China and the UK). It starts this Thurs.

I am also in the process of talking to 4 different insurance companies about setting up an insurance brokerage and claims agency…More of that anon.


	
	The plaintiff admitted in cross-examination that he had never received a cent from Payplan although its principal took him out for dinner “several times”. He also admitted that Ability Australia had not made any money, although he volunteered:
	


“At the time there was nothing to suppose that we wouldn't make money.”


	
	Nor had the plaintiff made any money from the proposed insurance brokerage and claims agency.
	
	
	In his tax return for the year ended 30 June 2008, the plaintiff recorded that he had suffered a taxable loss on Reevesdale of $109,000. The plaintiff accepted that he expended substantial amounts on Reevesdale between the time of its purchase and 30 June 2008, since interest costs alone did not account for the size of the figure.
	
	
	At some stage in 2008 or 2009 the plaintiff brought proceedings in this Court for specific performance of the alleged agreement with his neighbour to sell the Paddington terrace for three times its market value (referred to above). He did not obtain the relief sought.
	
	
	On 15 January 2009 Deacons, solicitors, wrote, on behalf of Mr Thomson, to Stephen Titus of Carneys informing him that any costs agreement that infringed either s 325 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 or the corresponding provision in the Legal Profession Act 1987 was not maintainable and that the deed between the plaintiff and Mr Thomson executed in May 2006 was “invalid and of no effect”.
	
	
	On 16 January 2009 the plaintiff wrote to Mr Meakes in part in the following terms:
	


“I write in connection with my purchase and the information supplied by the Goulburn Mulwaree Council or alternatively by the vendor.

Obviously I was unaware that there was proposed to be a quarry right on the boundary of Reevesdale.

. . .

What these circumstances have led to is the need for me to sell Paddington – rather than Reevesdale. It being the worst time for a property sale for many years. I will be forced to take a big loss on Paddington. That loss is approximately $1M. If I were to try to sell Reevesdale the loss is likely to be even worse.

In order to take action against the Council I need to obtain all of the relevant documents from my file. Please can you, therefore, send to me the following:

Contract for sale in the form exchanged including all of the documents appended or referred to.

All enquiries to the vendor and all responses.

All enquiries to the Goulburn Mulwaree Council and all responses.

Any other document dealing with material issues.

. . . “


	
	On 21 January 2009 the plaintiff reported on his financial situation to Mr Twyford. He informed him that he and his wife had moved out of the Paddington terrace to put it on the market and were living in rented accommodation nearby. He said of Reevesdale:
	


“Since we bought in July 2007 there has been a further application for a quarry next door. The Council did not disclose to us that the property was in a “buffer zone”. I am not sure yet whether Carneys Lawyers made the relevant enquiry. I have asked for the papers to be supplied to me. The Government is to make a decision on the quarry issue by May 2009. . . If Wally [Meakes] did not make appropriate enquiries then he has been negligent.”


	
	The plaintiff attached a copy of his letter to Mr Meakes to his letter to Mr Twyford as well as the facsimile from Deacons regarding the invalidity of the deed. The plaintiff also reported that his proposed business, Payplan Australia Pty Ltd, was going very well. I note that, although the plaintiff was prepared to inform Mr Twyford of the possibility that Mr Meakes had been negligent, he was not prepared to disclose that possibility to Mr Meakes himself and, indeed, did not do so prior to the commencement of these proceedings.
	
	
	On 18 July 2009 the plaintiff sold his Paddington terrace for $1.4m.
	
	
	On 25 August 2009 the plaintiff wrote to Richard Hincks, of Rabobank, seeking further accommodation. He purported to retain his belief, notwithstanding his knowledge of the proposed quarry development, that Reevesdale was worth significantly more than he paid for it and said:
	


“Let’s say that the farm is valued down to $2.1m (which will be temporary but in line with current conditions).”


	
	The plaintiff accepted in cross-examination that the following extract from a Rabobank internal memorandum dated 29 October 2009 accurately described his preference both then and in October 2010:
	


“His [the plaintiff’s] preference is to retain the rural property if possible and he has sold other assets during the recent real estate market downturn to rationalise his financial position.”


	
	The plaintiff suffered a brain abscess (as a result of undiagnosed diabetes) which manifested itself during the Oxfam trail walk in August 2010 and led to his collapse at the end of October 2010. He has not practised as a solicitor since.
	
	
	At some time prior to June 2011 the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning approved the development of a quarry on the land next to Reevesdale. No development has yet commenced. Notwithstanding this approval, the plaintiff’s desire to keep Reevesdale continued at least up to and including 2012 when he was obliged to sell it for financial reasons. Eventually, in May 2013, Reevesdale was sold for $805,000. The net sale proceeds were $708,451.
	
	
	On 27 May 2015 the plaintiff sent an email to Mr Couston, the solicitor for the defendants in these proceedings. After setting out why he thought he would win the case, the plaintiff wrote:
	


“Bill Bridges rang me very late in the piece to suggest that I had not offered enough. I immediately arranged to see a Lake Bathurst property with Les Hannan. I was getting quite keen on the Lake Bathurst property. But lo and behold Reevesdale came back on the table. No mention of a DA [development application] or a recently refused DA (with the process to be repeated by a determined DA applicant).”

Expert evidence on liability


	
	The plaintiff relied on the evidence of Ronald Heinrich who has been in practice as a solicitor, principally involved in conveyancing, since 9 December 1971. The defendants relied on the evidence of Edward Boyce, also an expert conveyancing solicitor, who was admitted to practice in New South Wales in February 1974. Their evidence was broadly to the same effect. They agreed that, as at 2007:
	



	
	Competent solicitors in New South Wales would have advised their clients to undertake inquiries of the Council to ascertain, relevantly, whether there were any proposed developments in the area which might adversely affect the client’s enjoyment of the property proposed to be purchased.
	
	
	Competent solicitors in New South Wales would not have conducted such inquiries themselves.
	



	
	Mr Heinrich explained that the purpose of recommending that a proposed purchaser make enquiries of the local Council was that Councils keep records of current or determined development applications in their planning departments and may also have a note or record of decisions of the Land and Environment Court that are germane to those applications. Accordingly a prospective purchaser could ascertain potential uses and development of surrounding land.
	
	
	The expert opinions were consistent with the following extract from a pro forma letter issued by the Law Society as at 15 November 2006 entitled ‘LETTER TO PURCHASER EXPLAINING CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE OF NON-STRATA RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY” which contained the following paragraph:
	


On the Planning certificate you will see that a number of uses are permitted on your property and on the adjoining properties provided Council’s approval is given pursuant to a development application. In other words, it is possible for lands with the zonings similar to yours to have erected upon them buildings other than //58a//. We recommend that prior to exchange of Contracts you call at the Council to ascertain whether there are any proposed developments in the area that might not be suitable to your particular enjoyment of the property.

[Emphasis in original.]


	
	Mr Heinrich also gave evidence of his own practice not only to advise a city buyer of a rural property to speak to the Council (as set out above) but also to speak to the neighbours.
	
	
	Mr Heinrich said that he was not aware of any accepted practice amongst rural conveyancers in New South Wales in 2007 of checking that their clients had in fact undertaken the inquiries that had been advised. He was not, however, asked as to his own practice in this regard. Mr Boyce said that if inquiries had been recommended and a solicitor was subsequently given instructions to exchange contracts, the solicitor would be entitled to proceed on the basis that the client had either satisfied himself or herself as to such inquiries, or elected not to make them. A solicitor would not be obliged to check that a client purchaser had made the enquiries the solicitor had recommended.
	


Valuation evidence


	
	Peter Reardon, a valuer, was engaged by Rabobank, on behalf of the plaintiff, to value Reevesdale as at 25 February 2008. He valued the property at $2m (comprising $900,000 for the land and $1.1m for the improvements). He also valued the property as instructed by Rabobank, for the plaintiff, as at 25 August 2009 at $1.8m (comprising $753,900 for the land and $1.05m for the improvements). He valued the property again as at 7 February 2012 and considered its market value to be $1.75m and its value on a forced sale to be $1.55m. Mr Reardon also said, in his report dated 7 February 2012:
	


“The property [Reevesdale] eventually sold in July, 2007 to the current owner [the plaintiff] for $1,675,000, which we consider to be very good buying and below current market value having consideration to a number of other sales of historical properties in the district at this time.”


	
	Mr Reardon was not required for cross-examination. His evidence was not challenged.
	


Evidence with respect to damages


	
	The plaintiff relied on the report of Mr Fitzsimons. The defendants relied on the expert evidence of Tamara Lindsay. Mr Sullivan QC, who appeared on behalf of the defendants, obtained, in his cross-examination of Mr Fitzsimons, the witness’ concessions to all of the matters raised by Ms Lindsay in her report. Accordingly, the evidence is (subject to legal submissions as to the recoverability of the damages) that the plaintiff has suffered losses, as calculated by Ms Lindsay, as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Relevant item
			
			
			Amount
			
		
		
			
			Loss on sale of Reevesdale
			
			
			$1.052m
			
		
		
			
			Loan establishment fees
			
			
			$17,729
			
		
		
			
			Operating losses of the primary production business
			
			
			$101,382
			
		
		
			
			A portion of the interest on the loan
			
			
			$1.008m
			
		
		
			
			TOTAL
			
			
			$2.179m
			
		
	


Credibility of witnesses

The plaintiff’s credibility


	
	I formed a very adverse view of the plaintiff’s credit, who was an unimpressive witness. I do not accept his evidence except where corroborated, against interest or consistent with uncontroverted or admitted facts. My reasons for this view are set out below.
	


The plaintiff’s mode of responding to questions


	
	The plaintiff appeared to be at pains to divine the forensic significance of each question asked of him before he formulated his response, which at times was not responsive to the question. The transcript is redolent with examples, of which the following exchange is one:
	


Q.  Why didn't you read the contract in full?

A.  Had Wally said to me that it was necessary for me to go and get advice from the council I would have done so.

Q.  Mr Williamson, you know that that is not an answer to my question don't you?

A.  Yes, well, it is in a way.

Q.  It is not in any way Mr Williamson, my question was in the context of the advice you give your own clients why did you not read the contract in full yourself?  That was my question.  Nothing else?

A.  Well, time.  Time.


	
	In making this assessment of the plaintiff, I have taken into account that his capacity to answer questions is likely to have been compromised in some way by the brain abscess and its consequences. However, although the plaintiff’s fluency may well have been marred, his capacity to find an answer that suited his interests at the time demonstrated that, whatever his disability, his mental processes were intact at least to that extent. Furthermore I note that the plaintiff did not rely on any medical evidence to the effect that his evidence was affected by his injury or that any of the matters referred to in this part of the reasons (dealing with the plaintiff’s credibility) ought not be regarded as adversely affecting his credit.
	


The plaintiff’s lack of recollection generally


	
	The plaintiff did not particularly recall the conference with Mr Meakes on 12 June 2007 although he accepted that it occurred. Nor did he have a good recollection of executing the documents. Although he denied being told that he ought make his own inquiries, he accepted, or did not deny, many of the propositions put to him in cross-examination by Mr Sullivan about what had occurred in the conference. He gave the strong impression that he had other things on his mind when he met with Mr Meakes and that he regarded the legal documents associated with the purchase of Reevesdale to be a necessary, but inconvenient, formality.
	


Whether the plaintiff read the contract for the purchase of Reevesdale


	
	The plaintiff was loath to admit that he had read the contract for the purchase of Reevesdale. Mr Sullivan put to him, in various ways, that he had done so. He responded variously, including as follows:
	



	
	He did not read the contract himself because he retained Mr Meakes to do it for him.
	
	
	He read some of the standard form parts of the contract but not the special conditions.
	
	
	He only read those parts of the s 149 certificate that were specifically explained to him by Mr Meakes.
	
	
	He did not read the contract because he did not have time, notwithstanding that he had time to go to the United Kingdom with his wife for a holiday of over three weeks.
	
	
	He did not take the contract with him to the United Kingdom because he did not think it was wise to interfere with the process of introducing Lucinda to his family and friends by “taking a total lot of books with me”.
	



	
	As referred to above, I am satisfied that the plaintiff, either through reading the contract himself, or being taken through it by Mr Meakes, was aware of all material conditions. The versions he gave, which are set out above, are largely irreconcilable. That he was prepared to offer such a range of versions reflected adversely on his credit.
	


The deed with respect to remuneration for the Thomson litigation


	
	The defendants also challenged the plaintiff’s credibility on the basis of the deed entered into to provide for his remuneration with respect to the Thomson litigation. The plaintiff’s preparedness, as an officer of this Court, to enter into an agreement that he appreciated was prohibited by the Legal Profession Act, did him no credit. The apparent egregiousness of his conduct was compounded by his disclosure of the deed, on a confidential basis, to Rabobank with a view to his persuading it to rely on the deed for the purposes of advancing money to him, in circumstances where he appreciated that the deed was unenforceable. His conduct in this respect was not only unscrupulous but also dishonest.
	
	
	I regard the plaintiff’s evidence that, although the deed was unenforceable, he had a claim in quantum meruit for the same, or a similar, figure as the product of forensic opportunism.
	


The proposition that, but for the purchase of Reevesdale, the plaintiff would have had to sell his Paddington terrace


	
	The defendants also sought to impugn the plaintiff’s credit on the basis of his insistence that, had he not purchased Reevesdale, he would have had to sell his terrace in Paddington. The plaintiff was adamant that the added “fat” associated with the Reevesdale purchase was what gave him additional borrowing capacity, which he needed, since he was at the limit of the facilities advanced by the NAB and did not have the income to service any increased borrowings. Although this version has some superficial plausibility, there are at least two obstacles to its acceptance.
	
	
	First, any “solution” provided by the additional borrowings from Rabobank was, at best, short-term. The loan agreement with Rabobank required the plaintiff to repay $600,000 by 30 April 2008. The loan monies were insufficient to allow for that repayment (since deductions had to be made from $3.025m of $1m (to repay the NAB) and $1.725m (for the cost of the purchase of Reevesdale including incidentals), leaving $300,000. The plaintiff admitted that, without the Rabobank funds, he was unable to meet his debts as and when they fell due. It is therefore difficult to see how the loan improved his financial position. At best, it provided no more than an ephemeral amelioration of his cash flow.
	
	
	Secondly, the Thomson deed was unenforceable and, in any event, Mr Thomson was not obliged to pay the plaintiff for his legal services until the litigation had concluded. Accordingly, there was no real prospect of any income from that quarter in the foreseeable future.
	
	
	Thirdly, the plaintiff insisted, in a different context, that he was most reluctant to sell Paddington for personal and financial reasons. He maintained that he did not want to disrupt the education of one of his children, who attended the local school. Further, he also asserted that he had an enforceable agreement to sell his terrace to his neighbour for three times its market value. He accepted, on the one hand, that he was bound by that agreement not to sell the terrace to a third party; while on the other, he maintained that he would have acted, in breach of the agreement, to sell the terrace had he not bought Reevesdale.
	


The plaintiff’s preparedness to lie about whether he was looking at other properties before he bought Reevesdale


	
	The plaintiff was cross-examined about telling Ms Spinelli that he was looking at other properties when the vendor of Reevesdale informed Mr Meakes that settlement would not proceed. He said in evidence that he had no intention of buying another property if he could not have Reevesdale but that he was “suspending the truth” for two days because he believed that Mr Bridges was not telling him the truth about the vendor’s not wanting to sell to him. He sought to justify what he admitted amounted to a lie (that he was looking at other properties) on the basis that he thought that Mr Meakes might say something to the vendor’s solicitor or to the agents. He agreed that he was prepared to lie to his own solicitor.
	
	
	He was also cross-examined about the email to Mr Couston sent on 27 May 2015 referred to above in which he said that he was getting “quite keen on the Lake Bathurst property”. He was unable to give any satisfactory explanation as to how he could reconcile his recent statement with his case that, had he not purchased Reevesdale, he would not have purchased another rural property and he would have had to sell his Paddington terrace. I reject his evidence that the words “lo and behold” in the email imported such an ironic tone into the whole of the paragraph that no part of it could possibly be taken either literally or seriously.
	


The plaintiff’s evidence about when he found out about the proposed quarry development and his response


	
	The plaintiff gave evidence that he found out about the prospect that there would be a quarry near Reevesdale when he became acquainted with local residents in October 2007, who told him that there had been litigation. He agreed that he was “annoyed” when he found out but said that he complained to no one but his wife (who was not called to give evidence) because he “didn’t think there was anything done wrongly”. I regard this evidence as irreconcilable with the plaintiff’s case.
	
	
	The plaintiff presented as acutely conscious of his legal rights and ready to blame others for bad outcomes. Had he really believed, in October 2007, that Mr Meakes had in any way failed to fulfill his duties to him as a solicitor, I have no doubt that he would not only have written to Mr Meakes but also used the putative claim for damages in correspondence with Mr Twyford, who was the recipient of forecasts of numerous money-making schemes or pots of gold to which the plaintiff asserted he would be able to resort to solve his impecuniosity. Although the plaintiff insinuated to Mr Twyford in January 2009 that there was a possibility that Mr Meakes had been negligent, he did not pursue the allegation, or even disclose it to Mr Meakes, until he filed the statement of claim in these proceedings.
	
	
	When the plaintiff was cross-examined about the proposed development of the coach house at Reevesdale to which he referred in his letter to Mr Twyford dated 24 January 2008 set out above, the following exchange occurred:
	


Q.  You will agree will you not that when describing to the bank the Reevesdale property you are talking of it in very glowing terms and in very encouraging terms about its outlook?

A.  At that stage I felt a bit of a glow.  It's difficult because I had the application and I knew that the application was, you know, foretelling the awful day would come when the rocks and sand all went past the front door.  But I thought that if we got the, you know, made Bungonia into a tourist attraction that we could ward off the possibility of a planning consent.


	
	The plaintiff’s answer manifested, in my view, not only his cavalier approach to the truth but also his forensic flexibility. He realised that plans made in 2008 to develop Reevesdale as a tourist facility were inconsistent with his case that he found out in October 2007 that a quarry development was proposed on the adjacent land and that, if he had found out earlier, he would not have purchased Reevesdale at all. Accordingly, he sought to use the development to advance a case that he was trying to make the best of a bad lot by resisting the quarry development by creating a tourist destination. Moreover the disparity between the letter and the objective facts revealed his grandiloquence. He was, at the time of the letter, on the brink of a substantial default to Rabobank and had no funds to comply with the facility, much less develop Reevesdale.
	
	
	He also gave evidence that it did not occur to him until 2012 that it was Mr Meakes’ responsibility to advise him to make enquiries of the Council. Mr Sullivan reminded the plaintiff of his letter to Mr Twyford dated 21 January 2009 (in which he made an allegation of negligence against Mr Meakes). He responded by saying that he did not even know if Mr Meakes had a duty to give that advice in 2009. The following exchange ensued:
	


Q.  Is this the situation, that you as an honourable solicitor were prepared to write to your banker accusing your own solicitor of negligence when you didn't even know whether that solicitor had a duty of care in that regard, is that a serious answer Mr Williamson?

A.  I thought that he did, but then I thought that he didn't.

The plaintiff’s preparedness to engage in conspiracy theories


	
	The plaintiff submitted that I should reject Mr Hannan’s evidence because Elders Real Estate (for whom Mr Hannan worked) was associated with Elders Rural Bank Limited (the mortgagee of the vendors of Reevesdale) and therefore had a motive to conceal from Mr Meakes the development application for the quarry. The plaintiff admitted, when challenged, that there was no evidence to suggest that there was any connection between the real estate agent and the vendor’s mortgagee. I regard the plaintiff’s submission of a conspiracy theory based on a connection between Elders Real Estate and Elders Rural Bank Limited as one borne of desperation and designed to impugn Mr Hannan’s evidence, which the plaintiff appreciated destroyed his case.
	


Jones v Dunkel inference


	
	The plaintiff’s wife was with the plaintiff when he had the discussion with Mr Hannan referred to above about the placards on Mountain Ash Road on the way to Reevesdale. She and the plaintiff remain on good terms despite their separation. He continues to contribute to her financial support and that of their children. The plaintiff did not call her as a witness in his case. I infer that her evidence would not have assisted his case and more readily draw the inference that Mr Hannan’s evidence is to be accepted in preference to the plaintiff’s where they are in conflict. I do not accept the plaintiff’s evidence that he complained to his wife about Mr Meakes’ conduct in October 2007 when he spoke to local residents who told him of the quarry development.
	


Mr Hannan’s evidence


	
	In March 2015 Mr Hannan was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He consulted an oncologist on 25 March 2015. In early April 2015 he informed Mr Couston, the solicitor for the defendants with carriage of the proceedings. On 21 April 2015 he affirmed an affidavit setting out his recollection, including of conversations he had had with the plaintiff and the local resident about the quarry protest signs and the occasion on which he had inspected Reevesdale with the plaintiff.
	
	
	In May 2015 it was proposed that, in light of Mr Hannan’s declining health, his evidence be taken in Goulburn as it would be difficult for him to attend court. Directions were made on 9 June 2015 to permit Mr Hannan to give evidence by audio-visual link from a remote location. Laura Acton, a solicitor assisting Mr Couston, visited Mr Hannan at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney on 18 June 2015 at which time he signed a further statement in which he made a few corrections to the contents of his affidavit.
	
	
	On 25 June 2015 Ms Acton visited Mr Hannan in hospital and arranged for him to affirm a second affidavit which incorporated the statement he had signed on 18 June 2015. During this period it became increasingly clear that Mr Hannan would not be able to give evidence. On 3 July 2015 he died.
	
	
	By reason of these circumstances, Mr Hannan’s evidence could not be tested in cross-examination. This must be taken into account in assessing its weight.
	
	
	However, I accept Mr Sullivan’s submission that the circumstances in which Mr Hannan’s affidavits were executed tell in favour of his reliability. Mr Hannan had no interest, whether financial or otherwise, in the proceedings or their outcome. That he was prepared to spend any of his residual precious time or energy on the evidence in this case when his prognosis was so dire suggests that his version is true.
	
	
	Moreover, Mr Hannan’s evidence has a certain verisimilitude in light of what has emerged about the plaintiff. It is entirely consistent with the view I have formed of the plaintiff that he would say, when Mr Hannan mentioned the Land and Environment Court, that he knew where it was. The plaintiff’s fondness for Reevesdale was not affected when, on his admission, he learned of the application in October 2007. It is difficult to see, in those circumstances, why he would have been deterred by what Mr Hannan passed on by way of local knowledge when he followed up the plaintiff’s enquiry about the significance of the protest signs.
	


Mr Meakes’ credibility


	
	Mr Meakes has an obvious interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The relevant events, as far as he was concerned, took place in June and July 2007. The first time he had any indication that his conduct was to be called into question by the plaintiff was in 2012, when the statement of claim was served. Mr Meakes did not make a file note of his meeting with the plaintiff on 12 June 2007, although he did make a file note of the matters that concerned him when he went through the draft contract and the out-of-date s 149 certificate in preparation for that meeting.
	
	
	Each of these matters tends to reduce the weight that can be attached to Mr Meakes’ evidence. However, when the plaintiff put to Mr Meakes in cross-examination that he could not really remember the detail of the matter, Mr Meakes’ response was such as to persuade me that he had a good recollection of the transaction notwithstanding the passage of time. The transcript does not capture the tenor of Mr Meakes’ evidence. However I set it out because it shows that the plaintiff and this transaction made a significant impression on Mr Meakes.
	


“Q.  How did you remember?

A.  Well I remember Mr Williamson because in this matter I had a desire to make sure that I knew ‑ that you knew everything about this transaction because this was a matter where you were going overseas, where you expected me to settle the matter where you gave me instructions to settle it within a week.  And I remember going through the contract with you, spending a lot of time with you.  In that first conference on 14 June we spent an hour going through the contract, I was able to ‑ I had the benefit of the file note that I made in relation to the perusal of the contract when I first got the documents, the information memorandum and the contract and I prepared a file note in relation to those matters and I had that‑‑

. . . that file note that I made in June 2007 alerted me to the issues in schedule E and there's reference to that in the file note that I made and that's why I had a concern.  I had you coming into my office, I knew that you were going to go overseas.  The matter was very urgent and I had a desire to make sure that you knew everything about the contract and that's why I spent an hour with you going through that contract.

. . .

A.  I don't have a file note of that meeting.  I have the file note that I prepared in readiness for that meeting.

Q.  On page 86/65 you say, ""schedule E sets out notices to purchasers of rural lands in the area and needs to be looked at carefully""?

A.  That's correct.

. . .

Q.  And this was the basis on which you say that you told me to make a search of the local council?

A.  That is one of the things that I base my advice on, but the other element is that when I met with you, and after we spoke about me not providing you with taxation advice or financial advice, I advised you that you should make inquiries with the local council, with the neighbours, in the local area‑‑

Q.  Come on, come on.  You didn't because had you done so I would have said, ""I will make inquiries with the neighbours‑‑

. . .

Q.  I put it to you Mr Meakes that nothing of the sort happened?

A.  I completely disagree with that.

Q.  Where is it set out?

A.  I've already referred to it.  It is set out in numerous areas of my affidavit Mr Williamson.  It's on page 6, also when I'm talking to you about clause 34 in the contract about refractive industries there's a further reference in numerous parts of my affidavit saying that we will carry out searches ‑ ""our searches are related to the property.  Inquiries in relation to neighbouring lands and other areas adjoining our property must be made by yourself"".

Q.  Let's suppose that if you did say these things did you check that I'd done them?

A.  No.  Because you told me that you'd carried out your due diligence.”


	
	I accept Mr Meakes’ evidence. He came across as a diligent solicitor who was concerned to protect his client but also concerned neither to allow the apparent urgency of the transaction; nor his prior acquaintance with the plaintiff; nor their common club membership (which the plaintiff described as a “brotherhood”); nor the plaintiff’s qualifications and experience as a solicitor to compromise proper and prudent practice. Mr Meakes’ unwillingness to use the power of attorney in what he considered to be an inappropriate way (when the plaintiff asked him to execute the guarantee on behalf of the plaintiff’s company) is further evidence of this.
	


Liability

The causes of action alleged


	
	The plaintiff alleged the following causes of action against the defendants:
	



	
	Breach of either an express or implied contract arising from Mr Meakes’ alleged failure to advise him to inquire of the Council and of the neighbours about developments on surrounding properties; or his alleged failure to check that he had carried out such inquiries or alternatively, Mr Meakes’ alleged failure to conduct those searches himself;
	
	
	A co-existent breach of duty of care on the same basis as (1);
	
	
	An action for damages for contravention of the Trade Practices Act against Carneys and of the Fair Trading Act against Mr Meakes by reason of the following representations which are said to arise by silence:
	



	
	That Mr Meakes would carry out all necessary searches and inquiries to ascertain whether there were proposed developments on adjoining properties that might affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of Reevesdale;
	
	
	That the plaintiff need not undertake any such inquiries himself.
	


The terms of the contract of retainer and the extent of the duty of care


	
	The contract of retainer was not relevantly express. Accordingly, the plaintiff must establish that there was an implied term to the effect alleged. Before any such term can be implied it is necessary that it pass the three-fold test adopted in Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347 that it be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract; that it be so obvious as to go without saying; and that it not be inconsistent with any express term of the contract.
	
	
	Mr Sullivan accepted that there was an implied term of the contract of retainer that required the defendants to advise the plaintiff to make inquiries of the local council to ascertain whether there were any proposed developments in the area surrounding Reevesdale that might affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of the property. The defendants also accepted that the co-extensive duty of care they owed to the plaintiff required them to give him such advice. I note that it was not suggested by the plaintiff that the defendants’ retainer imposed any higher duty in contract than in tort.
	


Whether Mr Meakes advised the plaintiff to conduct the relevant inquiries regarding surrounding properties


	
	There is a contest of credit between the plaintiff, who denied that Mr Meakes advised him to conduct inquiries of the Council and the neighbours as to developments or proposed developments on surrounding properties, and Mr Meakes, whose evidence was that he had given that advice.
	
	
	The plaintiff has failed to discharge the onus of proving that Mr Meakes did not give him such advice. Indeed, I accept Mr Meakes’ evidence that he did in fact give him such advice. The file note created by Mr Meakes when he received the draft contract and the out-of-date s 149 certificate prior to meeting with the plaintiff on 12 June 2007 indicated that he turned his mind to the very question of developments on surrounding properties in a rural setting. Moreover, I accept Mr Meakes’ recollection of his meetings with the plaintiff, as set out above, during which he raised such matters.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Meakes, having advised the plaintiff to carry out those inquires, did not represent either that he would carry them out himself or that the plaintiff did not need to carry them out.
	


Whether the duty of care or the retainer required Mr Meakes to conduct the enquiries himself or to check that the plaintiff had carried out the inquiries


	
	I accept the defendants’ submissions that the duty of care they owed to the plaintiff neither required Mr Meakes to carry out such enquiries himself, nor to check with the plaintiff that he had conducted such enquires himself. Nor can a term imposing such an obligation be implied in the contract of retainer. The evidence of Mr Heinrich and Mr Boyce did not support the imposition of either of these obligations. For a solicitor to be required to undertake inquiries as to developments on properties surrounding the subject property without specific instructions from the client to do so would amount, in my view, to an unjustified extension of a solicitor’s retainer. Questions of commercial and lifestyle risk are not generally within such a retainer, which is principally concerned with ensuring that good title passes from vendor to purchaser and that the purchaser is aware of any matter that may affect that title.
	
	
	Moreover, the suggestion that a solicitor should check with a client to make sure that he or she has followed the solicitor’s advice (to conduct inquiries of the Council) presupposes a level of paternalism which is inconsistent with the usual relationship between a solicitor and a client, at least in circumstances where a client is not under a relevant disability.
	
	
	Accordingly, although it is accepted that Mr Meakes neither conducted the relevant inquiries himself, nor checked with the plaintiff that he had conducted the relevant inquiries, he was neither in breach of his contract of retainer nor his duty of care by omitting to do those things.
	


Conclusion as to breach


	
	By reason of the foregoing, the plaintiff has not established that Mr Meakes breached his contract of retainer with the plaintiff or that he was in breach of the duty of care he owed to the plaintiff. Nor has he established that any of the representations alleged against Carneys or Mr Meakes arising from the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act were made, either expressly or by silence. I note for completeness that the defendants accepted, for the purposes of these proceedings, that any such representations as were made were made in trade and commerce, as required by the legislation. I understood the basis for the concession that it did not expose the defendants to any greater liability than that to which they would be exposed in contract or tort.
	
	
	It follows from these findings that the plaintiff has not made out any claim to relief and that there should be judgment for the defendants. However, as I am obliged, as trial judge, to make all relevant factual findings, I propose to address the question of causation.
	


Causation


	
	Although there are some cases where the question of causation might be resolved differently whether the claim is brought in contract, tort, or under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act, the present is not such a case (subject to the principles of remoteness, which are addressed below). In this case, Mr Meakes was obliged by the contract of retainer and the duty of care he owed to the plaintiff to advise him to make his own inquiries, at least of the Council if not the neighbours. The representations alleged are either that the inquiries did not need to be made or that Mr Meakes would make the inquiries himself, on behalf of the plaintiff.
	
	
	For the reasons given above, I accept Mr Hannan’s evidence that the plaintiff noticed the placards and was told that they related to a protest against the quarry development and that Mr Meakes advised him to make his own inquiries. That the plaintiff was prepared to go ahead and buy Reevesdale in the knowledge that there was a quarry proposed in the vicinity is a powerful indication that he was unconcerned about what would have been revealed had he inquired of the Council or the neighbours, as recommended by Mr Meakes.
	
	
	Moreover, although I do not necessarily believe that the plaintiff was too busy to read the contract between the time he received it (on or about 12 June 2007) and the time he executed it (on 24 July 2007), his priorities seemed to revolve around Lucinda and his trip to the United Kingdom, rather than looking after his own financial interests or acting on advice of persons such as Mr Meakes.
	
	
	Furthermore, the matter the plaintiff relied on for the purposes of these proceedings as being what would have changed his mind about buying Reevesdale, is the very matter of which he was made aware by Mr Hannan, following his inquiry regarding the significance of the placards.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not make any inquiries of the Council or the neighbours, notwithstanding that he was aware of the quarry development from speaking with Mr Hannan and notwithstanding that he had been advised to do so by Mr Meakes. In these circumstances, whether or not Mr Meakes had advised him to make those inquiries, the plaintiff would still have purchased Reevesdale.
	
	
	The narrative set out above indicates the plaintiff’s reluctance to sell Paddington on both personal and financial grounds. I do not accept that, had the plaintiff not purchased Reevesdale, he would have sold his Paddington terrace in mid-July 2007 (which he contended was a better market). Even if the NAB was not prepared to extend its facilities any further, it is likely that the plaintiff would have been able to use the Paddington terrace to increase his borrowings with another lender. I regard the plaintiff’s argument that he had to buy Reevesdale to keep Paddington as captious, for the reasons given above.
	
	
	Accordingly, the plaintiff has failed to establish factual causation in negligence (as required by s 5D(1)(a) of the Civil Liability Act 2005 (NSW); see also Wallace v Kam [2013] HCA 19; 250 CLR 375 at [14] – [16]), contract or under the Trade Practices Act or Fair Trading Act.
	


Damages


	
	The measure of damages in contract is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in had the contract been performed; in tort, the measure is the money to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in had the tort not been committed: Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3; 160 CLR 1. A similar test is used to assess damages under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act: Kizbeau v WG and B Pty Ltd (1995) 184 CLR 281 at 290, including footnote (11); Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52; 206 CLR 459 at [30] – [31] per Gleeson CJ.
	
	
	In order to assess damages, I am obliged to assume (contrary to my findings above) that Mr Meakes did not advise the plaintiff to make inquiries of the Council and that, had he done so, the plaintiff would have gone to the Council. Had this occurred, the plaintiff would have found out that the quarry development had not been approved and that an appeal against its refusal had been dismissed: CEAL Ltd v Minister for Planning. In my view it is inconceivable that, in these circumstances, knowing that the developer’s appeal had been dismissed, the plaintiff would not have purchased Reevesdale.
	
	
	However, accepting the counterfactual for the purposes of these reasons, and accepting that the plaintiff would not have purchased Reevesdale had he made inquiries of the Council, he has suffered no loss. The reason for this is that the unchallenged evidence of Mr Reardon was that Reevesdale was worth $2m as at 25 February 2008 (being seven months after the plaintiff purchased it for $1.675m). Furthermore Mr Reardon considered that Reevesdale had been “very good buying” and “below current market value” when the plaintiff purchased it for $1.675m.
	
	
	Mr Reardon’s evidence comprises the only evidence of the value of Reevesdale at the time the plaintiff purchased it. The plaintiff has, accordingly, failed to establish that Reevesdale was worth less than he paid for it. The reduction in the value of Reevesdale from the time of its purchase by the plaintiff to the time of its eventual sale in 2013 was due, according to the unchallenged view of Mr Reardon, to the general reduction in the area, rather than to anything specifically related to the proposed quarry development, which has not, in any event, commenced.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the starting point is the rule of practice derived from Potts v Miller that the measure of damages (for deceit, and by analogy, tort and contract) is usually the difference between the real value of the property at the time of purchase and what the plaintiff paid for it. The “real” value is the appropriate integer, rather than the market value, because hindsight can also be taken into account: Kizbeau v WG and B Pty Ltd at 291. Consequential losses (such as the expenses associated with the acquisition) may also be recoverable.
	
	
	The plaintiff did not provide any basis for displacing the rule in Potts v Miller. He did not suggest that he could not have sold Reevesdale earlier than he in fact sold it. To the contrary, the evidence showed that he was very reluctant to part with Reevesdale and would have retained it had he been able to. That he sold Paddington years before he sold Reevesdale is further evidence of this. In these circumstances, the plaintiff has failed to prove that he has suffered any loss as a result of the defendants’ conduct.
	
	
	The loss from the sale of the Paddington terrace is not recoverable in light of my finding on causation. However, even had factual causation been established, the loss would have been too remote to be recoverable in contract (Hadley v Baxendale (1854) Exch 341 at 354; 156 ER 145 at 151); tort (s 5D of the Civil Liability Act); or under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act (Henville v Walker, at [136]).
	
	
	It also follows from these findings that none of the consequential losses claimed is recoverable.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is not necessary to address Mr Meakes’ partial defence by reason of the Law Society of NSW Scheme under the Professional Standards Act 1994 (NSW).
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Judgment for the first and third defendants.
	
	
	Unless a written application is made to my associate within seven days for a different order, order the plaintiff to pay the first and third defendants’ costs of the proceedings.

		06 August 2015",2015-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767382,R v Basanovic and ors (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 1092,"Judgment


	
	Whilst Sam Cassaniti was being cross-examined by Mr Edwards of counsel for Wade Basanovic, Mr Cassaniti was asked if he had overheard the deceased saying to the people on the phone while the deceased was in gaol: “Look after Freddy, he has just got into gaol, he’s a good cunt”, and on another occasion, “That Johnny has just came (sic) in, he’s a mut, make sure he is sorted out. A maggot.”
	
	
	Objection was taken to the question and the line of questioning on the basis that the cross-examiner was seeking to lead tendency evidence from the witness without having served a tendency notice. Mr Edwards agreed that no tendency notice had been served but said that because the material was contained in the witness’s statement which had been served he had not known that the Crown would not lead that part of the statement in evidence.
	
	
	Section 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) relevantly provides:
	


97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.


	
	The Crown’s objection to the absence of the tendency notice was not merely a technical objection. The Crown submitted that it did not know what the tendency was that was to be relied upon by Wade Basanovic. During the course of the argument Mr Edwards said that he could only justify the evidence (which was contained in paragraph 12 of the statement) as going to a tendency on the part of the deceased to have others sort people out rather than a tendency for the deceased to engage in violence himself in that regard.
	
	
	In R v Cakovski [2004] NSWCCA 280 the appellant had pleaded not guilty to the murder of one Eugene Petroff. A jury found him of guilty of murder. He appealed on a number of grounds including a ground that the trial judge had erred in refusing to admit evidence that the deceased had murdered three people. The evidence had been rejected by the trial judge as not having significant probative value as s 97(1)(b) required. The trial judge’s ruling was later in the trial extended to other evidence that the deceased had said to another person that he was going to kill him as he had killed the other three people. The appellant in that case defended the charge on the basis of self-defence and provocation.
	
	
	Hodgson JA said:
	


[36]   In my opinion, evidence of the 1978 murders, and the reference to them in the threat made by the deceased to Mr. Logounov just a few hours before the stabbing, had significant probative value, in this way. In the absence of that evidence, the appellant’s evidence that the deceased threatened to kill him in such a way as to make him fearful for his life, and continued to make such threats and to attack him notwithstanding the appellant’s use of a knife, seems on the face of it highly improbable. In my opinion, it becomes less so once one knows that the deceased had committed three murders in the circumstances outlined, albeit as long ago as 1978, and also had made reference to those three murders in uttering a threat to kill Mr. Logounov just a few hours before. Of course, both the murders themselves and the threat made in this way to Mr. Logounov were not known to the appellant, but that does not reduce the relevance of the evidence. If the question to be determined was whether it was proved that the deceased actually did what the appellant said he did, beyond reasonable doubt or even on the balance of probabilities, one might consider the probative value of evidence that he murdered three people over twenty years before to be quite small, and also that there was a real chance that this probative value would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect. But in this case the question is rather whether there is a reasonable possibility that the deceased did these things, which otherwise might seem to be extremely improbable. On that question, in my opinion the evidence of the murders in 1978, coupled with evidence from an independent witness that, just a few hours earlier, the deceased had referred to these three previous murders apparently to add force and credibility to a threat to kill that person, is of substantial probative value.

[37]   On the question of notice under s.97, in my opinion the significant probative value of the evidence is not as tendency evidence, to which s.97 applies: the main relevance of the evidence is not to prove that the deceased had “a tendency … to act in a particular way”, but rather to suggest that the deceased was a person who was not subject to very strong inhibitions against killing and contemplation of killing in the same way as are the great majority of people. This is not to say that the deceased had a tendency to kill, but rather that there is less improbability in the deceased killing or making a serious threat to kill another person, than there would be for the great majority of people. …

[38]   Considered in that way, in my opinion the evidence did not require or even justify detailed examination of the circumstances of the 1978 killings, and detailed comparison of those circumstances with the circumstances of the encounter between the deceased and the appellant in this case. The brief outline of the circumstances, which was common ground between the appellant and the Crown, was sufficient for this aspect of relevance.

[39]   It may be that the evidence could have had some relevance as tendency evidence, within s.97, as evidence of a tendency to act violently when affected by alcohol. If that had been the only relevance of the evidence, this could have been affected by a more detailed examination of the circumstances of the 1978 murders. Had the Crown taken the point, the absence of the required notice under s.97 could have been significant, because the Crown could have said it needed an opportunity to investigate further the circumstances of the 1978 murders. However, in my opinion any relevance of the evidence in this respect would be of much less significance than its relevance in the other respect that I have referred to, and may not have added much to what was already indicated by the evidence of the incident with Mr. Logounov. As tendency evidence, it may therefore not have passed the s.97(1)(b) threshold. However, for the reasons given above, the evidence was relevant and admissible otherwise than as tendency evidence.

[40]   It was vital to the appellant’s defence of self-defence that the jury accept there was at least a reasonable possibility that the deceased had acted in the way described by the appellant, and as I have said the evidence of the 1978 murders and the deceased’s reference to them in the Logounov incident was relevant to this. Furthermore, although provocation was not the defence relied on by the appellant, it was left to the jury. If the jury rejected self-defence but considered that the appellant had lost self-control, the question of whether it was reasonably possible that the deceased acted as the appellant described would have been relevant to the question of provocation also.


	
	Hulme J agreed with Hodgson JA that the evidence was not admissible as tendency evidence principally because he said, at [58], that there was little evidence of the circumstances of the 1978 killings
	
	
	Hidden J said:
	


[70]   As to Ground 2, concerning evidence that the deceased had murdered three people on an earlier occasion, I have some reservation about his Honour’s view, and that of Hulme J, that the evidence was admissible other than as tendency evidence. I agree that the evidence had probative force for the reasons identified by their Honours, that is, that it lent some credence to the appellant’s account of the deceased’s behaviour, which otherwise would have seemed highly improbable. However, in my view, it did so because it demonstrated a propensity on the part of the deceased to retaliate in an extremely violent way against anyone who crossed him. (Whether he was affected by alcohol is not the point.) This, it appears to me, is necessarily tendency evidence. The incident involving Mr Logounov, although of a very different character, might be seen as a demonstration of the same propensity.

[71]   However, the evidence about the murders was admissible as tendency evidence because it had significant probative value despite its remoteness in time and lack of circumstantial detail. That probative value was enhanced by evidence that the deceased referred to those murders in his altercation with Mr Logounov. As it was evidence tendered by the appellant, it did not require the substantial measure of probative force mandated by s101 of the Evidence Act and, as Hodgson JA has pointed out, it was tendered in respect of an issue upon which the Crown, not the appellant, bore the burden of proof.

[72]   Lack of notice pursuant to s97(1)(a) of the Act formed no part of O’Keefe J’s reasons for rejecting the evidence, and does not appear to have been argued at the trial. No doubt, the Crown would suffer some prejudice from an inability so long after the event to examine the circumstances of the murders. However, that would not justify the exercise of the discretion under s135 of the Act to reject the evidence. In my view, a trial judge would need to think long and hard before exercising that discretion against an accused in a criminal trial.


	
	The Crown drew attention to the fact that the judges in Cakovski were not of one mind when they admitted the evidence. That may be accepted. Both Hodgson JA and Hulme J did not regard the evidence as tendency evidence although Hidden J considered that it was.
	
	
	Two matters are significant in relation to the circumstances in Cakovski when compared with the circumstances of the present case. First, the present case is stronger in this way. In Cakovski the appellant, at the time he killed the deceased, was unaware that the deceased had murdered three people. In the present case the evidence intended to be led is that Wade Basanovic was aware that, or believed that, the deceased could arrange for people to assault or otherwise deal with persons in a manner that the deceased wished.
	
	
	Secondly, although Hodgson JA and Hulme J did not consider that the evidence about the prior killings was tendency evidence, that was based on the length of time since those killings had occurred and the lack of evidence of the circumstances that led to the killing. In other words, the mere fact that the deceased had killed other people did not of itself demonstrate a tendency. As Hulme J said:
	


[60]   It is apparent from this summary that it was not known what were the operative factor(s) that inspired the killing. Experience in this Court shows that in the field of drug dealing, killing at times is just one of the occupational hazards. For all this Court knows, the deceased may indeed have been a major drug dealer and the killings done by way of general deterrence to others tempted to cheat him. Furthermore, while apparently present in 1978, alcohol might have not have had any operative force, so incensed may the deceased have been with being cheated. Without more information the evidence of events in 1978 was not probative of the deceased having any particular tendency.

[61]   To these considerations must be added also the passage of time and intervening imprisonment. In these circumstances, it is impossible to infer from the events of 1978 that in 2001 the deceased had a tendency to kill or act violently when affected by alcohol.

[62]   So removed in time were they that I very much doubt if it would even have been possible to infer from events in 1978 what tendency the deceased may have had in 2001. But at the very least if the events of 1978 were to have any probative value on that issue, a substantial if not full account of the circumstances operating on the deceased in 1978 would be necessary. …


	
	In the present case the tendency relied upon was an ability to arrange for other persons to deal with people either positively or negatively according to what the deceased requested. That can more easily be characterised as a propensity or tendency to act in a particular way than, as in Cakovski, merely giving evidence that the deceased had killed three persons earlier could be characterised.
	
	
	Cakovski, however, also supports the admissibility of the evidence on another basis. The evidence renders less improbable the evidence which it is said the accused Wade Basanovic will give of his beliefs about the deceased, which beliefs led to his shooting the deceased; Cakovski at [36] and [40].
	
	
	The Court has power to dispense with a tendency notice pursuant to s 100(1). In the present case I consider that the requirement for the service of the notice should be dispensed with. The evidence sought to be relied upon for the tendency was contained in the statement served by the Crown. Further, the witness had already been asked questions in cross-examination directed to the same matter and no objection was made by the Crown. Counsel for Wade Basanovic has identified the basis of the tendency relied upon. I do not consider that the Crown is prejudiced by the admission of this evidence.
	
	
	The question is allowed.
